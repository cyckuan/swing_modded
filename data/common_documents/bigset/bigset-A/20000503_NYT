 PACIFIC BELL ADS TO INCLUDE DISCLAIMER  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pacific Bell said Tuesday that it will add a
disclaimer to its comical ``Web Hog'' television commercials to
make it clear that its high-speed Internet service only offers
individual connections between users' homes and the nearest
switching office and not direct connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome, which provides a rival Internet service over cable
television lines, has threatened to sue the telephone company
unless it yanks the ads because they tout Pac Bell's service as
``Always Fast. Never Shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Redwood City, Calif.'s ExciteAtHome said the ads are misleading
because they imply that Pac Bell's service, called DSL or digital
subscriber line technology, gives users direct connections to Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said the disclaimer is already
used for radio and print ads, but the company didn't use it in
television ads, because all the images in the commercial focus on a
neighborhood _ where users have separate connections over regular
phone lines. Once the phone lines reach the switching office,
e-mail and other Internet traffic are merged together _ so, in
theory, users' connections to the Net could slow down if too many
people send heavy amounts of data at once.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Alison Bowman said the company, the
largest provider of cable modem service, is still demanding that
Pac Bell halt the ads or drop the ``never shared'' tag line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that a legal disclaimer on the same ad won't be
enough,'' Bowman said. ``Even with the disclaimer (the ad) will
continue to mislead consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads lampoon cable modem service, like the kind offered by
ExciteAtHome, because cable lines are shared in a neighborhood much
like a party line. So as more users sign up, the service could
theoretically slow to a crawl. That's occasionally happened in a
handful of neighborhoods, including Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   But cable companies claim it's not generally a problem because
they can upgrade the equipment and split the neighborhood lines
into smaller and smaller networks as more customers sign up.

 STARS TAKING A SHINE TO THE INTERNET  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dozens of dot-coms are reconsidering their
options after the April 14 Nasdaq shakeout. But that does not seem
to be interfering with Pamela Anderson Lee's plan to launch her own
Web site. Pamtv.com is under construction, and the former
``Baywatch'' babe is asking fans to tell her what they really want
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Pam evidently is so intrigued by the B2C space that she attended
a Red Herring party three weeks ago to celebrate the opening of the
magazine's Hollywood bureau. She was accompanied by her
Internet-savvy agent, Leonard Armato, who has already helped other
clients set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At Shaquille O'Neal's Dunk.net, for instance, visitors can buy
apparel and even participate in a contest to win Shaq's autographed
game-worn playoff shoes.
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine what Pamtv.com will pitch. Red Herring
Chairman Tony Perkins said Pam is the most downloaded image on the
Internet. Apparently, she wants to make some money off of all those
eyeballs _ or ``monetize traffic'' as they say in dot-com circles.
</P>
<P>
   Many other entertainers also have taken an interest in Internet
opportunities and venture capital plays. Perkins notes that
comedian Dana Carvey has invested with Ron Conway's Angel Investors
limited partnership and gave a free stand-up performance at Red
Herring's charity auction last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers also are catching dot-com fever and are
outfitting high-tech execs along with Hollywood stars for free. At
Red Herring's Venture 2000 conference for hot companies and
financiers this week at Squaw Valley, Perkins proudly displayed the
label on a free shirt from German designer Hugo Boss and said he
has a free tuxedo and plenty of other duds. Apple's Steve Jobs also
reportedly gets special deals from Hugo Boss.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that Silicon Valley is no longer nerdy is the
latest GQ magazine spread on spring fashions. It features high-tech
leaders and financiers including Steve Jurvetson of Redwood City,
Calif.'s Draper Fisher Jurvetson venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   HOME DEAL KILLERS: High-tech millionaires have been driving up
the price of real estate around the bay. But the sudden high-tech
downdraft has killed some recent real estate deals. Some home
buyers in Silicon Valley have reportedly walked away from deals,
losing $100,000 in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Bay Area real estate market is
suddenly flush with bargains. Quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Word at the conference was that former department store owner
Mervyn Morris (Mervyn's) recently sold his 3-acre Atherton, Calif.,
spread to wireless communications pioneer Craig McCaw for $30
million or more. And Jim Clark reportedly returned to California
from Florida, which has no state taxes, and bought a 20-acre
Woodside estate for about $53 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's a three-way race between Jim Clark, Larry
Ellison and Bill Gates on who can build the biggest house in
computerdom,'' suggested longtime Woodside resident Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign that the high-tech business is not about to go into
the trash is that financial printers are still getting plenty of
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still printing a lot of IPOs, secondary offerings,
merger-and-acquisition deals and private placements,'' says Bob
Boyle, sales manager for Bowne &AMP; Co.'s San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he says, Bay Area business is up about 50
percent from the same period last year. There was a slight pause
for two weeks after the mid-April high-tech stock sell-off, but he
said business has rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign that more deals are on the way, Bowne plans to open a
22,000-square-foot office in Palo Alto, Calif., in July. It will
have more than 20 conference rooms where entrepreneurs, financiers,
lawyers and accountants can thrash out confidential details.

 MARKET DROP CHANGES VC RULES OF ENGAGEMENT  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SQUAW VALLEY, Calif. _ The venture capital landscape has changed
dramatically since the week of April 10, when the technology-heavy
Nasdaq index fell nearly 1,000 points and many dot-com companies
with only faint profit prospects lost much of their value.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of most most privately funded startups is to enjoy a
rousing reception on Wall Street when they go public. But many
recent IPOs are not only selling well below their peaks, but below
their offering prices _ especially business-to-consumer companies.
In addition, many venture capital and angel investors are seriously
reconsidering what their investments are really worth.
</P>
<P>
   What better place to gain perspective than in the crystal clear
air of the Sierra. At Red Herring's second annual venture
conference at the Resort at Squaw Creek this week, more than 700
entrepreneurs and financiers listened to presentations from the
magazine's newly anointed top 50 private companies and the 10 hot
startups to watch.
</P>
<P>
   They heard Michael Dell and Nobel laureate Shimon Peres give
keynote addresses and sat in on panels about Linux, EcoNet and
mobile commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the informal discussion centered on how funding
formulas have changed and how valuations have tumbled during the
past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public markets are not offering huge premiums on
Internet companies, that ripples all the way up the food chain,''
said Ron Conway, founding general partner of Angel Investors LP,
which has two funds totaling $180 million and counts Dana Carvey,
Shaquille O'Neal and Henry Kissinger among its individual
investors. ``The April downdraft was sobering, and valuations are
coming down 30 to 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, a company that was figured to be worth $50
million may now only be worth $25 million, which translates into
dilution for existing shareholders. It also means the startups have
to give away a greater stake in their companies to get additional
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Larry Chiang, founder and CEO of Moneyformail.com in
Palo Alto, Calif., who took a booth at the Red Herring event to
show off his online startup to potential partners and perhaps
attract $20 million in second-round financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pure euphoria anymore,'' he said. ``You have to have
specific plans for turning a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Moneyformail has that. The company's concept is simple: paying
consumers from 20 cents to $2.50 to read targeted e-mail ads that
they have agreed to receive.
</P>
<P>
   The company already has attracted about 70 advertisers and
260,000 consumers and expects to be profitable within four months.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiang, who started a successful college credit card company
when he was 19, says he is prepared for the change in the climate.
If venture capital dries up, ``I will stick to my model and grow
slowly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He figures that with $10 million or $20 million in new funding
he can grow much more quickly and gain perhaps 12 million users in
12 months. He notes, too, that venture capital investors are useful
``for contacts and general market validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Weiss, CEO of a Philadelphia online music education
and instruments site called Gvox.com, said VCs ``are using the
market as a bludgeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, whose company is looking for $5 million to close out a
$10 million financing round, noted that in some cases investors are
demanding double the stakes in new ventures for the same amount of
money they were discussing three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ERugGallery.com, a San Carlos online bazaar for handmade
carpets, also is seeing traditional valuation models unravel. The
company, co-founded a year ago by former Barclays Global Investors
Chairman Fred Grauer, has signed up 20 rug dealers, has an
inventory of 5,000 rugs online and is looking for $12 million in
third-round financing.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a clear profit model that is making from 10
percent to 35 percent commissions on rugs sold online. But Jean
Claude Brunache, the company's senior vice president of sales,
concedes there are knotty problems, including the lack of
credibility of the rug business and the difficulties in
establishing the equivalent of a Kelly Blue Book value for carpets.
</P>
<P>
   HotLinks, another company with a booth at Red Herring's
conference, also is feeling the post-April 14 fallout. The year-old
company with early financing from CMGI Ventures has created a
portal where more than 850,000 users have already recorded and are
sharing their bookmarks and favorite online sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Jonathan Abrams, a Netscape veteran, has been looking
for $10 million in financing and has attracted interest. But he
says that one potential investor ``got skittish'' after the market
decline.
</P>
<P>
   One reason might be that the Mountain View company's focus is
still product development and user acquisition rather than revenue
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Startups that are most vulnerable in the current shift in
venture capital markets are the ones that have a spend, spend,
spend mentality, advertise heavily and sell products below cost to
gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   One entrepreneur smiling a lot at the conference was Mark Porat.
The chairman and co-founder of Palo Alto, Calif., startup
Perfect.com had just lined up $31 million in second-round financing
March 31 from Softbank and other investors for his
business-to-business Internet services company.
</P>
<P>
   The money was committed before the market crash. But it was not
all good news. Investors have put out word ``this could be the last
money we ever get,'' said Porat, a former Apple Computer and
General Magic manager. ``So rather than celebrate, I said, `Dive,
dive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect.com decided to cancel plans for bigger offices and
instead will squeeze two employees to a cube. Porat cut hiring
plans for the rest of this year to 43, from about 70, and plans to
trim legal and other professional services.
</P>
<P>
   The days are over for companies with $100 million-a-year capital
``burn rates'' and no clear path to profitability. Red Herring
Editor John Mecklenburg pointed to some online dog food purveyors
and eToys as endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Santa Claus stays solvent by giving away,'' he said.
``There's going to be a lot of roadkill out there,'' said Newport
Beach, Calif., merger and acquisition specialist Glen Lindenstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Comaford, managing director of Artemis Ventures in
Sausalito, Calif., agreed. ``Any new Internet business built on
advertising and building a community of one million users who don't
spend money and are not loyal is not relevant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she also says that fear and uncertainty are keeping some
good companies from getting financed. ``Some companies with great
ideas but without marquee executives are not getting financing,''
she noted. ``And some bad companies with known CEOs are getting
funded even though they may be one-trick ponies.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from who's at the helm, many VC investors are now more
interested in so-called ``Internet enablers,'' companies that help
traditional and new companies establish a Web presence and make
real money conducting business and communicating speedily on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The ventures capital community still has billions of dollars to
invest. The irony is that they have recently raised more money than
ever before but they are suddenly not so free with the purse
strings.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, VCs fell over themselves to give away $40
million or $50 million. Entrepreneurs were in the driver's seat.
But now the balance of power has shifted and VCs are dictating
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Packard, a director of the Draper Fisher Jurvetson
venture capital firm in Redwood City, Calif., said that during the
past few years investors ``lost sight of fundamentals'' and came up
with newfangled ratios like ``20 times forward loaded revenues'' to
justify market valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of his firm's initial public offerings such as Fogdog
are selling at less than half their offering prices, and VCs not
surprisingly are cutting valuations of the new companies they are
investing in.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects that more venture capital firms might also be
tempted to buy stock in some of their companies that have fallen so
far from their peaks. But companies with good prospects and profit
potential do not seem to be having much trouble lining up big
bucks. One of these is Restaurantpro.com, a business-to-business
online marketplace for the food service industry.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco company started by restaurateur Christopher
Hemmeter last year provides free PCs and DSL service to restaurants
to order supplies online. It then gets a transaction fee from
BankAmerica Merchant Services on every credit card charge plus a
small commission from restaurant suppliers on purchases of
everything from meat and produce to kitchen equipment and flatware.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmeter said the company, which expects 55 percent pretax net
income on revenues by late next year, is having no trouble raising
$40 million in its third financing round this month.

   INGLEWOOD -- The state agency charged with overseeing horse
racing in California will not conduct its own investigation into
working conditions in stable areas, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the California Horse Racing Board said they will not
conduct their own investigation into labor and health issues at the
state's nine tracks and six county fairs. The board will instead
monitor and participate in several on-going probes of conditions
that may violate state and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a spokesman for the state Department of Industrial
Relations said his agency has launched a probe into allegations
against the tracks, which include Santa Anita in Arcadia and
Fairplex Park in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   A special gathering of three state Assembly committees will be
convened next week to address many of the concerns about the
conditions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   CHRB chairman Robert Tourtelot said his organization began a
proactive program of improving backside conditions when it allowed
the sale of Golden Gate Fields to Santa Anita owner Frank Stronach
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put conditions on the sale,'' Tourtelot said. ``They had to
spend $5 million improving conditions before we would approve the
sale.''

 NETWORTH: PRAYING FOR STOCK OPTIONS  &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's Friday afternoon and Umashankar Dixit, a
Hindu priest, is praying to the wealth goddess Lakshmi to bring
success and prosperity to Avakai Information Networks, an
e-commerce startup in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Avakai CEO Manjunath Kashi has set up a small, colorful shrine
in a tiny conference room at his company for the Lakshmi ``pooja''
or ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   There is a basket with 108 U.S. coins, symbolizing the 108
different names and forms of Hindu gods; a platter with coconuts,
limes and other offerings; and small silver bowls of turmeric, the
yellow-orange seasoning signifying wealth, and kumkum, the red
powder that Indians use to dot their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony, which involves a lot of chanting and tossing of
flower petals, lasts about 45 minutes. As an honorarium, Dixit will
receive $51 and 5,000 Avakai stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of Indian-led startups around the Bay Area _ there
are at least 900 according to one estimate _ is keeping Dixit busy
these days, and he has the portfolio to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu priest has received or been promised stock or options
in 15 high-tech companies that he has blessed. Most of the
companies are still private, so a lot of the options aren't worth
anything at the moment. But some have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Dixit says he blessed K.B. Chandrasekhar, the chairman of Exodus
Communications, and B.V. Jagadeesh, the firm's chief technology
officer, in 1994. As a thank you, he got to buy 500 Exodus shares
at the IPO price. Dixit says he sold his shares in the Santa Clara,
Calif., Web-hosting company for a $12,000 profit. He used that
money, and some other funds, to build a temple in Bangalore, India.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a dozen Hindu priests in the Bay Area, but only
a few do Lakshmi poojas at high-tech companies. Dixit, who works at
the Shiva-Vishnu Temple in Livermore, says he is considered a
``lucky hand'' because his god is Ganesha, ``a remover of
obstacles.''
</P>
<P>
   Srinivas Kudaravalli, president of Key Solutions in Santa Clara,
Calif., had Dixit bless his e-commerce company and is going to give
him some stock in a health care subsidiary he's putting together,
in addition to a $500 gift. ``His blessing will help to make us
successful,'' Kudaravalli says.
</P>
<P>
   Another Indian entrepreneur who used Dixit's services is Rao
Neelamraju, chief technology officer of Jasmine Networks, an
optical networking company in San Jose, Calif. He plans to give
Dixit some options out of his personal option pool. ``Any gods'
blessings are welcome,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dixit's ceremonies are in keeping with Hindu practice, says Mark
Juergensmeyer, a sociology professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara who studies Indian religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the tradition to call on gods for prosperity in life,''
he says. ``What are gods for if not to help out in times like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the options are a new twist, ``in Indian culture there
is nothing wrong with priests receiving compensation or being
supported by the public.'' Some Hindu priests, he says, receive
more than others, just as they do in other religions.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON OPTIONS: My Friday column on sunken stock options
prompted this question from a reader:
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently moved from out of state to an e-commerce startup in
the valley and am benighted about prevalent stock-option packages.
My company is seed funded, about 10 months old, and I am employee
No. 7. I wanted to find out if my options package _ 90,000 shares,
four-year vesting, one year of waiting, exercise price of 5 cents _
is in line with the market average. I probably should have
researched even harder before I joined the company, but I did not
know anybody around here and I could not find much help on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this is such a common question, I called Dave Bisson, a
senior consultant with WestWard Pay Strategies, a San Francisco
firm that advises companies on compensation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bisson says that except for the vesting schedule _ which in the
reader's case is typical _ there is no ``average'' when it comes to
option packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the stage of a company, its capital structure
and how that many change over time, and the person's position,''
Bisson says.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, options are issued at the fair market value of
the company at the time of the grant. If the options are issued
with an exercise price of 5 cents per share, the company is worth 5
cents per outstanding share. As the company grows and raises
capital, the value of the company _ and the exercise price on
future option grants _ goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Employees typically get one option grant when they join the
company. They may get an additional round of options, exerciseable
at the IPO price, just before an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The number of shares _ 90,000 in this case _ is meaningless
without knowing how many shares are outstanding, Bisson says. What
counts is the percentage of outstanding shares an option grant
represents. And that depends as much on job responsibilities as
date of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Employee No. 7, if he or she is a vice president, could get
options representing one-10th to 1 percent of the company's
outstanding shares. An entry-level programmer would probably get
less than one-10th of 1 percent. ``As the company raises additional
equity, that percentage is likely to be diluted down,'' Bisson
says.
</P>
<P>
   Options also depend on the person's background, salary,
negotiating skills and supervisor. ``Some managers (in the same
company) hold the line on options, some give away the store,''
Bisson says. ``There is greater randomness in options than base
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no good source of information on
options, other than asking people in similar positions. Companies
like Bisson's don't give advice to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to share your option intelligence, send me an
e-mail and I'll follow up in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   CLARIFICATION: In Friday's column on repricing stock options, I
said that under new Financial Accounting Stardards Board rules,
companies will have to start taking charges and credits to earnings
each quarter to reflect differences between the new, lower exercise
price and the current market price for all unexercised options.
</P>
<P>
   I should have said that the company can take credits only to the
extent that they offset prior charges.
</P>
<P>
   For example, say a company lowers the exercise price on employee
options to $5 from $10 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Then the stock recovers, and at the end of the quarter is
trading at $13. The company will have to reduce quarterly earnings
by $8 ($13 minus $5) for all repriced options. If at the end of the
next quarter, however, the stock goes up to $10, the company would
take a $3 credit.
</P>
<P>
   Now take an alternative scenario: After the repricing the stock
falls and at the end of the quarter is at $2. The company cannot
take a credit because it never took a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Got that?

 REV. JACKSON WINDING UP SILICON VISIT  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson will conclude a three-day
stay in Silicon Valley on Wednesday with a conference where many of
the valley's most powerful chief executives will talk about how
they can bridge the ``digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's visit is part of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Silicon
Valley Project, a group Jackson started this year to urge
technology companies to take more responsibility for including
minorities and other under-connected groups in the high-tech boom.
In the past three days, Jackson has met with venture capitalists,
minority entrepreneurs, students and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers will sit
down at an executive round table with Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly
Fiorina and the leaders of Intel, Covad and Silicon Graphics to
talk about ``inclusion and digital connections,'' according to the
event schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Other workshops will focus on bringing into the digital age East
Palo Alto, Calif., the low-income, low-tech community sandwiched
between high-flying areas such as Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Rainbow/PUSH's Silicon Valley headquarters are in East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is now the battleground for the civil rights
movement, Jackson said in a conference call before arriving in
Silicon Valley. While past advances in civil rights _ the end of
slavery, the right to vote and the end of segregation _ depended on
changes in laws, the next step demands change in business, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth stage is access to capital, access to technology
and access to enough education,'' Jackson said. ``There's such a
tendency to (ask), what will the government do? Corporate America
must take some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, CEO of Symantec, who will speak at the
conference, said that a major theme Wednesday will be connecting
Silicon Valley's intense need for skilled employees with
disadvantaged groups' need to join the successful economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to think about this is enlightened self
interest,'' Thompson said. ``It's about how do we ensure that there
is talent to fuel our ability to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at Wednesday's conference, representatives from Goldman
Sachs, Viridian Capital and other groups will discuss expanding
funding opportunities for women and minority entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Jackson met with minority entrepreneurs, including Ron
Jones of Songboy.com and Ed Nwokedi of UrbanEvents.com. Monday, he
joined with several local groups including Plugged In to distribute
25 computers with Internet access and printers to low-income youth.
Hardware was donated by Hewlett-Packard, PeoplePC and other
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also appeared at a technology job fair for San Jose,
Calif., high school students, and met with labor leaders to discuss
the Silicon Valley ``Justice for Janitors'' campaign. Silicon
Valley janitors are pushing for raises when their union contract
expires May 31.

 KAISER TO END CONTROVERSIAL PRESCRIPTIONS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kaiser Permanente on Tuesday ended a
controversial practice in which psychiatrists in its San Diego,
Calif., office prescribed medicines to patients they had never
personally examined.
</P>
<P>
   The practice came to light last month in a lawsuit filed by
former Kaiser psychiatrist Thomas Jensen, who was fired after he
refused to rubber-stamp prescription recommendations by the
psychologists or social workers who screened new patients.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting any wrong or making any apologies, Dr. Oliver
Goldsmith, medical director for Kaiser Permanente in Southern
California, said all new patients will have to be seen by a
psychiatrist before medication is prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kaiser Permanente, we go down roads from time to time we
have to come back from,'' Goldsmith said, declining any comment on
Jensen's actions ``because it's a legal matter and I have to be
careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Palefsky, the San Francisco attorney representing Jensen,
said his client felt partially vindicated by Kaiser's reversal.
``Now that his ethical concerns have been addressed, we're ready to
start talking with Kaiser about making him whole,'' Palefsky said,
adding that his client ``really has been damaged personally and
professionally'' by his exercise in medical whistle-blowing.
</P>
<P>
   Palefsky criticized Kaiser for letting the matter drag on.
Before his firing, Jensen had tried to change the prescription
practice through internal channels. Palefsky said he also
informally contacted Kaiser attorneys three times before resorting
to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldsmith, Jensen's complaints had been reviewed by
the medical authorities in San Diego, who never brought it up to
the next level, which would have brought the practice to his
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith said no punitive action was contemplated against Dr.
Dennis Cook, the chief of psychiatry in San Diego, who enforced the
earlier prescription practice and fired Jensen when the latter
refused to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our doctors ought to be trying different approaches,''
Goldsmith said, adding the Cook ``sincerely thought he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his lawsuit, Jensen's complaints prompted a state
investigation into the practices of the Oakland, Calif., HMO. Julie
Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations in
Sacramento, said her office was ``encouraged'' by Kaiser's reversal
but would continue looking into Kaiser's prescription practices.
</P>
<P>
   The state investigation was also looking into allegations that
Kaiser psychiatrists in Northern California might have been issuing
prescriptions for patients they had never personally examined.
</P>
<P>
   When the matter first arose last month, Kaiser denied that
psychiatrists outside San Diego were using the procedure which
Jensen brought to light. Goldsmith repeated those denials
yesterday, saying so far as he could determine ``it was not being
employed anywhere else in Kaiser.''

 METALLICA HEATS UP INTERNET DISPUTE WITH NAPSTER  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich plans to visit
Napster Inc. on Wednesday to deliver a gift: a list of 335,435
Napster users who the heavy metal band claims has offered illegal
copies of Metallica songs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica, which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San
Mateo, Calif., startup, wants Napster to block further access to
all of the users on the 60,000-page list, a request Napster says it
might honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to put Napster out of business, or at least out
of the copyright infringement business,'' Metallica attorney Howard
E. King said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Napster created software that allows people to share and swap
MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M
Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in
damages. The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and
racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica
songs on the Internet without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by
rap artists Dr. Dre and the Recording Industry Association of
America trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the
University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana
University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by
their students. But each institution was dropped from the suit
after blocking Napster permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the
suit. However, King said Napster officials said they would block
any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to
monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30. The
firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of
five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members
and enough information to identify the users' computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded
during that period, but King said the band contends any song
offered by Napster users is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at
noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the
60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes. Metallica sent
invitations to media organizations saying that ``all coverage is
welcome and questions will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what this litigation is about is a public education
process, too,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   But King said the band does not intend to sue each of the
Napster users on the hit list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the band's intention to kick the rear ends of people
who have a few files here and there,'' King said. ``The goal here
is not to intimidate the fans. The goal is to stop Napster.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company would accept
Ulrich's list and review it to determine if any users needed to be
booted off the service.

COWBOYS AGREE TO TERMS WITH BOWDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Joe Bowden, an urestricted free-agent starting
linebacker for the AFC champion Tennessee Titans, agreed to terms
on a three-year contract with the Cowboys and flew to Dallas last
night to sign the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, a Dallas native who recently turned 30, will received a
modest signing bonus, according to a source, of less than $400,000
and a first-year salary for the $440,000 NFL veteran's minimum in
order for the Cowboys to fit him under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden can play all three linebacker positions and immediately
becomes the most experienced linebacker on the Cowboys, with 84
starts and 123 games in eight NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl weak-side linebacker Dexter Coakley, with a 48 career
starts, is considered the only Cowboys linebacker assured of being
a starter in 2000. Dat Nguyen is a first-time starter at middle
linebacker and Darren Hambrick started at strong-side linebacker
for the first time last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are still interested in signing Bowden's former
Titans teammate, Barron Wortham, a Fort Worth native from Everman
High School, according to Wortham's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are pumped, as they should be,'' said Scott
Casterline, Wortham's agent. ``I can't believe they're going to be
able to get two \Rstarting Super Bowl\S linebackers like this, and
they're getting them cheap. Joe just agreed to his quicker \Rthan
Wortham\S, but we're working very seriously on getting a deal done,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe and Barron are very excited about being able to play
together. They're very good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is 5-foot-11, 235 pounds, and is two years removed from a
career-high 145 tackles as Tennessee's starting middle linebacker.
Last season, he started 15 games at outside linebacker and had 51
tackles, 3.5 sacks, three fumble recoveries and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden became expendable when the Titans drafted three
linebackers, including first-rounder Keith Bulluck of Syracuse.
Wortham was released last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wortham, 5-11, 244, can play either the middle or strong side.
He started all but one game at middle linebacker for the Titans
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was not available for comment. Neither
Bowden nor his agent, Kennard McGuire, could be reached.

POLICE COMMISSION OKS BACKGROUND CHECK ON AMMO SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushing Los Angeles to the vanguard of the gun control movement,
the Police Commission unanimously backed a proposed city ordinance
Tuesday to require background checks before people could buy gun
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   City officials estimated the ordinance could cost Los Angeles
gun shop owners and other licensed dealers about 75 percent of
their ammunition sales, with buyers going to Burbank, Glendale and
other nearby cities where it would be easier to buy bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will this stop anyone from getting ammunition? Absolutely
not,'' said Bob Kahn, chief executive officer of B&AMP;B Sales of North
Hollywood, one of the largest gun and ammunition suppliers in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're grandstanding. How can this work when my competitors
anywhere else can sell ammunition without any problems whatsoever?
How can this work when it's legal to buy it through the mail ...
legal to make your own?''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Michael Feuer, who first proposed the state's
toughest ammunition permit ordinance, insisted public safety should
take precedence over other considerations. He argued the background
checks are necessary to give meaning to existing state statutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have state rules that preclude felons and (offenders with)
violent misdemeanors from possessing guns and ammunition. But there
is currently no system in place to prevent any criminal from
walking into (a gun store) and buying bullets right now,'' said
Feuer, a candidate for city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer added that his office has collaborated with the Los
Angeles Police Department, state Attorney General's Office and
state Department of Justice to create a simple permit application
system that is easy to enforce and implement.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the ordinance would require consumers to pay a $14
permit fee and submit to a 10-day background check for the right to
purchase ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has yet to determine whether the $14 permit
would be good for two years or would have to be renewed every year.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Dean Hansell called the background checks
``another important step to help make this city a little safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Justice has agreed to complete the
ammunition background checks for the city, using nearly the same
criteria the state now uses for permits to buy guns. The only
information that could not be accessed for ammunition background
checks would be a buyer's mental health records.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer wanted authorization to buy a gun and ammunition
at the same time, he or she could use the same background check for
both and would only have to pay one $14 fee.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the ammunition background checks, the state would
need to upgrade the gun permit computer system at a cost of about
$380,000. In addition, there would be a yearly cost of about
$120,000 for the workers who perform the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer expressed hope that the state would agree to pick up the
tab.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon law enforcement estimates, about 40,000 consumers
purchase ammunition each year at gun shops and other licensed
dealers in Los Angeles. The number would plunge to about 10,000 if
the ordinance were adopted, according to official preliminary
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most persons would likely purchase their ammunition from gun
dealers outside of the city limits or through mail order companies,
neither of which would be affected by the ordinance,'' city policy
analyst Bill Statti noted in a March report.
</P>
<P>
   The city has no means to track how much money it took in last
year on taxes from ammunition sales. Attempts by the city to create
a special tax on ammunition were invalidated in 1998 by Proposition
218, tax and permit officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Feuer and Hansell expressed hope that tougher ammunition laws in
Los Angeles would serve as a catalyst for other cities, the state
and the nation. Both noted San Francisco recently began considering
a similar proposal at the city and county levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of interest in this from other cities,''
Hansell said. ``We anticipate that Glendale, Burbank, Pasadena and
other cities would be very interested in what we are doing. Those
cities have the identical goal of keeping the streets safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council's Public Safety Committee is scheduled to
discuss the ordinance May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a foolish idea,'' said Merrill Gibson, president of the
National Rifle Association Member Council of Westside Los Angeles.
``I suppose it's supposed to have some sort of crime-fighting use.
Generally speaking, criminals do not have a need to replenish their
guns. When they use a gun they seldom fire it, they use it as a
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said the only people who do use ``vast quantities of
ammunition'' are law-abiding target shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous waste of resources and does nothing to
stop criminals from getting ammunition,'' he said. ``It only makes
it a little harder for law-abiding citizens to get ammunition.''

<P>
   On this date in 1904, the first ``perfect game'' was pitched in
major-league baseball. Who was the pitcher who allowed no opposing
player to reach first base? (Hint: Baseball's highest pitching
honor today is named after him.) &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Today is also International Tuba Day.
</P>
<P>
   This week's featured wine won't throw you a curve, and it's so
good you won't have to toot your own horn when you serve it to
guests; you'll have all the flavor bases covered. The 1997 Tommasi
``Rafael'' Valpolicella _ 4 1/2 stars _ is a Joe DiMaggio of a
wine: graceful, supple, and when the wine game is on the line, it's
the wining run. Better even than the 1995 model, the '97 Tommasi is
redolent with dusty plum notes and a silky texture, and is so well
balanced it can match up with white-meat dishes or a robust pasta
with noticeable garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicella is a vastly underrated varietal, probably because
there are quite a few in the market that are cheap _ and taste like
it. But when you get a good one _ pow, it's out of the park.

proposed a new presidential nominating system intended to build
suspense and interest from March through June, with smaller states
voting first and larger states casting the decisive final votes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was a sharp reaction to the current system in which
both party nominations were effectively decided by March 7, the
first day with several major primaries, before millions of
Americans got a chance to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Brock, former Republican Party chairman, who led the
committee that offered the plan, said, ``Too many people in too
many states have no voice in the electoral process that names our
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the Republican national chairman, said he
expected the party to adopt the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican willingness to scrap the system seems likely to
open up a national debate, even though the Democratic Party's
reaction was to point out that the present system had elected Bill
Clinton twice and therefore ``at this point, there is little
incentive to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans adopt the plan at the convention in August,
Democrats might be willing to discuss changing the primary process.
A crucial provision would give the Republican National Committee
the authority, which it now lacks and the Democratic National
Committee has, to alter delegate selection rules between
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   James Roosevelt, co-chairman of the Democratic Rules and By-Laws
Committee, said, ``If the Republicans can get that kind of
flexibility, then between cycles we could have some real
substantive discussions about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential opposition from large states is a major obstacle to
the Brock plan. So is traditional Republican reluctance to impose
national rules on state parties. Democratic opposition, if it
persists, would be another hurdle, and even if both parties agreed
on a plan, getting almost every state to change its primary or
caucus date would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the 12 least-populous states, the District of
Columbia and the territories would be allowed to hold primaries or
caucuses no earlier than the first Tuesday in March. Another group
of 13 slightly more-populous states, from Connecticut to New
Mexico, could go on the first Tuesday in April. Thirteen
middle-size states, including Kentucky and Massachusetts, could go
on the first Tuesday in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, including New York, New Jersey, California, Florida
and Texas, could have primaries on the first Tuesday in June. Any
state could go later, and in the early stages, some might do so to
get a Tuesday that was less crowded. The plan makes no allowance
for early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, but that might be
adjusted by the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures would have to vote to adopt new primary
dates. To pressure them, the Republican National Committee would
have the power to deny state parties 50 percent to 90 percent of
their delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That degree of central control may be an issue, at the
convention if not earlier, at next week's meeting of the Republican
rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   John Deardourff, a Republican consultant whose first primary was
in 1964, said on Tuesday, ``The unwillingness to impose
Washington-based decisions and the unwillingness to accept them is
pretty strongly ingrained in Republican theology, and whether it's
the government doing it, or the party, it just doesn't sit well.''
</P>
<P>
   The first hurdle is clearly within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, the California secretary of state, said the plan was
``absolutely not'' in his state's best interest because it would
mean that California always came in the last group. He said the
majority of members on the Brock commission on which he served were
mistaken in their belief that because nearly half the delegates
would not be chosen before June, a contest would keep going.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who had pushed to move the California primary up to March
7, said he did not think the suggested changes would be enough to
overcome the current way of nominating a candidate, which he called
``raise a lot of money, get it over quick.'' He said he thought a
system of regional primaries, in which different regions each got
their chance to go first, would be better.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, could play a decisive role on the plan at the
convention. But his campaign had no comment on Tuesday night,
saying Bush looked forward to studying the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued on the day when North Carolina and
Indiana, the 11th and 14th most-populous states, held presidential
primaries that drew virtually no interest. Early in the campaign,
primary turnout was high, at least among Republicans, but by March
7, known as Super Tuesday, two-fifths of Republican delegates and
one-third of Democratic delegates had been picked.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, who cheered the Brock report as ``the best thing since
sliced bread,'' said turnout since March 7 ``has been abysmally
low, and the citizens in the states which were after Super Tuesday
have felt left out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brock report said the plan that it recommended could ease
``many of the problems that have come to plague the current
nominating process: front-loading, compression, low voter turnout,
early media frenzy, excessive `tarmac and media ad' campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans do adopt the plan, the process of getting
legislatures to alter primary dates (and abolish winner-take-all
contests), would be simplified if some agreement was reached with
the Democrats. Republicans might not press ahead without such
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   On tuesday, Roosevelt complained that the Republican plan gave
too prominent a place to ``states with no diversity.'' Brock
acknowledged that blacks made up only 6.2 percent of the population
in the first group of states. But he said the existing system, with
pre-eminence to Iowa and New Hampshire, rewarded two
even-less-diverse states, since Iowa is 2 percent black and New
Hampshire is 0.7 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when Democrats were establishing new rules for
choosing delegates, most legislatures went along. The bipartisan
good feelings more typical in state capitals than Washington
frequently persuaded Republicans to let the Democrats have the new
procedures they needed to stay out of trouble with their national
party. Democrats could well do the same for Republicans over the
next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Thomas Patterson, a leading researcher in the Vanishing
Voter project at Harvard, said he doubted the plan would accomplish
its goals. Patterson said he believed if one candidate won most of
the primaries in the first two months, he would be acclaimed as the
likely nominee, even if most delegates had not been selected.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brock did not argue that the plan, if in force this year, might
have produced a different candidate. But he noted that a shortage
of money had forced several Republicans out of the contest even
before the first votes had been cast. He argued that a calendar
that began with primaries in lightly populated, relatively
inexpensive states would have let them continue longer and ``bring
their ideas'' to the process.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Weaver, political director for Sen. John McCain, said he
had no idea how a different calendar would have affected McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not been reflective about that,'' Weaver said. ``We were
pleased with the calendar. Why look back?''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the national committee's satisfaction
with the existing system reflected the position of the campaign of
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Berman, campaign manager for former Sen. Bill Bradley, said
that having both parties hold primaries at the same time would have
helped Bradley, since interest in the Democratic race evaporated
when only Republicans were voting in February.

CITY ATTORNEY CALLS FOR HALT TO WATER RECYCLING PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ City Attorney James K. Hahn on Tuesday called for
the suspension of a so-called ``toilet-to-tap'' project, saying the
Department of Water and Power failed to inform the public about its
start-up and potential health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn, a Los Angeles mayoral candidate, faxed a letter to DWP
chief S. David Freeman calling for the project to be halted
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this has been bungled from the public
participation standpoint,'' Hahn said in an interview. ``I don't
think we're ready to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn added that no laws were broken and he is not exerting any
legal authority, but was just expressing his opinion as an elected
city official, aspiring mayor and someone who drinks Los Angeles
tap water.
</P>
<P>
   His criticisms were echoed by mayoral candidates Antonio
Villaraigosa and Joel Wachs on Tuesday. And an aide to Mayor
Richard Riordan agreed there should have been more public input,
but stopped short of criticizing the DWP outright.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which critics have nicknamed ``toilet-to-tap,''
will start on a pilot basis, but will eventually involve treating
11.4 billion gallons of wastewater annually and using it to
recharge the groundwater supply. After five years or more of
underground filtering, the water would be drawn out for household
use by homes throughout the East San Fernando Valley and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman refused to comment Tuesday on Hahn's letter.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent opinion piece in the Los Angeles Daily News, he
said a series of public meetings took place in 1991 as the
project's environmental impact report was being prepared.
Additional hearings were held in 1995 by the state Department of
Health Services and the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman also said the public was notified when construction
began several years ago, information has been available on the
DWP's Web site, and signs were posted around the San Fernando
Valley with a hotline number to call for information.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hahn and several City Council members have said there
has been no attempt at keeping the public abreast in the past year
or two, as the project was being completed and about to start
pumping water.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman and mayoral candidate Joel Wachs and Councilman Alex
Padilla, who both represent the East Valley, last month called for
public hearings on the project before the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   A joint hearing of the Environmental Quality and Public Works
committees is expected to be scheduled within the next two weeks,
while the Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee is
expected to hold its own hearing at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs said there was no recent public notice or awareness of the
project until an article appeared in the Daily News last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly the kind of issue that people have a right to
make their own decisions about,'' Wachs said. ``It's their money,
it's their water, it's their lives and they have to be consulted.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, who stepped down from the
speaker's post last month to run for Los Angeles mayor, agrees with
the criticism, saying when he has met with Valley residents
recently, that is one of the topics that most often comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made his opposition to the project well known,'' said
Elena Stern, communications director for Villaraigosa. ``Residents
shouldn't learn of projects of this magnitude through headlines.
There should have been a thorough community input process.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern added that Villaraigosa also has concerns about the
environmental health and safety of the project and ``until he can
be assured of the absolute integrity and public safety of the
project, he will remain opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Mayor Richard Riordan said that while there had been
some public notification, there should have been more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a process through which the public was notified,'' said
policy analyst Eric Moses. ``In hindsight, the department should
have made a better effort to notify the public that this was going
on line sooner than they did.''

BASKIN-ROBBINS JOINS FREEBIE FRAY

<P>
   (Glendale, Calif) _ As the weather gets warmer and the days
longer, there may be nothing better than a scoop of Bubble Gum or
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream. Except, that is, a free
scoop.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, Glendale-based
Baskin-Robbins is expecting to give away 4 million free single
scoops tonight at stores nationwide - enough to create a Rocky
Road-flavored path from Los Angeles to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In its Free Scoop Night, lines are expected to spill out the
doors as ice cream lovers queue up between 5 and 10 p.m. for their
favorite of the company's 31 flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a different way to say thank-you to our loyal
customers who support us all the time,'' said Debra Newton,
spokeswoman for Baskin-Robbins. ``It's a way to invite people back
who haven't been to Baskin-Robbins in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts say giving away the store for a day can be a
great way to get a lot back in the long run. The idea is to get
people to try the product at no cost. If they like it, chances are
they'll come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do this because it helps them sell products down the
road,'' said David Stewart, professor of marketing at USC's
Marshall School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Such promotions have been so successful for rival Ben &AMP; Jerry's
since the company went into business more than 20 years ago that
it's now a part of the Vermont-based ice cream chain's culture,
said spokesman Max Gitnick.
</P>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's gives the donations it receives on Free Cone Day
to charity, Gitnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin-Robbins will be giving donations to a national nonprofit
organization, called First Book, that buys books for disadvantaged
young people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both ice cream companies don't mind profit losses
for a giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay to advertise one way or another,'' said Gitnick.
</P>
<P>
   But servers may put on some limits on free ice cream. Some ice
cream lovers have been known to get back in line for seconds or
thirds.
</P>
<P>
   To them, Gitnick offers this advice: ``It's only Free Cone Day.
It's not all-you-can-eat day.''

DODGERS MIGHT HAVE TO TRADE A RELIEVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers wanted bullpen depth, and by the time
they embark on a 12-game road trip Monday, they might have more of
it than they know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said rehabbing righty Antonio
Osuna could be ready to join the club when they play in Arizona.
But to activate Osuna, the Dodgers need to clear a roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer not to go to 12 (pitchers),'' Johnson said.
``I'd prefer not to shorten my bench. (Geronimo) Berroa is a guy we
held out before. I would prefer not to go that direction because
Arizona is a club that throws left-handers at you.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson's thinking remains consistent through Osuna's next
two outings for Triple-A Albuquerque, it means Berroa will remain
with the club. It could also mean the Dodgers will be forced to
either send right- hander Matt Herges to the minors or trade one of
their relievers. They certainly don't want to send Herges out. He's
yet to allow an earned run in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping teams in need of relief help begin to
shop around in the next few days, but so far the only inquiries
have been about Terry Adams, Mike Fetters and Herges.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are those three the best set-up men in the Dodgers
bullpen - they have a combined 0.85 ERA - but they make economical
sense. The trio makes a combined $2.16 million this season while
struggling right-hander Alan Mills is owed more than twice that in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna has an option remaining, and he could be activated and
then sent to the minors. But the Dodgers might be willing to
showcase him for a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be interested to see where he's at,'' Johnson said. ``I
feel we have a strong bullpen, and if he's throwing like the
reports indicate, then it'll make it stronger down there. The
question is where do you go?''
</P>
<P>
   Tell-ing Rocker: Andrew Tellers, the fan who ran onto the field
and mooned Atlanta closer John Rocker in the bottom of the ninth
Monday at Dodger Stadium, said he did so because he was disgusted
with Rocker's behavior following his verbal bashing of gays,
immigrants and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't premeditated,'' said the 24-year-old from
Bellflower. ``It was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I hated him before
just because he pitched for a different team. I hated him more for
what he said. After his remarks, he deserved to be mooned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to the security guards and the police,'' added
Tellers, who had ``John is off his Rocker'' written on his arm. ``I
wouldn't do it again in the future, and I wouldn't do it to another
player, but if I could go back, I'd do the same thing. I do have
remorse. Someone had to do it. I'm hoping fans don't run on the
field anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Braves got a chuckle out of it, but it is a
serious issue. Derrick Hall, Dodgers senior vice president of
communications, said extra security was added for Tuesday's game.
In addition, Tellers has a May 22 court date to face what he said
was a misdemeanor charge for disrupting a sporting event. He also
faces a fine, though he said spectators in his section donated $100
before he ran onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros was scratched
from the lineup because of flu-like symptoms. Berroa made his
second start in Karros' place. Karros is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS VS. ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 p.m., at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: The Dodgers conclude their three-game series with the
Braves in a game that appears to be a mismatch based on the
pitchers. Lefty Carlos Perez (2-1, 4.62 ERA) starts for the Dodgers
against four-time Cy Young winner Greg Maddux (4-0, 2.49). Perez
has performed better than expected, especially his last two starts
in which he is 1-0 with a 3.27 ERA. Perez is tied with Eric Gagne
for the staff lead with five homers allowed. Maddux is making his
seventh start of the season. He allowed one earned run in seven
innings in beating San Diego on Friday.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Kerry Wood's long-awaited return to Wrigley Field created
a playoff-type atmosphere. That was the first sign of trouble for
the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it wasn't the last.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros endured another troublesome night in a season of
many, falling 11-1 to the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday. Pitching and
hitting aside, the Astros looked pretty good. However, it's almost
impossible to win in the absence of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to analyze everything that went wrong,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said. ``But obviously, a lot did.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started on the mound, where Wood had just about
everything going and Astros starter Jose Lima had nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Wood is coming off reconstructive elbow surgery and
hadn't pitched in a big-league game since 1998, it would have been
safe to bet Lima would outlast him. Don't everyone rush off to the
pay window at once.
</P>
<P>
   Wood picked up where he left off from his Rookie of the Year
season of 1998, dazzling the Astros for six innings. Dierker had to
pull the plug on Lima after 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tallied only four strikeouts _ as opposed to the
record-tying 20 he logged the last time he faced Houston at Wrigley
_ Wood held the Astros to three hits and a run in six innings. In
three starts against them lifetime, he is 2-0 with a 0.78 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' only run came on Daryle Ward's solo homer in the
sixth. Roger Cedeno's infield single in the first and Lima's
end-of-the-bat hit in the fifth were the Astros' only other hits
against Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a great game,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
said. ``All you can do is tip your hat to him, which we seem to be
doing every time we face him. He has our number; that's for sure.
He's the same guy he was a couple of years ago, and he's just going
to get more comfortable the more times he goes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can only hope the same is true for Lima, who looks
nothing like the pitcher who won 37 games over the past two
seasons. As if the Astros didn't already have reason enough to
worry about Lima, the struggling righthander gave them about 10
more in Tuesday's blowout loss. The Cubs tagged Lima for 10 runs
(nine earned) on 13 hits, including three home runs, each of which
was the hitter's first.
</P>
<P>
   ``They beat me,'' Lima said. ``I can't make any excuses, and I'm
not going to kill myself. They were hitting everything I threw up
there. If I threw a ball in the dirt, they hit it into the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima's dramatic decline begs the question: After establishing
career highs with 233 innings in 1998 and 246 in 1999, is his right
arm sound?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with my arm,'' Lima insisted. ``It feels
great. That's not the problem. I just have to pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   While his arm may be strong, Lima's ERA continues to take a
beating. It jumped to 9.59 Tuesday. Lima has allowed 23 hits and 22
runs in his last two starts (9 innings) _ both against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old righthander also has allowed eight home runs
during the most horrible stretch of a season with few bright spots.
Lima, who has lost five consecutive starts, has allowed a
major-league-high 13 home runs in just six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get any worse,'' he said. ``Things have to change.
I'm really disappointed that I'm not performing better. But I'm not
going to give up on myself. I'm still only 27 years old, and I
didn't win 21 games last year by being lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got a lot of starts left to turn it around, and I
believe I will. No one believes in himself more than I do. It's not
how you start; it's how you finish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros started off on the wrong foot against Wood. They had
a runner in scoring position with less than two out on two
occasions but failed to capitalize each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some scoring opportunities early,'' Dierker said. ``But
we weren't able to make them pay off. After that, things got out of
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The first three batters reached base against Lima in the second
inning, including Willie Greene, who delivered an RBI double. Joe
Girardi drove in another run with a fielder's-choice grounder, and
Wood rubbed salt into Lima's wounds with a two-run homer to left
field.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who was 4-for-4 with four RBIs, had an RBI single in the
third and a two-run homer in the Cubs' five-run fifth inning.
Girardi also hit a two-run homer in the fifth, and Mark Grace
chimed in with an RBI double, which finally chased Lima from the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima threw a lot of pitches up and over the plate that they
hit out of the ballpark,'' Dierker said. ``That's been a problem
for him this season, and it was again tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Wood on the mound, the Astros didn't need any more
problems.

LEHTINEN COULD BE BACK FOR GAME 4
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The day-to-day status of injured Stars winger
Jere Lehtinen's return has an actual day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a player tonight,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said
before Game 3 last night. ``But if he continues to move along,
there is a real opportunity he's a player on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat prognosis came after Lehtinen, who hasn't played
since reinjuring his right ankle in the Stars' season finale, had
another good day of practice. He skated with the team during the
morning skate yesterday, the fourth consecutive day he has been
able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches are evaluating him and he's evaluating himself,''
Stars trainer Dave Surprenant said. ``He's as close as he has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen played in only 17 of the Stars' 82 regular-season games
because of a fractured right ankle.  &QL; 
Sharks gripe about holding
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Sharks are grumbling that the Stars are holding
them up in the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock didn't sound too surprised to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about our holdups, and we're talking about
their holdups,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm sure someone is talking to
the refs about the holdups. I'm sure someone is talking to the
supervisor about the holdups. In the end, you usually get a couple
of calls and 25 get let go. It's the same every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock figured his talks with the supervisor of officials
sounds a lot like what Sharks coach Darryl Sutter says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except his might have more Canadianisms,'' Hitchcock quipped.
 &QL; 
Not a pleasant surprise
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said an unpleasant surprise greeted him at
practice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed up this morning with two or three hockey players
with strep \Rthroat\S,'' Hitchcock said. Backup goalie Marty Turco
was included in that unlucky few.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Kirk Muller has been battling the flu, but played
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not in, you can go to the bank \Rthey're sick\S,''
Hitchcock said. ``Some guys left early because of it and some were
sent back to the hotel. ... It's going to be a hard thing this time
of year to keep a player out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' other non-injured scratches were Jamie Pushor, Jon
Sim and Brad Lukowich.  &QL; 
Hail, Roman
</P>
<P>
   Stars rookie Roman Lyashenko celebrated his 21st birthday last
night.
</P>
<P>
   The American passage into legal drinking age was lost on the
Russian winger, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America,'' he said.  &QL; 
Morrow ranks high
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brenden Morrow has carried over his successful
rookie season into the playoffs. Morrow ranks third among NHL
rookies in playoff scoring with four points on two goals and two
assists. He picked up an assist on Mike Modano's game-winner in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow is behind Jochen Hecht of St. Louis (4-6-10) and Simon
Gagne of Philadelphia (3-3-6). Morrow is also a plus-4 in the
plus-minus rating, tied for third in assists (2) and tied for
second in power-play goals (1).  &QL; 
Modano's streak
</P>
<P>
   If Mike Modano keeps this up, you can start calling him Conn
Smythe. His power-play goal at the 3:35 mark of the first period
gave him a career playoff-high seven-game scoring streak, five
goals and three assists. The goal was in typical fashion for this
series. It came off a rebound from a Brett Hull shot.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Modano had a six-game point streak (2-4-6) from the
start of the playoffs through Game 2 of the Western Conference
semifinals against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Modano is first on the team in goals (4) and first in takeaways
(11) and, with eight points, is one behind Brett Hull for the team
lead. Hull had an assist on Modano's goal..

SHARKS BACK IN FRENZY, THANKS TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Hit or get hit. It's all about survival for
the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   They promised a more physical presence and more traffic in front
of Stars goalie Ed Belfour. They brought a chippier attitude to
Game 3, although through almost a period and a half it did little
to aid their ailing forecheck. It was an atypically undisciplined
Stars crew that got the Sharks' machine churning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to penetrate the neutral zone with the way
they play, so it seems we are losing the puck a lot more than we
did against St. Louis,'' Sharks center Vincent Damphousse said.
``The key is to get our forecheck going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' defense, when at full strength, didn't allow that to
happen. They remained consistently strong in moving the puck
quickly out of the defensive zone. When they do that, it
drastically limits the Sharks' ability to light up the Stars with
punishing hits the way they had bullied the Blues in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is it frustrates teams when they rely on their
forechecking,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think that's
the reason San Jose beat St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Sharks finally broke through, thanks to a slew of Stars
penalties in the second period, two of which gave the Sharks a
five-on-three power play. Mike Ricci finally was able to do what
had been the impossible _ he deflected Gary Suter's shot past
Belfour. It was the Sharks' first goal in more than seven periods
against the Stars to tie the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two ways about it, discipline wins,'' Sharks winger Dave
Lowry said. ``You can't take selfish penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   When Owen Nolan poked in a Damphousse pass with one hand late in
the second period for a 2-1 lead and the Sharks' first lead of the
series, the San Jose Arena erupted, and the Sharks' high-energy,
hard-nosed play finally seemed to be breaking out of its shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they are going to be more physical every game we've
played them,'' Stars winger Brenden Morrow said. ``The games have
been pretty physical, but you haven't really been able to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Take notice.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's going to be. Both teams know it. The Sharks
are battling for survival.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ricci: ``We've got to make sure we're doing whatever we can
within the rules to play more physical and win more battles.''

PLAYOFF PAYOFF COULD BE RESULT OF BARRY BENCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No record is kept in the NBA of an obscure category
called ``arrows taken for team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, really. Without it, the professional casualty rate
among coaches would be even more ridiculous than it is. Lately, it
might have included Paul Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Brent Barry took an arrow. A flaming one, right
in the caboose.
</P>
<P>
   After most of a season of creditable play as Gary Payton's
running mate, he was removed by Westphal from the starting lineup
for reasons having nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul had no problems with the way I was playing,'' Barry said
after practice Tuesday. ``He told me he had to make a change for
certain reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   And those were...?
</P>
<P>
   Said the Sonics coach: ``I didn't want the headline to read,
`Westphal benches Vin Baker.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the politics of team sports, there is a diplomacy that
usually prevails when a star gets his chops busted. Particularly
when the star is as sensitive as Baker. Make what you will of
Baker's will, but Westphal was desperate for some victories _ the
Sonics had lost 9 of 11 _ while getting a fire lit under Baker
without burning him up.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of making Baker the sole change, Westphal replaced
Barry and Ruben Patterson as well. It was a large gamble, because
not only were the three new starters youngsters with minuscule
playing experience, the two veterans who went down with Baker had
every right to be hacked off.
</P>
<P>
   The drama isn't over yet, but Westphal is on the verge of a
payoff. If the Sonics can win Game 4 Wednesday night against the
Jazz in KeyArena and force a deciding game Friday in Utah, the
perhaps unprecedented late-season maneuverings can be said to have
produced results.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sonics wouldn't have come nearly this far had Barry and
Patterson done the familiar pro-sports pouts that are usually
measured in megatons.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was definitely cranky after being ill-used in the Game
2 rout in Salt Lake City. But the mood passed, and his energy was
decisive off the bench in the Game 3 victory (sports archaeologists
carbon-date the game back to the past Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Barry returned to the starting lineup for Game 3, and
although burdened by some of the cheesiest fouls outside Wisconsin,
Barry had seven points, four assists and three blocks in 23
minutes. He also used his face to slow down one of Karl Malone's
elbows, which in some jurisdictions passes for attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Barry not only denied his mutilation was intentional, he denied
any emotional injury over the earlier benching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider it getting benched,'' he said. ``I was still
playing. I consider it a benching if you don't play at all. That's
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care (about a role). If coach wants me to start, or
come off the bench, or play in a thong ... it'll be uncomfortable,
but I'll do it. It's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Barry already has a nickname, Bones, a pass will be taken
on the opportunity to name him Thong Boy. He might, however, be
given credit for reviving the word ``teammate'' in an era when most
franchises are collections of 12 mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I was brought up,'' said the son of Rick Barry,
former NBA All-Star. ``That's the way a player should think. If you
work hard enough, you'll get the opportunity. That's what Rashard
(Lewis) took advantage of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to say the professional level has gotten to a point
where you have a guy who `refreshingly' or `willingly' takes his
licks and accepts them. If that's not the norm, it's a sad
statement for basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport is full of sad statements, but this isn't one of them.
Barry not only subsumed his ego lately, he's had to do it most of
the season to run with Payton, who dominates the Sonics' show.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Barry has emulated his predecessor, Hersey
Hawkins, who forsook a lot of shots and glory for the sake of
Payton and the team. Barry's style makes a better fit at the moment
than with rookie Shammond Williams, who nevertheless played
splendidly in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shammond arguably had the best series so far among us,''
Westphal said. ``But the change was more about familiarity with
what we've been doing all year; a comfort zone. I really wanted to
help Vin put some of his problems behind him. We went with (the
three youngsters) until it stopped working. When it did, we went
back to what's most familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no blame on anybody, the results weren't there. More than
anything, Brent is just a more experienced player and the team is
more used to him, and maybe that's why we're a little smoother.
Because of his size (6-7), he gives us some easier rotations
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was the fact that Payton wanted Barry back. Williams
has enough of a shoot-first persuasion _ he scored 38 points in the
first two games, second to Payton's 44 _ that Payton ended up
playing a different game, with less control of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Barry made his peace with the role a while ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asked to do too much on the court _ chip in a few
shots, hustle on defense, make some plays. Basically I'm supposed
to facilitate what Gary and, hopefully, Vin do. Anything else is a
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it frustration, but there were times this year
I was hoping to get more opportunities to use the skills I have to
further our team. It seemed like those were curtailed. At the time,
I had no problem because we were playing pretty good basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   At 28 and in his fifth season, Barry figured that on Team
Tumult, where he is about the only midcareer veteran, it was useful
to have one or two guys who aren't running along walls and
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   ``An even keel,'' is how he described it. ``I like to think of
myself and Horace Grant in that way _ guys you can rely on. If I'm
anything like Horace, I can live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the arrow hits him near the thong.

RANGERS WIN GAME, LOSE KAPLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Rick Helling pitched terrifically, Rafael
Palmeiro returned to the lineup with a bang and the Rangers have
now actually won two games in a row for only the second time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, a somber mood prevailed in the Rangers'
clubhouse after an 8-1 victory last night over the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays at Tropicana Field. The Rangers were unable to completely
enjoy the victory because the injury menace that has dogged them
since spring training struck again.
</P>
<P>
   This time Gabe Kapler was the victim, leaving the game in the
fifth inning with a strained hip muscle. He is scheduled to undergo
an MRI, and trainer Danny Wheat said Kapler could miss at least two
to four games until the Rangers determine how seriously he's hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan on missing tomorrow,'' Kapler said. ``But I don't
think I have a choice. That's somebody else's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates and assistant general manager Dan O'Brien
met after the game to discuss the club's options. If Kapler can't
play today, that leaves the Rangers with only three healthy
outfielders: Jason McDonald, Ruben Mateo and Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was guessing, I'd imagine we'd probably try to have
somebody here tomorrow,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have four possibilities at Triple-A Oklahoma:
Scarborough Green, Pedro Valdes, Mike Zywica or Ruben Sierra.
O'Brien said the Rangers are still discussing the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem is that designated hitter is not an
option for Kapler. That role is reserved, at least for the time
being, for Palmeiro, who homered and had a two-run single last
night after missing two games because of a strained left hamstring.
Palmeiro is still bothered by the injury and is unable to play in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Last night really belonged to Helling, who had to wait a full
week between starts because the Rangers had two days in the past
week. That left him stronger than normal, although his control
wasn't as sharp as it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and it was still a dominating performance,
until he ran out of pitches in the eighth inning. He walked six and
hit a batter but only allowed one hit through 7 1/3 innings, a
sixth-inning single by Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good ... but with a week between starts, you're
not going to be as sharp,'' Helling said. ``I felt my curve ball
was the best it's been all year. I bounced some in the dirt early,
but that didn't bother me. It's easier to adjust from the dirt up
than from a hanging breaking ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who threw 136 pitches, took a no-hitter into the sixth,
but McGriff ruined any chance of glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was still close at that point, so I was really
focused on getting outs,'' Helling said. ``The count was 0-1, and I
threw a changeup that I left up. McGriff got the bat on the ball
and hit it through the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-inning error by third baseman Mike Lamb led to an
unearned run, keeping the Rangers from getting their first shutout
of the season. But the Rangers, despite their poor start, remain
encouraged by the performances they've been getting from their
first four starting pitchers: Helling, Kenny Rogers, Darren Oliver
and Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Those four have a combined earned-run average of 3.73 after 21
starts, and they've pitched at least seven innings in 11 of those
21 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind \Rstarting pitching\S is one of
our strengths,'' Oates said. ``We have the personnel here to fix
what's wrong. April wasn't pretty, but it's not like we have to
start over. We have the personnel to fix it. If we can get healthy,
with our starting pitching and if we get our bullpen fine, then
we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that getting healthy seems to be the elusive part of
that equation.

ANGELS BLOW LEAD IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE -- The Angels have done everything they can to rid
last season from their memory, but they got a jolt of reality
Tuesday night when they were reminded of something.
</P>
<P>
   They still can't beat the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from a 5-0 deficit, took a 6-5 lead into the
ninth inning only to see the Orioles score two runs off closer Troy
Percival for a 7-6 win before 34,923 at Camden Yards. The Orioles
have beaten the Angels nine consecutive times and 14 of the past 15
going back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it looked like the trend would continue without a fight
as the Orioles scored once in the third, twice more in both the
fourth and fifth innings to take a 5-0 lead against Angels starter
Scott Schoeneweis.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels rallied against Orioles starter Sidney Ponson.
Bengie Molina singled home two runs in the sixth, and Tim Salmon
hit a three-run homer in the seventh to tie the game at 5. Troy
Glaus hit his team-leading eighth homer later in the seventh to
give the Angels a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were 12-0 this season when leading after the seventh
inning, but that doesn't take into account Percival's struggles
against the Orioles. With Tuesday's loss, Percival is 0-4 with a
6.08 ERA in his career vs. Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He faced five batters in the inning and didn't retire any of
them. After getting two quick strikes on Jeff Conine to start the
inning, Percival (0-2) walked him on a 3-2 pitch. Cal Ripken
followed with a double off the fence in left-center field to score
Conine to tie the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to pinch hitter Harold Baines, Charles
Johnson singled to left to load the bases for Mike Bordick, who
began the day leading the American League with 29 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia not only brought the infield in, he
brought left fielder Darin Erstad in to play between first and
second base, moving second baseman Adam Kennedy over to the second
base bag and giving the Angels five infielders.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy didn't work because Bordick lined Percival's first
pitch to right field past Salmon for a game-winning single.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he thought Percival might have lost his rhythm,
but Percival wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I lost my rhythm, I still felt pretty good,''
he said. ``I didn't throw good pitches and they hit me. The took
some good swings off me. What can I say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get balls down and away and every one was down
the middle. The one to Ripken was right down the middle. I've got
to make a better pitch than that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to happen,'' Scioscia said. ``In the big picture
there are going to be some blown saves.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was Percival's first blown save of the season in seven
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days are better than others,'' Percival said. ``Some days
the ball is jumping out of your hand and some days you have to
pitch a little better. Tonight I needed to pitch and I didn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis gave up only six hits in 7 2/3 innings, but the
Orioles made them count. Of the six, Schoeneweis said only a
hanging slider to Brady Anderson was a mistake. Anderson hit the
pitch for a two-run homer and a 5-0 lead in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hung it, but I was still keeping the ball down and
getting ground balls,'' Schoeneweis said. ``If I can stay in the
game I feel I get better as the game goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hitters got better after Ponson shut them out for
five innings, scoring twice in the sixth and four times in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been in situations when you get down, it's all over,''
Mo Vaughn said. ``That's not the situation here. We know we can
play with everybody. We just need a little luck to go with it.''

WOOD RETURNS WITH DOMINANT STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Don Baylor eagerly awaited Kerry Wood's return to the
Chicago Cubs rotation because of the tall Texan's ``John Wayne
presence.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first major-league start since Oct. 3, 1998, Wood
provided just that.
</P>
<P>
   The Irving native and Grand Prairie High School graduate had a
night that would make any Western legend proud.
</P>
<P>
   Making a comeback from career-threatening elbow surgery, Wood
both pitched and hit his team to an 11-1 victory against the
Houston Astros last night at a sold-out Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, feeling no pain in his surgically repaired elbow, held the
Astros to one run on three hits in six innings, and hit a two-run
home run off the first pitch he saw from Houston starter Jose Lima
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better than scripted for me,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback was the fact that it was a night game. Had it
been played in the afternoon, Wood could have finished his day like
all Texas heroes, by riding off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Wood had no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good pitching,'' he said. ``I'm very pleased with that.
The home run is just a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   By almost any measure, Wood's comeback was a success. He was
able to throw 96 pitches. His fastball was clocked as high as 97
mph. He had a two-hit shutout through five innings, losing it only
when Daryle Ward hit a one-out homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my stuff is pretty close,'' Wood said. ``My command
has to come back as far as the breaking stuff, and I wasn't able to
put the fastball where I wanted to early, but that came around
after a couple of innings. I've still got a little work to do, but
I'm pleased with the first outing.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing lacking was a typical pre-surgery strikeout
total. This start came four days from the two-year anniversary of
the day he fanned the Astros 20 times, tying Roger Clemens'
major-league record. He whiffed only four last night, rarely
exhibiting the dominance that led to an average of 12.6 strikeouts
per nine innings and a .196 opponents' batting average when he was
a 20-year-old rookie in '98.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, could be attributed to rust and adrenaline, a
combination that prompted catcher Joe Girardi to simplify the game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for more fastballs than I will down the road,''
Girardi said. ``When you're too hyped up, it's harder to control
your breaking ball. I was most encouraged because I thought he got
better as the night went on. His fastball got better, his changeup
got better, his breaking pitches got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was at his best in the fifth inning, when the Astros had
runners at second and third with two outs and the dangerous Jeff
Bagwell at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Wood got ahead with a 97 and a 96 mph fastball, just missed with
a 96 mph fastball, than froze Bagwell with an 84 mph slider on the
outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did to Bagwell, not too many people do that,'' Cubs
first baseman Mark Grace said. ``It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   That strikeout heightened an already festive atmosphere at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans began arriving early, ready to welcome Wood back. A
few wore Cubs jerseys with Wood's name on the back. They carried
signs reading, ``Welcome Back,'' and ``Finally Kerry Has Come Back
To Wrigley.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also seemed to be caught up in the pregame buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives this game a certain electricity, and I kind of like
being part of this scene,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``It's not
hard to figure out that something special is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was excited even before arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today seemed a lot longer than yesterday,'' he said. ``I woke
up at 6:30, afraid I was going to be late for the park.''
</P>
<P>
   His adrenaline flowed even faster as he went to the bullpen to
warm up, accompanied by the first of several standing ovations from
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   While Wood was excited, his teammates were nervous for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many emotions run through your mind,'' Grace said. ``You
worry about the worst-case scenario, if he hurts himself, and you
think, `Please don't happen.' Then, I didn't want him to get
shelled. I wasn't thinking about no-hitters or 20 strikeouts. I
just wanted him to pitch good, and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne would have been proud.

MICROSOFT PARTNERS GET SHORT SHRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the analyses of Microsoft's future, precious little has
been said about the company's business partners.
</P>
<P>
   Much ink has been spilled and air time given over to the
shareholders, employees, consumers and competitors, but what about
those whose business fates are inextricably linked to Microsoft?
These partnerships embrace a wide variety of enterprises, including
big personal computer makers, software firms and retailers. How
will the government's bid to break up Microsoft affect their
prospects?
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times, one of the few business journals to pay
heed to these forgotten players of the Microsoft drama, estimates
that in America alone there are 10,000 technology partners and
115,000 retailers, smaller personal computer companies, resellers
and other peripheral businesses closely associated with Microsoft.
Globally, the Financial Times noted, the number of such firms is so
high the company doesn't bother to keep track of them.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, they have millions of employees whose economic
fortunes now ride on judicial whim and Microsoft's ability to fend
off its government foes.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from key competitors such as Oracle and Sun
Microsystems has been muted, probably because the case has a long
way to go through the appeals process. Meantime, nobody can say for
sure how Microsoft's primary competition will fare even if
government trustbusters get everything they seek.
</P>
<P>
   For industry partners with important ties to Microsoft, however,
the future may be now as they assess how to prepare for the worst,
should government prevail. History suggests the outlook is
reasonably bright for employees and shareholders. Job security
isn't likely to be a problem regardless of how the company might be
reorganized, and past big breakups have tended to enhance
shareholder value rather than diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the Financial Times points out, the worst-case
scenario doesn't bode well for companies whose business has been
built on the dominance of Windows. The work of lifetimes will be at
risk for some key Microsoft partners.
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust chief, Joel Klein, indicated that the
proposed remedy would be a ``surgical strike,'' but the job of
creating two companies from one as dominant and complex as
Microsoft defies such a tidy characterization.
</P>
<P>
   The early fallout already signals how chaotic this intrusion by
government may prove in the years ahead. Much of the stock market's
tech sector swoon is probably attributable to the uncertainties
created by Washington in the Microsoft case. Moreover, as investors
begin to further ponder the implications of government's heavy hand
on industry affairs, the industry's golden age as a Wall Street
darling may become a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever government pursues such radical actions, the means and
ends are critical considerations.
</P>
<P>
   As for means, it's most important to remember Microsoft was made
a target for legal action by its competitors, not its customers.
Polls consistently show overwhelming approval by consumers familiar
with Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   As for possible ends, one critic called the government's
proposed breakup remedy ``like trying to fix a traffic jam by
dropping an atom bomb.''

KEMPER MILITARY ACADEMY PLANS TO CLOSE NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The oldest military academy west of the
Mississippi River will close next week unless it can find $1.3
million, said an official at Kemper Military School and College in
Boonville, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do a lot of things to pull ourselves out of
the fire,'' retired Lt. Col. Tom Challender, director of alumni
affairs, said Tuesday. ``But every parent who has paid for summer
school or fall semester will get their money back. We're going down
honorably and with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Web site, www.kemper.org, a statement posted Tuesday
attributed to school President Edward E. Ridgley said: ``...it will
be problematic, if not impossible, for the institution to meet its
financial obligations if it continues to operate after May 13.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgley would not accept phone calls Tuesday seeking further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement of the 156-year-old school's closure
came Monday afternoon, said Judith Delaney, dean of women. Ridgley
first told the department heads, then the faculty, then the
corpsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were devastated,'' Delaney said. ``It's very sad to
talk with the kids who love this place. These kids are doers.
They're on the phone, calling their parents. Calling alumni.
They're praying for a miracle. They didn't see this coming. We
hoped that it wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an inkling of financial trouble late last fall when
the school, about 115 miles east of Kansas City, Mo., decided to
close its football program, which long had been a source of pride
for the school. Later, the school shut down its basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   The school began with three students in the 1840s as a boys
boarding school founded by Frederick Thomas Kemper. From the same
family came a Confederate general, an Episcopal bishop and Kansas
City financier William T. Kemper. The school later focused on
military training.
</P>
<P>
   During the prelude to World War II, the school's enrollment
expanded to more than 500 students. But after the Vietnam War, its
enrollment dropped. Women were admitted in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the Vietnam War, there were 600 military schools across
America,'' Challender said. ``By 1980, the numbers dropped to 100,
and now they're at 80. There seems to be a real anti-military
feeling we're living with right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the school had 338 students, a climb from a decade
earlier when it had 167 students. Last fall, the school did not
report its student enrollment to the Missouri Department of Higher
Education. But according to the Web site, there are 256 students _
79 in junior college living at the academy, 145 boarding students
in seventh through 12th grades, and 32 nonboarding junior college
students.
</P>
<P>
   The school has almost closed its doors twice before: in
mid-1970s and in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``But both times we were able to sell properties and get some
cash flow in,'' Challender said. ``We told alumni in January that
we'd hit a wall in May. Some people told us we'd probably close in
late January, but we didn't. These kids will graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton is to speak at Kemper's graduation
ceremony May 13. Skelton is a graduate of Wentworth Military
Academy and Junior College in Lexington, Mo. But even Skelton was
unaware of Kemper's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did tell me it was going to close a couple of weeks ago,
but I thought they meant for the summer,'' Skelton said from his
office in Washington. ``This is surprising. We need these schools.
We need what they offer to students and the country. I'm very
saddened by this news. Very saddened.''
</P>
<P>
   Other famous Kemper Military School and College graduates
include James Stowers Jr., a Kansas City philanthropist and founder
of American Century Investments; humorist Will Rogers; actor Hugh
O'Brian; and chicken magnate Don Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to see this institution die, but just because it's the
bottom of the ninth with two strikes it doesn't mean we're down
yet,'' Challender said. ``We're going to fight until the game is
over. We have a lot of alumni out there who care about this school.
They may save us yet.''

LIBRARY GIVEN PILES OF WORTHLESS BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY EDYTHE JENSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would happen if someone donated 15,000 books to Gilbert's
library and nearly all of them had the same title?
</P>
<P>
   Librarians are finding out the hard way this week as they sort
through a loading dock full of books that arrived as part of a
Cracker Barrel restaurants promotion. The gift includes 11,796
copies of a preschool book titled ``What Would Happen If ''.``
.''`` .'' . The rest of the gift is just as useless, including
1,000 ``Quick and Easy Pasta'' paperbacks, hundreds of outdated
textbooks and 200 copies of ``How To Use Microsoft Windows 95.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maricopa County Southeast Regional Library had agreed under
pressure in December to take the books after it was accused of
ingratitude for questioning whether the books would really be
usable.
</P>
<P>
   The library's director predicted then that it could be stuck
with thousands of ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't that far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed,'' Maricopa County Library
Director Harry Courtright said. ``We can find a creative way of
doing something with the children's books . . . but ``Windows 95''
is of no value to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first such problem for Cracker Barrel's literacy
sweepstakes award. Promoted by country music star Faith Hill, it
gave 10 lucky winners a trip to the Country Music Awards in
Nashville, along with a donation of 10,000 children's books in
their name to a library of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries in Columbus, Ind.; and Gasden, Ala., have received
similarly worthless shipments. Gasden's librarian plans to haul
hundreds of copies of an outdated microbiology text to the local
dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Cracker Barrel and told them, `The concept was really
great, but it didn't work out the way y'all thought it would,' ''
said librarian Becky Buckner, who suspects that the prize books are
publisher rejects used as tax write-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Jennifer Presley said she is as
surprised as everyone else. She said the Lebanon, Tenn.-based chain
didn't know who shipped the books or where they came from. She was
sure restaurant officials did not get a chance to review the
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was intended to be a useful gift,'' she said. ``We are
extremely disappointed that this has created difficulties . . . and
are trying to determine what we can do to alleviate the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Presley did not say what Cracker Barrel would do, and Hill did
not return messages left with her agent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in Gilbert, librarians are already making plans. Courtright
is hopeful that the local Friends of the Library group may be able
to sell some of the books at a fund-raiser. He said its massive
``What Would Happen If...'' collection could be distributed to
day-care centers or as prizes in summer reading programs.
</P>
<P>
   For Lillie Holmes, it wasn't supposed to end this way. The
Gilbert woman who won the contest after stopping in the Casa Grande
Cracker Barrel last year said she was promised ``new and gently
used children's books.'' She saw the new, nearly empty library as
the perfect home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of disappointed,'' Holmes said Tuesday. ``I still
think the library can make some use of the books, but my
understanding was they would send novels for children.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Holmes complained when the library seemed less than
thrilled with her offer to donate the books.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Library officials were concerned about the
usefulness and potential cost of processing so many books. They
became the target of public criticism when they first told Holmes
they couldn't take all of them.
</P>
<P>
   They later agreed to accept the entire shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it now sits in the loading dock behind the library while
officials wait to see whether Cracker Barrel will do something
about the piles of such titles as ``Why Women Live Longer than
Men'' and ``Rotary Cutter Quilts. ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert's library also has 1,000 copies of another book that
Cracker Barrel may find particularly useful now: ``Corporate
Comeback.''  &QL;

SHOULDER PROBLEMS AGAIN PLAGUE DiSARCINA 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina left Tuesday's game after
five innings because of tightness in his right shoulder, the same
injury that bothered him late last season.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina made two throws in the dirt that were dug out by first
baseman Scott Spiezio, but after throwing the ball over Spiezio's
head for an error in the fifth inning, he finally admitted
something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously something was not right in his release,'' manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``I talked to him about it (early in the game)
and he said he felt good. But later in the game he said his arm was
bugging him. He got progressively worse as the game moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said DiSarcina will not play today, but ``I don't see
it as anything long term.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina missed 14 games when on the disabled list with a
bruised left thumb and has played in only 11 of the team's 27 games
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Mercker was so disappointed he wasn't named to the starting
rotation at the end of spring training, he said he didn't expect to
get another chance to start all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity was there,'' he said at the end of March.
``Now it's not there. I don't see it coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's coming back. Scioscia said Mercker will start Saturday's
game against the Mariners in Seattle, in place of the injured Jason
Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was 3-0 with a 3.78 ERA in Arizona, but Scioscia chose
Scott Schoeneweis for the rotation instead. Mercker was sent to the
bullpen, where he is 0-1 with a 6.61 ERA in 10 appearances,
pitching mostly in middle- and long-relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the dept of our pitching that Merck can step in and
get a start,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Eric Weaver and Mike Holtz joined the club Tuesday
after spending the first month of the season at Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz gives the Angels something they haven't had all season --
a situational lefty. His ERA at Edmonton was 10.80, but Scioscia
was quick to point out Holtz gave up six runs in one-third of an
inning on a cold and windy night in Colorado Springs in his first
appearance of the season, but hasn't allowed a run since in five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a roll now and he meets our needs,'' Scioscia said.
``Now we do have a lefty that can come in and get a left-hander
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The last few years, Holtz has been up and down between the
majors and minors, and it reflected his confidence level. His goal
now is ``The same as always,'' he said. ``Establish my fastball in
a good location and get my breaking ball over. I know I can get
people out, it's a matter of having the confidence to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver did not allow a run in spring training but was sent down
anyway. He was coming off surgery to remove bone chips in his
elbow, and had to show he was healthy again. He did that, then
pitched well (3.52 ERA) as Edmonton's closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sucks in Triple-A,'' Weaver said. ``There's a good group of
guys and the coaching staff is great, but I hope I never see 'em
again. It was a step I had to take to get back to the big
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels media relations department continues to scramble to
determine what records Darin Erstad broke with his torrid April.
Besides setting a club record for hits in a month (48) and setting
the major league record for hits in April, Erstad also tied the
club record for batting average in a month (.449). He now shares
the record with Rod Carew, who hit .449 in April 1983.
</P>

   ANGELS AT ORIOLES

   Time: 4:05 at Camden Yards

   Matchup: Ramon Ortiz (1-2, 5.06 ERA) will start for Anaheim
against Baltimore's Jason Johnson (0-0, 2.72). Ortiz hasn't won
since his first start of the season on April 11. The Angels hit 34
home runs to set a club record for the month of April. The old mark
of 33 was held by the 1986 team.

SHARKS GET BOOST, WINNING GOAL FROM NOLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Sharks captain Owen Nolan put aside his
ailing shoulder or foot, or both, and was in the lineup last night
in a do-or-die situation for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   He proved to be one of the heroes, scoring the game-winning goal
in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   After missing Game 2, Nolan resurfaced at yesterday's morning
skate, but it wasn't certain if he would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he plays, he plays,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said.
``I'm not answering anymore Owen Nolan questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars fully prepared to play against him. Inside their
dressing room, on a board where the team posts the opposition's
tentative lines, Nolan's name was in his usual right-wing spot on
the No. 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the guy's on crutches, he's out there,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ``You don't want to show anything. He was
leading the troops there just like he does on a regular basis, and
he looks like a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan played for the first time this series with center Vincent
Damphousse and winger Jeff Friesen.  &QL; 
Can't be shaken
</P>
<P>
   The talk around San Jose before Game 3 was if the raucous crowd
could rattle Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who recorded shutouts in
Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   The chant: BEL-FOUR started before the first faceoff, but coach
Darryl Sutter thought the notion was preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you can't. I said all along he is in the top three in the
league; he was probably their MVP,'' Sutter said. ``Tell me a guy
that's played like that under pressure, you're going to rattle him?
I don't think so.''  &QL; 
Speedy Marleau plays
</P>
<P>
   Coach Darryl Sutter opted for more speed in his lineup last
night. For the second consecutive game, he used 20-year-old center
Patrick Marleau. Marleau has been a bit of a head-case this year,
having found his way to Sutter's doghouse more than once.
</P>
<P>
   He finally played in Game 2 after being benched after his first
series of the second period in Game 2 against St. Louis when he was
a minus-2 in 3:31 and was beaten both times on the goals. But
Sutter wants more speed, so he again sat Ron Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more speed in our lineup,'' Sutter said. ``I think he
is capable of generating some offense and hopefully he can be sound
defensively.''  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Steve Shields is beginning to break his shaky reputation. He
made two game-saving stops in the second period. Richard Matvichuk
jumped out of the penalty box and received a pass. He was all alone
with only Shields to beat, but Shields blocked him low for the
save. Later, Mike Modano had a short-handed breakaway. He tried to
go five-hole, but Shields made the save to keep the Sharks alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks spent half of the second period on the power play,
scoring their first power-play goal and first goal of the series.
Mike Ricci redirected a Gary Suter shot from the high slot. It was
Ricci's fourth playoff goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks registered 19 shots on goal after two periods to
match their total output of Game 2. It bettered their Game 1 output
by one goal.

<P>
   Spring 1998: With Young and JaRon Rush firmly set on their
respective paths, Piggie focused his attentions in the spring of
1998 on Kareem Rush and Andre Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Piggie) stated that it was Williams' and Kareem Rush's year
and that he would take care of them like he took care of JaRon Rush
and Young,'' states the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing Williams said his client would have no
comment on the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that spring and summer, Piggie paid Kareem Rush $300
for playing in basketball tournaments and $200 for prom at Pembroke
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But after receiving $250 from Piggie, Williams had a change of
heart, and he and his uncle went to Grant and reported that Piggie
was paying players for basketball. Under the direction of an
investigator hired by Grant, Williams tape recorded conversations
with Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Grant then called Piggie in late June to confront him. Piggie
vigorously denied paying players, and Grant testified on April 17
of this year that Piggie then threatened him when he revealed he
had tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
   On a tape played at his bond hearing, Piggie said, ``If people
want to start a war with me, I can guarantee you I can start a war
and do it in a way that I don't care how much money people got.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant also told Piggie he was cutting off the severance
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Piggie collected thousands of dollars in the summer of
1998. In addition to the $50,000 Nike paid Piggie in the second
year of his consulting contract, Poston made payments totaling
$26,700 to Piggie, the indictment notes.
</P>
<P>
   Also that summer, Piggie paid for JaRon Rush to travel to
Houston to meet Poston and several of his clients, including
Anfernee Hardaway of the Orlando Magic, Charles Woodson of the
Oakland Raiders, Ty Law of the New England Patriots and Robert
Horry of the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, federal agents and prosecutors would be
reviewing the tapes made by Williams and information about Piggie
provided by Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe dealings
</P>
<P>
   Unaware of the emerging probe, Piggie soon would begin a scheme
that would threaten his most valuable economic asset, the Nike
contract, the indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Falsely describing himself as a Nike wholesaler, the indictment
alleges, Piggie negotiated a deal with Mark Tilford, the co-owner
of an interior design business, to sell basketball shoes to high
schools. Under the agreement, Tilford would contribute $6,000, and
Piggie would put up $7,000. They were to split equally the expected
$22,000 proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   After giving Piggie a cashiers check on Nov. 17, 1998, Tilford
waited for Piggie to deliver the shoes. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   Tilford soon learned why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myron didn't have the authority to resell Nike equipment,''
Tilford said in a court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   After making repeated unsuccessful attempts to get his money
back, Tilford threatened to report Piggie to Nike.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Piggie to arrange a meeting in late December 1998
at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Tilford testified, Piggie arrived with two large
associates and announced that unless Tilford signed an agreement
settling the dispute, Tilford would ``leave the restaurant
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   After a tense standoff, the restaurant owner intervened, and
Tilford left the restaurant unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Tilford testified that his phone calls to Nike prompted the
company to investigate. According to the indictment, Nike soon
canceled Piggie's contract.
1999
</P>
<P>
   Myron Piggie's life soon turned more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 18, 1998, he was arrested on a municipal charge of
carrying a concealed 9mm Smith &AMP; Wesson pistol after he was pulled
over for making an illegal U-turn.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest and subsequent guilty plea in August 1999 to the
municipal charge provides the basis for the least flexible federal
charge Piggie now faces: a single count of being a felon in
possession of a handgun, which carries a 10-year sentence upon
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, Piggie was clearly in the sights of federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1999, the first hints of the federal investigation
began to appear in the press, when UCLA sophomore JaRon Rush was
suspended for taking payments from Piggie and from a sports agent.
</P>
<P>
   The university sidelined Rush after he appeared before a grand
jury in Kansas City and after federal investigators visited the
school.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the NCAA suspended eight players _ including the
Rush brothers and Williams _ for taking improper benefits from
summer-league coaches or having contact with agents. The
association, facing a storm of criticism from players, coaches,
fans and commentators over its current regulations, also has
pledged to reform the ``culture'' of summer basketball with new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   No one predicts that the federal pursuit of Myron Piggie, alone,
will solve the problems that bedevil amateur basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaccaro, the adidas executive, thinks that if Piggie decides
to cooperate with investigators, the entire sport could be shaken:
``In my opinion, if the guy plea bargains, he'll bring the whole
pyramid down.''

STARS TAKE EARLY LEAD, BUT CAN'T HOLD IT

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Stars knew exactly what San Jose was
going to do last night. They remember Game 3 of their first-round
series against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   More noise than a monster truck rally. More animosity than a
Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Arena was all that, but the Stars caught their break
less than two minutes into the game when the Sharks' Mike Rathje
was sent to the penalty box for an obstruction tripping call.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 90 seconds later, Stars winger Brett Hull's
shot deflected off Sharks goalie Steve Shields' stick to Mike
Modano, who thrust the rebound past Shields for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars survived the first-period tempest but were swamped in
the second round en route to a 2-1 loss. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said that is the problem. His players were trying to weather the
storm, when they should've dived right into the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really disagree with that 100 percent; I hate that
statement; I can't stand it as a matter of fact,'' Hitchcock said
of weathering the storm. ``That's like standing up there saying to
Mike Tyson I am going to absorb body punches for the first three
rounds and I should be OK after that. ``You are dead. That's what
happened in Edmonton; you aren't weathering anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had said they felt they could take control if they
controlled the first 10 minutes. Well, they did, but they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scored their early goal and made it stand up
throughout the first period but faltered in the second period. The
once left-for-chum Sharks are suddenly back in a series, trailing,
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 10 minutes is huge,'' Stars winger Kirk Muller said.
``You can go as far as the first period. You try to be even or
better after the first. The biggest thing is to have a real solid
good road first period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars already knew what the possible outcome could be with a
flat first 20 minutes. Remember Game 3 at Edmonton in the first
round? The Oilers outshot the Stars, 22-7, scored two goals in the
first 10 minutes and another seven minutes late for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's first period went the Stars' way. Aside from
Modano's goal, goalie Ed Belfour and the Stars' defense deflated a
once vociferous crowd with yet another scoreless period _ No. 7 in
a row _ as Belfour stopped all 12 shots he faced. Two San Jose
power plays netted Stars winger Blake Sloan as many shots as the
Sharks had on the man-advantage: two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to put pressure on them and maybe they start taking
chances,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``Once you get in the
playoffs every first goal is the big part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   How big? Well, they were 6-0 heading into last night when they
scored first in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for the Stars, the formula isn't perfect.

EDITORIAL: REVOLT OF THE BUSINESS CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   The American political scene has always been enlivened by
protests. But there are not many parallels to the recent rebellion
among wealthy businesses tired of being hit up by Democrats and
Republicans for campaign donations. As Don Van Natta Jr. reported
in The Times this week, at least 31 corporations that have given
big soft-money contributions in recent election cycles appear to be
boycotting the process this year. Most are backing off quietly, but
a few have stepped forward to say that swearing off soft money has
not brought retaliation from the political establishment. Their
disgust with the excesses of fund-raising could be another impetus
to enactment of campaign finance reform this year.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and other
foes of the McCain-Feingold bill that would ban the unlimited
donations to political parties known as soft money never tired of
saying that this was an issue of little interest to American
voters. Then the reform cause was energized by Sen. John McCain's
primary campaign, and by a Democratic race in which Vice President
Al Gore declared that enactment of the soft-money ban would be one
of his highest priorities as president.
</P>
<P>
   Now business support for reform is growing. Sen. Mitch McConnell
has contended that businesses give money in order to
``participate'' in the political process, with no expectation of
anything in return. But business leaders from the Committee for
Economic Development and the Campaign for America, led by the
investor Jerome Kohlberg, have characterized the campaign finance
system as a shakedown operation. Many big businesses like General
Motors, Time Warner and Allied Signal have concluded that the money
they were spending on political contributions is better spent
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But of course many businesses and special interests still give
to get something in return for their donations. Philip Morris and
the National Rifle Association, two of the biggest givers to the
Republicans, have gotten politicians to oppose efforts to regulate
guns and tobacco. The question is whether the public wants big
questions like a patients' bill of rights, the creation of Social
Security investment accounts and policies on software,
telecommunications and Internet companies to be decided by who can
give the biggest donations to whom.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gov. George W. Bush has so far joined Lott as an
obstacle to reform. He says he favors a ban on corporation and
union contributions to parties, but he would leave open a wide
loophole by allowing unlimited donations to parties from
individuals. Like other opponents of reform, he calls it a free
speech issue. But Congress set limits on individual donations to
candidates in 1974 after the Watergate scandals, and the
legislation before Congress would simply extend those limits to
donations to parties, which have been used to undermine the old
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is to meet with the presumptive party nominee in a few
days to talk about issues. He needs to press Bush to support his
campaign finance legislation in the Senate, where it commands
majority support, and Bush ought to sign on to real reform.
Americans want it. Most in Congress want it. Now even the donors
want it. Bush and Lott should not stand in their way.

<P>
   1997: The cash for basketball increased in the spring and summer
of 1997. Now flush with a $40,000 annual salary from Grant and
travel money from Nike, Piggie took the '76ers to the best
tournaments in the country.
</P>
<P>
   From the April Boo Williams Invitational in Hampton, Va., to the
Michael Jordan Flight School in Santa Barbara, Calif., in August,
with stops in Indiana, Kansas, Georgia, Florida and the Las Vegas
Grand Finale in July, the '76ers cruised from coast to coast, with
some players collecting up to $1,000 per tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says that in total, from March, when JaRon Rush
was allegedly given money for competing in the Missouri State High
School basketball tournament, to July 30, Piggie paid Korleone
Young, JaRon Rush, Corey Maggette, Kareem Rush and Andre Williams
$6,450.
</P>
<P>
   ``These payments were made secretly to the players who were told
by (Piggie) to keep the payments confidential,'' the indictment
notes. ``Additionally, it was part of the scheme that (Piggie)
developed cover stories for the players to explain the payments in
the event the NCAA learned of their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Piggie's players were created equal, the indictment
suggests. At one tournament that summer, Maggette, a Duke
University prospect, collected $300, while JaRon Rush picked up
$150 and Kareem Rush $100.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``(Piggie) accorded preferential treatment to Young, JaRon
Rush and Maggette as opposed to the remainder of the team,'' the
indictment reads. ``Specifically (Piggie) provided these players
with extra tennis shoes and clothing, and took them to more
expensive restaurants for dinner than their teammates during
out-of-town tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment quotes Piggie as saying: ``They are Division 1
(caliber players) and the other guys are nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Maggette nor his agent returned calls from The Star
seeking comment on the indictment. Maggette told The Orlando
Sentinel recently that he received no payments from Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie's interest in Young was rooted in the player's potential
earnings as a professional, the indictment alleges. An example of
the payoff that could come Piggie's way had just occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In late June 1997, Tracy McGrady, a dazzling high school senior,
jumped directly to the NBA, bypassing college. In setting up a
six-year deal with adidas, McGrady agreed to split $300,000 a year
between his high school coach and a talent scout that discovered
him in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie was soon on the phone with the man who brokered McGrady's
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Star, adidas' Sonny Vaccaro said he
remembered a late June 1997 phone call in which he claims Piggie
expressed interest in structuring an endorsement deal that would
provide payments to him. Piggie offered to bring Young to adidas'
upcoming premier summer basketball camp to ``make an alliance''
with Vaccaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer was it's preposterous to talk about a junior in high
school at that point,'' Vaccaro said. ``I said no, there's no
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejected by adidas, Piggie took Young, JaRon Rush and Maggette
to Nike's invitation-only super camp, the All-American Camp in
Indianapolis. Scouts there rated Young as the camp's top power
forward, and speculation increased that Young would jump from high
school straight to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of camp, on July 10, Nike rewarded Piggie's
cultivation of basketball talent with a five-year, $50,000-a-year
consulting contract that included $15,000 a year for travel
expenses and $100,000 in Nike shoes and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Later in July, Piggie met with Raveling and Stanley in Las Vegas
to hash out Young's financial future. Within days of the Las Vegas
meeting, Stanley had made a $20,000 payment to Piggie, the
indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Piggie continued to make $100-a-week payments
to JaRon Rush, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   In a tape recording made last year and obtained by The Star,
Rush acknowledged the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me $100 a week...,'' he said. ``...I would go over
secretly to Myron Piggie's house so I could get money from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other payments to JaRon Rush during the fall allegedly include
$300 for Pembroke Hill's homecoming; $200 at Halloween; $150 for a
weekend trip to the University of Kansas; and $300 at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush also received about $1,000 during this period.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment notes Piggie delivered some of the payments
packed in Nike shoe boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush has acknowledged to The Star that he received money
from Piggie, though he disputed the amount alleged in the
indictment.
Late 1997, early 1998
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn of 1997, Grant and Piggie had a falling out. An
article in The Basketball Times focused on the recruiting blizzard
surrounding Rush, and painted Grant as a University of Kansas
booster who was pushing JaRon Rush to Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The article also detailed Piggie's felony conviction for selling
crack cocaine in the late 1980s and accused him of selling Nike
shoes that he was supposed to be giving away for free.
</P>
<P>
   Although Piggie vehemently denied the allegation, Grant had
second thoughts and told Piggie he would no longer sponsor the
'76ers. He gave him $16,100 in severance pay over the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Though Grant now regrets the relationship and denies strongly
that he was pushing Rush toward KU, he said recently that he agreed
to the severance arrangement because he thought Piggie needed the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a friend, and I liked him,'' Grant said. ``I didn't
want to leave him high and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other issues marked the fall of 1997: JaRon Rush wavered on
his announced intent to attend KU, and money began to flow again
from Stanley to Piggie after a three-month lull.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1997 through February 1998, while Rush publicly
dithered on his college choice, the payments from Stanley to Piggie
steadily poured in. Of the nine payments to Piggie, six _ totaling
$20,400 _ were made during these months, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Several came in close proximity to important moments in Rush's
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the recruiting whirlwind, Rush on Nov. 20 announced he
could not complete his letter of intent to Kansas because his
mother would not sign. He explained that she wanted him to consider
all his options.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 24, the indictment alleges, Stanley made a $6,000
payment to Piggie. On New Year's Eve, Stanley made another $6,000
payment.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the indictment alleges, Piggie gave Rush
``$5,000 in cash in an envelope at (Piggie's) residence...for the
lease of a 1998 Chevrolet Blazer on the condition that Rush not
accept a basketball scholarship to the University of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   In early February, Stanley made yet another $6,000 payment to
Piggie, and on Feb. 23 Rush announced he would accept a basketball
scholarship from UCLA. Four days later, Stanley made a $500 payment
to Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley recently has described the payments to Piggie as loans.
Prosecutors are skeptical. ``...No loan documentation exists to
substantiate this claim,'' the indictment reads.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley made his eighth payment _ $5,000 _ to Piggie on April 1,
1998, the indictment reads. On April 8, Rush formally signed his
letter of intent to attend UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that same day, Young announced he would bypass
college and apply for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment notes that Stanley quickly negotiated a $500,000
endorsement contract for Young with Nike.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment shows no provision in the contract for
payments to Piggie or to a nonprofit foundation he had created to
support his basketball program after Grant released him.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment notes that Piggie knew such payments were at
least a possibility. Piggie had met the year before at his home
with Detroit sports agent Kevin Poston to discuss such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Young's Nike deal and just three days after
Stanley made a final $4,000 payment to Piggie, Poston made a $5,000
payment to Piggie, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Young dropped Stanley and signed with Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Poston's luck with Young wasn't much better.
</P>
<P>
   Young soon washed out of the NBA and now plays on a minor league
team in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Poston did not return calls seeking comment.

INDICTMENT, TESTIMONY OUTLINE EVENTS LEADING TO SUMMER COACH'S
CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and KATIE FUNK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In late July 1997, a summer-league coach, a
shoe company consultant and a pro sports agent met over cigars in
Las Vegas to discuss the future of one of the best high school
basketball players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What the men were doing, according to a recent federal
indictment, was talking about how much money Wichita's Korleone
Young could make when he turned pro the next year and joined the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Young was one of the coach's stars on a team playing in the Las
Vegas Grand Finale basketball tournament, and the coach, Myron
Piggie of Kansas City, expected to receive a slice of his earnings
as a pro, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Using the 40-page indictment, court records and testimony, The
Kansas City Star has reconstructed events from the spring of 1995
through January 1999 that led to 11 fraud and tax counts against
Piggie. Piggie has denied doing anything improper and has pleaded
not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment, the culmination of a two-year federal
investigation by FBI and IRS agents, federal prosecutors identify
more than $400,000 in payments to Piggie from a sponsor, a shoe
company and two sports agents.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also drew on months of grand jury testimony
from players, sponsors, coaches and shoe company representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In unusual detail, the charges also recite more than 130
instances in which Piggie allegedly paid money to players in return
for their basketball skills and a piece of their professional
contracts should they make it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The money, which sometimes came in shoe boxes, also went for
proms, holiday gifts and, in one case, a sport-utility vehicle, the
indictment alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Most striking in the indictment is how the payments to the
players increased the further they progressed and the more notice
they received from college recruiters and sports agents.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the indictment provides one of the most penetrating
looks at the seeds of this season's basketball scandal, which saw
several big-time college players temporarily suspended for
accepting improper benefits before they were in college.
</P>
<P>
   If what is alleged in the indictment is true, it exposes what
many say are the most corrosive elements _ shoe company money,
free-spending sponsors, unscrupulous coaches and pro agents _
surrounding summer-league amateur basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the NCAA moved to curtail the ``unsavory influences''
of summer league basketball by sharply curtailing the ability of
coaches to recruit during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Such action was welcome news to Dan Schnell, president-elect of
the Missouri Basketball Coaches Association. ``I'm sure this has
gone on for years, but now it's gotten enormous and scary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas meeting was the high-water mark for Piggie.
According to the indictment, he was at the meeting because of his
cousin, Young. But also on Piggie's summer team were JaRon Rush,
Kareem Rush, Corey Maggette and Andre Williams. Observers said it
was the finest collection of high school hoopsters in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of weeks before, as coach of the ``dream team,''
Piggie had signed a five-year consulting contract with Nike Inc.
worth $425,000.
</P>
<P>
   George Raveling, a former college basketball coach and TV game
analyst, had become friends with Piggie and also was at the meeting
to discuss Young's future. Raveling is a Nike consultant and works
in the shoe company's summer league basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Stanley, a Los Angeles sports agent, was there because
Raveling had recommended him to Piggie. With Piggie's blessing,
Stanley hoped to become Young's agent. Over the next year, the
indictment says, Stanley paid Piggie $49,400.
</P>
<P>
   Though their names appear repeatedly in the indictment, Raveling
and Stanley were not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie's lawyer has declined to comment. Piggie himself is in
custody and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Raveling declined to comment for this article. In an interview
with The Star earlier this year, Raveling described his dealings
with Piggie as professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything with Mr. Piggie that I would regret,''
Raveling said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley in the past has denied doing anything improper. He also
declined to comment for this article.
1995 and 1996
</P>
<P>
   The indictment traces Myron Piggie's serious involvement in
summer league basketball back to 1995, two years before the Las
Vegas meeting. That's when Tom Grant, a Johnson County businessman
and chief executive officer of LabOne Inc., hired Piggie to coach a
summer league team he was sponsoring, the CMH '76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Grant had taken an interest in JaRon Rush as a child and was
paying his tuition at the Pembroke Hill School. Through his family,
Piggie also had known Rush for years.
</P>
<P>
   Grant agreed to pay Piggie a $10,000 salary and gave him $13,100
to assist at a Kansas City basketball camp.
</P>
<P>
   That summer Young and Rush, both high school sophomores, were
the key players on the '76ers. At a Los Angeles tournament, the
team came to the attention of a Nike executive.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1996, with Young and Rush now high school
juniors, Nike took formal notice of the team, and the company gave
Piggie $5,000 for the '76ers' travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Grant had bumped Piggie's coaching salary to
$37,260 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And here, the indictment says, Piggie's means of recruiting and
keeping players also changed _ he began paying them.
</P>
<P>
   That spring and summer, the indictment alleges, Piggie paid
Young $200 to $500 for each of nine tournaments he played in. When
Young broke his foot during one tournament, Piggie eased the pain
with $750.
</P>
<P>
   Total payments to Young in 1996 reached $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that Piggie made the payments ``to ensure
that Young remain loyal...and compensate (Piggie) after Young
received a professional contract.''
</P>
<P>
   With the same intention, the indictment alleges, Piggie made
$100-a-week payments to Rush from August through December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Young did not return several phone calls from The Star seeking
comment on the indictment. JaRon Rush declined to comment for this
article through his lawyer.

EDITORIAL: A NEEDLESS SHOWDOWN OVER VIEQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is preparing to evict dozens of
protesters camped at the Navy bombing range on Vieques, an island
off the coast of Puerto Rico. Instead of engaging in a fight now,
Washington should wait until Vieques residents decide in a vote
next year whether they want the Navy to continue to use the island.
If the Navy is welcome after the vote, protesters can then be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Navy training on Vieques has been suspended since April of last
year, when a civilian guard was killed in a bombing accident. After
months of angry protests by island residents, who are American
citizens, the Clinton administration reached an agreement with Gov.
Pedro Rosello of Puerto Rico in January.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement allows the Navy to resume training on the range
with inert bombs until a referendum is held next year so that the
island's 9,300 residents can choose between two options. They can
vote to end all Navy training by May 2003 or allow the Navy to stay
and resume its exercises, including the use of live bombs.
Washington has promised to give $40 million for economic
development on Vieques, provided that training resumes before the
vote. The island would receive $50 million more if the residents
voted to allow the Navy to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to resume training now with inert bombs, federal
law enforcement officers will have to remove the demonstrators.
Though Rosello has said he would support clearing the bombing
range, it is not apparent how that operation will be managed. There
is concern that it could result in violence or provoke more
protests elsewhere on Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   A more prudent course would be for the Navy to hold off on
training until the Vieques residents vote. The Navy insists it
cannot conduct combined combat exercises anywhere in the Western
Atlantic but Vieques. But a presidential panel recommended last
year that the Navy leave the island in five years, suggesting that
alternatives can be found. It is time the Navy left Vieques, unless
the islanders affirmatively choose otherwise.

LEGAL OBSERVERS SAY KEY TO CASE MAY BE GUN ALLEGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS and KATIE FUNK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Take your eye off the ball, legal observers
say.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the government's elaborate basketball fraud
case against former Kansas City summer league coach Myron Piggie is
an immense glittering distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hammer'' in this case, as criminal defense lawyers call
it, is the gun charge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 11 conspiracy, fraud and tax counts in the
basketball case, Piggie faces a single federal charge of being a
felon in possession of a handgun. Such charges make up about 30
percent of the most recent criminal charges filed in the U.S.
Western District of Missouri. Because the elements of the crime are
simple _ you're a felon; you got a gun; you're guilty _ it's an
almost impossible charge to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like shooting fish in a barrel,'' said Kansas City
criminal defense attorney John P. O'Connor. ``He's looking at a
mandatory 10 years in prison without parole.''
</P>
<P>
   And when combined with another case, such as the basketball
fraud counts, a felon in possession case can give federal
prosecutors a powerful advantage to encourage a plea bargain and
require subsequent cooperation in an ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Only then will the intricate, and more scholarly, defense
arguments get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe Howard, a University of Kansas criminal law professor,
said prosecutors won't be shy about applying that advantage.
Already, he noted, prosecutors have succeeded in having Piggie
denied bail. Unless a district judge overrules the magistrate who
denied bond, Piggie will remain in jail until his June trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives him a taste of his life for the next decade,''
Howard said. In that situation, ``you ask, why am I doing this?
What do I owe these people? What do I owe myself?''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people'' are other possible co-conspirators. By charging
Piggie with conspiracy, prosecutors believe other people
participated in the alleged fraud. And Piggie may have information
that could lead prosecutors to other alleged conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want you to think we're done fleshing out the
conspiracy,'' U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said in announcing
the charges against Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a nutshell, is the government's theory of what
prosecutors think was illegal about Piggie's actions:
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal indictment charging Piggie with 11
counts of conspiracy, fraud and tax violations, Piggie paid money
to five summer-league players while they were still in high school.
With the exception of Korleone Young, each of the other players was
recruited and played basketball at a federally funded, member
university of the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the scholarship contract between schools and
athletes, athletes must sign a statement certifying they have not
received money or benefits because of their athletic talents.
</P>
<P>
   If athletes who received money sign the statement, and the NCAA
or the school finds out about it after the athletes have competed
in NCAA events, the school could be penalized. Schools have been
forced to forfeit games in which the inelgible athlete played.
Schools also have forfeited money received from the NCAA or funds
given by athletic conferences for participating in NCAA events.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that by paying players who intended to
accept scholarships, Piggie and unnamed conspirators defrauded
federally funded universities of their right to offer valuable
scholarships to eligible athletes.

EDITORIAL: FIRE STANDARDS FOR CIGARETTES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Legislature has passed an important bill that
would make the state the first to require the tobacco industry to
make cigarettes sold within its borders more resistant to starting
fires. Gov. George Pataki should sign the bill when it arrives on
his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was approved unanimously in both the
Assembly and Senate, would require that by 2002 cigarettes meet a
fire safety standard set by the state's Office of Fire Prevention
and Control. Under the measure, cigarettes would have to be
self-extinguishing within a certain time after a smoker stops
puffing on the cigarette. The technology for such products is
readily available. Tobacco companies have the ability to make less
flammable cigarettes by altering the cigarette paper to slow down
the rate at which it burns. Some cigarette brands already on the
market would probably meet fire safety criteria without any change.
</P>
<P>
   This proposal has strong support from anti-smoking advocates,
firefighters and consumer groups. Lighted cigarettes dropped on a
bed or couch are the leading cause of fire-related deaths in New
York, causing nearly 50 deaths a year. But the tobacco industry has
fought sensible regulations on the grounds that there should be a
single national safety standard.
</P>
<P>
   The New York bill provides that it will not take effect if a
federal standard is created by April 2001. But the reality is that
Congress has done nothing on this issue and probably will not until
states take the lead. If the bill becomes law with Pataki's
approval, other states will probably follow New York's example.
That will give Congress impetus to establish a national standard
for less flammable cigarettes that could save hundreds of lives a
year.

EDITORIAL: THE CHANGING FACE OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, May 3:
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward combating international terrorism is to
identify the places from which it springs, and the latest State
Department report properly points to South Asia as a new hub of
activity. Pakistan and the rigidly Islamist Taliban movement that
dominates Afghanistan are providing safe haven and support for the
loose networks of individuals and groups that seem to be replacing
states as the primary source of global terror. The challenge for
the United States and its allies is to devise a combination of
diplomatic and economic pressure that will induce the leaders of
Pakistan and Afghanistan to join the fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Washington cannot rely on methods that have helped to reduce
terrorist threats elsewhere. In South Asia, unlike the Middle East,
peacemaking does not offer the prospect of ameliorating underlying
inequities that fuel terrorism. The conflicts of South Asia,
especially the tensions between India and Pakistan and the
confrontation between them in Kashmir, are not the primary source
of inspiration or support for the international terrorist groups
that are based in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist problem in South Asia involves privately sponsored
groups motivated less by political grievances than by religion and
ideology, which are not amenable to negotiation. The most notorious
of these organizations is led by Osama bin Laden, the fugitive
Saudi-born financier suspected of masterminding the 1998 bombings
of two American embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200
people. Bin Laden remains at large in Afghanistan, sheltered by the
Taliban, which he supports financially. He also leads a militia
with thousands of fundamentalist fighters that defends the Taliban
against northern Afghan insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has already imposed some sanctions on both the
Taliban and Pakistan, and it does not recognize the Taliban's
harshly repressive regime. Pakistan is a key source of support for
the Taliban, providing arms, food, fuel and, not least, thousands
of volunteers for its fighting forces. But Washington, concerned
about Pakistan's economic stability, has refrained thus far from
placing Pakistan on the list of states that sponsor terror, which
would cut off aid, loans and credit from Washington and
international lending institutions. If Pakistan's military ruler,
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, fails to reduce his country's links to the
Taliban, Washington will have to consider stronger measures.

   YOUNG-SUICIDES (East Haddam, Conn.) _ In the hours before they

   TV-TEENS (Hollywood) _ For decades on television shows about
teen-agers, sex was unmentioned, divorced parents were out of the

seemed frozen in time. The biggest issues facing television
teenagers of the '50s, '60s and '70s seemed to be borrowing the
family car or finding a date for the prom. And then came the Fox
shows ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which is making its television
finale on May 17 after 10 years, and ``Party of Five,'' whose last
episode will be seen Wednesday night. Though the characters on
these two shows could not be more dissimilar, the two programs have

GANNETT CO. NAMES NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gannett Co., the nation's largest newspaper publisher, said
on Tuesday that John J. Curley would step down as chief executive
in June, and named Douglas H. McCorkindale, who has been the
company's president since 1997, as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Curley, who is 61, will remain chairman until he retires next
year. At that time McCorkindale, who is 60, will assume the
chairman's title.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are longtime Gannett executives. Curley joined the
company in 1969; McCorkindale, two years after that. Since the men
are nearly the same age, Wall Street analysts said Curley's
decision to step down represented the start of a transition to the
next generation of leadership at Gannett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised at the timing, but when you think about
it, it probably makes some sense,'' said Douglas M. Arthur, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curley and McCorkindale are so dominant that investors have
not been thinking about who the next generation of leaders will be.
With Curley retiring soon, McCorkindale gets his day in the sun.
And it gives younger players a chance to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and others identified Tom Curley, publisher and president
of Gannett's USA Today, and Gary Watson, who heads the company's
newspaper division, as likely candidates for the top jobs in the
post-McCorkindale era.
</P>
<P>
   ``For both to leave in one fell swoop would have been too
disruptive,'' said Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have now is a transition that is ongoing. Over the
next couple of years you will see other executives groomed for the
top jobs. When McCorkindale decides to leave will depend a bit on
how comfortable he is that the next generation of management is
ready to run the shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Curley, 51, is the younger brother of the outgoing chief
executive. Watson is 54.
</P>
<P>
   Curley announced his decision to step down at the company's
annual meeting. He was named chief executive in 1986 and has been
chairman and chief executive since April 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He gave no reason for his decision to step down. But in a
statement he said he intended ``to do what I want to do when I want
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkindale was named president in September 1997. A lawyer, he
joined Gannett as general counsel and secretary. He was named chief
financial officer in 1984, chief administrative officer in 1986 and
vice chairman in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time in Gannett's history that an executive with
no newsroom experience has been selected as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Curley, who succeeded Allen H. Neuharth, joined Gannett as an
editor in Rochester after working for The Associated Press in New
York and New Jersey and for newspapers in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug McCorkindale and I have worked together for almost 30
years,'' Curley said in his statement. ``I am extremely confident
Gannett will continue to prosper under his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Curley picked a good time to leave because Gannett
is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is in great shape,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``USA Today has been gushing with
double-digit top-line growth, the newspaper group excluding USA
Today has been generating advertising revenue growth with some of
the highest margins in the industry, and their broadcasting
operations are in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday was not one of Gannett's best days on Wall
Street. In a tough day for newspaper stocks, Gannett's stock closed
at $62.5625, down $1.1875.

WAKE UP AND SMELL A HORSE TRADE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Memo to whoever supplies coffee to the Examiner's
top brass: No more decaf!
<P>
   Examiner Editor and Publisher Tim White testified Monday that he
offered to do a little ``horse trading'' with Mayor Willie Brown
last August _ the Examiner's editorial support for Brown in return
for Willie's help in greasing the sale of The Chronicle to the
Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it sounds ghastly, but White later explained that he
didn't really offer to sell his newspaper's soul. It just came out
wrong in court because: ``I was tired and confused by the
question.''
</P>
<P>
   White must have been tired and confused after that lunch, too,
when he fired off an e-mail to his boss outlining the horse trade.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hearst bosses must have been tired and confused when
they didn't respond to that e-mail by doing what they did Tuesday _
suspending White (replacing him with George Irish, president of
Hearst Newspapers).
</P>
<P>
   It was the right move, if eight months late. Maybe the coffee
just kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein was at that power
lunch, and since Bronstein has always stood for honest journalism,
we'll assume he was either tired and confused, or was busy feeding
quarters to the jukebox when the horse deal came up.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Phil would have given White a subtle sign, like a
right cross to the jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ZIPPER ACCIDENTS. That could be one of many unfortunate
consequences of the new trend in wireless e-mail devices such as
the BlackBerry.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported that these handheld e-mail
gizmos are the big thing. One man e-mailed relatives while his wife
was giving birth. In the men's room of a restaurant, one man was
punching his BlackBerry while standing at the urinal.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moose fights the good anti-cell fight at his North Beach
restaurant, but he fears the BlackBerry. ``I don't think we can
station monitors at the urinals,'' Ed sighs.
</P>
<P>
   NO, WINE FANS do not call themselves cork sniffers.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an official name for people who really really enjoy
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Care to guess? Is it grape nuts? Vino weenies?
</P>
<P>
   According to Andrew Fulton and Chuck Victory, the affectionate
term is: Cork dorks.
</P>
<P>
   BARRY BONDS' home-run trot is so slow that if you're in the back
of the beer line when Barry bombs one, by the time he toe-taps home
plate, you've got your brewski.
</P>
<P>
   That's style.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Barry was the first guy to hit a ball into
the Bay Monday night. And it's not like Bonds was forcing the
issue. Two days earlier, he gave the Giants their first win in the
new ball yard by hitting a homer to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the suggestion has been popping up that the Giants
trade Barry. But if you're charging arms and legs for beers and hot
dogs, you better give the fans a Barry Bonds kinda guy.
</P>
<P>
   The man's so cool he's even got his own navy, that scraggly
fleet of vessels that lurks in McCovey Cove every game, waiting for
homers. Barry's Boats.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN MAIL: California's branch of the U.S. Postal Service will
soon be buying electricity for 1,103 post offices from San Jose's
Go-Green.com. The juice comes from 100 percent renewable sources,
like wind and sun.
</P>
<P>
   And 500 all-electric postal putt-putts are on order.
</P>
<P>
   If only the post office could develop a steam vehicle powered by
burning junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S TEEMING with giant flying cockroaches, is the San Francisco
Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of using a pesticide, a team of hungry gecko lizards
has been unleashed to snack on the roaches.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea, except: ``Somebody is not reading their history,''
says Paul Jaqua. ``Some 25 years ago, the New York Housing
Authority got the same idea. One catch: Rats love geckos,
dinnerwise.''
</P>
<P>
   So pretty soon, the flower people are going to need an army of
cats to control the rats, then wolves to thin the herd of cats,
then ... Eventually we'll have to bring back the dinosaur. Them
roaches are pesky.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD FOR the new millennium:
</P>
<P>
   Ken Holford checked the expiration date on his Swanson Hungry
Man frozen dinner: May 01 02070.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that not only is the Boneless Pork Rib Shaped Patty
good for 70 more years, but with a five-digit year stamped on the
box, it also looks like Swanson is developing a TV dinner that will
be good well into year 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   BRING BACK the good old words.
</P>
<P>
   Like  &UR; kine.  &LR; A recent column about an artist whose paintings
were nixed by a hotel because they showed cows in ``provocative''
poses, was headlined, ``Art is fine, but not the sexy kine.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to look it up. Kine is the archaic plural of cow.
</P>
<P>
   On the radio someone used the word  &UR; ganch.  &LR; It means to execute
or kill by impaling on stakes or hooks. George W. Bush hasn't said
whether or not he supports ganching.
</P>
<P>
   These are good words to know, and to use if you want to turn a
readable column into crinkum-crankum _ ``something full of twists
and turns, or a thing fancifully or excessively intricate or
elaborate.''
</P>
<P>
   SAUNTERING in the Big Apple, Noel Hartzell overheard a
conversation between a male model and a ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   The model was saying he had been jilted by his boyfriend, but
was coping, with the help of an antidepressant. His doctor
prescribed the pills because, ``You know, therapy is a major time
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballerina nodded sympathetically.

JONAH JONES, 91, A MASTER JAZZ TRUMPETER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonah Jones, a jazz trumpeter who played with some of
the great swing bands and sold a million copies of his versions of
``On the Street Where You Live'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and
Beads,'' died on Sunday. He was 91 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was born in Louisville, Ky., learned to play the
trumpet in a community center where he played church music. The day
he heard a Louis Armstrong record, he said, his life was changed.
While still in Louisville, he performed with local bands like
Tinsley's Royal Aces and Perdue's Pirates; in 1928 he was hired by
the band leader Horace Henderson and worked in the Midwest for a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 he moved north and joined the violinist Stuff Smith's
sextet. He continued changing jobs, appearing with McKinney's
Cotton Pickers and Lil Armstrong, Louis Armstrong's wife, among
other band leaders. But his first big break came in 1936, with a
four-year residency at the Onyx Club secured by Stuff Smith. The
band, featuring Smith on electrified violin, was popular, salting
its vivid playing with slapstick humor.
</P>
<P>
   After working briefly with Benny Carter and Fletcher Henderson,
Jones became a longtime member of Cab Calloway's group, from 1941
to 1952, seeing the band through its reduction from a big band to a
septet to a quartet. (Calloway was an appreciative boss: he
recorded a song celebrating Jones' arrival called ``Jonah Joins the
Cab.'')
</P>
<P>
   He staged a midcareer resurgence in the 50's by putting a mute
in his horn and familiar pop melodies in his hands. In 1952 Jones
received an offer from the pianist Joe Bushkin to fill in at the
Embers, one of New York's 52nd Street jazz clubs. Jones agreed to
put a mute in his horn; this quieter sound was what his predecessor
in the band, Buck Clayton, had adopted, and it was what the
restaurant preferred. Jones, whose resume included stints with the
society band leaders Lester Lanin and Meyer Davis, wasn't
particularly fazed. Despite the fact that his regular style was
open, forceful and swinging in the Louis Armstrong vein, he knew
how to play softly too.
</P>
<P>
   He was invited back to play at the Embers with his own quartet
in 1955, and the same restrictions of volume applied. Occasionally
Jones was tempted to take the mute out of his horn. ``People would
say, `Jonah, just play one chorus open,''' Jones told John S.
Wilson of The New York Times in 1983. ``One night, Joe Howard, the
maitre d', who had warned me to keep the mute in, was busy, and I
thought he wasn't listening, so I played one chorus open.
Afterward, when I came off the stand, Joe told me that if I took
the mute out again I should just forget the address of the club.''
</P>
<P>
   The trumpeter Jimmy Owens recalled: ``The essence of his style
was to swing. His whole thing was to communicate, and that's why he
stuck with the melodies. He always said of himself that he was not
a chord player, like Dizzy Gillespie and Roy Eldridge and Charlie
Shavers; he was more of a melody player.''
</P>
<P>
   What started as a once-weekly job led to a week's engagement,
which finally led to a five-year contract, in which Jones played at
the club 20 weeks a year. He also began to sing during his
performances of this period. The Embers became Jones' home base for
the next decade, and he began to make records that further refined
this sound, which verged on easy listening. His recordings of show
tunes were extremely successful, and he won a Grammy in 1959 for
the album ``I Dig Chicks.''.
</P>
<P>
   Touring and recording through the 80s, Jones finally retired
from performing in 1993. His final public performance was at the
Blue Note in Greenwich Village in November, when he sang during a
benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three children, Shirley Redmond of Manhattan,
Lawrence Jones of the Bronx and William Jones of Cleveland; and two
grandchildren.

 LATINO VOTE ON AGENDA AS BUSH RETURNS TO STATE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush will arrive in
California Wednesday for a flurry of fund raising and political
campaigning intended to stress education and outreach to Latino
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's visit marks his second to the state in the weeks since
the March 7 primary, and his supporters say the trip indicates that
the Republican presidential hopeful will wrestle with Vice
President Al Gore for support of the nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race in California is a race we can win,'' said Gerry
Parsky, who co-chairs the Bush campaign in California. Parsky said
Republicans are buoyed by Bush's commitment to return to California
frequently, to raise money for the state GOP and to continue to
push for the critical Latino voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrives in Palm Springs this afternoon for a private
fund-raiser for the Republican National Committee and the
California Republican Party at the estate of Walter Annenberg.
</P>
<P>
   He will travel to Orange County, where he will mark National
Prayer Day by attending a morning Catholic Mass at Mission San Juan
Capistrano Thursday. Later, he is expected to attend an event at a
Mission Viejo charter school to stress education, another lead
issue in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has scheduled another fund raiser tomorrow at the Los
Angeles home of investment banker Brad Freeman, who heads Bush's
state finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the governor will be in San Diego to mark Cinco de
Mayo by attending a breakfast where he'll push for Latino votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's California trip comes on the heels of a new Field Poll
that indicates that virtually all the growth in the state voter
rolls in the past last  &LR; decade _ 1 million new voters _ is Latino,
and that Democrats will largely benefit from the change.
</P>
<P>
   But both the governor's national and California campaign staffs
say the repeated emphasis on attracting Latino voters in the state
_ a theme in all his recent California state  &LR; visits _ will
continue through November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not conceding any vote to the Democrats,'' Mindy Tucker,
spokeswoman for Bush's campaign, said Tuesday. ``Governor Bush was
able to earn the vote of 49 percent of the (Latino) vote here in
Texas ... and we feel confidence he will continue to earn the vote
(in California).''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Goodman, a Bush supporter and Republican consultant in
Sacramento, said Bush has taken ``a unique Republican approach'' to
winning the Latino vote in California, where he has chosen to make
major policy addresses on issues such as like  &LR; education to Latino
groups in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to great lengths to say, `Welcome to my house'
because he believes they are a dynamic (voter) group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats supporting Gore say Bush's campaign efforts in
California are little more than window dressing because, they
argue, on issues such as abortion, guns and the environment, he
can't win in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even surgery can't take the Proposition 187 tattoo off Bush's
head,'' said Bob Mulholland, the Democratic campaign adviser. He
said the Republican Party's support of the controversial
anti-illegal immigration measure, which alienated many Latinos,
will continue to haunt Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president, talking about crime, health care and
protecting Social Security, is communicating powerful messages to
the people,'' said Mulholland.

JIM ROGERS, 84, RANCHER AND SON OF THE HUMORIST WILL ROGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Rogers, a horse and cattle rancher who was the last
surviving child of the cowboy humorist Will Rogers, died on Friday
at his home in Bakersfield, Calif. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was also a consultant to three memorials to his father:
the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Okla.; the ranch
where his father was born, near Oologah, Okla.; and the Will Rogers
State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As a child the younger Rogers performed in three of his father's
films. He also appeared in three Hopalong Cassidy westerns, made
Army training films and was in three cowboy comedy movies produced
by Hal Roach Jr.
</P>
<P>
   For a time he ran the family-owned newspaper, The Beverly Hills
Citizen, with his brother Will Rogers Jr., and he was a skilled
polo player.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York, the third son and last child of Will
Rogers and his wife, Betty. The family moved in 1919 to Southern
California, where Jim Rogers attended Pomona College. He left
school in 1935 after his father and Wiley Post were killed in a
plane crash in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Will Rogers Jr. died in 1993; his sister, Mary, died
in 1989; and his brother Fred died in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was married for 50 years to Astrea Kemmler Rogers, who
died in 1987. He is survived by his second wife, Judith Braun; two
sons, James Kemmler Rogers of Nashville and Charles Edward Rogers
of Cave Creek, Ariz.; a daughter, Astrea Elizabeth Rogers Brandon
of Chowchilla, Calif.; six grandchildren; and 11
great-grandchildren.

STATE BUDGET SURPLUS NOW BETWEEN $11 AND $13 BILLION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ State budget writers learned Tuesday that they
will have a windfall of between $11 billion and $13 billion to
spend in the next budget year _ nearly double the amount expected
last week.
<P>
   But as the Senate prepares to approve a nearly $90 billion
spending plan Thursday instead of making the job easier the record
``surplus'' could spell friction between the more tight-fisted Gov.
Gray Davis and his more liberal fellow Democrats who control both
houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats give cities and counties $1.5 billion for
housing transportation and general expenses. Davis offers $200
million, all in grants to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate budget also gives public schools $1 billion more than
Davis although the Democratic governor has promised schools more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposed $20 million to continue a pilot mental health
program for a full year. Senate Democrats pour $200 million into a
variety of mental health efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be asking a lot but there should be sufficient funding
to do the things on the governor's agenda and on ours,'' said Sen.
Hilda Solis, D-Los Angeles, who coordinated the Senate's work on
health and welfare programs. ``We're giving major relief to
constituencies that have not seen any kind of relief in the last 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   As reported last week in The Chronicle, tax revenue has been so
strong this year, the state has already taken in nearly $5 billion
more than expected in just the first months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill told the Senate budget
committee Tuesday that the state will take in between $5.5 billion
and $6 billion by June 30, the end of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state already has a budget for this fiscal year, the
$5 billion won't be spent until the next fiscal year, which Begins
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the higher-than-anticipated cash comes from more
Californians having jobs and more of them moving into higher income
brackets, a trend that will lead to at least another $5.5 billion
in additional revenues during the next fiscal year, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   That could climb to $7 billion if the amount of capital gains
increase by 10 percent, which they have in recent years, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen anything like this since the 1970s,'' said
Hill in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' Department of Finance agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature for us to make an official forecast but if
revenues continue the way they have we are going to be in that
ballpark,'' said Sandy Harrison, a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   The fight between Davis and lawmakers will be how to spend the
money. The Decmorats who control the Legislature believe much of
the new money should be spent to expand health and welfare programs
which saw reductions or little growth during the eight years of
Pete Wilson, Davis' GOP predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Solis said her health and welfare budget subcommittee spent $800
million more in those areas than Davis proposed in his January
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has yet to agree to those spending increases and, looking
his budget record last year, may never do so.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year in office Davis has been more inclined to
earmark money for one-time expenditures, like transit or public
works projects, than expand the state's ongoing financial stake in
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   He also socked away more than $2.4 billion in a reserve account
for emergencies and another $500 million in an account to pay off
any pending lawsuits the state loses.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor has, however, already said how he would
spend some of the new money rolling into state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   A $5 billion transportation plan he unveiled in April will cost
$1.2 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in state park day-use and camping fees costs another $30
million. He also agreed to an expansion of the state's Cal Grant
college scholarship program sought by lawmakers at a cost of $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   He has also promised to give public schools more money generally
and more money that can't spent on district priorities as opposed
to programs imposed on schools by the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has said education is his first, second and third
spending priorities and I'm confident this budget is going to
reflect that,'' said Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-San Luis Obispo, chair
of the Senate's education budget subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Like Solis, O'Connell spent more on public schools than Davis
proposed in January, including $1 billion schools can spend as they
wish and $175 million to increase starting teacher salaries above
the state average of $32,500.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will outline his new spending priorities on May 15, when
he revises the budget he proposed in January with the new revenue
figures.

NOLAN, SHIELDS END SWEEP TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Talk about a sudden reversal of substance,
form and poise. After one period here last night, the Stars
appeared to be showing their Stanley Cup savvy to the wide-eyed San
Jose Sharks. The series looked sweepable. Who would be next?
Avalanche or Red Wings?
</P>
<P>
   After two periods, all of the above was null and void.
</P>
<P>
   And after 60 minutes, well, buckle up and buckle down. There
will be a Game 5 back at Reunion Arena, and if last night was any
indication of where this series is headed, be prepared for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in playoff hockey beats grit, unless it's goaltending.
Over the final two periods of Game 3, and particularly the middle
20 minutes, the Sharks welcomed back Owen Nolan, and with him came
the grit. And then, out of nowhere, there was Steve Shields, who
became the best goalie on the ice in this one. No way that's
supposed to happen, right, Eddie?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mr. Belfour wasn't so bad himself. It's just that for
the final 40 minutes last night, he wasn't Shields. In the end,
that's why the Sharks are breathing fire again after a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars can blame several items for what happened in the
second period, when both San Jose goals were scored. They can also
give an Oscar to Shields for an acting job that drew a critical
goalie-interference call on Blake Sloan, setting up a 5-on-3 power
play.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, the Stars can blame themselves. Taking the
smart penalties is one thing, particularly with the best kill unit
in the NHL. But eight penalties in the second period? It was
overkill and it changed the course of a game the Stars totally
controlled in what was supposed to be the telltale first period.
</P>
<P>
   That Sloan penalty on Shields was questionable to say the least,
but the referees were leaning on their whistles at that point, and
the 5-on-3 allowed the Sharks to finally break the Belfour shutout
spell. Mike Ricci delivered from the point on the two-man advantage
at 5:42 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a beauty from Nolan, who was not supposed to play
after missing Game 2 with a variety of injuries. But he's the guy
who sets both the physical and scoring tone for the Sharks, and
this was the game of the season for San Jose. Nolan played, and
scored what turned out to be the game-winner on a sliding tip of
the puck past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, however, made the win happen. Gifted with a lead, he
wouldn't budge. Late in the second period, Shields stuffed Mike
Modano on a short-handed breakaway when Modano tried to go
five-hole. Minutes earlier, Richard Matvichuk had also found
himself on a breakaway after leaving the penalty box. Again,
Shields answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were all over Shields in the third period. But there
was nothing. Speaking of a scoring slump _ the Stars have two goals
in the past two games. And Shields is supposed to be beatable. Ask
anybody except St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The series lead is still 2-1 for Dallas, but a shaky 2-1 after
last night, and after Shields' work for two consecutive games.
Friday night will be interesting here in the Shark Tank.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny, but the first period last night was about
expectations becoming reality.
</P>
<P>
   The easy guess said San Jose would open the game desperate and
daring, fueled by a 2-0 series deficit and an on-edge, supportive
crowd that piled into San Jose Arena refusing to believe the Stars'
dominance could stretch across two time zones.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the constant ``Bell-Four Thing,''
which is something about Eddie once making this city feel inferior,
the same as neighboring San Francisco has always done. San Jose
civic pride is at stake _ these people must try to rattle Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   So the Sharks started Game 3 with their best push of the series.
They put 12 shots on Belfour in the first 20 minutes, which was
massive improvement for a team with 37 shots total in two games.
But when all the fire and fury had cleared, San Jose had been
outplayed, out-skilled and remained on the outside looking in when
it came to putting the first dent in Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano blistered home a power-play goal just 3/12 minutes
into the game, and the crowd suddenly became docile, as did the
Sharks. One thing about Shields _ he gives up a rebound or two or
ten. On the Modano goal, Shields stopped a Brett Hull shot from a
severe angle, but the puck went off his stick into the slot. Modano
was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, it was 20 minutes of perfection for the
Stars. Man, did the evening start off right, or what? Except the
first period didn't start to tell the story of Game 3. In fact, a
big change was coming. Nolan made that change happen. And so
certainly did Shields by doing a ``Bell-four'' impersonation that
on this evening was better than the original.

 FOREST SERVICE TO RELEASE SIERRA LOGGING OPTIONS FOR REVIEW  &HT;     By GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service will release several possible plans for
logging on the 11 national forests in the Sierra Nevada this week,
and all of them are sure to engender intense controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Both environmental and commercial forestry groups have already
expressed dissatisfaction with the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited draft environmental impact statement for the
forests of California's primary mountain range will explore eight
different options for regulating logging, ranging from maintaining
cuts at current levels to dramatically reducing them to protect
endangered species such as the California spotted owl and the
Pacific fisher, a large weasel-like predator. Both creatures favor
old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service has designated two of the options as
``preferred alternatives.'' One would authorize cutting 351 million
board feet of timber annually for the next five years, up from the
most recent available figures, 337 million board feet that were
logged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The second preferred alternative would reduce the annual cut
significantly, to 141 million board feet.
</P>
<P>
   The average home utilizes 10,000 to 15,000 board feet of lumber.
</P>
<P>
   The current Forest Service plan calls for cutting 571 million
board feet annually, but that target has not been reached because a
controversial pilot logging project _ known as the Quincy Library
Group Plan for the Plumas National Forest, the Lassen National
Forest and part of the Tahoe National Forest _ has not yet been
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   After five years _ when the Quincy Library Group Plan has
expired _ the first alternative would authorize the annual logging
of 190 million board feet, while the second would allow 72 million
board feet.
</P>
<P>
   Current plans call for the yearly cutting of 414 million board
feet for 2005 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists quickly condemned the preferred alternatives,
particularly the one that called for the larger cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big disappointment,'' said Scott Hoffman Black, the
campaign director of the Sierra Nevada Forest Protection Campaign,
a coalition of 80 environmental, science and religious
organizations favoring rigorous logging controls in the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're about to embark on a course that represents a step
backward,'' said Black. ``We believe it will hasten the decline of
Sierra wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Alford, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, said logging in
the Sierra's national forests causes irreparable environmental
damage and is particularly devastating to species that depend on
old-growth timber for survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California spotted owl is declining at 7 to 10 percent a
year, and other species such as fisher, pine marten, red-legged
frog and yellow-legged frog are also threatened,'' Alford said.
``With the Quincy project, the current plan would take 571 million
board feet a year. It's impossible to sustain those levels without
harming critical habitats.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford said the Sierra forests are ``a sinking boat. The
(preferred alternative that would allow the most cutting) is a
timid effort to bail water and not plug the boat. The (second
preferred alternative) still results in a leaky ship, but at least
it patches some holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Nance, the vice president of public affairs for the
California Forestry Association, is also unhappy with the forest
service's proposals _ but for opposite reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks more, not fewer, trees should be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the options address the threat of catastrophic
wildfire in the Sierra forests,'' Nance said. ``The preferred
alternative (with the higher figures) would reduce the threat of
wildfire only by 10 percent over a 30 year period. The second would
actually increase wildfire danger. There is 2 billion board feet of
growth in the 11 Sierra forests each year. Three times as many
trees are dying as are harvested. We need to employ timber
harvesting and prescribed fires to sustain forest health.''
</P>
<P>
   Alford agreed with Nance that using controlled fire would reduce
litter and brush, kill destructive insects and generally improve
the health of the forests, but said logging causes more problems
than it solves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A congressionally mandated study conducted by the University
of California at Davis concluded that logging has led to an
increase in wildfire severity, because tree removal increases brush
and slash (dead branches and trees),'' Alford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative (with the lower cut) is more cautious in its
approach, but we have to think about what the forests will
ultimately look like in 50 years,'' said the Forest Service's Brad
Powell, who oversees national forestlands in California, part of
Nevada and U.S. islands in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the latest science on species management for these
scenarios,'' said Powell. ``The final solution will be crafted from
the best of all the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said one thing is certain: Commercial logging and
thinning `'will be a key ingredient'' in managing the forests of
the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The draft Environmental Impact Statement will be published in
the Federal Register Friday. A 90-day public comment period will
follow. The Forest Service will then analyze the comments, and
issue a final decision later this year.

YANKEES DEFEAT INDIANS, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There was heavy editing to the first lineup card
posted by the Yankees' hitting coach, Chris Chambliss, on Tuesday
night. It was covered with black blotches, the names and
accompanying positions obliterated and then revised.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch was out with a sprained wrist, and the new
leadoff hitter had a batting average of .170 _ but Ricky Ledee hit
a home run, his first of the season. The new second baseman, Wilson
Delgado, ripped a two-run double. The catcher, Chris Turner, played
in his first game for the Yankees, hit an important double and
guided Andy Pettitte through most of the 4-2 victory against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to matter who plays for the Yankees these days.
They are getting strong starting pitching and strong relief and
scraping together enough offense, and their 17-8 record is the
American League's best. The Yankees have won 23 of 32
regular-season games in Jacobs Field, this victory coming with a
makeshift lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch was scratched from the starting lineup because of his
sprained left wrist, and unless he feels markedly better Friday, he
will probably be placed on the 15-day disabled list. Delgado
started at second base, in the 67th game of his major league
career. He is not hard to miss when the Yankees take batting
practice. Delgado is generously listed at 5 feet 11 inches and 165
pounds _ he is probably shorter and lighter _ and he tends to dump
a lot of balls over the infield, rather than launching rockets over
the fences. When asked about Delgado's offensive potential, Manager
Joe Torre replied, ``Well, he's a good defensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado does not have the experience of the man he is
essentially replacing, Luis Sojo. The Yankees don't have someone
like Darryl Strawberry on their bench, the big left-handed slugger
who frightens opposing managers; Lance Johnson hits singles and
steals bases.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Homer Bush came off the Yankee bench with his
awesome speed and he stole a few bases and won a few games. Now
there is Clay Bellinger, whose strength is versatility. Joe Girardi
was once the Yankees' backup catcher, and now the backups are Jim
Leyritz and Turner.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Yankee bench doesn't seem as deep or as strong, it
is contributing in meaningful ways. Leyritz is hitting .125, but on
April 16, his home run in the seventh inning snapped a 4-4 tie with
the Kansas City Royals. Three days later, Johnson started and
spurred the offense with four hits and two steals against the Texas
Rangers. When the Rangers tied the game in the ninth inning that
day, Bellinger slammed a game-winning home run in the 10th inning.
Even Alfonso Soriano slugged an important home run in his otherwise
turbulent and temporary tenure as third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado and Turner stepped in on Tuesday night, with Ledee
moving to the leadoff spot. The Yankees led by 1-0 after Bernie
Williams hit a solo home run in the fourth inning. Scott Brosius
singled to open the fifth, and Turner _ who found himself nervous
all day, ``feeling butterflies'' before his first start with the
Yankees _ hammered a double against the center-field fence. Brosius
stopped at third.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado was next. He learned just before batting practice that
he would play, and he didn't know anything about Knoblauch's injury
until reporters told him after the game. But what Delgado did know,
as he batted in the fifth inning, was that Cleveland's Bobby Witt
would challenge him with fastballs. ``They wanted me to show what I
can do,'' Delgado said after the game, before pausing, then adding.
``But I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado lined a ball between the outfielders in right and
center, the ball rolling and rolling, Brosius and Turner scoring.
Delgado stood at second with two RBI _ matching Knoblauch's total
for the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Turner had never worked with Pettitte in spring training, only
watching him from afar. They sat together in the dugout during
Monday's game, discussing how they might try to pitch against the
Cleveland hitters, something the American League has done with
great success this year. Coming into Tuesday night's game, the
Indians had scored only 121 runs, third fewest in the league, ahead
of the Detroit Tigers (84 runs) and, amazingly, the first-place
Yankees (114).
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte retired the first 12 batters he faced, nine of those on
groundball outs, and no Cleveland batter hit the ball out of the
infield in the first four innings. Manny Ramirez opened the fifth
with a single and Pettitte wavered, walking home a run.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte recovered, and in the seventh, Ledee lifted a home
run deep into the right-field stands; he muted his smile until he
returned to the dugout, and then, Torre said, ``He was cheesing
from ear to ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson took over in the seventh and pitched two innings,
Mariano Rivera overcame an error and an unearned run in the ninth,
whiffing Enrique Wilson to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen has an earned run average of 1.31 over its last 11
games. The starters have an ERA of 1.67 in the last turn through
the rotation. The names in the lineup can be obliterated, blacked
out, changed and switched, but so long as the Yankees get that kind
of pitching, there won't be any revisionism in the American
League. &QL;

KINGS PUSH LAKERS TO GAME 5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - If one playoff loss put an unsightly scuff on the
Lakers' glimmering aura as presumed champions-in-the-making, the
second loss ripped the shine right off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they can't even be presumed as victors of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings made that point emphatically Tuesday night,
sending the heavily favored Lakers to a stunning 101-88 Game 4 loss
at Arco Arena, tying this best-of-five series at two games each.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about the Lakers rose exponentially with a second
straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3, they merely coughed up the game in the fourth
quarter. This time, they couldn't even forge a lead, trailing from
buzzer to buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, they couldn't even muster a
decent run, or much of an offense at all, shooting 37.9 percent
from the field. In an odd role reversal, it was the Kings who won
with defense, and with higher-percentage shooting (43.9).
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, still uncontainable, led the Kings' charge with 23
points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Six Kings scored in double
figures, with 41 points coming from the bench. Onetime Laker Jon
Barry led the bench scoring with 17 points. The hot-shooting Kings
hit 9 of 21 attempts from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant had another huge night, with 32 points, and
Shaquille O'Neal bounced back from his Game 3 performance with 25
points and 16 rebounds. But O'Neal had another rough night at the
line, making 5 of 12 foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers got no help from their role players, and
the reserves supplied just eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers never got closer than six points in the fourth
quarter, having lost control long ago, trailing by double digits
for most of the first three quarters. And it was a tense first
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Webber and Glen Rice each drew flagrant fouls in the second
quarter. By the third, Bryant and Vlade Divac were mixing it up,
earning a double-technical foul for a post-whistle scuffle under
the Lakers basket.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings were inspired out of the gate, it might have been
more than just a product of their emotional Game 3 victory and
another insanely amped home crowd; the Kings were also irritated by
the Lakers' comments that they had given away the game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson seemed amused by the Kings' anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been trying everything over there, you know, from
attacking officials to everything else,'' he said before tipoff.
``But how many minutes did we lead that ballgame, probably 40
minutes? ... They just climbed over the mountain at the end and
went by us. From that standpoint, when you lead for 40 minutes of a
48-minute game, the basic conclusion is that you probably gave the
game away, because you had the momentum, you had the lead, you
didn't extend it, didn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yes, they're a good basketball team, we're not taking
anything away from them. But we have trailed them in a lot of games
for three quarters and had to come back in the fourth quarter with
our energy and beat them. In fact, two games I can remember quite
well we had to do that. So we know what it's like to play form
behind against this basketball club and when we play from the other
side, we feel like we just didn't do the right thing. We had all
the opportunities and didn't carry it out.''
</P>
<P>
   That description also was appropriate for most of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long before signs of another possible upset
became apparent. Jackson's body language told the story.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings grabbed an early 7-2 lead, Jackson - who rarely
rises from his courtside seat - stood up, arms folded. And he
stood. And stood.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, Jackson logged a season high for upright minutes
in the first quarter. Not that it helped, as the Lakers fell to an
11-point deficit and eventually were outscored 27-18 in the opening
period.
</P>
<P>
   Having just posted their lowest quarter of the playoffs, the
Lakers showed signs of life in the second quarter, using a 10-3 run
to pull within three points, 36-33. But the Kings, who never
trailed in the half, had an answer for everything.
</P>
<P>
   A flagrant foul by Glen Rice against Chris Webber fueled a
four-point Kings burst that pushed the lead back to seven points.
The Lakers pulled within three again, 46-43, only to watch Nick
Anderson hit a 3-pointer that started a 10-2 Kings run to close out
the half.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento had a 56-45 lead at the intermission, the Kings'
largest lead of the series and their first halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started slowly once again but muscled his way to 14
points and seven rebounds in the half. Bryant had 11 points and
Rice 13. But the Lakers' poor shooting (38.6 percent), a bad
rebounding disadvantage (31-22) and a Kings 3-point barrage (6 for
14) tipped the scales.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are a lot of unusual things about Pacific
Bell Park, the quirky yard that has played host to 10 games by the
San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   An 80-foot Coca-Cola bottle, doubling as a children's slide,
looms over left field. Next to that is a giant old-fashioned
baseball mitt. A robot named Rusty emerges from a shed in right
field now and then, waving goodbye to opposing pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, the unusual can be found on the scoreboard. The
New York Mets have seen a lot of crooked numbers on this road trip,
and the San Francisco Giants posted another in the fourth inning on
Tuesday night: 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' starter, Glendon Rusch, was undone by one big inning,
and the Giants defeated the Mets, 7-1. Rusch allowed six runs in
the fourth _ the third six-run inning the Mets have allowed in five
games on this trip. Four other times, an opponent has scored at
least three runs in an inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first unsuccessful start for Rusch out of four he has
made this season. He had been virtually invincible until Tuesday
night, permitting just five runs in 222/3 innings, walking just
two. He walked no Giants on Tuesday night, but five hits and a hit
batsman ruined his evening.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, 1-1, Barry Bonds doubled to lead off the
fourth. Two singles gave the Giants a 2-1 lead, and Rusch faced
J.T. Snow. With a 2-2 count, the left-handed-hitting Snow leaned
into a curveball with his front shoulder, a hit-by-pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine argued, suggesting Snow made no
effort to get out of the way of the pitch. Two weeks ago, the Mets
had gotten such a call, when the Cubs' Eric Young was not awarded a
hit-by-pitch after leaning his shoulder into a John Franco pitch.
But Valentine was unsuccessful this time, and the bases were
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The next hitter, Rich Aurilia, poked a single to right field to
increase the Giants' lead to 3-1. Catcher Bobby Estalella then came
up and ripped a line drive to left that never stopped carrying
until it had barely cleared the eight-foot wall in left-center
field. Suddenly the Giants had a 7-1 lead on the grand slam, and
the Mets never got close off Livan Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Rush was lifted after six innings, having allowed seven runs on
11 hits. His record dropped to 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did score off Hernandez in the first inning, but they
could have had more than one run.
</P>
<P>
   The right-field corner is only 307 feet from home plate here,
because the Giants wanted space for a public walkway between the
fence and the bay.
</P>
<P>
   But they also wanted a field that would play fairly for pitchers
and hitters. Heeding the advice of their broadcaster and former
pitcher, Mike Krukow, designers made the right-center-field gap a
distant 421 feet from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That dimension sometimes inspires extra-base hits at the expense
of home runs, as the Mets' Robin Ventura discovered in the first
inning. Hernandez struck out the first two Mets on breaking balls,
and he got ahead of Edgardo Alfonzo. But Alfonzo walked, and
Ventura followed by slamming a pitch high off the brick wall in
right-center. It would have been a homer almost anywhere else, but
it went for a double here.
</P>
<P>
   No Mets runner got farther than second for the rest of the game.
Hernandez, who was 0-5 against the Mets last season and has gone
19-28 since winning the most valuable player award for Florida in
the 1997 World Series, beat the Mets for his first victory this
season. He worked all nine innings, allowing eight hits on three
walks and five strikeouts.

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The key call of Game 3 between the Stars and
the Sharks proved to be what is or isn't goaltender interference.
</P>
<P>
   The referees thought Stars winger Blake Sloan did it. They
didn't think Sharks forward Mike Ricci did. The difference is the
biggest reason the Stars lost, 2-1, to the Sharks last night at San
Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you have the opportunity to agree or disagree with the
referee,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I didn't agree with
some of the calls. I didn't think Ricci's goal should've counted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci scored on a five-on-three power play at 5:42 of the second
period. Ricci tipped in a shot by Sharks defenseman Gary Suter from
the point. Stars captain Derian Hatcher argued that Ricci had
interfered with Stars goalie Ed Belfour, but the goal stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricci backed into me, and I tried to make a save, but I think
he turned a little bit,'' Belfour said. ``I might have been hit,
but that is going to happen in playoff hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal snapped Belfour's playoff shutout streak. He had gone
164 minutes and 34 seconds without allowing a goal. His streak
dated back to Game 5 of the Stars' first-round series with
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Sharks were back in the game, San Jose captain Owen
Nolan proceeded to win it.
</P>
<P>
   His goal at 14:56 of the second period proved to be the
game-winner, although a number of solid save were needed from
Sharks goalie Steve Shields before the game was officially won. He
finished with 30 saves, including 13 in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played very well,'' Stars winger Mike Keane said. ``You
have to make every shot a perfect shot. ... But you can't play
five-on-four for a whole period.''
</P>
<P>
   A floundering Sharks bunch in desperate need of life got it when
Sloan was called for goaltender interference at 5:02 of the second
period. Stars forward Aaron Gavey was already in the box for
slashing, giving the Sharks had 52 seconds with a two-man
advantage. It was one of their five power plays in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci's goal went in with 12 of them remaining. The goal broke a
streak of 14 power plays without a goal for the Sharks in this
series. They're 1-for-18 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the best penalty-killing unit in the league
was no match for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks power play didn't do as much damage to the Stars as
the endless stream of their own players traipsing to the penalty
box.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars suffocated the Sharks' first power play. Nos. 2, 3 and
4 were handled as well. No. 5, a five-on-three no less, proved to
be the one that allowed the Sharks to get back in Game 3 and
eventually the best-of-seven series. Game 4 is scheduled for Friday
at San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best penalty kill in the league,'' Stars winger
Kirk Muller said. ``But you are playing with danger.''
</P>
<P>
   They gave the Sharks one too many chances, too.
</P>
<P>
   Their power play wasn't working. The Stars had a 1-0 lead.
Belfour looked invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly why Nolan was in the game. Nolan, who missed
Game 2 because of ``flu-like symptoms,'' returned to the lineup for
Game 3 against Dallas last night. The foot, the shoulder, all his
ailments encapsulated by ``flu'' still ached, but the Sharks were
in desperate need of exactly what Nolan brings in a best-of-seven
series, where they hadn't scored a goal against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't disappoint, scoring the game-winning goal at 14:56 of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's banged up a little bit,'' Ricci said. ``Got the flu, I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing cures a flu like a 2-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it didn't look like even the return of Nolan would
be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had been clinging to a 1-0 lead since 3:35 of the
first period, which is when Stars center Mike Modano scored a power
play goal of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The play began when Stars winger Brett Hull took a shot from
along the boards. Shields made the save, but, as has become his
modus operandi, left the rebound out in front. Modano swooped in on
the puck like a kid on candy. Before Shields had time to say ``no
more rebounds,'' the puck was over his shoulder for a 1-0 Stars
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Modano extended his streak of points in consecutive playoff
games to a personal-best seven games.
</P>
<P>
   He had chances for more, too. A shorthanded breakaway with 1:08
remaining in the second period stands out more than the others.
</P>
<P>
   Modano wasn't the only one with a bunch of could'ves and
should'ves either. Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk had two tips that
easily could've gone in, one in the first period and one in the
frantic final minutes of the third. Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk on a breakaway as he came out of the penalty box.
Matvichuk had been in for unsportsmanlike conduct at 13:36 of the
second period. They thought he took a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Which turned out to be the story of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars just couldn't seem to get out of the penalty box.

MARINERS NOT GOOD, BUT GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It was not a well-played game, as is often the
case in the Metrodome these days.
</P>
<P>
   But after three hours and 25 minutes, 14 walks, a dozen stranded
Mariners, 10 pitchers, two errors, a hit batter and a passed ball,
an otherwise ugly game finally ended on a play worth savoring _
shortstop Alex Rodriguez's bare-handed fielding gem that preserved
Seattle's 5-4 win over the Twins Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the ninth and Minnesota's Jacque Jones at first
base, Cristian Guzman hit a sharp grounder off closer Kazuhiro
Sasaki's glove. On the run near second base, Rodriguez reached back
with his bare hand, grabbed the ball and threw to first for the
game's final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had it real easy, but when Sasaki touched it the rotation
took it behind me,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was like a golf ball. It
had a lot of english on it. It was the only play I had. If it gets
by me, Jacque Jones scores easily because he was running on the
play and the ball would have spun off ... into no-man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   The play ended what had been a frequently exasperating game, the
sort so common to the Metrodome in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota franchise is in bad shape, on its way to an eighth
consecutive losing season and drawing the smallest crowds in the
majors. With the Timberwolves playing across town in the NBA
playoffs, the announced attendance was 6,780, but far fewer
actually showed up. Those who did were not rewarded by the Twins
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota pitchers walked 10 batters _ four in a row at one
point _ and hit another. Reliever Hector Carrasco threw 13 pitches,
only one of them a strike, and walked the three batters he faced.
LaTroy Hawkins walked the bases loaded as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Mariners were much better, making two errors and
taking little advantage of Minnesota's wildness. Of the 10 Seattle
batters who walked and the one hit batter, only one scored. With a
chance to do some heavy damage, Seattle left the bases loaded in
the fourth, sixth and the eighth innings. Once again, they failed
to get a bunt down in a critical situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a strange game,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``I
don't think you ever win ugly. It may seem that way, but when it's
over and you win, it's very pretty. We got it done, what can I
say?''
</P>
<P>
   The game moved along fairly quickly the first couple of innings
before the Twins started walking everyone in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like putting a parachute out,'' said Seattle starter
John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   Halama pitched poorly in his previous starts, allowing eight
runs in 72/3 innings. He was far from exceptional Tuesday night,
but gave the Mariners a good-enough performance, allowing three
runs (two earned) in five innings to raise his record to 3-0
despite a 5.79 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as the game got on, I started getting the first-pitch
strike,'' Halama said. ``I had a lot of movement on my sinker
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama breezed his first trip through Minnesota's lineup before
allowing a run on a walk, a ground-rule double and an infield
single in the fourth inning. He allowed two runs in the fifth on a
leadoff single and some shoddy fielding.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mariners rallied for four runs in the top of the sixth
on three singles, four consecutive walks and a passed ball,
Piniella yanked Halama abruptly as he warmed up in the bottom of
the inning, replacing him with struggling Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided to get Mesa into the game and see if he could
get through the inning,'' Piniella said. ``As it was, we used four
relievers, but they all needed work, so it really doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa struck out a batter and allowed two hits before Arthur
Rhodes came in to clean up the mess. Rhodes allowed a run in the
seventh, Paul Abbott took over in the eighth and Sasaki came in to
begin the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki had only one save opportunity in the past three weeks
prior to Tuesday night, but thanks in large part to Rodriguez, got
the job done for his fourth save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out the first batter he faced, retired Todd Walker on
a long fly to deep center and walked Jones before Rodriguez made
his bare-handed play.

WIRED MICHAEL JOHNSON PROVIDES VITAL STATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To find out whether Michael Johnson had his
heart in anchoring the winning 4x400-meter relay team at last
weekend's Penn Relays, one can simply check NBCOlympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   There on the network's official Olympics site is a feature that
includes the rate of Johnson's heartbeat during his winning sprint.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, he literally had his heart into it, and NBCOlympics.com
has provided proof.
</P>
<P>
   With tiny sensors attached to his chest and legs, Johnson's
winning sprint in Philadelphia was recorded with every step.
According to the site, his heartbeat in the first 50 meters was 184
beats per minutes; in the final 50 meters it was 174 beats per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The data fascinated even the coordinator of the project, Tom
Feuer, the coordinating producer of NBCOlympics.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe data\S told me, one, that he was clearly more nervous at
the beginning of the race; two, he is so danged fit that his
exertion of energy slowed his heart,'' Feuer said. ``That's an
amazing feat to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of information that Feuer envisions as the next
step in tracking an athlete's performance. Rather than sorting
through statistics, Feuer said fans can check a wired athlete's
performance, such as NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine tracking a quarterback's heart rate in the fourth
quarter,'' he said. ``We can determine what contributes to an
interception.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said Johnson had seen Quokka Sports wire athletes for
hiking events and climbing exhibitions and approached the San
Francisco company suggesting it do the same with a track athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed to participate in the joint venture between NBC
and Quokka Sports. But to make the technology work, Johnson had to
be outfitted with special Band-Aid-sized sensors developed by
FitSense Technology of Wellesley, Mass. FitSense's e-Go system
monitored Johnson's speed, distance, acceleration, cadence, stride
length, energy burn rate and heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was tested in the field at UT-Arlington in
December and unveiled at the Penn Relays. The 15-month project
wouldn't have worked without Johnson ``willing to take some
risks,'' Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes before the relay, NBCOlympics.com used clear
surgical tape to attach the sensors to his body. Once the relay was
in progress, Johnson activated the recording process.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of credit goes to Michael, who was willing to go before
40,000-45,000 people and try a never-before-tested device,'' Feuer
said. ``We think we have it perfected with Michael, but with other
applications there are a lot of things we still need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the kinks is the turnaround time for posting the data. It
took less than 24 hours to post Johnson's data, but it's nothing
like real-time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is quoted on the site as saying it's ``the first time
something like this has ever been done, so of course, I want to be
a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done some things in this sport that nobody else has
ever done, and I see this as another way of getting something like
that under my belt.''  &LR; subheds:Bytes Downloads: Mavericks owner

HEARST PUTS S.F. PUBLISHER ON LEAVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN, JANET WELLS and YUMI WILSON 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Examiner Publisher Tim White was
placed on indefinite leave Tuesday afternoon, a day after he
testified in federal court that he was willing to ``horse trade''
favorable treatment in the paper's opinion pages in exchange for
Mayor Willie Brown's support of Hearst Corp.'s purchase of The
Chronicle.
<P>
   Hearst announced that it would begin ``an internal review into
the matter'' involving White, who testified at a federal antitrust
trial challenging the company's proposed purchase of The Chronicle
and the acquisition of the Examiner by the Fang family, publishers
of the thrice-weekly free San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   White's leave became effective immediately, and George Irish,
president of Hearst Newspapers, was named interim publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reaffirming our policy that the content of news and
editorial pages may not be negotiated or compromised in any way,''
Hearst spokesman Paul Luthringer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph M. Alioto, who is prosecuting the antitrust suit on
behalf of former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly, said at a news
conference Tuesday afternoon that Irish, Hearst CEO Frank Bennack
Jr., and other Hearst officials in New York had to know about
White's comments to Brown because they received the e-mail from
White describing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   White is being used as a ``scapegoat,'' Alioto said. ``If any
action should be taken, it should be taken against Mr. Bennack and
Mr. Irish. Both of them knew about this in the summer of last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's decision to place White on indefinite leave came as
media experts around the country _ and the Examiner's own staff _
condemned White's testimony. Journalism ethics experts likened
White's exchange with the mayor to ``extortion'' and ``blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is at the very core of the integrity of the press, when
you have a guy as high-ranked as (White) even implying that he
traded editorial coverage,'' said Michael Josephson of the Joseph
and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina Del Rey, an
organization that has consulted with newspapers on ethics issues.
</P>
<P>
   White testified during questioning from Alioto about a lunch
that White and Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein had with
Brown on August 30, just weeks after the Hearst's deal to buy The
Chronicle was announced.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail sent to Irish the same day, White wrote that
Brown's treatment by the Examiner was discussed at the lunch along
with Hearst's effort to buy The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Willie how I was going to justify to my superiors in
New York wanting to support him and cooperate with him,'' White
wrote, ``when he was seeming to go out of his way to make our lives
difficult (by opposing the sale).''
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail, White also highlighted his impressions of the
relationship between Brown, Bronstein and The Examiner, which the
mayor has criticized for being unfairly critical of him. ``You
would think that (Bronstein and Brown) were the best of friends,''
White wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, White wrote, ``tells me Phil has always taken care of
any problems (the mayor) raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final touch,'' White wrote, ``is that the mayor invited
Phil and Sharon (Stone) to join him in his private suite at 3Com
Stadium for the 49ers' opening game. Phil lied and said he enjoys
football and would be happy to join the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   In court Monday, Alioto asked White if he was ``horse trading''
favorable treatment for Brown's help in closing The Chronicle deal,
and White answered: ``Yes.'' White then qualified his answer by
adding that he was referring to the paper's ``editorial side'' and
not its news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, in a statement released by Hearst Corp., White
said, ``I was tired and confused by the question. The implication
of my answer that the pages of the Examiner can be influenced,
under any circumstances, is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein stated emphatically ``that there were no negotiations
of press coverage of any kind.'' Bronstein later explained that by
``press coverage'' he was referring to coverage in both news pages
and opinion pages.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Tuesday he doesn't remember ``any of the
conversations reported in the newspapers. I remember a very
pleasant lunch ... during the early part of the campaign. There was
no impropriety to speak of. ... There was certainly no substantive
conversation that took place.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Examiner had been highly critical of his record
in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Examiner has been an incredibly nasty newspaper to me. You
have some very evil people working in that paper,'' Brown said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about White's testimony, Brown said, ``It sounds like
Mr. White was bushwhacked, so to speak.'' The mayor added, ``I am
frankly shocked (that White was placed on indefinite leave).''
</P>
<P>
   White appeared briefly in federal court in San Francisco Tuesday
where he was scheduled to continue his testimony under examination
by Hearst and Chronicle lawyers. But a Hearst attorney informed
U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who is presiding over the trial,
that his testimony would not be needed at this time.
</P>
<P>
   White left the courtroom a short time later and he could not be
reached for comment later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said that White's testimony was highly relevant in the
trial because Brown had been in contact with U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno about launching a possible antitrust investigation of
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of the publisher making a connection with the
highest political officer in the area, who had ties with the
Justice Department to get him to support not only the Hearst
acquisition of The Chronicle but the closing of the Examiner,''
Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Shulman, Alioto's co-counsel, added that if White had been
``tired and confused'' and had made a mistake, he had an
opportunity Tuesday to correct it on the witness stand, but Hearst
lawyers didn't call him.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein broke the news of White being placed on leave to the
paper's stunned staff, which was already reeling from the fallout
from White's comments.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members had drafted a petition sharply criticizing White's
testimony:
</P>
<P>
   ``The editorial employees of the San Francisco Examiner would
like it to be known that our editorial support is not, nor has it
ever been, for sale. We do not, nor have we ever, practiced
`horse-trading' at the Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Examiner staffers expressed shock at White's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into work and read the trial story, I felt like I
had been kicked in the gut, kicked in the groin,'' reporter Jim
Herron Zamora said. ``It called into question the credibility of me
and all my colleagues. This isn't the Hearst I work for ... Most of
us were big fans of (White).''
</P>
<P>
   But few Examiner staff members wanted _ or even imagined _ that
White would be placed on indefinite leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim White was a decent guy trying to do his job, and his job
was this merger,'' said editorial writer Lynn Ludlow. ``A
suspension of this kind has got to be devastating to his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Examiner Editorial Page Editor James Finefrock said White never
tried to manipulate editorial direction of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a deal offered, it certainly wasn't
consummated,'' Finefrock said. ``There was no direction to go easy
on Willie Brown on the editorial page. ... We've been very tough on
him throughout. It would be news to Willie Brown if we soft-pedaled
him. It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's endorsement of Brown in last year's mayoral race,
which some media observers found surprising, was the ``unanimous
result of an editorial board meeting,'' Finefrock said in a
statement to the Examiner staff Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   News of Hearst's decision to place White on leave prompted a
staff meeting in The Chronicle newsroom as well. At the meeting,
Chronicle Publishing Co. CEO John Sias was asked if it were true
that he had delayed publication of a lengthy story about the
paper's sale to Hearst Corp. and the Fangs' acquisition of the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Sias confirmed that the story had been held one day because he
had concerns about publishing it so close to the beginning of the
trial and that the paper's senior editors persuaded him to publish
it. Managing Editor Jerry Roberts stated that Sias did not ask for
a single change in the story, which ran in last Thursday's
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   During the staff meeting, Chronicle Executive Editor Matt
Wilson, Roberts and Editorial Page Editor John Diaz reaffirmed the
paper's policy of editorial independence from financial or
political pressures, stressing that all news decisions are made in
the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will resume in federal court Wednesday morning.

BRAVES BEAT DODGERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is why the Atlanta Braves won a club-record
15 in a row. It's why the Dodgers have lost five in a row to the
Braves and why they must still prove they are playoff contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hung around long enough until they made something
happen, which turned out to be a three-run eighth inning in a 5-3
win against the Dodgers on Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did so many things wrong to allow the Braves to hang
around. The result was their fifth loss to Atlanta in five games.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight outing Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park tied
a career high by walking seven. He allowed only three hits and two
runs, but couldn't finish the seventh inning because of his
wildness. He gave way to reliever Terry Adams with a 2-1 count on
Quilvio Veras.
</P>
<P>
   Adams walked Veras but got out of the inning by getting Chipper
Jones to ground out. However, Adams, who had a 1.35 ERA in 12
outings, had his own problems in the eighth. He walked Brian Jordan
and Bobby Bonilla, threw a wild pitch and was victimized by passed
ball. It set up Andruw Jones' two-run single to center as the
Braves took a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the defense appeared to bail out the Dodgers, it was
only momentarily. Mike Fetters relieved Adams and with runners on
second and third and one out got Andres Galarraga to ground to
third. Adrian Beltre threw home to get Andruw Jones at the plate.
But the Dodgers gave the run up anyway when Fetters' pickoff throw
glanced off first baseman Dave Hansen's glove and allowed Javy
Lopez to score.
</P>
<P>
   Adams (2-2) was the loser in relief. Atlanta's Bruce Chen (4-0)
pitched a scoreless inning for the win. John Rocker recorded his
second save of the series and seventh of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dodgers' offense had two hits in 12 at-bats with
runners in scoring position. Left fielder Gary Sheffield, who
carried the Dodgers offense through the first month, grounded into
three double plays. The third one came with the bases loaded and
none out in the seventh and the Dodgers trying to add to a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After scratching and clawing for opportunities the first four
times they played this season, the Dodgers had plenty of them
against Terry Mulholland. And they frittered a bundle of them away.
Mulholland allowed 10 hits and walked one in six innings, but the
Dodgers could push across only three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley's first of two doubles put runners on second and
third with none out in the second. Kevin Elster's RBI groundout to
third gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead, but Park struck out and Devon
White flied out to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it 1-1 on Lopez's two-out double in the fourth,
but the Dodgers were able to turn Park's leadoff double in the
fifth into a 2-1 lead, though it took a little longer than the
Dodgers would have liked. Park's drive to the right-field fence was
initially ruled a home run, but first-base umpire Larry Young
changed his decision and said a fan reached over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Park was sent to second and eventually scored on Shawn Green's
blooper to left. But Sheffield grounded into a double play with
runners on the corners to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Braves tied it, this time on Wally Joyner's first
homer of the season. He hit Park's 2-0 pitch into the right-field
bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four games this season against the Braves, the
Dodgers scored five runs. This didn't constitute a windfall of
offense, but the Dodgers did regain the lead again in the bottom of
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre doubled down the right-field line with one out and
Hundley followed with an RBI-double to right-center as the Dodgers
went ahead 3-2. But the struggle with runners in scoring position
continued. Just 2 for 8 at that point, Elster grounded out to first
and Park grounded to third to end the inning.

INTERIM PUBLISHER OF EXAMINER DESCRIBED AS `MAN OF INTEGRITY'
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George B. Irish, the Hearst Corp. executive who is taking over
the San Francisco Examiner, was described Tuesday as ``a man of
integrity'' who is able to deal well with difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
   Irish, 55, replaces Examiner editor and publisher Timothy O.
White, who was placed on indefinite leave Tuesday, one day after he
testified in federal court that he was willing to ``horse trade''
favorable treatment with Mayor Willie Brown in the Examiner's
editorial pages for Brown's support of the Hearst purchase of The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Irish, as president of Hearst Newspapers, received e-mails from
White outlining White's discussions with Mayor Brown. Tuesday,
however, Irish removed White and took over himself as interim
publisher of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Irish has been in a difficult
situation. He was the publisher of the San Antonio Light in Texas
when the Hearst Corp. acquired the much larger San Antonio Express.
The two papers had been in a circulation war for years, and
Hearst's Light had lost an estimated $60 million in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst attempted to find a buyer for the Light, but was
unsuccessful. On Jan. 27, 1993, Irish announced that the Light
would close down. Hearst then took over the Express. The Express's
employees kept their jobs, but the staff of the Light lost theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult time,'' said Tam Harvey, who was
graphics editor at the Light and was laid off. ``Hearst bought the
other paper and fired their own people. There were feelings of
betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Harvey said, Irish emerged from the situation with his
integrity and honor intact. ``He handled a difficult and painful
situation well and with a lot of heart,'' Harvey said. ``He is a
good guy, and people have a lot of respect for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never forgets a name or a face,'' Harvey added.
</P>
<P>
   Irish became a Hearst executive in 1979 when the chain acquired
the Midland (Mich.) Daily News. He served as publisher there and
then became publisher of the Midland (Texas) Reporter-Telegram, the
Beaumont (Texas) Enterprise and the San Antonio Light.
</P>
<P>
   He then moved up the corporate ladder as vice president and
group executive for Hearst Newspapers, and in 1998 became president
of Hearst Newspapers and a vice president of the Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been Hearst's rising star in the newspaper division,''
said Larry Kramer, who is now the CEO of Marketwatch CBS.com, and
reported to Irish when he was executive editor of the San Francisco
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's straight up,'' Kramer said. ``He's a man of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   According to others who know him, Irish is a man with an
impressive personality who is willing to serve on community and
corporate boards of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very good citizen,'' said Tom Goldstein, dean of the
Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Irish is a member of the school's board of visitors, a member of
the Associated Press Board of Directors, the American Press
Institute and chairman of the board of regents of Millikin
University in Decatur, Ill., his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is universally respected,'' said Goldstein, who was
formerly the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Irish's experience has been as a newspaper executive, not as an
editor or reporter. ``But he understands the appropriate roles of a
publisher and an editor,'' Goldstein said. ``He is the
quintessential publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer does not think Irish will stay long in San Francisco.
``It is an interim role,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Irish and his wife, Mary, live in New York and have a vacation
home in San Antonio. Like many business executives, Irish enjoys
golf.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PHOENIX _ The Suns' Jason Kidd was starting and soon flying. Maybe
then the Spurs knew it was over. Perhaps they always knew.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It just never seemed right for the Spurs, from Sean Elliott's
kidney transplant to begin the season to Malik Rose's ripped right
knee to end it. They never seemed to have a chance, never seemed to
more than resemble the team that swept to last season's title. And
then it was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns ended San Antonio's reign Tuesday with an 89-78 victory
for a 3-1 win in their first-round NBA playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns got Kidd back from his fractured ankle Tuesday as if he
was never hurt. The Spurs looked at their bench to see Tim Duncan
in jeans, his torn knee ligament not allowing him to give it a
last-chance try. And as the Spurs limped home on crutches, the
championship reign was gone before they could truly defend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst feeling in the world,'' guard Mario Elie said.
``You work hard during the season. But we never had a healthy team
the whole year. It's frustrating. I wish we could have had our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the champions of the NBA's shortest season, with one of
the swiftest playoff runs to a title, ended the league's shortest
reign since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It could be even more fleeting. The last champion to fail to
repeat, the 1985 Lakers, won five titles in the '80s. The Spurs,
the first champions eliminated in the first round since the 1984
76ers, will have to struggle to stay together with every starter a
free agent save David Robinson, 34.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of a breakup seems to fit with their demise.
Lakers coach Phil Jackson derisively labeled the Spurs asterisk
champions as title-holders from the 50-game lockout season. They
became asterisk former champs for going down with forward Duncan in
street clothes and the Spurs' realistic chances impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to go very far without Tim,'' Elliott said.
``That's just reality. The guys in this locker room overcame a lot
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Kidd to charge the Phoenix offense again, the Spurs
were outmanned, diminished when Rose went down four minutes before
halftime. Without Duncan, the Spurs could not muster an attack.
Robinson had 21 points and 16 rebounds. But he could make just
seven of 19 shots, and the Spurs needed much more.
</P>
<P>
   Elie was the only other Spur to score in double figures with 12,
and he was just 3-of-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing to go out like this,'' Spurs guard
Avery Johnson said. ``We were never really whole. Jason came back
and gave them a huge lift. If Tim would have suited up and given us
10 points, 10 rebounds (to answer Kidd's nine points and 10
assists) it would have given us the same lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd played 31 minutes, making four of five shots and putting
life in the offense. Rodney Rogers and Penny Hardaway each had 23
points, with Rogers adding 10 rebounds, Hardaway seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, any time somebody comes back, there's going to
be a lot of emotion at first,'' Kidd said. ``After we got back in a
groove and everybody settled down, that was the Suns team you've
seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   And with so much coming from so many angles, there was no way
the Spurs could keep pace, their best hope unable to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had gone through the Spurs' Monday practice. But when the
soreness and swelling returned, he was held out as he had been
throughout the series. And as short-handed as that left the Spurs,
it would only get worse when Rose went out with a torn knee
ligament before halftime. The Spurs had lost Jerome Kersey in Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   Down to the last bodies at the end of the bench, the Spurs' last
stand came with the unlikely efforts of Antonio Daniels, Derrick
Dial and Jaren Jackson. With Daniels completing a dunk to a
three-point play, the Spurs found themselves within 70-66. But with
Kidd to guide them, the Suns could not be stopped. They scored on
six consecutive possessions after the Daniels slam with Kidd
getting the assist on every field goal, pushing the lead back to
10.
</P>
<P>
   As much as that might not seem insurmountable, the Spurs were
barely hanging on, outmanned and incapable to hold off the end of
their reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't hit me,'' Robinson said. ``Until I see somebody else
raise that trophy up, that's when it will hit me. How many teams
get major injuries like we had? But you have to maintain your
character one through 12. That's a little disappointing. I'd say
it's more than a little disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the championship that came so quickly, so did the end. Only
the pain of a season wrong from the start seemed to linger.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE cameras usually have faded to a commercial or switched to a
sideline reporter when it happens. But almost always, it does. A
group of tired football heroes gathers at midfield after a game.
Players kneel and hold hands _ one bloody, stained arm pad
interlocked with another.
</P>
<P>
   They bow their heads. And they pray.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of so much political correctness, so much walking
gingerly along the safe, center line, Fellowship of Christian
Athletes members leading organized prayer is neither sanctioned nor
endorsed by public schools or professional sports. Usually,
athletic directors and team officials turn their heads and act as
if it's not happening.
</P>
<P>
   But it is.
</P>
<P>
   In a small weight room under the Compaq Center grandstands,
local FCA president Mike Myers leads Rockets players in chapel
services before every game. In the Astros' clubhouse, players
quietly bow their heads in prayer at their lockers. At college,
high school and youth games across the country, faith in God and a
commitment in the FCA are strong, even if media coverage is not.
</P>
<P>
   So often in interview settings, players thank God for their
gifts or deeds. But the words usually end up on the cutting-room
floor. It's just not always good copy, often too uncomfortable a
subject for media outlets to throw in front of the public. But it
is there. Always.
</P>
<P>
   And it is there because of Don McClanen and, as he emphatically
says, God.
</P>
<P>
   When did writing about God on the sports pages become foul? When
did acknowledging an athlete's faith become agitating? We are not
here to argue the political sides of sports and religion. We could
go on forever on that one.
</P>
<P>
   But McClanen, who founded the FCA 46 years ago with bold steps
into former Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Rickey's office,
received the first Founders Award at the annual FCA banquet here
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And, well, why not McClanen? He started this far-reaching
association, whose membership has grown into the thousands and
whose presence in sports is inspiring if often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simple obedience,'' said McClanen, 75, recalling his
days as a young basketball coach at Eastern Oklahoma State. ``I was
collecting clippings from people like Branch Rickey, Otto Graham
and Doak Walker talking about their faith. I thought, `This is
something that needs to be known.'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, McClanen took out a loan on his car with the idea of
founding the FCA. He then drove his wife and two young children
1,300 miles to New York, hoping Rickey could spare five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rickey's secretary kept discouraging me from going,''
McClanen said, ``but I went anyway. With his stature in sports, I
knew Mr. Rickey could be a big help. Someone finally told him,
`This guy that's been bugging us is here for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rickey agreed to speak with McClanen for five minutes. Five
hours later, the two emerged from Rickey's office with Rickey
promising to connect McClanen with the corporate world and lend his
support to the FCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `If athletes are used to selling cars, razor
blades and cigarettes, why can't they testify for God? Kids won't
listen to their pastors or sometimes their parents, but they listen
to athletes,''' McClanen said. ``He told me, `This thing has the
potential for changing the youth scene in America.'''
</P>
<P>
   After many years and several more loans secured by McClanen, the
FCA's mission has not changed. It now is an international
organization with more than 600 staff members, an annual budget
near $50 million and many high-profile athletes playing prominent
roles.
</P>
<P>
   The FCA still rarely grabs headlines. But always it is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Religion) in athletics is very much frowned upon,'' McClanen
said. ``But there is a deeper significance in people's lives behind
the headlines. People look down on the relationship, but if people
think David Robinson is soft because he is faithful, David Robinson
won a world championship. Doak Walker was a winner. Winners who are
faithful are everywhere in athletics. Nice guys don't finish
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the public often sees only the controversial, criminal
side of sports personalities. We've all been guilty of not seeing
the good for all the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic world is unusually susceptible to distortion,
greed and materialism,'' McClanen said. ``Things have gotten worse.
We are working against society's attraction to overabundance. I'd
like to say the FCA has made definite progress, but I'm not sure.
Our deteriorating society still needs the FCA.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether it makes headlines or not, the FCA figures to always
be there. Under the grandstands. Away from the cameras' focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been given to athletes,'' McClanen said. ``Much
should be expected.''
</P>

CHRONICLE PUBLISHER ADMITS NEGOTIATING WITH HEARST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The top executive of the Chronicle Publishing
Company testified Tuesday that for the past several years he
negotiated repeatedly with the Hearst Corp. about forming some kind
of mutually profitable arrangement if the Hearst-owned Examiner
were sold or closed.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Chief Executive Officer John Sias explained that one
such arrangement would have given the Hearst Corp. 34 percent of
the Chronicle's profits ``for 50 years or perpetuity'' if the two
newspapers terminated their joint operating agreement, an exemption
to antitrust laws that for 35 years has allowed the two papers to
combine their business operations while keeping their editorial
staffs independent.
</P>
<P>
   But the family that owns The Chronicle rejected that proposal
and others, deciding instead last year to sell not only The
Chronicle but the family's other media holdings, including KRON-TV,
Sias testified.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came during an antitrust trial in which former
mayoral candidate and San Francisco real estate investor Clint
Reilly has sued Hearst to block The Chronicle sale on the grounds
that it will result in a single daily newspaper in the city and a
monopoly for Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, his attorney, Joseph M. Alioto, sought to show
through Sias' testimony that The Chronicle and Examiner were
determined to eliminate any competition between the two papers
after their JOA expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claimed that several of the proposed deals between the
two papers, outlined in confidential memos and letters, were
predicated on the closing of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Sias was adamant that Hearst officials always said they
would put the Examiner up for sale first and would close the paper
only if no buyer emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Sias said, however, that he did not know if the Examiner _ with
a circulation less than a quarter of The Chronicle's _ could
survive after the termination of the JOA, which requires that the
two papers split all profits evenly.
</P>
<P>
   In his early testimony, Sias was clearly flustered by Alioto's
aggressive questioning. Alioto accused Sias of making an untrue
statement when he signed an affidavit stating that the JOA requires
The Chronicle to subsidize the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's not true,'' Sias said.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, when Alioto insisted that Sias did not know
how much the Examiner would make if it operated alone, Sias joked:
``Now, that I've just been exposed as a perjurer, I don't know how
to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he did not know from actual expense and revenue
records of the papers' combined operations whether The Chronicle
was actually subsidizing the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he logically assumed, based on The Chronicle's
larger circulation, that it was carrying the Examiner, even if he
had no numbers to support the assumption. ``But I don't know this
from a cost-accounting breakdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sias also rejected as unrealistic one Chronicle study that said
that the Examiner could achieve success after the end of the JOA
with less than a quarter of the papers' combined current revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Models were flying all over the place,'' he said, ``and I
don't mean model planes.''
</P>
<P>
   A key contention of Reilly's suit is that the merger of the two
papers would result in the elimination of competition in subscriber
rates and advertising rates, restraints of trade that would form a
violation of federal anti-trust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and The Chronicle attorneys have argued, however, that
since the two papers already have combined their business
operations under the JOA, there is no actual competition to
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   But Alioto confronted Sias with the confidential report that The
Chronicle family ordered last year from its investment bankers,
Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The report lays out two scenarios of what would occur when the
JOA expires in 2005: the first with one surviving newspaper and the
second with ``newspaper war`` between the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``With one newspaper,'' Alioto said the report concluded,
``there could be a one-time 20 percent increase in national retail
ad rates.'' With head-to-head competition, there would be
significant ad-rate competition and a 10 to 15 percent decline in
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sias rejected the report, saying that it was written by
``pulling figures out of thin air by people who don't know squat
about the newspaper industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He called them incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   When Alioto asked him if he really believed they were
incompetent, Sias said he had gotten a little ``colorful'' with his
language. While they didn't have newspaper experience, he said,
they were very competent at what they were hired to do, which was
to figure out the best price for each of The Chronicle family's
eight business assets, including The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked Sias why some of the memos, especially those based
on rejected proposals, had been kept so confidential, which he said
he found odd in a business that demands open public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Sias said that in 1997 word got out about one of the proposed
merger ideas, and the San Jose Mercury News wrote a story that a
deal for the Hearst purchase of The Chronicle was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal was not imminent,`` he said. ``That can be very
destructive to the employees,'' he said. ``They (the Mercury News)
issued an apology ... years later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker feigned shock. ``You mean you
can't always believe what you read in the newspapers?'' he asked.

KINGS PUSH LAKERS TO GAME 5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - If one playoff loss put an unsightly scuff on the
Lakers' glimmering aura as presumed champions-in-the-making, the
second loss wore the shine right off.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they can't even be presumed as champions of the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings made that point emphatically Tuesday night,
sending the heavily favored Lakers to a stunning 101-88 Game 4 loss
at Arco Arena, tying this best-of-five series at two games each.
</P>
<P>
   Two elimination games played and the Kings are still alive. Two
games later, the Lakers are as close to elimination themselves as
they are to clinching a second-round appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed,'' coach Phil Jackson said of the Lakers' first
postseason test. ``It's not `the jury's out' - they failed
dramatically in this first step. But this team doesn't have to do
anything but win home games and in basketball you win the
championship. That's the reality of the situation. So now the
pressure's there to win on our home court.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing anyone could have expected when this series
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little down,'' Kobe Bryant admitted, ``because we
wanted to get the job done here. But it didn't happen. So we have a
big game on Friday - pressure situation, that's what you live for
as a basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's back to Staples Center for Game 5 and the Lakers can only
hope some semblance of the team that won 67 regular-season games
reappears.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts about the Lakers' title hopes rose exponentially with
this defeat. In Game 3, they merely coughed up the game in the
fourth quarter. This time, they couldn't even forge a lead,
trailing from buzzer to buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a long time, they couldn't even muster a
decent run or much of an offense at all, shooting 37.9 percent from
the field. In an odd role reversal, it was the Kings who won with
defense, and with higher-percentage shooting (43.9).
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to play us incredibly well on their home court,''
Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Chris Webber was a monster on offense (23 points,
eight assists), on the boards (13 rebounds) and on defense (seven
blocked shots). Six of his teammates scored in double figures, with
41 points coming from the bench, including 17 from Jon Barry.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-shooting Kings hit 9 of 21 attempts from 3-point range,
often in the midst of a Lakers push.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate for a team to do that,'' said Glen Rice. ``Every time
we made a run, they would really drive the dagger in a little bit
deeper. And that's what you've got to do. That's something we've
got to realize that we've got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had another huge night, with 32 points, and Shaquille
O'Neal bounced back from his Game 3 performance with 25 points and
16 rebounds. But O'Neal had another rough night at the line, making
5 of 12 foul shots, and he only had one block.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Lakers got no help from their role players, and
the reserves supplied just eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of it, including deficits as high as 14 points, the
Lakers, winners of numerous comebacks this season, felt they could
get back in the game. Even when they were down by 11 points with
1:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, to be totally honest, I felt it got away from us like
a minute and something left in the game,'' Rice said. ``We still
felt that if we could hit a couple of 3s, we'd get into the game.
But after that it was pretty much over.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Jason Williams punted the ball into the upper deck
and the confetti rained from the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence is not down,'' Rice said. ``We just realized
that we came in here and didn't play our best basketball. And we've
just got to try to regroup and come back Friday and not let this
slip away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' defense against O'Neal once again had Jackson
perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you play this game is that you play at the level the
referees allow you to compete at,'' Jackson said. ``That changes
from game to game, it's not consistent from one situation to
another. Their determination is, `We're going to foul Shaq whenever
he gets the ball in the lane, we're going to surround him, we're
going to bang away at him.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And this has been the most valuable player in the league, and
as a consequence (of the fouling), he's not capable of finding the
freedom or the space to operate that he's had in the first two
games of the playoffs. And now we go back and see what this brings
on our home court and see if the referees will use the same
style.''

BRAVES BEAT DODGERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This is why the Atlanta Braves are on a
club-record 15-game winning streak. This is why the Dodgers lost
five in a row to the Braves, and why they still must prove why they
should be considered a playoff threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hung around long enough to overcome their mistakes.
The Dodgers let Atlanta hang around long enough until the Dodgers
made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   It all came together, or apart, in a three-run eighth inning as
the Braves rallied for a 5-3 win against the Dodgers on Tuesday in
front of 30,246 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers left 10 runners on base, failed to score in a bases-
loaded, none-out situation, went 2 for 13 with runners in scoring
position, walked 10 Braves (seven by Chan Ho Park for the second
straight start), committed two errors, threw a wild pitch and had a
passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we gave them the game,'' Dodgers catcher Todd
Hundley said. ``We gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's winning streak is the longest in the National League
since the New York Giants won 16 straight in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (2-2) lost in relief while Bruce Chen (4-0) pitched
a scoreless seventh inning to record the win. Atlanta closer John
Rocker got Gary Sheffield to fly out to center with two runners on
for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just feel like no matter what happens, they know they're
going to win,'' Dodgers shortstop Kevin Elster said. ``They
deserved it. They got some breaks. They took advantage of the
mistakes we made, and we didn't take advantage of their mistakes.
It's always frustrating to lose. Very frustrating. Frustrating as
hell. But you tip your hat to them. Their guys made some pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the toughest night belonged to Sheffield. He's carried
the offense the past month, leading the Dodgers with 10 homers, 22
RBI and a .330 average. But he had a horrific time against Atlanta,
hitting into three double plays.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult, Dodgers center fielder Devon White jammed his
left shoulder diving for a ball in the top of the ninth inning. He
left the game and will be re-evaluated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it's a bruise,'' said White, who had offseason
surgery on the shoulder. ``It's sore right now. It hurts right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   An excruciating evening really began to turn painful in the
bottom of the seventh. The Dodgers led 3-2, but they were on the
verge of breaking it open with the bases loaded and none out. But
Sheffield bounced back to Chen (4-0), who threw to home to start
the double play. Dave Hansen struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves countered in the top of the eighth when Adams walked
the first two hitters. A wild pitch moved them over a base and
Andruw Jones singled to center to give the Braves a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough one, to beat yourself,'' Adams said. ``I think I
tried to nibble too much. My approach is pretty much aggressive, go
after them. I got away from my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters relieved Adams and with runners on second and third
and one out got Andres Galarraga to ground to third. Adrian Beltre
threw home to get Andruw Jones at the plate for the second out and
keep the deficit at one run. But the Dodgers gave the run up anyway
when Fetters' pickoff throw glanced off first baseman Hansen's
glove and allowed Javy Lopez to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some games during the streak we should have
lost,'' Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said. ``Like tonight,
Sheffield is up with the bases loaded and no outs, and getting out
of that without a run is probably the farthest thing from anybody's
mind at that point.''

LAKERS MUGGED AGAIN BY BENCH MOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - And that fifth game again, was when?
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento Kings, all but left for dead at Staples Center -
what was it, a lifetime ago? - have now forced a fifth game no one
truly expected, and the Lakers definitely did not want.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings made the Lakers look very mortal, very Clark Kent, in
Tuesday night's 101-88 victory in Game 4 at what just may be
correctly billed as the world's loudest arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers left town, cow bells ringing in their ears, perhaps
fighting that shadow of doubt, and with a Kings team that now very
much believes in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our self-confidence is very good,'' said Kings guard Tony
Delk. ``Game 3's win really helped. We learned we could play with
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when Delk and the rest of his ``Bench Mob'' are
absolutely dominating the Lakers' ``No-cinch Mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of numbers you can bet your Zen self-help book
on, that Phil Jackson will be pointing out: Kings bench 42, Lakers
bench eight.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the offensive output of the two teams' benches
Tuesday night. Sad but true, the Kings bench outscored their Lakers
counterparts by a whopping 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year and last year, the bench was a big part of our
success,'' said Sacramento center Vlade Divac. ``I think they're
the best bench in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can play like that, we can beat anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Laker Jon Barry led the Sacramento reserves with 17 points,
five rebounds and two assists. But Delk added 12 points, two
rebounds and two assists; Predrag Stojakovic 11 points and three
rebounds; and even Scot Pollard chipped in three rebounds and a
couple of points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   Their reserves made a grand total of three baskets. Count 'em -
one, two, three. End of offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry did grab seven rebounds, but otherwise the L.A.
bench was about as effective as earplugs at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   And not Horry, A.C. Green or anyone else from La-La Land, has
yet to come up with the slightest answer for forward Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
   Webber scored 23 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, had eight assists,
a franchise-record seven blocks and four steals.
</P>
<P>
   This is called a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was over,'' Webber said. ``I'm just proud
of this organization and this team, because it would have been so
easy to quit the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been so easy to lose, just have a vacation and
say it's over because we played against some good guys. But we feel
good, because we're going back to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are feeling sick. They had trouble from the get-go.
They trailed by nine at the end of the first quarter, 11 at the
half, seven after three quarter, and finally lost by 13.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was waiting, but the great Lakers' charge never came.
Every time they would start to rev up their offense, the Kings
would be ready with an answer. With a 3-pointer, a key rebound, or
maybe most unexpectedly, a big stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They missed a lot of shots,'' said Divac, holding onto a
straight face. ``We don't play defense. We're an offensive club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings played 48 minutes of complete basketball. From
beginning toend, they kept the pressure on. Truth is, they may not
be able to play much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who played, had a hand in this one,'' Barry said.
``We just attacked the basketball and looked for the open man. It's
a simple game. Sometimes we try to make it hard with behind the
back passes and stuff, but tonight we played hard and made it
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fans at Arco Arena can certainly cause the ears to ache,
but can they really make that much difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they have a good crowd here, but they don't come out
and make a basket for you,'' said Kings guard Jason Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when the crowd is against you. I hope Friday night,
everyone at Staples Center just let's me have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we'll have to come out and play better on Friday,
because they're going to be jacked up.''
</P>
<P>
   By the game's end, the Lakers were reduced to Ron Harper - 3 for
9 from the field - flashing one of his championship rings to the
crowd by holding onto the back of his shaven head.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd responded by chanting, ``Not with Shaq!''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, for the Lakers, it was a rough night overall.
</P>
<P>
   And now the team with the league's best regular-season record,
goes home with a stunning prospect now possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance,'' Barry said. ``And in any deciding game,
anything can happen.''

FASHION THERAPIST HAS REMEMDIES FOR WHAT AILS YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She is a slim, small-boned woman with piercing
blue-green eyes and smartly cropped hair, and on a recent day she
wore a blue sweater, trousers and a charming smile.
</P>
<P>
   But the soft-spoken voice and gracious manner belie a deeper
power. Betty Halbreich has nudged, prodded, intimidated, guided and
mothered celebrities, socialites, stockbrokers and moms from
Scarsdale into clothes they might never have considered for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For 23 years she has been the personal shopper in residence and
director of the Solutions department at Bergdorf Goodman, an
upscale New York department store. She can boast a clientele that
includes the likes of Joan Rivers, Susan Lucci, Jane Curtin and
Stockard Channing.
</P>
<P>
   She says she can tell in nanoseconds what will enhance a
customer who walks into her sight, and it's unlikely anyone argues
with her. Given her poise and self-assurance, she probably knows
best.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, HarperCollins Publishing convinced her to do a
book, and the result was Secrets of a Fashion Therapist: What You
Can Learn Behind the Dressing Room Door (Cliff Street Books, $25)
with Sally Wadyka, published in 1997. The book, which has been
reprinted in Japan, Germany and China, was slated for reissue in
paperback ($15) in the United States in April.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Halbreich is more than a clothing stylist and far more
than a saleswoman. Her own phrase, ``therapist,'' might not be far
wrong. She looks beyond hair coloring and cellulite bulges and
understands that the consumer's quest for a new wardrobe may well
be a search for a new sense of self _ or a new life.
</P>
<P>
   In her time at Bergdorf, the fashion world has shifted from
haute couture to street power and from designer decrees to personal
style. The store executives have changed, and by her account, the
store has suffered diminished gloss and glamour.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I'm still alive,'' she says with a Scarlett O'Hara kind of
survivor's determination.
</P>
<P>
   She has watched fashion do flip-flops and observed the emergence
of business casual and the dressing down of America. She laments
the loss of interest in good lingerie among young women. And in the
old days, women would recite criticism from their husbands or come
looking for what spouses told them to wear. Maybe they would bring
back a dress: ``He didn't like it,'' they would say. But now it is
their children who are criticizing their clothes, Halbreich says.
</P>
<P>
   She is surprisingly outspoken, with a very modern perspective.
She believes the most common mistake women make is in buying too
much. ``They don't need so many clothes. Why, you could take that
suit,'' she says, pointing at the reporter, ``on a trip, wear it
every day (in different ways) and no one would realize it was the
same suit.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't put much stock in many designers because their ``ego
gets in the way of creativity,'' she says. But among Americans, she
most admires Geoffrey Beene because he ``always stuck to what he
believed.'' And Michael Kors, whom she has known since his youth,
has managed to stay with what is ``truly American.''
</P>
<P>
   In her personal wardrobe, her own favorite is a long Issey
Miyake skirt that she can pull up as a dress or wear down as a long
skirt, and it works for many special events. ``I can wear it
without a jacket and with a jacket,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the questions she gets from women have to do with body
size. They ask, ``How can I look thinner? Do you think my shoulders
are broad?'' she says. ``Most women see themselves as too large,
and they'll have on a size 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Her romance with clothing began when she was a child in Chicago
with a mother who delighted in clothes and showy hats. She
remembers how, well before the winter snow melted, her mother
brought out her cherries hat. In early fall, the feathered felt
appeared as regularly as the first chill. She learned quickly the
joy of playing dress-up in her mother's closet. ``Those things
stuck,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Later she married, raised children and never gave a thought to
working until her marriage ended in her middle years. She was then
able to fall back on the sense of taste and aesthetics she absorbed
so early in life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worthy points she makes in the book:
</P>
<P>
   - Before you go shopping, weed your closet. If you haven't worn
a garment in a year, toss it or donate it to charity or a friend.
</P>
<P>
   - Strip down in front of a full-length mirror and _ be brave _
analyze your figure flaws and assets. And remember everything you
wear is seen from every angle.
</P>
<P>
   - Before you go shopping think about what you need. Flip through
magazines. Repeat the mantra, less is more.
</P>
<P>
   - When it comes to accessorizing, rules can go out the window.
Hosiery doesn't have to match your shoes exactly if you're not
wearing skin-toned sheers. You can add another subtle color that
doesn't compete with the rest of the look.
</P>
<P>
   - Black is good because it does make you look thinner and it
looks expensive even if it's not.
</P>
<P>
   - But you can have too much of a good thing. You know you have
enough (black) if people start to console you for your recent loss
or when even you ``stop being able to tell your clothes apart.''
</P>
<P>
   - Mixing and matching is fine, but if you wear denim jeans with
a boxy jacket you'll ``look like a box with denim legs.''
</P>
<P>
   - Many colors can be mixed. And tones don't have to match to go
together.
</P>
<P>
   - You can almost always lose the oversized shoulder padding even
if you have narrow shoulders. If not, you look as if the hanger is
still in the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   - If you're brain dead when it comes to style, find a good
personal shopper _ as soon as possible.

GEORGE SAUNDERS SHORT STORIES LAY EVERYDAY TRUTHS AT OUR FEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARK EBERHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pastoralia, by George Saunders (188 pages; Riverhead Books;
$22.95)
</P>
<P>
   It may only be May, but George Saunders has already written the
short-story collection of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pastoralia does everything a gathering of tales is supposed to
do: It touches the reader but also provokes reflection, mirth and
pain. It is a noisy collision of satire and pathos, where poor
wretches like you and me struggle to overcome corporate America or
classism or maybe just their own twisted egos _ and fall short.
Here are six yarns so strange that one must resort to a cliche to
describe them: You really won't know whether to laugh or cry.
</P>
<P>
   The natural thing for a critic to do with a book like this is
demand an explanation from the author. But in a recent telephone
interview from his home in Syracuse, N.Y., Saunders basically
admitted he has a hard time explaining himself to himself. Some of
his story ideas come from dreams. All his work is ``organic.'' And
yet he knows he's not exactly normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagine my talent as a dog, and I say, `OK, boy, go
out and get something,' and I think he's going to bring back this
big, classic pheasant _ but in my case he always comes back with
the lower half of a Barbie doll or something. When I try to write a
story about love or whatever, it always somehow gets warped in the
telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Saundersworld.
</P>
<P>
   `Pastoralia'
</P>
<P>
   His title story is the funniest riff on corporations since ...
well, since the title story of his last collection, 1996's
CivilWarLand in Bad Decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastoralia'' is a theme park where modern Americans can go see
living history, or at least the version the park's owners provide.
There are fake shepherds, for example, and faux hermits.
</P>
<P>
   And a sham caveman and cavewoman. Our ``hero'' is the caveman, a
hard-working guy who spends his days grunting and pretending to
grub for bugs. His cavewoman partner is a slacker who instead of
grunting and cowering, chats with the park's paying customers. In
English. And gets argumentative visits from her doofus son. Right
there in the cave. Management is not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The customers are no better. ``Where do they poop?'' one odious
woman asks.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling to our caveman hero is that he has to evaluate
Janet, his querulous cavewoman. There's a fax machine in his living
quarters, out of sight of the customers. Every day he faxes in
chirpy lies to his superiors, trying to protect Janet. They're onto
him, though. Pretty soon Janet's in trouble. Pretty soon Janet's a
goner. Pretty soon our caveman hero is reassigned a go-getter
cavewoman partner who thinks he's a slacker.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastoralia'' is a sendup of the workaday world and a wicked
riff on plastic-meets-rustic theme parks such as Silver Dollar
City. The story began as a dream Saunders had about wearing a
caveman costume in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   But he also once worked for an environmental company (his
undergraduate degree is in geophysics) where he had to evaluate his
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd basically be living with these people,'' he says.
``You'd go out on the road and stay in bad hotels and be working in
swamps taking samples, and you'd come back and have to rat on them.
My policy was, `I'm not going to do it; I'll always say everything
was great.' But then there was this woman who was in trouble. I
thought her work was OK. But the company wouldn't accept my
reviews. My boss said, `You've been so consistently positive that
we know you lie.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the company's communiques to its employees were just as
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get these e-mails alluding to a feud that we didn't know
existed or denying a layoff we hadn't even heard about yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Those e-mails provided inspiration for a note our caveman hero
receives one morning from headquarters regarding bathroom breaks on
company time:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think your poop is a legitimate business expense? Does
it provide benefit to us when you defecate? No, on the contrary, it
would provide benefit if you didn't, because then you would be
working more. Ha ha! That is a joke. We know very well that all
must poop. We grant you that. But also, as we all know, it takes
time to poop, some more than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders' view of the business world makes ``Dilbert'' look like
a company man.
</P>
<P>
   Broken hearts
</P>
<P>
   But Saunders is more than just a modern-day Swift. His
characters are misfits and fools, and yet they evoke pity,
compassion, even sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   In another story titled ``Winky,'' a man named Neil Yaniky goes
to a self-help seminar where a gung-ho guru will teach him to deal
with any person who is cramping his lifestyle. Neil decides he has
to give the boot to his sister, Winky, who lives with him. Winky,
Neil says, is ``crazy-looking and too religious and needs her own
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-help man wants Neil to be ruthless. As the story
progresses, though, Neil's resolve slowly breaks. His sister
genuinely is an idiotic mess of a human being, but she also loves
him.
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing the ending, let's just say Neil finds it
harder to extricate himself from his misery than he first imagined
in that seminar room at the Hyatt.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders has grown as a writer. The tales in his previous
collection often ended with a death ``or something extreme,'' as he
puts it. This time around, he says, ``I don't have those kind of
explosively escapist endings. Something happens from A to Z, but
it's not all the way finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty stinks
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of ``Sea Oak'' is a male stripper at a nightclub
called Joysticks. Female patrons rate him and his co-workers
according to their cuteness, from Knockout to Honeypie to Adequate
to Stinker.
</P>
<P>
   Our stripper ``hero'' lives with his aged Aunt Bernie and sister
Min and cousin Jade in a squalid apartment complex called Sea Oak,
which is nowhere near the sea and has no oaks. Aunt Bernie works at
DrugTown. The foul-mouthed and feckless Min and Jade divide their
time among having babies out of wedlock, allegedly studying for
their GEDs, spouting malapropisms and watching porn infomercials
and TV shows such as ``How My Child Died Violently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For dinner it's beanie-wienies,'' our stripper hero observes
one evening after a hard day's booty-shaking for 40 lousy bucks in
tips, $5 an hour in salary and only a Honeypie//Adequate rating.
``For dessert it's ice cream with freezer burn. `What a nice day
we've had,' Aunt Bernie says once we've got the babies in bed.
`Man, what an optometrist,' says Jade.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders hasn't worked as a stripper (or at least didn't admit
to it) but has done time in bad jobs. His narrator in ``Sea Oak''
is lower-middle-class and culturally challenged but not stupid.
Saunders thinks the simple burden of too little money can wear down
the hardiest spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read somewhere that the average CEO gets 700 times the
salary of the average line worker. I'm not a big political thinker,
but I had a run of luck, I guess I'll call it bad luck, when I was
in my 20s (he's 41 now) and bouncing around from job to job _
slaughterhouse to roofer to doorman in Beverly Hills. The
cumulative effect was to convince me that even on the material
level, a person can be greatly reduced by strife and hard work. And
the good things in life are less accessible when you're working
your ass off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the trick is to recognize (poverty's) manifestation in
each generation. It's certainly not The Grapes of Wrath in our
country now, but there's still something off.''
</P>
<P>
   Love those losers
</P>
<P>
   Saunders has a gift for making us care about his outcasts and
weirdos. Not since Ignatius J. Reilly and company in John Kennedy
Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces has their been a band of
dunderheads so delightful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End of FIRPO in the World'' features a kid so dorky that
even his mother makes fun of him, and yet by the time something
really bad happens to him in the story, it feels like a death in
your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barber's Unhappiness'' tracks the movements of a man whose
lechery seems boundless. (The character is based on a real person
Saunders knew who ogled women without shame, including Saunders'
wife.) But somehow Saunders finds his humanity, shapes him into a
man who just might be capable of loving an imperfect female.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falls'' walks down two paths, following two men to a
destiny that will reveal them as cowardly or courageous. One finds
strength within; the other is paralyzed by his instinct for
self-preservation; and yet the line that divides their characters
is almost invisible. They are both, after all, only human.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the really interesting thing in the human story is
people's belief that the self we create is permanent and solid and
defensible. But in fact, as we know, in another 90 years or so,
none of us is going to be here in any form; the bodies are going to
go, the minds are going to go long before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it seems to me that one thing you can count on in writing
is to exploit our tendency to be silly and greedy and narcissistic
and self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of timeless, isn't it?''

<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the the Aspen Institute and
its Wye River Conference Center in Maryland, where Elian Gonzalez
and his father were taken?
</P>
<P>
   A: The institute describes itself as ``a global forum that
convenes leaders from diverse disciplines to address critical
issues that confront societies, organizations and individuals.''
Founded in 1950, the nonprofit institute has offices in Aspen,
Colo.; Chicago; New York; Santa Barbara, Calif.; Queenstown, Md.;
and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Conference Centers overlook the Wye River on
Maryland's Eastern Shore. They encompass three retreats with their
own meeting and dining rooms, accommodations, and recreational
facilities. Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, are said to
be housed at Carmichael Farm, about a mile north of the Wye River
Plantation and away from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The complex has provided a secluded, secure location for
everything from congressional and business retreats to seminars
and, in 1998, the Middle East peace talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
hosted by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we buy tickets to the All-Star Game July 11 in
Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: An announcement about ticket sales will be made by the
Atlanta Braves on or around May 25, according to Major League
Baseball. Near that time, call 404-522-7630 or check online at
www.majorleaguebaseball.com or www.atlantabraves.com for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I distinctly remember reading months ago about a mass mailing
by Social Security of everyone's current statement of earnings. But
I have yet to receive mine. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration started mailing Earnings
Benefit Statements to everyone 25 and older last October, said
agency spokeswoman Patti Patterson. They are sent out about three
months before each person's birthday, and will be mailed
automatically, once a year, on the same schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing your birth date, she couldn't speculate on your
particular statement, but she said you can do what anyone has
always been able to do: Call 1-800-772-1213 and request a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to leave my body to Emory University for research, but
I also am listing myself as an organ donor. Is there a conflict?
Can I do only one or the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: At most medical schools, you cannot donate organs and tissues
for transplantation and then donate the rest of your body for
anatomical study, said Jeff Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on
Donation and Lifelink of Georgia. So you must decide which you want
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that Princess Juliana of the Netherlands was
91. Isn't she the queen mother? Why was she referred to as
princess, since at one time she actually was the queen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's correct to refer to her as Princess Juliana, said a
spokeswoman at the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry of
Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina was born
on April 30, 1909. She was princess until she became queen on Sept.
6, 1948, when her mother abdicated. Then on April 30, 1980, by her
own wish, Juliana abdicated in favor of Beatrix, the oldest of her
four daughters with Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, whom she
married in 1937. When she abdicated, her title once again became
princess. She often is referred to simply as Juliana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that onions grown in a specific geographic area are
called Vidalia onions. Is there any difference between them and
sweet onions grown outside that area?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would seem so. This geographic area of Georgia is unique
in its soil type, rainfall patterns and other climatic conditions,
said Reid Torrence, University of Georgia Extension Service
coordinator in Tattnall County, which is in the heart of Vidalia
onion country. Those conditions allow for the production of onions
that are far milder than those grown in other parts of the state,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, research tests have shown that onions grown in the
Vidalia region are less pungent than onions produced anywhere else
in the world, Torrence added. Pungency in onions is related to the
presence or absence of sulfur in the soil during various stages of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: In 1986, Georgia passed legislation giving Vidalia
onions legal status and defining the 20-county production area in
southeast Georgia. The Vidalia onion was named Georgia's official
state vegetable in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that members of Congress don't pay into Social
Security, but have their own retirement plan. How does that work,
and how much do they collect from it?
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. senators and representatives began paying into Social
Security in 1983, as part of a government-wide pension overhaul.
This is a requirement, and members may not opt out of it.
</P>
<P>
   They then have the option of participating in one of two pension
plans, depending upon when they were elected. If before 1984, they
participate in the Civil Service Retirement System; if in 1984 and
after, in the Federal Employee Retirement System. These two plans
also are offered to rank-and-file federal nonmilitary employees,
except that the congressional plan's benefit is calculated on a
more generous formula.
</P>
<P>
   Also, members of Congress may participate in the government-wide
Thrift Savings Plan, which works like a federally managed 401(k)
salary reduction plan. Federal Employee Retirement System
participants are entitled to a government match of up to 5 percent
of salary; Civil Service Retirement System participants may set
aside 5 percent of their own salary, but they don't receive the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers pay 8 percent of their salaries into the pension
system. This compensates for only about one-fifth of the typical
lifetime benefit, according to the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   With service of 20-25 years, a member of Congress could retire
with up to 80 percent of final salary, said the NTU's Pete Sepp.
The only cap on how fast their benefits rise is the rate of
increase in the Consumer Price Index. Congressional pensions can
exceed a member's final salary, but only after a few years in
retirement, when cost-of-living adjustments begin to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Regarding the three judges on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals who ruled on the Elian Gonzalez case: Who appointed them?
Were they all Nixon appointees?
</P>
<P>
   A: None were appointed by President Richard Nixon. The order
keeping Elian in the United States until his appeals are exhausted
was issued by Judges J.L. Edmondson, Joel Dubina and Charles
Wilson. Edmondson was appointed by Ronald Reagan; Dubina by George
Bush; and Wilson by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After seeing ``Thunderheart,'' I'm curious about actor Graham
Greene, who also was in ``Dances With Wolves.'' What can you tell
me about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: A full-blooded Oneida, Greene is one of Canada's most
celebrated actors. He was born in Ohsweken, Ontario, on June 22,
1952. He was a draftsman, civil technologist and steelworker before
launching his acting career. After several outings on the English
stage in the '80s, he returned to Canada and was cast in the
British film ``Revolution,'' with Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Greene subsequently was involved in theater productions in
Toronto, working often in productions of Native Earth Performing
Arts and appearing on TV programs and in films. His big break came
when he met Kevin Costner, who told him, ``Don't cut your hair.
We'll be in touch.'' Greene's performance as Kicking Bird in
``Dances With Wolves'' earned him an Academy Award nomination for
best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has had roles in a number of films, including the
1999 adaption of Steven King's ``The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often reported that President John Kennedy established
the Peace Corps. Wasn't Hubert Humphrey also instrumental in its
creation? Also, didn't Kennedy borrow the statement ``Ask not what
your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country''
from someone else?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea of establishing an ``army'' of Americans to work for
peace dates to 1904, when the American philosopher William James
proposed it in a speech. In 1910, he developed the idea of a youth
peace army more fully in a pamphlet. After World War II, many
groups set up international work camps modeled on the American
Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1960, Sen. Richard Neuberger (D-Ore.) and Rep. Henry
Reuss (D-Wis.) asked Congress to study the possibilities of a youth
corps program. Later than year, Sen. Humphrey (D-Minn.) proposed
that Congress create a peace corps. Then Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.)
picked up the proposal, using it in his 1960 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   About the famous ``ask not'' quotation, it's similar in spirit
to a remark Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made on May 30, 1884, in
Keene, N.H.: ``We pause to . . . recall what our country has done
for each of us and to ask ourselves what we can do for our country
in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the first increase in Social Security benefits based
on a cost-of-living adjustment? What has been the annual percentage
increase since 1985?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first increase was in June 1979. Since 1985, these have
been the increases (year, percentage): 1985, 3.1; 1986, 1.3; 1987,
4.2; 1988, 4; 1989, 4.7; 1990, 5.4; 1991, 3.7; 1992, 3; 1993, 2.6;
1994, 2.8; 1995, 2.6; 1996, 2.9; 1997, 2.1; 1998, 1.3; and 1999,
2.4.

<P>
   HERTFORD, N.C. _ Joe Garner works on all foreign model cars. He
does paint work on all cars.
</P>
<P>
   But he only restores Volkswagens.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to spot his workplace next to his home on U.S. Highway
17 S. About 140 Volkswagens, mostly bugs, await their fate in the
yard surrounding the business.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 will be restored, and the others will be scrapped for
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Beetles, you can find early- and late-model buses,
super beetle convertibles, jeep models, the sporty Carmen Ghias,
Baha dune buggies, kit cars and a few other foreign-model cars.
</P>
<P>
   A customer from the Outer Banks leaves his super beetle for
Garner to repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful, it's my baby,'' the customer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that's got them calls them their 'baby,''' says
Garner.
</P>
<P>
   He's been restoring Volkswagens for about 25 years. His work
began with the second car he ever owned, a 1964 Baha bug. The
inability to afford a mechanic forced him to learn to repair it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a hobby,'' Garner says.
</P>
<P>
   He rented his first hobby shop in Weeksville. There, he started
buying and restoring old bugs for himself. Once restored, he had a
difficult time keeping one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd fix it, then somebody would see it and he'd have to have
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Garner relies on his Toyota and Dodge trucks for everyday use.
He won't keep a bug for himself because he feels it defeats the
job. He's got a wife and four daughters that come first, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's money,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is a Toyota, second is a Honda.''
</P>
<P>
   He does have a suped-up beetle and a 20-foot long sand-rail dune
buggy that, if he chose, he could ride on his three acres behind
the shop. The sand rail has never been ridden, and both cars can be
sold at any time, he says.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Janet, shares Garner's passion for Volkswagens. She'll
go to the shows with him. His 14-year-old daughter is waiting to
drive a 1960 convertible model.
</P>
<P>
   Beetles can be fully restored for about $6,000, Garner says.
Full restoration takes about a year. Restoring special models can
cost anywhere from $900 to $1,400. All parts are still produced. In
fact, because the vehicles are so cheap to produce, third world
countries have bought the right to manufacture them. Mexico City is
one place that breeds the bugs. At each place, the German auto is
designed slightly differently as far as cosmetics, Garner says.
</P>
<P>
   Garner doesn't have a favorite, but he generally prefers the
older models, he says. People will buy them upon his
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer anything from 1967 on down,'' he says. He points to
one bug with glass over the headlights. ``The older car looks
better to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cars waiting to be restored include a Porsche 914.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the poor man's Porsche'' he says. ``It's got the same
motor as the bus, but it's a two-seater, so she'll scream.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one rare, jeep-style model called the Volkswagon Thing,
and a fiber-glass dune buggy that can hold two or four seats (''the
cartoon speed buggy'').
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kit cars are all Volkswagon underneath, the front end
and the rear end,'' he says. ``They just take the top half off the
Beetle.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a high demand for buses. Garner definitely can't keep
them on the lot. ``I get people all the time asking for the
buses,'' he says. ``But I don't know where to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   One model he hasn't restored yet is an old bus. He shows a
picture of one with the front windows opening out and long, narrow
windows along the side of the roof. ``The kind you steer with your
elbows,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Garner's goal now is for the business to expand. He's got
several handymen to assist, but he can't pay them yet. It's more of
an internship, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an investor there would be no wait,'' Garner says. ``The
handymen could earn a paycheck. We could do more. There's work
here, but it takes a while to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   One assistant, Jess Wood, attends College of the Albemarle. He's
busy cutting hoses to fit, cleaning air filters, and other jobs. He
also has the buggy passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nice cars,'' he says. ``You can make them look any way
you want them to look. And the girls like them.''

 &HT;    Actress bares her age
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You wouldn't normally think that an onstage nude
scene is the best way for an actress to strike a blow for feminism.
</P>
<P>
   But if your name is Kathleen Turner, and you're widely regarded
as a has-been at 45, you might feel differently.
</P>
<P>
   Too old for Hollywood? Not starved-looking enough?
</P>
<P>
   Turner is fighting back with a headline-grabbing turn as Mrs.
Robinson in the London production of The Graduate, including a
40-second nude scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my feeling was, 'Why not a 45-year-old woman naked
onstage?''' Turner recently told USA Today. ``I am shapely. I am
not 25. I'm not gorgeous _ some kind of model _ but I am a
good-looking 45-year-old woman.''
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased to report that my husband, after catching Turner's
show-stopping performance during our recent trip to London, is
profoundly committed to her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind all the postcards Jim mailed to all his old
frat-house buddies: ``I was in the same room with Kathleen Turner,
and she was 100 percent naked.'' I am convinced he is acting purely
out of feminist zeal. He even e-mailed all his friends a copy of a
Reuters story _ ``Let Over-40s Be Sexy _ Kathleen Turner'' _ he
pulled off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud to know that you are so fully secure in your
masculinity that you can support such a worthwhile cause,'' replied
his friend Don. ``Without supportive males like you (and me) where
would the performing arts be? I shudder to think of the tripe that
the theater community would be forced to perform. God bless
Kathleen Turner and her cause!''
</P>
<P>
   It all started when we stopped in at the Gielgud Theater on the
off chance of snaring tickets for the show that had opened only a
few days earlier. The buzz hadn't yet reached locust level, and a
few scattered seats remained for the show that, only a few days
later, would be sold out for the entire run.
</P>
<P>
   Naively, I asked about the age-appropriateness of the production
for our 8-year-old son. (Hey, maybe this was the Disney, G-rated
musical version of The Graduate.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there will be a naked woman onstage,'' said the ticket
seller, shrugging, in a suit-yourself voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sold!'' Jim cried, landing a seventh-row seat.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that this play would hold more aesthetic and cultural
value for Jim, I volunteered to be the one who stayed at the hotel
readingThe Chronicles of Narnia to Alec.
</P>
<P>
   Jim came back elated. Turner, he reported, hadn't lost one
degree of Body Heat _ she looked beautiful and fit _ and the show
itself was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is, by all accounts, loving her star turn as Mrs.
Robinson _ and her chance to thumb her nose at a Hollywood that
won't look twice at a woman unless she is under 40 and borderline
anorexic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day she (Mrs. Robinson) gets more interesting,'' Turner
told Hello! magazine. ``More and more I find, in the U.S.A. anyway,
when a woman is over 40 and attractive and strong, then she must be
evil ... either she is that or terribly frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's something gratifying, for us 40-somethings, about an
international sensation caused by an actress who refuses to be
relegated to matron status.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jim, his theatrical coup has completely eclipsed all our
other adventures in England. Nobody wants to hear about the Tower
of London; everybody wants to hear about Kathleen Turner in the
flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the culmination of a 20-year dream,'' Jim raved to
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   By which he means, of course, finally seeing Kathleen Turner in
a role worthy of her mature theatrical talents.

<P>
   Q: Somewhere I believe I heard that Sen. John McCain's father
was an admiral in the U.S. Navy. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but the military heritage goes back even further. McCain
(R-Ariz.) comes from a long line of military commanders dating to
Capt. William Young, an ancestor who served on the staff of Gen.
George Washington during the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's father, Adm. John S. McCain Jr., was commander-in-chief
of all U.S. armed forces in the Pacific during the Vietnam War. A
much-decorated submarine commander in World War II, he led the U.S.
amphibious force that invaded the Dominican Republic in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's paternal grandfather, Adm. John Sidney McCain,
served in both world wars, becoming commander of all the aircraft
carriers in the Pacific in the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all: The grandfather's brother was an Army
brigadier general, and his uncle was an Army major general.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain (1884-1945) and McCain Jr. (1911-81) were the first
father and son to become full admirals in U.S. Navy history.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the roles of Congress and the president in awarding
the Medal of Honor? What is the correct name, simply the Medal of
Honor, or the Congressional Medal of Honor? And when did the medals
originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Medal of Honor was established on Dec. 21, 1861, by
President Abraham Lincoln for enlisted men of the Navy and Marine
Corps, and later was expanded to include enlisted men and officers
of all services.
</P>
<P>
   The highest military award for gallantry in action that the
United States grants to members of its armed forces, it usually is
awarded by the president ``in the name of the Congress of the
United States.'' That's why it often is incorrectly called the
Congressional Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the latest on Dr. Jerri Nielsen, who was stationed at
the South Pole when she diagnosed her own breast cancer? She had to
wait several months to leave the Pole because severe weather
prohibited access to her camp. She finally was rescued last fall,
but I haven't seen anything reported since.
</P>
<P>
   A: After she was plucked from the Pole Oct. 15 by the 109th
Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard, she was flown to
Indiana University where the tumor was removed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, she has made plans, with the help of a
professional writer, to tell the story about her life on the ice,
her feelings of helplessness as an ill caregiver, and her reasons
for taking the job in the first place. Nielsen has received a
``high six-figure payment,'' according to Hilary Bass, publicist
for Talk Miramax Books. Nielsen's story is to be published this
fall and serialized in Talk magazine, and she also has optioned the
rights to her story to Miramax Films.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue effort reportedly cost taxpayers more than $500,000,
but Maj. Bob Bullock of the New York Air National Guard said money
isn't a factor in such rescues. ``We don't put a value on human
life in terms of dollars and cents,'' he said, adding that
performing such flights ``is part of our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Congress recently passed the unlimited income bill for Social
Security recipients, and President Clinton said he would sign it.
Did that happen? If so, how far back is it retroactive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton signed the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of
2000 into law on April 7. It eliminates the Social Security
retirement earnings test in and after the month in which a person
attains full retirement age (currently 65).
</P>
<P>
   The repeal is retroactive to Jan. 1, which means that about
415,000 working seniors or dependents will get refunds for the
money already deducted this year from their Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available at Social Security offices and can be
found online at www.ssa.gov/legislation/legisbulletin040700.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a player selects the cash option for the Big Game, how
does the lottery board determine the amount the winner will be
paid? Of the advertised annuitized jackpot, how much would a winner
choosing cash option actually get?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cash option amount for the Big Game is based on sales and
current interest rates for each drawing. Since prevailing interest
rates and sales differ with every drawing, an exact figure for the
cash value of a hypothetical drawing can't be given in advance. For
example, two drawings six months apart with an estimated $30
million annuity amount may differ in sales and/or interest rates,
so the cash option value also would vary, even though the estimated
annuity amount is the same.
</P>
<P>
   You can get an idea of amounts, however, if you consider the Big
Game jackpot won by a Georgia couple in January. The advertised
annuity amount, based on taking the winnings over a period of 26
years, was $46 million. The couple chose instead to take the money
at once, making their winning amount $22.4 million. Of that, they
paid $7.6 million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has President Clinton answered the disbarment complaint made
against him by the Southeastern Legal Foundation? An article said
April 21 was the deadline. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   A: An administration official has indicated that Clinton met the
deadline. But more than likely it will be the middle of May before
much more is known.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Arkansas Supreme Court's committee on
professional conduct declined to comment, saying the matter is
confidential. But Matt Glavin of the Southeastern Legal Foundation
explained the process.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, the deadline for Clinton's response to the
foundation's disbarment complaint was Friday. The committee is
required to get a copy of the president's response to the
foundation within 10 days, Glavin said. If the president responded
with a defense and the foundation gets that copy within 10 days, it
will have seven days to reply. Then the complaint will go to the
committee members for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The committee probably will vote by May 18 on whether to disbar
Clinton, or what the sanctions should be ``for lying under oath and
obstruction of justice,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   When the foundation gets a copy of Clinton's response, that is a
privileged document and won't be released to the press by the
foundation. But the foundation will release its own response to it,
Glavin added, and from that it can be deduced what Clinton's
response was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide information about procedures for requesting
practice round tickets for next year's Masters golf tournament?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 2001 practice rounds will be April 2-4. Applicants are
allocated tickets on a random selection basis. Tickets will be sold
in advance, and by application only.
</P>
<P>
   Practice round applications for 2001 will be mailed beginning in
May to those people who applied in 1999 and 2000, or who have
requested practice round information. Others may request an
application by submitting their full name, address, daytime
telephone number and Social Security number to: Masters Tournament,
Practice Rounds, P.O. Box 2047, Augusta, GA 30903-2047.
Applications being returned to Augusta National must be postmarked
by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   To hear recorded information, call 706-667-6700 and follow the
prompts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Q&AMP;A item about obtaining tickets for Masters practice
rounds indicated that applicants were asked to provide their Social
Security number, along with other information. Can you clear up,
once and for all, whether it is or is not against the law to
request one's Social Security number?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration says you can refuse to
provide your Social Security number if a business or other
enterprise asks for it. However, that may mean doing without the
purchase or service for which your number was requested. The agency
says you're welcome to ask why your number is needed, how your
number will be used, what law requires you to give your number, and
what the consequences are if you refuse. The answers to these
questions can help you decide if you want to give your Social
Security number. The decision is yours.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that it can't prevent others from asking for your
number _ and it can't control what uses are made of your number
once you give it to someone else _ the Social Security
Administration says you should know that giving it to them does not
give them access to your Social Security records. The privacy of
your records is guaranteed unless disclosure to another government
agency is required by law, or the information is needed to conduct
Social Security or other government health or welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be found online at
www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought the first three digits of a person's Social
Security number referred to their state. But when I was filling out
my income tax return, I noticed that the number of one of my
children begins with 253, and the other two with 257. All three
were born in Atlanta. Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``area numbers'' _ the first three-digit field in the
nine-digit numbers _ are assigned to geographic locations,
according to the Social Security Administration. Those for Georgia
are 252 through 260. So your children's numbers are right in there.
</P>
<P>
   Area numbers assigned before 1972 indicate the Social Security
office that originally issued the number. Since 1972, the area
number corresponds to the residence address given by the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information about the structure of Social Security
numbers can be found online at this address:
www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/ssn/ssn.structure.html.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about the the Aspen Institute and
its Wye River Conference Center in Maryland, where Elian Gonzalez
and his father were taken?
</P>
<P>
   A: The institute describes itself as ``a global forum that
convenes leaders from diverse disciplines to address critical
issues that confront societies, organizations and individuals.''
Founded in 1950, the nonprofit institute has offices in Aspen,
Colo.; Chicago; New York; Santa Barbara, Calif.; Queenstown, Md.;
and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Conference Centers overlook the Wye River on
Maryland's Eastern Shore. They encompass three retreats with their
own meeting and dining rooms, accommodations, and recreational
facilities. Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, are said to
be housed at Carmichael Farm, about a mile north of the Wye River
Plantation and away from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The complex has provided a secluded, secure location for
everything from congressional and business retreats to seminars
and, in 1998, the Middle East peace talks between Israeli Prime
Minister Bnjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
hosted by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we buy tickets to the All-Star Game July 11 in
Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A: An announcement about ticket sales will be made by the
Atlanta Braves on or around May 25, according to Major League
Baseball. Near that time, call 404-522-7630 or check online at
www.majorleaguebaseball.com or www.atlantabraves.com for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I distinctly remember reading months ago about a mass mailing
by Social Security of everyone's current statement of earnings. But
I have yet to receive mine. Can you update me?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration started mailing Earnings
Benefit Statements to everyone 25 and older last October, said
agency spokeswoman Patti Patterson. They are sent out about three
months before each person's birthday, and will be mailed
automatically, once a year, on the same schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing your birth date, she couldn't speculate on your
particular statement, but she said you can do what anyone has
always been able to do: Call 1-800-772-1213 and request a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to leave my body to Emory University for research, but
I also am listing myself as an organ donor. Is there a conflict?
Can I do only one or the other?
</P>
<P>
   A: At most medical schools, you cannot donate organs and tissues
for transplantation and then donate the rest of your body for
anatomical study, said Jeff Al-Mashat of the Georgia Coalition on
Donation and Lifelink of Georgia. So you must decide which you want
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that Princess Juliana of the Netherlands was
91. Isn't she the queen mother? Why was she referred to as
princess, since at one time she actually was the queen?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's correct to refer to her as Princess Juliana, said a
spokeswoman at the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry of
Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Juliana Louise Emma Marie Wilhelmina was born
on April 30, 1909. She was princess until she became queen on Sept.
6, 1948, when her mother abdicated. Then on April 30, 1980, by her
own wish, Juliana abdicated in favor of Beatrix, the oldest of her
four daughters with Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, whom she
married in 1937. When she abdicated, her title once again became
princess. She often is referred to simply as Juliana.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that onions grown in a specific geographic area are
called Vidalia onions. Is there any difference between them and
sweet onions grown outside that area?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would seem so. This geographic area of Georgia is unique
in its soil type, rainfall patterns and other climatic conditions,
said Reid Torrence, University of Georgia Extension Service
coordinator in Tattnall County, which is in the heart of Vidalia
onion country. Those conditions allow for the production of onions
that are far milder than those grown in other parts of the state,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, research tests have shown that onions grown in the
Vidalia region are less pungent than onions produced anywhere else
in the world, Torrence added. Pungency in onions is related to the
presence or absence of sulfur in the soil during various stages of
production.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting: In 1986, Georgia passed legislation giving Vidalia
onions legal status and defining the 20-county production area in
southeast Georgia. The Vidalia onion was named Georgia's official
state vegetable in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that members of Congress don't pay into Social
Security, but have their own retirement plan. How does that work,
and how much do they collect from it?
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. senators and representatives began paying into Social
Security in 1983, as part of a government-wide pension overhaul.
This is a requirement, and members may not opt out of it.
</P>
<P>
   They then have the option of participating in one of two pension
plans, depending upon when they were elected. If before 1984, they
participate in the Civil Service Retirement System; if in 1984 and
after, in the Federal Employee Retirement System. These two plans
also are offered to rank-and-file federal nonmilitary employees,
except that the congressional plan's benefit is calculated on a
more generous formula.
</P>
<P>
   Also, members of Congress may participate in the government-wide
Thrift Savings Plan, which works like a federally managed 401(k)
salary reduction plan. Federal Employee Retirement System
participants are entitled to a government match of up to 5 percent
of salary; Civil Service Retirement System participants may set
aside 5 percent of their own salary, but they don't receive the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers pay 8 percent of their salaries into the pension
system. This compensates for only about one-fifth of the typical
lifetime benefit, according to the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   With service of 20-25 years, a member of Congress could retire
with up to 80 percent of final salary, said the NTU's Pete Sepp.
The only cap on how fast their benefits rise is the rate of
increase in the Consumer Price Index. Congressional pensions can
exceed a member's final salary, but only after a few years in
retirement, when cost-of-living adjustments begin to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Regarding the three judges on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals who ruled on the Elian Gonzalez case: Who appointed them?
Were they all Nixon appointees?
</P>
<P>
   A: None were appointed by President Richard Nixon. The order
keeping Elian in the United States until his appeals are exhausted
was issued by Judges J.L. Edmondson, Joel Dubina and Charles
Wilson. Edmondson was appointed by Ronald Reagan; Dubina by George
Bush; and Wilson by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After seeing ``Thunderheart,'' I'm curious about actor Graham
Greene, who also was in ``Dances With Wolves.'' What can you tell
me about him?
</P>
<P>
   A: A full-blooded Oneida, Greene is one of Canada's most
celebrated actors. He was born in Ohsweken, Ontario, on June 22,
1952. He was a draftsman, civil technologist and steelworker before
launching his acting career. After several outings on the English
stage in the '80s, he returned to Canada and was cast in the
British film ``Revolution,'' with Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   Greene subsequently was involved in theater productions in
Toronto, working often in productions of Native Earth Performing
Arts and appearing on TV programs and in films. His big break came
when he met Kevin Costner, who told him, ``Don't cut your hair.
We'll be in touch.'' Greene's performance as Kicking Bird in
``Dances With Wolves'' earned him an Academy Award nomination for
best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has had roles in a number of films, including the
1999 adaption of Steven King's ``The Green Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often reported that President John Kennedy established
the Peace Corps. Wasn't Hubert Humphrey also instrumental in its
creation? Also, didn't Kennedy borrow the statement ``Ask not what
your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country''
from someone else?
</P>
<P>
   A: The idea of establishing an ``army'' of Americans to work for
peace dates to 1904, when the American philosopher William James
proposed it in a speech. In 1910, he developed the idea of a youth
peace army more fully in a pamphlet. After World War II, many
groups set up international work camps modeled on the American
Friends Service Committee, a Quaker organization.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1960, Sen. Richard Neuberger (D-Ore.) and Rep. Henry
Reuss (D-Wis.) asked Congress to study the possibilities of a youth
corps program. Later than year, Sen. Humphrey (D-Minn.) proposed
that Congress create a peace corps. Then Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.)
picked up the proposal, using it in his 1960 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   About the famous ``ask not'' quotation, it's similar in spirit
to a remark Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made on May 30, 1884, in
Keene, N.H.: ``We pause to . . . recall what our country has done
for each of us and to ask ourselves what we can do for our country
in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was the first increase in Social Security benefits based
on a cost-of-living adjustment? What has been the annual percentage
increase since 1985?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first increase was in June 1979. Since 1985, these have
been the increases (year, percentage): 1985, 3.1; 1986, 1.3; 1987,
4.2; 1988, 4; 1989, 4.7; 1990, 5.4; 1991, 3.7; 1992, 3; 1993, 2.6;
1994, 2.8; 1995, 2.6; 1996, 2.9; 1997, 2.1; 1998, 1.3; and 1999,
2.4.

   The rescue effort reportedly cost taxpayers more than $500,000,
but Maj. Bob Bullock of the New York Air National Guard said money
isn't a factor in such rescues. ``We don't put a value on human
life in terms of dollars and cents,'' he said, adding that
performing such flights ``is part of our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Congress recently passed the unlimited income bill for Social
Security recipients, and President Clinton said he would sign it.
Did that happen? If so, how far back is it retroactive?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton signed the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of
2000 into law on April 7. It eliminates the Social Security
retirement earnings test in and after the month in which a person
attains full retirement age (currently 65).
</P>
<P>
   The repeal is retroactive to Jan. 1, which means that about
415,000 working seniors or dependents will get refunds for the
money already deducted this year from their Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
   Details are available at Social Security offices and can be
found online at www.ssa.gov/legislation/legisbulletin040700.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If a player selects the cash option for the Big Game, how
does the lottery board determine the amount the winner will be
paid? Of the advertised annuitized jackpot, how much would a winner
choosing cash option actually get?
</P>
<P>
   A: The cash option amount for the Big Game is based on sales and
current interest rates for each drawing. Since prevailing interest
rates and sales differ with every drawing, an exact figure for the
cash value of a hypothetical drawing can't be given in advance. For
example, two drawings six months apart with an estimated $30
million annuity amount may differ in sales and/or interest rates,
so the cash option value also would vary, even though the estimated
annuity amount is the same.
</P>
<P>
   You can get an idea of amounts, however, if you consider the Big
Game jackpot won by a Georgia couple in January. The advertised
annuity amount, based on taking the winnings over a period of 26
years, was $46 million. The couple chose instead to take the money
at once, making their winning amount $22.4 million. Of that, they
paid $7.6 million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has President Clinton answered the disbarment complaint made
against him by the Southeastern Legal Foundation? An article said
April 21 was the deadline. What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   A: An administration official has indicated that Clinton met the
deadline. But more than likely it will be the middle of May before
much more is known.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Arkansas Supreme Court's committee on
professional conduct declined to comment, saying the matter is
confidential. But Matt Glavin of the Southeastern Legal Foundation
explained the process.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, the deadline for Clinton's response to the
foundation's disbarment complaint was Friday. The committee is
required to get a copy of the president's response to the
foundation within 10 days, Glavin said. If the president responded
with a defense and the foundation gets that copy within 10 days, it
will have seven days to reply. Then the complaint will go to the
committee members for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The committee probably will vote by May 18 on whether to disbar
Clinton, or what the sanctions should be ``for lying under oath and
obstruction of justice,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   When the foundation gets a copy of Clinton's response, that is a
privileged document and won't be released to the press by the
foundation. But the foundation will release its own response to it,
Glavin added, and from that it can be deduced what Clinton's
response was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide information about procedures for requesting
practice round tickets for next year's Masters golf tournament?
</P>
<P>
   A: The 2001 practice rounds will be April 2-4. Applicants are
allocated tickets on a random selection basis. Tickets will be sold
in advance, and by application only.
</P>
<P>
   Practice round applications for 2001 will be mailed beginning in
May to those people who applied in 1999 and 2000, or who have
requested practice round information. Others may request an
application by submitting their full name, address, daytime
telephone number and Social Security number to: Masters Tournament,
Practice Rounds, P.O. Box 2047, Augusta, GA 30903-2047.
Applications being returned to Augusta National must be postmarked
by July 15.
</P>
<P>
   To hear recorded information, call 706-667-6700 and follow the
prompts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Q&AMP;A item about obtaining tickets for Masters practice
rounds indicated that applicants were asked to provide their Social
Security number, along with other information. Can you clear up,
once and for all, whether it is or is not against the law to
request one's Social Security number?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Social Security Administration says you can refuse to
provide your Social Security number if a business or other
enterprise asks for it. However, that may mean doing without the
purchase or service for which your number was requested. The agency
says you're welcome to ask why your number is needed, how your
number will be used, what law requires you to give your number, and
what the consequences are if you refuse. The answers to these
questions can help you decide if you want to give your Social
Security number. The decision is yours.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that it can't prevent others from asking for your
number _ and it can't control what uses are made of your number
once you give it to someone else _ the Social Security
Administration says you should know that giving it to them does not
give them access to your Social Security records. The privacy of
your records is guaranteed unless disclosure to another government
agency is required by law, or the information is needed to conduct
Social Security or other government health or welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   More information can be found online at
www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought the first three digits of a person's Social
Security number referred to their state. But when I was filling out
my income tax return, I noticed that the number of one of my
children begins with 253, and the other two with 257. All three
were born in Atlanta. Why the difference?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``area numbers'' _ the first three-digit field in the
nine-digit numbers _ are assigned to geographic locations,
according to the Social Security Administration. Those for Georgia
are 252 through 260. So your children's numbers are right in there.
</P>
<P>
   Area numbers assigned before 1972 indicate the Social Security
office that originally issued the number. Since 1972, the area
number corresponds to the residence address given by the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Detailed information about the structure of Social Security
numbers can be found online at this address:
www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/ssn/ssn.structure.html.

 &HT;    I'll keep my cheap beer, thank youBy John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I find it a little goofy that the federal
government is blaming cheap beer for causing gonorrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean I should switch exclusively to high dollar Fat
Tire and other brands that cost you $6 to $7 a six-pack? What's
wrong with picking up a six-pack of Busch Tall Boys for $3.29 every
once in a while? Is Uncle Sam trying to turn us all into a bunch of
Bass Ale-belching suds snobs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that Milwaukee's Best killed anything that
ailed you,'' said a friend of mine who carts the cheapest beer he
can find to University of TexasLonghorn football games.
</P>
<P>
   But despite what my friends and I know about the health benefits
of drinking Lone Star, Keystone and other inexpensive brands, the
studies by the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
concluded that raising the tax on a six-pack of beer by 20 cents
could reduce gonorrhea by up to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that drinking beer leads to risky behavior among
youth. So raising beer prices this much will make it harder for
them to get beer.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. Raising the price of a six-pack by two dimes really
slowed me down when I was a kid. How many teen-agers do you know
who can't find an extra 20 cents to get loaded?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the government has statistics to back its
conjecture. From 1981 to 1995, researchers followed changes in
alcohol policy in all states. In years after increases in beer
taxes, gonorrhea rates usually dropped among youth. For example, in
1991 a 9-cent tax increase per six-pack in California was followed
by a 30 percent drop in gonorrhea in 15- to 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that the way to eliminate fat kids is to raise
the price of the cheeseburger Happy Meal from $2.29 to $2.38? I
don't want to sound like I'm practicing medicine. But maybe a
better solution than raising the price of beer would be to have the
beer man pass out condoms with every cold one at sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair to single out the budget beers for blame. What's
next? Is the CDC going to call for a tax increase on all jug wines
that come with a twist-off cap? Trust me. You can get just as
stupid from sucking down a $7.19 six-pack of Guinness Extra Stout
as you can from inhaling a $2.69 six-pack of Schlitz.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as my friend so aptly put it, ``They may have the surgeon
general putting a clap warning on Pearl.''

 &HT;    Scientific research is busy tracing human DNA to the original
parents
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Baptist leaders at Baylor University are
establishing a think tank to see if they can use scientific methods
to validate the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a crude way of putting it. The supporters of this
controversial project are touchy about the way it is described.
Some critics have said the university is attempting to promote
creationism, the belief that the earth was created exactly as it is
described in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's administration, however, says the think tank will
attempt to build a bridge between religion and science.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the new think tank, called the Michael Polanyi
Center, promotes the argument of intelligent design, a discourse
that holds that some natural phenomena are so complex that their
existence is evidence of an intelligent creator. He uses statistics
to show that such phenomena can't be attributed to random chance.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that if all statisticians were laid end
to end, it would be a good thing. But that's another subject.
</P>
<P>
   While people are working themselves into a froth over whether
Baylor is forcing an unholy union between science and religion, a
dedicated group of scientists scattered around the globe are
gathering proof that all humans descended from one original father
and one original mother, Adam and Eve.
</P>
<P>
   These geneticists are using DNA to track the origins of the
human species. They have determined, according to a New York Times
article by Nicholas Wade, that all the people in the world are
descended from 10 sons of the genetic Adam and 18 daughters of the
genetic Eve.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of children, which may be why it was called
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The genetic scientists also have determined that the original
Adam and Eve lived in Africa, perhaps somewhere between the
central, southern and eastern portions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   It's fascinating to learn that scientists can use DNA to trace
ancestral lineage that shows the migration patterns of our early
family members out of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One group of scientists uses mitochondrial DNA, which is
described as tiny rings of genetic material that come from the egg
cell, and which traces the maternal line to one of 18 daughters of
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of scientists use the Y chromosome to trace the
family tree for men back to one of the 10 sons of Adam.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists don't know the names of the individuals who gave
all humans their genetic heritage, but the names Adam and Eve are
convenient and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA branches are referred to as the daughters of Eve and the
sons of Adam.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the branches trace their roots back to Africa, the
scientists have used mitochondrial DNA testing of existing African
populations that remain closest to the ancestral origins of humans.
They found the Biaka pygmies of Central Africa and the Vasikela
Kung of southern Africa as being genetically closest to humans'
ancestral origins.
</P>
<P>
   The single main lineage that began in Africa split into three
branches. The youngest branch, which is common in East Africa, is
believed to be the source of both the European and Asian lineages.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans have genetic lineages that come primarily from
Asia in several migrations but also from Europe, arriving in
America between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago. Sioux and Ojibwa
tribes, among other northern peoples, have DNA that show a European
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   A private company, Oxford Ancestors, has a business that for
$180 will determine for European descendants which of the seven
daughters of Eve who populated Europe they are descended from.
</P>
<P>
   These scientific discoveries should give Baylor University's new
think tank something to think about.

WHEN THE ANCESTORS MOVE IN  
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The house was already turning into a museum, and now we have a
piano. No current resident has need for a piano, nor any working
knowledge of one, but how could we not take it in?
</P>
<P>
   For many years it presided in a serene living room in Woodland,
Calif., where my mother-in-law would on occasion shyly agree to sit
down and play for family members. She always added the necessary
footnote about the foolishness of a woman in her 70s taking piano
lessons. But we knew she was almost as proud of what she achieved
on those keys as she was of possessing such a fine beauty.
</P>
<P>
   After she died, followed six weeks to the day by my
father-in-law, the children slowly emptied their house, quickly
disposing of easy things like appliances but reluctant to part with
sentimental favorites. The piano stayed, but now the house is to be
occupied by new people who will want to make their own sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The piano is in our guest room, which I guess we will now call
the piano room.
</P>
<P>
   There's little space left for guests, anyhow, seeing as how the
room also contains a baby's high chair, vacated 15 years ago by the
youngest grandchild and also a part of our newly acquired Woodland
group.
</P>
<P>
   Also in that room we have portions of the Pennsylvania
collection, that being the furniture group that moved in after my
parents died. This includes a child's desk built by my father and
painted by my mother. There's also a wingback chair, three
generations old at least. I visualize it one day dressed in maroon
colored velvet but now its gaudy 1950s style turquoise sits in a
corner fading in the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   All of these pieces wait, maybe for our children to find a spot
for someday, maybe for their children. Perhaps some Martha Stewart
type will envision the high chair as a plant holder. Who knows when
and how they will come alive again?
</P>
<P>
   All we know is that they can't be left to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room there is a Pennsylvania hutch and a rocking
chair, now sharing space with two Woodland chairs and a coffee
table that was never meant to hold coffee. It's a low sleek model
of highly polished mahogany, the kind found in expensive furniture
stores holding nothing more than a copy of ``Architectural
Digest.'' We've loaded it up with piles of newspapers and books
which is our way of preserving the finish.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it works. Eventually you become the family
repository, responsible for things left behind, more precious in
memory than dollar value. Everyone gets a turn at this. One
generation departs. The next moves to the front of the line. They
get the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   You see the same additions in friends' houses. Suddenly there
appears a gold framed portrait of a woman from the 1930s staring
from the wall next to the French travel posters and Victorian style
end tables incongruously bracketing the couch where the dog always
sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   A few generations back our ancestors moved here with nothing,
just like immigrant families still do today. They eventually filled
homes with bookcases carved by hand and dining tables paid for on
the installment plan. Some things were deemed important enough to
pass on, like grandma's yellow chair, and they move around the
country to continue the family connection.
</P>
<P>
   A piano does not travel easily. Nor is it something you stash in
a garage or on the top shelf of a closet. It can't be dismissed to
a basement or attic. This one weighs 600 pounds and was delivered
by two professional piano handlers, both musicians who juggle
pianos on the side. They were very gentle and respectful of their
cargo, complimenting my mother-in-law's taste.
</P>
<P>
   One is also a piano tuner. The other has a band and sings. They
are not dispassionate about anything that makes music.
</P>
<P>
   A piano requires delicate handling, said the man named Dave.
Even though it's the size of a refrigerator it needs to be carried
like a baby bird. A great deal of huffing and puffing went into
getting it inside and finally placed. They treated it with such
respect I felt bad that it was not going to a place of honor with
some eager musician waiting to test the keyboard. Put it next to
the high chair, I said.
</P>
<P>
   That morning my sister-in-law and brother-in-law were in
Woodland for the final cleanup and to wave the piano off. When they
called to say it was en route Stephanie reported in a small voice,
``Everything's gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also said that when it arrived I should ask the delivery
man to play something. He'd given them one last tune.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have to ask. Explaining that he wanted to make sure the
piano had withstood the journey Dave pulled up a stool and asked if
I preferred pop or classical. I said he should play what he did in
the old house.
</P>
<P>
   So he settled his big moving man's hands on the keys and played
``As Time Goes By.''

   TEL AVIV - An Israeli orchestra's decision to break the national
taboo on playing music by composer Richard Wagner, whose
anti-Semitic writings inspired Adolf Hitler and whose music was
adopted by the Nazi movement, has set off an angry debate months
before the first-ever scheduled performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some Holocaust survivors say it is cruel to inflict the music
and its memories on the very people who found refuge in the Jewish
state after surviving Hitler's plan of genocide.
</P>

   ``Every orchestra has the right to play what they want, but
personally I feel that as long as we Holocaust survivors are here

composer, then Wagner should not be played,'' said Shevah Weiss,
65, a Holocaust survivor from Poland and former member of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands and thousands of musical creations and
symphonies that the orchestra can choose from. Why did they have to
pick Wagner?'' asked Weiss, now chairman of the Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The piece that the Israel Symphony Orchestra recently announced
it would play in October is ``Siegfried Idyll,'' which Wagner wrote
for his wife Cosima after the birth of their son Siegfried in 1869.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of Wagner's music, such as the long and heavily
Teutonic Ring cycle, the chosen piece has been described by music
critics as an exceptionally beautiful love song without the
anti-Semitic tone some see in his other works.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Israeli audiences have shown that they do not
differentiate between Wagner's love songs and the operas that are
heavy with the German nationalism and glorification of a new type
of man that anticipated 20th century Fascist ideology.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1981, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra started to play
an encore taken from Wagner's romantic opera ``Tristan and
Isolde,'' listeners erupted in anger. One person jumped on the
stage and showed the concentration camp number tattooed on his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the New Israeli Opera, during a lunchtime seminar
on Wagner's music, planned to have one of its singers perform a
piece from Wagner. But the audience shouted down the idea even
before the seminar moderator could give the song's title.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israel Symphony Orchestra is able to go ahead with its
program - and, given the angry debate and threats of protests,
nothing is certain - this would be the first time that Wagner's
music was played in public from start to finish in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to do something provocative, but the bottom
line is that more than 50 years after the Holocaust, I thought it
was the proper time to start playing Wagner in a delicate way,''
said Ehud Gross, director of the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music of Wagner does not belong to the Nazis, it belongs
to the world and there does come a time when what you have to do is
distinguish between art and politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel was founded in 1948, there has been an unofficial
ban on public performances of Wagner, although his music is
available in shops and even the state radio's music program on
occasion plays pieces by Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his notoriety as an anti-Semite - embodied in a pamphlet
Wagner wrote called ``Judaism in Music'' - many people hear in his
works profound psychological insights and beautiful music.
</P>
<P>
   Theodor Herzl, the father of modern Zionism, adored Wagner's
music, and the second Zionist congress in Basel, Switzerland, in
1898 included musical excerpts from the opera ``Tannhauser.''
</P>
<P>
   What poisoned Wagner's music for many people in Israel was not
his anti-Semitism as such - many famous composers, including Franz
Liszt and Frederic Chopin expressed such views - but how his music
and writings were used by Hitler to give cultural legitimacy to the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came here from all over to be Jews and of all the
things that they can hear they don't want to hear Wagner's
operas,'' said Eric Zamir, a journalist at The Jerusalem Post who
has closely followed the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The question some people in Israel now ask is when it will ever
be a good time to play Wagner. Some people say when the last
Holocaust survivor dies, but others ask about their children and
their grandchildren, who may also feel uncomfortable in memory of
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   One music specialist said that the issue might be less Wagner's
actual anti-Semitism - for example, another composer favored by the
Nazis, Richard Strauss, is now performed in Israel - and more that
this is the last real taboo in Israel relating to the Holocaust and
as such has become a symbol of its horrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in Israel who lived through the Holocaust clings to
this symbol as if, if they let go, people would forget the
Holocaust,'' said Michael Ajzenstadt, artistic administrator of the
New Israeli Opera.

LABOR LEADER POSES THREAT TO MUGABE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADOMA, Zimbabwe _ When the rally ended, Morgan Tsvangirai
didn't linger. His battered white pickup truck slipped through a
crowd still shouting his praise and disappeared into a maze of
cornfields, skirting the brick-wielding pro-government mobs lying
in wait along the tarred roads back toward town.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who is state enemy No. 1 in strife-torn Zimbabwe, such
acts of evasion are Tsvangirai's only concession to the danger he
faces daily in his electoral campaign to topple President Robert
Mugabe. Once safely out of town, he pulled off on the shoulder of a
darkened two-lane highway and jumped into a car to spar with
journalists on the two-hour ride back to Harare, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody phoned me, when was this, the night before last. This
guy phoned me, said `Are you Morgan?' I said yes. He said, `Oh, I'm
going to kill you.' I said, `People who kill people don't use
phones, they just shoot,''' Tsvangirai joked. His sandy voice was
raw from too many public speeches.
</P>
<P>
   His humor is neither act nor naivite. Tsvangirai galvanized a
limp and corrupt labor movement into the government's greatest
irritant, mobilizing workers against tax hikes and rising food
prices. Now, as leader of a recently formed opposition party, he
may just end Mugabe's 20-year lock on power.
</P>
<P>
   His gain has brought pain. Two years ago he was nearly beaten to
death. He's been imprisoned twice. Last month his driver was killed
in a roadside ambush. His family lives under armed guard. But
Tsvangirai still walks through Harare at will, protected _ at most
_ by a few aides or a bodyguard, and often alone. He refuses to be
intimidated and seldom wears a tie. He is motivated, his friends
say, by the people's desire for change.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai for president? It is not far-fetched. Two decades
after leading Zimbabwe to independence, Mugabe and his ruling party
are decidedly out of favor with voters. The government is riddled
with corruption, the econonmy is in tatters. Unemployment and
inflation both exceed 50 percent. Interest rates float at more than
70 percent. Despite this, Mugabe is diverting an estimated $6
million a month to prop up embattled Congelese President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   In February, voters, led by Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic
Change, delivered Mugabe his first ballot rebuke since 1980,
rejecting his proposed new constitution. Using a soccer analogy,
Tsvangirai said voters had given Mugabe a yellow card, or warning,
and would him a red card in the parliamentary election, throwing
him out of power.
</P>
<P>
   Stung, Mugabe unleashed veterans of the war for independence on
white farmers, resorting to violence and the issues of race and
land to stop Tsvangirai ahead of parliamentary elections, which
constitutionally must be held before August 11.
</P>
<P>
   However, opinion polls show Tsvangirai's party maintaining
support from 65 percent of voters. If his party wins a majority in
parliament, Tsvangirai said, he will launch impeachment proceedings
to drive Mugabe from power before the end of his term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes his support to demographics. ``Young people are
very frustrated, and they see this old man who is always trying to
talk about the past,'' he said. ``Poverty, job creation, and all
those economic issues are the topmost issues. You can't confuse
land with poverty. People want jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Belonging to an emerging generation of African leaders,
Tsvangirai is more concerned with economics and government
accountability than the post-colonial heroism of Mugabe's age. He
has vowed economic austerity and a clean government. When Mugabe
raised the wages of civil servants up to 90 percent in January,
Tsvangirai objected. He vows to reduce the Cabinet's size and sell
off the state fleet of Mercedes Benzes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry about leadership under a trade unionist. They cite
Zambia, where labor leader Frederick Chiluba toppled autocrat
Kenneth Kaunda in 1990, but then oversaw steady economic decline in
the decade that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai rejects the comparison. ``We will seek a consensus
with business, labor, and government,'' he said. ``Continuing down
the current path is self-destruction. The trade unions must be
assured that down the line, economic discipline is the only way we
can create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1952 in the dry, impoverished southern town of Buhera,
Tsvangirai was the oldest of nine children. His father, a
bricklayer, died while he was in his teens. Although a bright
student, Tsvangirai was forced to abandon school to support the
family. He worked in a textile mill and a nickel mine before rising
in union ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Tsvangirai slipped into Mozambique to join the freedom
struggle, but he never successfully linked up with the forces
fighting against colonial rule in his country. Some now regard his
lack of liberation credentials as a liability, and Tsvangirai
recently made what some say was a tactical mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In need of funds to finance his campaign, he met with the South
African Chamber of Commerce, a body still dominated by whites and
which recently urged its members not to invest in Zimbabwe.
Tsvangirai also accepted a meeting with visiting South African
opposition leader Tony Leon, also white.
</P>
<P>
   Those contacts, as well as his support among white farmers at
home, opened him to attack from critics claiming he is a puppet of
the former white regimes of South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe was always going to use the race card against us, said
Welshman Ncube, an adviser to Tsvangirai. ``That's his only
weapon.'' Ncube said they have tried repeatedly to talk with South
Africa's ruling African National Congress, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The father of six children, Tsvangirai lives in a modest suburb
of Harare. His cars are dented, his clothes rumpled, and friends
say he was not eager to lead the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried his best to see it go to someone else,'' said Brian
Kadoro, his longtime friend and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But as Zimbabweans clamor for change, Tsvangirai seems
determined not to fail them. ``Any new generation of
post-independence leaders must start, first of all, the
pschological shift from blaming and start accepting responsibility
for their own decisions,'' he said. ``The post-liberation
generation can always raise emotions of colonialism, racism, and
all that. We cannot afford that. We have to push Africa to a
situation where it is respected again.''

EMPLOYERS ARE REACHING OUT FOR DISABLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When the manager of the Sears store in Braintree, Mass.
realized that a new employee would not be able to walk to a stock
room on another floor because of her disability, he built a stock
room next to her work area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we are trying to accommodate people with
disabilities by redesigning certain aspects of the job to fit their
needs,'' said Charles Ferreira, store manager. ``Hiring the
disabled has been an ongoing program for us, but now it's becoming
a way to hire more people in a tough labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   With competition for workers at a record high, employers are
turning to people with disabilities to fill mainstream entry-level
jobs as well as positions requiring top skills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of National Affairs Inc., a research information
group and think tank in Washington, D.C., reports that nearly 40
percent of US employers have had trouble finding professional and
technical workers, 1 1/2 times higher than it was two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more employers are reaching out to workers they
might not have considered in the past. ``Companies are more willing
to hire people with disabilities now than they have ever been in
the past, but there are not enough applicants to meet the demand,''
said Hank Cheney, president of Work Inc., a Quincy, Mass.
vocational training, placement, and advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit agency serves about 1,000 disabled clients daily.
Of those, 600 are in training and employment programs. The
remainder work at private companies or have been placed in
residential programs and are not employed.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Work Inc. placed approximately 50 to 80 people
in entry-level jobs per year. This year, it expects to place 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting someone who is able to work, helping them to find a
job, and knowing that they will be able to keep it is really our
goal,'' Cheney said. ``Our best are always leaving us, which is
what we want to see. As they become skilled, they move on. The goal
is to always keep people moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Riley II, editor in chief of New York-based WE
Magazine (WeMagazine.com) for people with disabilities, had
difficulty finding companies to interview when he published his
first list of the best employers to work for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go out and find them,'' he said. ``Now those
companies come to us. So things have changed tremendously. These
workers are the great undiscovered element in the diversity debate.
In the past, diversity was primarily about cultural, gender, and
racial issues. Now the new kids on the block are people with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley credits two factors with driving the current push for
inclusion: the low unemployment rate and the recent passage of The
Work Incentives Improvement Act, viewed by workplace activists as
the first bill to address the many employment concerns of disabled
Americans. It is also the most far-reaching legislation for the
disabled since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, signed into law by President Clinton in December,
awards states $150 million over five years to develop programs that
offer support for disabled residents who want to work. Even more
important, the bill permits workers with disabilities to keep their
Medicaid and Medicare benefits while they are employed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, once a disabled person was accepted into the Social
Security Disability or Supplemental Security Income Program, he
became eligible for Medicare or Medicaid but could earn no more
than $700 per month. If he or she earned more, financial support
from the government was cut off. This law allows workers to
continue receiving federal support even though they are working
full time. And it allows them to choose between state-supported
vocational rehabilitation and private programs that can link them
to jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it is still too early to tell the true impact of the
measure, say experts, who are predicting the law and the labor
shortage eventually will open the flood gates, ushering in a new
era for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the US unemployment rate is now 4.1 percent, the lowest
in 30 years, the unemployment rate among the nation's 54 million
disabled residents of working age is now 71 percent, reports the
National Organization on Disability in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the top 10 firms for disabled employees to work for,
Riley focused on companies that have set out to diversify all
aspects of employment, particularly their professional ranks.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the list included: Microsoft Corp., Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, IBM, Caterpillar, Charles Schwab, Ford Motor Corp., and
Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old style of employing people with disabilities was to
essentially create a whole bunch of menial jobs,'' said Riley.
``But we wanted to recognize companies that have hired people for
white-collar jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The company chose Microsoft to head the list after it joined
with the National Business and Disability Council to create a
coalition of 23 firms that have pledged to hire disabled
professionals.

LEE ENDURES BIG BUMPS ON THE ROAD TO RICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upon close examination, the road to riches usually turns out to
be a bumpy path.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: the Thomas H. Lee Co., the Boston investment firm
that made a name for itself and fortunes for its institutional
clients through leveraged buyouts and other private equity
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The company and Lee himself made that name on the gaudy internal
rates of return posted by each of the company's investment pools.
The details of individual private equity investments rarely saw the
light of day, with the exception of the occasional blockbuster
sale.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Lee has more money in publicly traded stocks. And
that makes a lot more of the details, well, public. They aren't all
slam-dunks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lee's $500 million preferred stock investment in
Conseco Inc. got more complicated. The insurance company's chief
executive resigned under pressure, and Lee president David Harkins
was installed as interim chief.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco stock had sunk 73 percent since Lee's investment in
December, and talk had turned to the liquidation of at least some
of the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   The news wasn't as bleak as it might appear for Lee. His
preferred position would at least break even short of bankruptcy,
and even then might do just fine. But Conseco isn't going to be
anyone's idea of a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed by recent events, but we're
certainly not anticipating any loss of principal, and we still hope
to make a profit on the investment,'' Lee said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months earlier, the value of Lee's 11 million shares of
Mattel Inc. was sliced in half over two weeks in a corporate
meltdown that led to the departure of chief executive Jill Barad.
The stock has been dead in the water ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Lee ended up with Mattel stock when the toy company acquired
software maker The Learning Co., a significant Lee investment in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Lee has still doubled the value of his original
investment in less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: He had quadrupled his money as of last fall.
</P>
<P>
   What does he think about the future of Mattel stock? ``We
continue to hold those shares,'' is all Lee would say.
</P>
<P>
   The developments at Conseco and Mattel might seem jarring, but
step back for the big-picture view we normally get with Lee's
private investments and the results are as smooth and rich as
whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   The internal rate of return for a Lee fund launched in 1995 has
been about 70 percent a year, and another fund created two years
later has generated just over 120 percent annually, according to
people who have seen recent documents (for yet another new Lee
fund) that detailed the company's past performance.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the problems at Conseco and the trimmed profits in
Mattel, Lee points to other recent investments in companies like
MJD Communications Inc. and Big Flower Holdings Inc. as promising
and his 21 percent stake in Metris Cos. as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record of our fund as a whole is excellent,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what matters most to institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we invest with a private equity firm, we don't expect
that they're all going to be home runs,'' said one investor who has
bought into past Lee funds. ``The notion of one or two deals
(struggling) doesn't signify a trend in my mind,'' he said. ``These
people are taking significant risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who give Lee big money to invest think about other
things, like how his firm's operations will be affected over time
by the large stake in the business sold to Putnam Investments. Or
the latest, biggest new fund of all, which Lee intends to create.
</P>
<P>
   The new private equity fund, which had a stated intention of
raising $5 billion, will probably reach more than $6 billion before
it is completely closed. The first of several closings of the fund
took place within the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It will almost certainly become the largest private equity fund
ever, just ahead of the $6 billion investment vehicle launched in
1996 by Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lee started to raise money for his new fund, KKR has begun
work on a new fund of its own that's believed to be targeting $8
billion for investment.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I would point out that none of these guys has a small
ego,'' said Steven Galante, publisher of Private Equity Analyst in
Wellesley. ``Any of them would be more than pleased if they wound
up with the largest fund.''
</P>
<P>
   You only get into that kind of league by earning huge returns
for investors over many years.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a few bumps along the way.

ANALYSTS WONDER   MICROSOFT SPLITUP   WOULD CREATE 2 MONOPOLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the US Justice Department prevails in its drive to break
software monopoly Microsoft Corp. in half _ and that's still a big
if _ many analysts wonder whether the breakup would simply create
two new monopolies and even more headaches for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Government antitrust regulators Friday urged that Microsoft be
split into two companies, one focused on the Windows operating
systems for personal computers, the other on ``applications'' such
as e-mail and document production that run on Windows. Months or
years of appeals seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed remedy is roughly analagous to breaking an
automotive monopoly into two companies that make engines and
vehicles. Then rival engine companies would have a better shot at
selling their products, and auto makers would no longer be beholden
to using one type of engine.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting Microsoft in a similar way would create ``two strong,
robust, viable competitors,'' according to the country's top
antitrust prosecutor, Joel I. Klein. In his ideal scenario, both
would be open to partnerships with technology developers
overwhelmed by Microsoft in the last five years. And they might
even invade each other's turf in a GM-vs.-Ford consumer war.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein faces some severe doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really only replaces one monopoly with two,'' said
economist Frederic M. Scherer, a public policy professor at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who with three
colleagues filed court papers urging that Microsoft's operating
systems division be broken into three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Given Microsoft's domination of the applications market through
products such as the Office suite of e-mail, word processing, and
graphic presentation software, ``you're essentially taking one
integrated monopoly and breaking it into two vertically separated
near-monopolies,'' Scherer said.
</P>
<P>
   And David J. Morrison, head of Lexington-based Mercer Management
Consulting's MercerDigital Internet practice, said the typical
computer user probably would be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Though Microsoft was found to have used illegal tactics to
maintain its monopoly in the operating system market, Morrison
said: ``For most people the de facto standardization has been
wonderful. Application developers love the fact that Windows is a
dominant, pervasive operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average person, this monopoly has been a good thing,
and I don't think society has suffered,'' Morrison said. ``The cost
of having different operating systems out there, if it happened,
that are all incompatible, the headaches and friction cost of that
would be so overwhelming it wipes out the fact that Microsoft makes
an extra $5 or $10'' in monopolist profits on every copy of Windows
it sells.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Smith, an analyst with The Gartner Group, said
that while ``you may be theoretically turning it into two different
monopolies, you're turning it into two monopolies that can't
leverage each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to miraculously revive competition in the
industry? No. Is it going to increase competition somewhat in some
areas the two companies might share? Somewhat,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposed split, which could well be heavily
reworked by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson or the Supreme Court,
would create two new companies that would be carefully monitored to
prevent collusion and forbidden from recombining for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The operating systems company would control Windows and its
successors and products developed for handheld wireless devices,
Internet servers, and television set-top boxes. It would have a
license to keep selling the Internet Explorer code but be forced to
develop a new Web browser in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The applications company would control a vast range of programs
that are now made to run on the Windows operating system, including
Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, the Net Meeting
videoconferencing product, and the Outlook e-mail product, as well
as ``streaming video'' and voice recognition software.
</P>
<P>
   The second company would also take control of the MSN Web
portal, the Hotmail free e-mail service, Slate magazine, the MSNBC
television network, and the Expedia travel network, and Microsoft's
huge stable of joint ventures with cable TV companies, hardware
makers, and software makers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's $21 billion cash pile would be split between them,
and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and president Steve Ballmer would
be forced to take stock in only one of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right remedy for the right time. Our proposal will
stimulate competition, promote innovation, and give consumers new
and better choices in the marketplace,'' said US Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan assumes the new applications company would
welcome developing versions of Microsoft Office for rival systems
such as Linux or Unix-type platforms such as Solaris from Sun
Microsystems, which are used to run computer servers and
large-organization computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, once Windows had no investment in Microsoft software,
the new operating systems company might be far more eager to
support products such as IBM's Lotus Notes or the WordPerfect word
processing systems now sold by Corel.
</P>
<P>
   But just as over half of Baby Bell customers kept AT&AMP;T for their
long-distance phone service for years after the 1984 breakup of
AT&AMP;T, Microsoft's dominance of the market might lead millions of
people to prefer using versions of Office that run on Windows,
assuming they would work better.
</P>
<P>
   Given that people at different companies and organizations want
to be able to exchange documents and Powerpoint presentations, the
popularity of Microsoft Office _ of which more than 100 million
copies are in circulation _ might serve as a force toward
remonopolization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who develop software would still have a lot of
incentive to develop strictly for Windows, because for the
foreseeable future, it will still be the dominant system out
there,'' said Charles Hill, an economist at the University of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part breakup proposal pleased some business executives
who had worried that if Microsoft were to be broken into even more
pieces, as Harvard's Scherer and others urged, they would have to
develop software to run on a Babel of different platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to port to every different version of Windows NT,
and that's not what we want to do,'' said Michael Ruettgers, chief
executive of EMC Corp., the Hopkinton maker of data storage
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Also, given the rapidly evolving nature of the software
industry, computer operating systems could be a far less important
market three years from now because more and more people might use
so-called ``dumb boxes'' that run on software housed within the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game may very well be over for PC desktops,'' said the
Gartner Group's Smith. But he said the government action could
prove important to keeping Microsoft from extending its monopoly
into Internet-based software and into wireless applications, where
Microsoft's Windows Mobile is battling with products from Palm,
Motorola, and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer Consulting's Morrison said that if and when some clearly
superior alternative to Microsoft's products emerges, computer
users and product developers will migrate to the new alternative
because of the desirability of common standards. ``We will, over
some 36-month period, go from 10-90 to 90-10,'' if one strong rival
emerges, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 19 attorneys general who joined with the federal
government in the antitrust case declined to go along with the
breakup plan, saying they preferred having Microsoft scrutinized
for anticompetitive practices for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reorganization could be difficult to undo, and its effects
would be difficult to predict,'' said Ohio Attorney General Betty
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond whether a Microsoft bifurcation is good for consumers,
another key question is whether it's good for investors, especially
given the explosion in stock ownership among Americans. The
Microsoft stock meltdown _ its shares have plunged from $119 on New
Year's Eve to under $70 Friday _ has been a major driver of the
Nasdaq's woes this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more people investing in stocks than ever before, I have
yet to see how sparking a devastating stock market loss protects
consumers,'' said US Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Washington
Republican and leading supporter of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed Friday, financial advisers retained by the
Justice Department said that ``depending on management's execution
of the separation, the performance of the two independent
companies, market conditions, and a number of other factors, the
impact of the proposed separation of the market value of the
current Microsoft share owners' holdings could be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greenhill and Jeffrey Williams of Wall Street merger
advisers Greenhill &AMP; Co. LLC said they believe that in the mid- to
long term, ``There will not be a material decrease in the value of
the current Microsoft shareowners' holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone conference call with reporters Friday, Gates
said that ``no one should think that shareholders' value would be
preserved. What we have are smart people who work together as a
team . . . (and) Microsoft never could have developed Windows under
these rules.''
</P>
<P>
   William Welch, managing director of Fiduciary Asset Management,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you split a pretty dynamic company like that in half,''
he said, ``it dilutes overall value.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Melissa Eisenstat of CIBC World Markets Inc. estimated
that, based on current sales growth and Microsoft's price-earnings
ratio, the two postsplit companies combined would be worth between
$52 to $59 a share, well below its Friday closing price of $69.75.
</P>
<P>
   But if the companies were valued similarly to IBM, Sun, and
Novell Inc., they could be worth $134 a share combined, CIBC
concluded, suggesting an unsettling $80 swing is ``the range in
which the stock could trade while the lawsuit rages on,'' Eisenstat
said.

SAVE AGGRESSIVELY, INVEST CONSERVATIVELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. Are my investments too risky? I recently switched the
403(b) account from Fidelity Magellan, Contrafund, Ginnie Mae etc.
to the current holding. I have never been able to save before my
current job as an administrative assistant. I have to be as
aggressive as possible, even if I push retirement back to age 70.
If I don't do much better than the average 10 percent return, I'm
going to be a bag lady. I am so frightened about how I will
survive. Am I too old and poor to buy a small condo in the next
year or two? Would I be better off putting more money into my
investments, or less into the 401(k) and buying property? I pay
$460 monthly rent because I live in a moderate income complex, but
it will go up to $550 in June and in several years I won't be
eligible for the apartment and would face going into the Boston
rental market, at which time the rental cost would exceed what I
would pay for a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Rockland, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the picture is as bleak as you paint it,
although you probably will have to work past the usual retirement
age. I don't agree with your decision to assume the heavier risks
that go along with funds such as Fidelity Select Biotechnology,
hoping to make up for lost time. My approach has always been to
save aggressively and invest conservatively. Having that dormant
403(b) in the biotech fund is probably OK, but I don't suggest you
increase that position. And be cautious with additions to similar
funds.
</P>
<P>
   You don't specify how your 401(k) contributions are allocated.
I'd make heavy contributions to American Century Twentieth Century
Ultra and Vanguard Index 500 _ about 40 percent each _ and limit
contributions to the riskier Science and Technology and Emerging
Growth funds to 10 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring your suggestion that a 10 percent return wouldn't be
enough, I projected your accumulation after 16 years with that
presumed return and with contributions at current levels. The total
was $436,741. But it's only fair _ before I paint a picture that's
too rosy _ to point out that if inflation runs at an average 3.5
percent for 16 years, that would have the value of only a little
more than $250,000 in today's money, or only enough to supply a
$16,250 income stream (in today's dollars) without depleting the
principal.
</P>
<P>
   One big missing element is Social Security. If you will be
eligible, the fact that you probably will be retiring late should
push your benefits up. Moreover, if you continue saving the current
percentages of your income and increasing the dollar value of your
contributions every time you get a raise, that would push your
accumulation higher.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is by no means bright, but I don't think you need to
be frightened. Just keep plugging away and you should be in a
workable situation.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a condo also might work. But before you decide, calculate
the total cost, including taxes and the management and maintenance
fees. If you are still convinced that in a few years the monthly
cost will be less than that of renting, by all means go ahead. Home
ownership represents a form of financial security just as solid
(and a whole lot safer) than an investment portfolio. And if at
retirement age you find you have to liquidate that asset and go
where living costs less, you should be able to convert the property
to cash, especially if you have chosen it with long-term value in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The only situation in which I would rule out a condo purchase is
if saving for the down payment would take your 401(k) contributions
below the point at which you would get the maximum matching benefit
from your employer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am trying to decide whether to invest a $50,000 inheritance
in a balanced mutual fund such as Vanguard Index 500 or use it to
buy a home. If I invest, I'd like average gains of 10 percent over
at least 10 years. I am in the 20 percent tax bracket. If I do buy
a home, I would wait for interest rates to fall below 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   S.M., El Cajon, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the fund. In the language used in the
investment community, Vanguard Index 500 is not a balanced fund. A
balanced fund is one that divides its portfolio between the stock
and the fixed-income markets, usually with 50 to 66 percent of the
assets in stocks and the rest in bonds and other fixed-return
investments. Vanguard Index 500, on the other hand, is an all-stock
fund, keeping 99.9 percent of its assets in stock holdings,
retaining only a small portion of cash to facilitate redemptions.
Since over the long haul bond holdings tend to be less risky than
stock funds, if you bought a balanced fund you would see less
choppy investment results but probably lower returns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, Vanguard Index 500 has produced average
annual returns of 18.71 percent, but you should remember that the
last 10 years have been a truly remarkable decade. Nonetheless, I
think your 10-year expectation of 10 percent average annual returns
for Vanguard Index 500 is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   If you went with a true balanced fund, and Vanguard Balanced
Index comes immediately to mind, expectations of returns in the 8
to 9 percent range would be reasonable over the long haul. Like
Index 500, that fund is designed simply to track broad market
indexes as closely as possible, with 60 percent in stocks, 39
percent in bonds, and the remaining 1 percent in cash. It hasn't
been around long enough to build a 10-year record.
</P>
<P>
   I have nothing to guide me in guessing whether you would be
better off buying a home. I think of home ownership as one of the
greatest foundations of financial security. But before you make a
decision, you should consider the factors I mentioned to J.M.
above: total cost, including mortgage, taxes, insurance, and
maintenance, and whether you think home prices in your area are
reasonable and likely to hold their value and, ideally, to advance.
</P>
<P>
   If a home purchase is an affordable alternative, I'd lean that
way. But if you are indeed in the 20 percent tax bracket, my guess
is that you would have little tax advantage if you bought a home
and reaped the deductions for interest and taxes, versus taking the
standard deduction. There are too many unknowns for me to call that
one, although all things being equal, I would tend to favor the
home purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a previous column, there was no factual basis for your
statement: ``I agree, it is risky to buy funds at banks, where the
advisor sometimes appears to know little more than the customer.''
This is unfounded, untrue, insulting, inaccurate, and so on. As an
investment representative at a bank, this undeserved broadside
appalls me. I have invested a great deal of time and money to
become as well informed as I can on the subject of investing and
mutual funds, specifically. I am currently working toward the
Chartered Mutual Fund Counselor designation. In March, I spent a
day in Chicago taking a Morningstar class in Analysis and Fund
Selection. Many people who have no interest, desire, or time for
managing their own investments are best served by an investment
adviser _ an honest, knowledgeable, component professional who is
just as likely to be found at a community bank as anywhere else.
Retract your insult.
</P>
<P>
   P.A., Middleton, Wis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm sorry to have given offense, but in the nearly 10 years I
have been taking questions from readers, the very heavy
preponderance of writers who had bought a fund with very little or
no idea of what they had purchased had done so at a bank. I'm sure
there are bankers who deal with mutual funds who are well informed,
talented, and give excellent service. However, their clients do not
tend to write to me. Those who write are usually people who bought
something such as a government bond fund from a bank, and while
they probably heard their adviser say the bonds the fund held were
guaranteed by the government, they had no idea that their
investment could lose value.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad to hear you are working so hard to give fine service.
If more bank fund representatives were like you, I would get fewer
letters complaining about investments the customers did not
understand.

ANALYSTS WONDER   IF MICROSOFT SPLIT   WOULD CREATE 2 MONOPOLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the US Justice Department prevails in its drive to break
software monopoly Microsoft Corp. in half _ and that's still a big
if _ many analysts wonder whether the breakup would simply create
two new monopolies and even more headaches for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Government antitrust regulators Friday urged that Microsoft be
split into two companies, one focused on the Windows operating
systems for personal computers, the other on ``applications'' such
as e-mail and document production that run on Windows. Months or
years of appeals seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed remedy is roughly analagous to breaking an
automotive monopoly into two companies that make engines and
vehicles. Then rival engine companies would have a better shot at
selling their products, and auto makers would no longer be beholden
to using one type of engine.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting Microsoft in a similar way would create ``two strong,
robust, viable competitors,'' according to the country's top
antitrust prosecutor, Joel I. Klein. In his ideal scenario, both
would be open to partnerships with technology developers
overwhelmed by Microsoft in the last five years. And they might
even invade each other's turf in a GM-vs.-Ford consumer war.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein faces some severe doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really only replaces one monopoly with two,'' said
economist Frederic M. Scherer, a public policy professor at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who with three
colleagues filed court papers urging that Microsoft's operating
systems division be broken into three companies.
</P>
<P>
   Given Microsoft's domination of the applications market through
products such as the Office suite of e-mail, word processing, and
graphic presentation software, ``you're essentially taking one
integrated monopoly and breaking it into two vertically separated
near-monopolies,'' Scherer said.
</P>
<P>
   And David J. Morrison, head of Lexington-based Mercer Management
Consulting's MercerDigital Internet practice, said the typical
computer user probably would be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Though Microsoft was found to have used illegal tactics to
maintain its monopoly in the operating system market, Morrison
said: ``For most people the de facto standardization has been
wonderful. Application developers love the fact that Windows is a
dominant, pervasive operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average person, this monopoly has been a good thing,
and I don't think society has suffered,'' Morrison said. ``The cost
of having different operating systems out there, if it happened,
that are all incompatible, the headaches and friction cost of that
would be so overwhelming it wipes out the fact that Microsoft makes
an extra $5 or $10'' in monopolist profits on every copy of Windows
it sells.
</P>
<P>
   However, David Smith, an analyst with The Gartner Group, said
that while ``you may be theoretically turning it into two different
monopolies, you're turning it into two monopolies that can't
leverage each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to miraculously revive competition in the
industry? No. Is it going to increase competition somewhat in some
areas the two companies might share? Somewhat,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's proposed split, which could well be heavily
reworked by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson or the Supreme Court,
would create two new companies that would be carefully monitored to
prevent collusion and forbidden from recombining for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The operating systems company would control Windows and its
successors and products developed for handheld wireless devices,
Internet servers, and television set-top boxes. It would have a
license to keep selling the Internet Explorer code but be forced to
develop a new Web browser in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The applications company would control a vast range of programs
that are now made to run on the Windows operating system, including
Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, the Net Meeting
videoconferencing product, and the Outlook e-mail product, as well
as ``streaming video'' and voice recognition software.
</P>
<P>
   The second company would also take control of the MSN Web
portal, the Hotmail free e-mail service, Slate magazine, the MSNBC
television network, and the Expedia travel network, and Microsoft's
huge stable of joint ventures with cable TV companies, hardware
makers, and software makers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's $21 billion cash pile would be split between them,
and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and president Steve Ballmer would
be forced to take stock in only one of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right remedy for the right time. Our proposal will
stimulate competition, promote innovation, and give consumers new
and better choices in the marketplace,'' said US Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan assumes the new applications company would
welcome developing versions of Microsoft Office for rival systems
such as Linux or Unix-type platforms such as Solaris from Sun
Microsystems, which are used to run computer servers and
large-organization computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, once Windows had no investment in Microsoft software,
the new operating systems company might be far more eager to
support products such as IBM's Lotus Notes or the WordPerfect word
processing systems now sold by Corel.
</P>

   Damiano makes a 12-inch incision between Jones' neck and abdomen
with a scalpel, then cuts through Jones' sternum with an electric
saw and cracks the bone apart to expose the diseased heart.
</P>
<P>
   To create a clear field for his surgical maneuvers, he inserts a
drainage tube into the right atrium and diverts the flow of blood
to a heart-lung machine the size of a truck engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we're going all the way,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   He injects a mixture of blood and potassium _ which alters the
flow of electrochemical impulses into the heart, causing it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   On the video screens, multicolored lines measuring
electrocardiograph activity are flat. Jones' burly chest is still.
</P>
<P>
   Time is now of the essence. Damiano deftly sews a piece of
healthy artery harvested from Jones' left arm above and below one
blockage, completing the first bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Then he does something completely out of the ordinary for a
heart surgeon: He unhooks the power to his forehead light; takes
off his magnifying glasses; leaves behind dozens of scalpels,
scissors and clamps; and walks away from his patient.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, he settles into an office chair in front of
a squat black-and-gray computer console positioned five feet from
the operating table and dons an unsterilized headset equipped with
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   So goes an endoscope _ a camera attached to a robotic arm and
inserted in Jones' body before the operation _ scanning to the
left, illuminating for Damiano a brightly lit landscape of pink,
glistening flesh magnified 10 to 12 times on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano then grasps the silvery ends of elbowed computer
joysticks, which allow him to maneuver two additional robotic arms
that hover over the operating table like brooding black cranes.
</P>
<P>
   As Damiano manipulates the joysticks like a master puppeteer, a
pair of surgical graspers and the needle driver he will use to help
sew the second bypass graft loom into view on his monitor. Once
that's done, the procedure is complete.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fantasy; this is real. It is the operating room of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Hershey Medical
Center at Penn State University, is one of a handful of doctors
using computer assistance and robotic tools in an attempt to
revolutionize heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history we're interposing a computer
between the surgeon and the patient,'' says Damiano, 45, a tall man
with thick eyebrows, a mustache, a ready smile and thoroughgoing
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   He believes these robotic tools will set a new standard in
minimally invasive surgery _ and eliminate a good deal of the
terrible physical trauma associated with opening the heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology fulfills its promise, there will be no need to
cut the sternum and no need to stop the heart. Patients may leave
the hospital sooner, wearing three Band-Aids instead of a long line
of heavy metal staples.
</P>
<P>
   For now, because the Food and Drug Administration considers
computer-assisted bypass operations experimental, doctors in the
United States are also required to open the patient's chest and
hook him up to a heart-lung machine so that the surgery can be
completed by hand if something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But last September, Canadian surgeon Douglas Boyd provided a
glimpse of the future of computer-assisted surgery when he inserted
tiny robotic tools through four keyhole-sized ports in a patient's
chest and successfully performed the first closed-chest,
beating-heart bypass operation without the aid of a heart-lung
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Damiano both use a computer-driven robotics system
called Zeus, which was developed and manufactured by Computer
Motion in Santa Barbara, Calif. The computer hardware that drives
Zeus is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires about the same horsepower as a high-performance
home desktop,'' says Computer Motion founder Yulun Wang. And yet
commands travel from the console to each robotic joint at a rate of
up to 400 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Zeus lies in its software _ the 200,000 lines of
computer code that harness the machine's processors to pick up the
hand movements of the surgeon as he handles the computer joysticks.
Instantly, the circuits sense and filter out tremors, the nemesis
of every microsurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system smoothes out my hand motions in much the same way
you can filter an image in digital photography and make it
perfect,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also capable of scaling hand movements down to
whatever size the surgeon chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the digital connection between surgeon and patient
might someday extend well beyond five feet, a possibility that
intrigues the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the U.S. military has spent $3 million to design a
battlefield surgical system stocked with robotic arms and cameras
and housed in an armored vehicle. Surgeons stationed safely behind
front lines would manipulate tools to stitch up the most serious
wounds so soldiers could arrive alive at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers developing remote techniques at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., say it
will be at least 10 years before tests on cadavers and dummies pay
off with ready-for-combat equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge will be to figure out how to transmit the flood of
3D video signals from the field _ about 45 megabits of data per
second, roughly the equivalent of three Zip disks a minute _
especially when generals need bandwidth to communicate during
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a doctor in Chicago using robotic servants to sew
up an astronaut on the moon may be limited by the speed of light,
which lags the movements of the surgeon's hands over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes more than five-thousandths of a second for the
signal to travel to a robot, ``it begins to feel like you're
working in molasses,'' says Joel Jensen, a program manager at SRI
International, a nonprofit institute that has done groundbreaking
work in remote surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen estimates the maximum distance between the surgeon and
the patient should be less than 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano says that, even if these problems can be solved, it's
still doubtful that surgeons will use remote systems over long
distances unless a second surgeon is on the scene, ready to handle
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be relatively unethical,'' he says. ``You need to be
next to your patient. This is an enabling device for surgery that
doesn't replace the surgeon in any way. If a clamp came off an
artery, for example, you'd have only about 10 minutes maximum to
stop the flow'' while trying to find your way onscreen through a
rising pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Much more likely, he says, is using the system to share
expertise by satellite or fiber-optic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the potential of robotic tools is just beginning to be
explored, progress may come quickly. Yulun Wang of Computer Motion
believes this is only the beginning of a profound transformation in
the way surgery is done.

   Heart surgeon Ralph Damiano's hands move with practiced
precision as he prepares to open the chest of 62-year-old David
Jones for a double-bypass operation.

   People who combine certain herbal medicines with prescription
drugs may be putting themselves at considerable risk. So says
Adriane Fugh-Berman, a physician at George Washington University
School of Medicine who has been collecting case reports and studies
of hazardous herb-drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Fugh-Berman has learned that Saint-John's-wort, a popular
mood-lifting herbal remedy, may increase the risk of confusion,
nausea and diarrhea _ symptoms of an excess of the neurotransmitter
serotonin in the brain _ when taken with antidepressants such as
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo biloba can trigger bleeding in people taking warfarin, a
drug that reduces the risk of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Yohimbine, an anti-impotence herb, can provoke hypertension when
combined with tricyclic antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicines alone can be trouble as well, Fugh-Berman
warns. Asian herbal medicaments have been found to be contaminated
with lead or arsenic, and some have even been ``doctored'' with
drugs such as steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the use or
sale of herbs. But Fugh-Berman, who proffers herbs in her own
practice, isn't counseling avoidance _ just awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbs with known interactions should have to be labeled, as
should herbs with adverse effects. Right now, that's optional,
which is nuts,'' she says.

 &UR; EARLE OF THE SEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, marine biologist Sylvia Earle spent two weeks
underwater heading the first women's team of aquanauts.
</P>
<P>
   Later she became chief scientist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, founded a company to build undersea
vehicles and worked to preserve the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Today she leads the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a five-year
project to explore the 12 marine sanctuaries along America's
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What first inspired your studies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ocean got my attention when I was 3 years old. I was
knocked over by a wave, and I found it exhilarating rather than
frightening. Once I found my feet and plunged back in, I thought
the water that flowed all around me was the greatest, most powerful
substance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why protect the oceans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  They are the foundation of life on Earth. More than 70
percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by life in the
sea, which also absorbs carbon dioxide. The oceans are in trouble _
and if they are, we are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What are the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We're poisoning the oceans with pesticides and heavy
metals. There are red tides and dead zones, and in the last decade
we've seen a great increase in waterborne diseases, such as cholera
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exterminating wildlife in the sea on an unprecedented
scale. Nearly 100 million tons of fish, mollusks, squid and
crustaceans are extracted from the ocean every year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Do you eat fish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I used to, but I know too much now. Chilean sea bass, for
example, live a long time and reproduce slowly, yet we're simply
mining them. This is also true of swordfish, monkfish and orange
roughy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be as unpopular to eat them as it is to wear a
leopard-skin coat. I think we should farm more, but we should be
careful what we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are caught to feed carnivorous domesticated fish like
salmon, which is like catching wild quail to feed chickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  That humankind will go the way of the dinosaurs in the
not-too-distant future, because we did ourselves in through
complacency and greed.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; OPEN SESAME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting therapeutic drugs into the brain is difficult because of
a firewall of cells that line the capillaries there. But Alessio
Fasano, a gastroenterologist at the University of Maryland, may
have found a way through.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while studying cholera vaccines, Fasano
stumbled across a protein that made victims' intestines dangerously
leaky. He later found similar molecules that unlock tightly sealed
barricades throughout the body, including the one in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on brain tissue have confirmed that some of these
molecules can open the blood-brain barrier, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many brain tumors are highly susceptible to drugs, but we
can't get the drugs across the barrier. Now we have a key,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; A RAT'S BEST FRIEND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks enough like a rat to fool real rats, but Atsuo
Takanishi's creation is actually a miniature robot.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trial, he and his colleagues at Waseda University in
Japan placed rat and rat-bot together in an enclosure and
programmed the robot to head straight for a dish of food.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rat began chasing its doppelganger as if it were a real
animal and reached the food much faster than it would have on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Takanishi plans to see what happens when rats live with
rat-bots for an extended duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the rats become lazy or selfish if the robots make things
too convenient for them?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to figure out how to avoid such behavioral changes
before humans begin interacting with personal robots.

<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What first inspired your studies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ocean got my attention when I was 3 years old. I was
knocked over by a wave, and I found it exhilarating rather than
frightening. Once I found my feet and plunged back in, I thought
the water that flowed all around me was the greatest, most powerful
substance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why protect the oceans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  They are the foundation of life on Earth. More than 70
percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by life in the
sea, which also absorbs carbon dioxide. The oceans are in trouble _
and if they are, we are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What are the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We're poisoning the oceans with pesticides and heavy
metals. There are red tides and dead zones, and in the last decade
we've seen a great increase in waterborne diseases, such as cholera
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exterminating wildlife in the sea on an unprecedented
scale. Nearly 100 million tons of fish, mollusks, squid and
crustaceans are extracted from the ocean every year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Do you eat fish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I used to, but I know too much now. Chilean sea bass, for
example, live a long time and reproduce slowly, yet we're simply
mining them. This is also true of swordfish, monkfish and orange
roughy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be as unpopular to eat them as it is to wear a
leopard-skin coat. I think we should farm more, but we should be
careful what we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are caught to feed carnivorous domesticated fish like
salmon, which is like catching wild quail to feed chickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  That humankind will go the way of the dinosaurs in the
not-too-distant future, because we did ourselves in through
complacency and greed.
</P>

 &UR; OPEN SESAME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting therapeutic drugs into the brain is difficult because of
a firewall of cells that line the capillaries there. But Alessio
Fasano, a gastroenterologist at the University of Maryland, may
have found a way through.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while studying cholera vaccines, Fasano
stumbled across a protein that made victims' intestines dangerously
leaky. He later found similar molecules that unlock tightly sealed
barricades throughout the body, including the one in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on brain tissue have confirmed that some of these
molecules can open the blood-brain barrier, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many brain tumors are highly susceptible to drugs, but we
can't get the drugs across the barrier. Now we have a key,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; A RAT'S BEST FRIEND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks enough like a rat to fool real rats, but Atsuo
Takanishi's creation is actually a miniature robot.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trial, he and his colleagues at Waseda University in
Japan placed rat and rat-bot together in an enclosure and
programmed the robot to head straight for a dish of food.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rat began chasing its doppelganger as if it were a real
animal and reached the food much faster than it would have on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Takanishi plans to see what happens when rats live with
rat-bots for an extended duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the rats become lazy or selfish if the robots make things
too convenient for them?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to figure out how to avoid such behavioral changes
before humans begin interacting with personal robots.

   GERMANY-EXCHANGE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Germany's stock exchange
has quietly amassed clout through acquisitions, new technology and
a readiness to start up new ventures. Much of the credit goes to
its chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, a devoted gourmet and jazz
pianist who was an outsider when he arrived at the exchange in
Frankfurt 1994. For starters, he is Swiss rather than German. Now
50 years old, he had been a partner in Germany at McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
the management consulting firm. And while he had little experience
in the nuts and bolts of securities trading, he had a strong sense
that technology would transform the markets and erode national

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The first question Kuki Gallmann asks when she learns I have
seen ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' the Kim Basinger movie based on
Gallmann's best-selling memoir, is, ``Do you think people will want
to come to Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   For Gallmann, Italian by birth, Kenyan by choice, it is really
the only question.
</P>
<P>
   When she sat down to write ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' she had no
intention of seeing her story turned into a big-budget Hollywood
movie. She didn't even plan to have it published. She says she
simply needed to ``exorcise my ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the United States go a lot to psychoanalysts, and
they talk,'' Gallmann says over lunch in an Italian cafe near her
London flat. ``I also talk _ all Italians talk _ but in general,
the empty page is my psychoanalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   She filled the pages of the book with lyrical memories of
recovering from a devastating car accident in Venice _ doctors had
held out little hope she'd walk again _ and beginning life anew in
Kenya with her young son, Emanuele, and second husband, Paolo, in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the Laikipia region, they bought the Ol Ari Nyiro
ranch and struggled to make it viable. But the deeper she fell in
love with Africa, the more it seemed to extract from her as
payment.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paolo was killed in a car accident driving back from
Mombasa with a cradle for their unborn daughter. Three years later,
Emanuele, a passionate collector and scholar of snakes, was bitten
by one of his puff adders and died in Gallmann's arms. He was only
17, due to leave shortly for college in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her second loss, Gallmann gave no thought to
returning to the comforts of Italy. She raised her daughter, Sveva,
on the ranch and started a foundation in memory of Paolo and
Emanuele.
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann agreed to publish the memoir only after a friend
convinced her it could help other parents whose children had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only mother who has lost a son,'' she says.
``Children die all the time everywhere. But I wanted to transform
something negative, something immensely sad, because Emanuele was a
very intelligent, gifted, extraordinary human being. I wanted to
make sure his passing was not in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she resisted offers to sell the film rights. Gallmann
dreaded seeing the tragedies of her life played out on screen _ and
since she typically sees movies only on airplanes, she also had
doubts about the medium itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no to everybody because there is a different dignity
about something written that you read alone,'' she says, ``as
opposed to something on the big screen that you share with people
chewing gum and eating peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But then friends introduced her to Stanley Jaffe, the producer
of ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Fatal Attraction.'' Jaffe had read
her book after a year of prodding from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like it was going to be _ not in a pejorative or
sexist sense _ more for a woman,'' Jaffe recalls. ``But I got to
the last eulogy, and I was awash in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann decided to let Jaffe make the movie, with Hugh Hudson
(``Chariots of Fire'') directing, but not without trepidation. When
we first meet, in the fall of 1998, filming is under way, and
Gallmann is clearly uneasy. Most of the movie is being shot in
South Africa, the terrain of which, she frets, ``is as different
from Laikipia as Sweden is from Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   She regrets not trying to write the screenplay herself and
worries about the star, Kim Basinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: If I'd been given the task of interpreting
you in a movie, I would have come and met you,'' Gallmann says. ``I
would have made it my business.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, however, she is somewhat
relieved after attending a private screening with her daughter,
saying Basinger ``did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, though, was still difficult to watch, particularly
the first scene in which the teen-aged Emanuele appears, because
the actor bears such a striking resemblance to her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' she recalls. ``We cried for two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Larry Ashmead, executive editor and vice president of
HarperCollins, says, Gallmann is not a ``weeping widow.'' For one
thing, she has too much work to do. HarperCollins is publishing her
latest book, ``African Nights,'' a collection of autobiographical
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann is also busy planning Sveva's wedding for Laikipia in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her time, though, is spent on the Gallmann Memorial
Foundation, which supports education and wildlife conservation.
Every year, more than 1,000 schoolchildren visit Ol Ari Nyiro,
which is teeming with elephant, buffalo and the largest population
of black rhino on private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Africans have never seen a wild elephant,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, each child receives an indigenous tree to plant at
home. Many of those trees have grown from seeds collected from the
acacia trees Gallmann planted on the graves of her husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's often likened to a modern-day Isak Dinesen,
Gallmann says the biggest difference between her and the author of
``Out of Africa'' is that she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never leave Africa,'' she says. &QL;

<P>
   Flowers have long been admired in paintings and verse for their
physical beauty, but they also work their art on the olfactory
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, they've been rediscovered on the beauty scene. Dedicated
sybarites and wishful escapists looking to unwind after a hard day
at the office swear by the scent of blossoms and the curative
effects of petals. Stated simply: Blooms are primo when it comes to
pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Immerse yourself in flowers or their essence and you will truly
be transported. Spa treatments that use flowers to envelop the
senses _ if not literally, then figuratively _ abound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aqua Spa in Santa Monica, Calif., the aromatherapy
manicure and pedicure start off with a blissful soak in lavender,
rose or geranium oil.
</P>
<P>
   The ``aromatic facial'' at Spa Internazionale at Fisher Island
in Florida features custom-blended oils from plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's cozy and quiet Carapan Urban Spa, many of the
treatments use the spa's new body collection called Plateau, which
contains luxurious oils of lavender, patchouli and bergamot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Plateau Body Massage, for example, Carapan's clients get
to experience the Plateau Body &AMP; Massage Oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Aida Thibiant European Day Spa in Beverly Hills, one of the
most requested body treatments is a stress-melting soak in a 47-jet
hydrotherapy tub with Tahitian Milk Bath, a sumptuous product with
Monoi de Tahiti, a medley of petals from the rare tiare flower
soaked in oils.
</P>
<P>
   Tahitian Milk Bath is also sold at the spa for at-home revelry,
as are several newer products with Monoi de Tahiti, including a
sensuous dry oil spray and exfoliating and moisturizing body scrub.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was ever any doubt that flowers are among the most
luxurious treats in the world, consider that Christian Dior's new
skin-care line, Dior Prestige, features the nectar, or the sap, of
100 kniphofia buds, a flower that blooms on the island of
Madagascar only during June and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will transport you to another place,'' says Robert
Isabell, the florist and party planner who launched Perfumes
Isabell, a collection of body products and candles based solely on
flowers. ``They calm and bring great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mastermind behind such lavish bashes as the recent
Costume Institute party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
society weddings including those of Caroline Kennedy and Aerin
Lauder, the subject of flowers is very dear to his heart. Isabell
counts water lilies, tuberose and jasmine among his favorites
because of their intoxicatingly powerful scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers simply capture all the senses,'' he says. ``I know a
woman who always has fresh ones by her bedside. She treats them
like friends.''
</P>
<P>
   While the physical beauty of flowers has never been in question,
the therapeutic benefits are also impressive _ and well documented
throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, the Romans would spritz dinner guests between
courses with rose water from tiny pipes installed under the table.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the 19th century, rose was the prominent ingredient in
remedies that treated everything from depression to infertility.
</P>
<P>
   In Renaissance Italy, rose water was used for rinsing the hands
and some even drank alcohol-based perfumes as breath fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were also commonly used for beauty purposes _ crushed
rose petals are a centuries-old secret for rosy, glowing skin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology has taken over most of these tasks, but this
does not mean that flowers should be relegated to the garden. Far
from it. Flowers contribute plenty to the pampering process and
spas and beauty firms are always looking for new ways to exploit
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Close, owner of the Naturopathica Spa and Holistic
Health Center in East Hampton, N.Y., has built both her day spa and
product line on the premise that botanicals, including flowers, are
a vital ingredient in the quest for beauty and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   One of the line's cult products, a rose-water facial spritz
called Rose Hydrolat, is ideal for sensitive, irritated skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' declares Scarlett Messina, owner of the
Scarlett Beauty Emporium in New Hope, Penn., which also sells
Close's Orange Blossom Hydrolat and Lavender Hydrolat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is perfect for calming sensitive skin,'' Close says. ``I
recommend it for people with ruddy complexions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her spa is a veritable haven for those seeking natural beauty.
There's even a computer system that explains the benefits of
various floral ingredients and a custom blending bar that allows
customers to spike their favorite shampoo or body lotion with a
specific essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   These oils can be pretty pricy, Close says, but they're worth it
when you consider that approximately 2,000 pounds of rose petals
are needed to make just one pound of essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   If rose appears to be one of the most popular flowers among
beauty aficionados, it's no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rose is known in the flower kingdom as the queen,'' says
perfumer Sarah Horowitz, whose company, Creative Scentualization,
creates custom fragrances. ``Rose is used in aromatherapy for many
things, including skin replenishing. It's also used as an
aphrodisiac and to open the heart chakra promoting love.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetually beautiful rose is at the center of other
skin-care products and spa treatments. The popular French treatment
line Guinot has added musk rose oil, which balances the complexion
and works as an anti-inflammatory, to its new Refreshing Cleansing
Milk and Refreshing Toning Lotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Guinot, our philosophy is to coax the skin back to a state
of homeostasis, to an ideal state of health,'' says Remy DeVere,
director of education for Guinot.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Bulgarian rose is the main ingredient in the
ultra-expensive Joy fragrance from Patou. It also features
prominently in new night creams created by Thibiant.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett's Messina considers the rose soap from the Two Girls
Brand to be the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scents the whole room and creates an experience,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Equinox Spa in Manhattan, a new treatment
called the Yogi Scrub combines rose water and rose oil with yogurt
for maximum exfoliation and softening.
</P>
<P>
   Equinox also uses the Floral Mask from a professional French spa
line called Phalgo that is a mix of white clay, rose and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers may also be beneficial when ingested. Roses are said to
be higher in vitamin C than citrus fruits.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people in countries like Pakistan and India have
been drinking flowered teas. (A modern example is the trendy chai
tea that is sold alongside cafe latte at Starbucks. Its main
ingredient: rose.)
</P>
<P>
   Yael Alkalay and Victor Silveira, the founders of a line of
candles and teas called Red Flower, consider flowers a ``life force
that you can smell and breathe,'' adding, ``flowers encourage the
enjoyment of simple experiences in a beautiful way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their teas features roses from Spain, bilberries and
hibiscus. The other is a lavender tea with rosemary, spearmint and
peppermint. Both varieties are pretty enough to display.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile, another flower that reigns supreme for its
anti-allergenic properties, is better known as a soothing tea. But
it, too, is being discovered by aestheticians and beauty companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian skin-care line Jurlique is ripe with chamomile,
as is Nectar of the Gods, an Italian collection of hair care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Essentiel Elements, the line of natural spa products, has
created three separate skin-care collections around chamomile,
lavender and geranium.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile was chosen for its calming effect on inflamed and
irritated skin, lavender for its ability to detoxify and geranium
for its super-hydration abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The star product of the Essentiel Elements skin-care collection
is Intensive, pure essential oil of either chamomile, lavender or
geranium, blended with almond oil. Several drops massaged lightly
on pressure points, namely the temple, behind the ear lobes and on
the bridge of your nose, can do wonders for a weary soul.
</P>
<P>
   Eradicating stress and its irritating symptoms is yet another
benefit of the essential oils of flowers. Lavender and chamomile
are probably the most recognized in this area, but many others are
beneficial as well.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive but potent jasmine has a calming and uplifting effect
on the nervous system, while neroli, or orange blossom oil, helps
with many kinds of stress, including insomnia and panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For even more severe cases of malaise, those in the medical
profession have prescribed bergamot essential oil for help with
drug withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a treatment at Manhattan's Paul Labrecque Salon &AMP;
Spa called the ``antidepressant facial.'' Administered with the
Gisele Delorme skin-care line, the active ingredient is petitgrain
oil, a woodier version of neroli that is known to reduce tension
headaches and treat less serious depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that flowers would give the skin a boost.
Beautiful blooms, so naturally intoxicating, have been lifting the
psyche since Eve discovered them in the Garden of Eden. &QL;

<P>
   Flowers have long been admired in paintings and verse for their
physical beauty, but they also work their art on the olfactory
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, they've been rediscovered on the beauty scene. Dedicated
sybarites and wishful escapists looking to unwind after a hard day
at the office swear by the scent of blossoms and the curative
effects of petals. Stated simply: Blooms are primo when it comes to
pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Immerse yourself in flowers or their essence and you will truly
be transported. Spa treatments that use flowers to envelop the
senses _ if not literally, then figuratively _ abound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aqua Spa in Santa Monica, Calif., the aromatherapy
manicure and pedicure start off with a blissful soak in lavender,
rose or geranium oil.
</P>
<P>
   The ``aromatic facial'' at Spa Internazionale at Fisher Island
in Florida features custom-blended oils from plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's cozy and quiet Carapan Urban Spa, many of the
treatments use the spa's new body collection called Plateau, which
contains luxurious oils of lavender, patchouli and bergamot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Plateau Body Massage, for example, Carapan's clients get
to experience the Plateau Body &AMP; Massage Oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Aida Thibiant European Day Spa in Beverly Hills, one of the
most requested body treatments is a stress-melting soak in a 47-jet
hydrotherapy tub with Tahitian Milk Bath, a sumptuous product with
Monoi de Tahiti, a medley of petals from the rare tiare flower
soaked in oils.
</P>
<P>
   Tahitian Milk Bath is also sold at the spa for at-home revelry,
as are several newer products with Monoi de Tahiti, including a
sensuous dry oil spray and exfoliating and moisturizing body scrub.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was ever any doubt that flowers are among the most
luxurious treats in the world, consider that Christian Dior's new
skin-care line, Dior Prestige, features the nectar, or the sap, of
100 kniphofia buds, a flower that blooms on the island of
Madagascar only during June and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will transport you to another place,'' says Robert
Isabell, the florist and party planner who launched Perfumes
Isabell, a collection of body products and candles based solely on
flowers. ``They calm and bring great peace.''

LONDON, GERMAN EXCHANGES TO MERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN MAX   
 TheStreet.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Technology stocks from Frankfurt's Deutsche Borse and blue-chips
on the London Stock Exchange will trade under one roof in London as
part of a merger between the two exchanges announced Wednesday,
with the Nasdaq stock exchange forming an alliance with the merged
entity.
</P>
<P>
   The new exchange, to be called the iX, will open at 9 p.m EDT
after operations are under way, allowing Europeans to trade Nasdaq
stocks by day and Americans to trade stocks listed only on the
German and London exchanges by night. The new market will account
for 81 percent of Europe's growth market.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the European exchanges will own 50 percent of the new
entity, according to a statement from the London exchange. Don
Cruikshank, LSE's chief executive, will become the chairman of iX.
His German counterpart, Werner Seifert, will become the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The London-Frankfurt agreement is subject to approval by British
and German regulators, and by stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings to a climax two years of fitful efforts by the
London and Frankfurt exchanges to combine.
</P>
<P>
   The combination spurs a shift toward around-the-clock trading,
and rivals the New York Stock Exchange, which has been reluctant to
accommodate Nasdaq stocks among its own issues.
</P>
<P>
   The iX market, however, will move quickly to capitalize on the
stalemate between the top two U.S. markets and cross-list Nasdaq
issues on the new exchange, Cruikshank told CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The combined volume between the three exchanges could push it
past the volume on the NYSE, making it the world's largest bourse.
The compound annual growth of trading in stocks on the two
exchanges taken together is more than 35 percent over the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives behind the new exchange are also talking with
representatives from the Milan and Madrid exchanges about joining
the iX, according to a statement from the LSE.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chief executive officer of Nasdaq, in a
teleconference from London, said, ``We have no pre-conditions as to
how far this can go, and will go, with respect to the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the IPO engine of choice for Europe,'' Zarb said.
</P>
<P>
   In the teleconference, Zarb would not answer a question as to
whether the NYSE will eventually be brought into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert said in a statement that all market participants will
benefit from lower spreads due to higher liquidity. He added that
smaller trading firms will benefit from the trading system's remote
access and larger retail investors will have a wider choice of
products to trade.
</P>
<P>
   The new European exchange, to be headquartered in London but
operated in Frankfurt, will use the German trading system Xetra.
The board of directors will include up to 12 members will equal
representation from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said the link with Nasdaq should come early next year,
after the LSE and Deutsche Borse make their connection.

&HT;     WHITE HOUSE TO LOBBY TEXAS DEMOCRATS ON CHINA TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commerce Secretary William Daley is headed to Texas
Friday to urge congressional Democrats to rebuff organized labor
and vote to normalize trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is scheduled to be in Houston, McAllen and San Antonio as
the battle over the China trade bill heats up in the House of
Representatives, making it one of the most contentious votes since
the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite some optimistic press accounts, this is going to be a
tough vote,'' Daley told business leaders attending the Information
Technology Association of America's 5th annual policy summit on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to approve the bill granting China
permanent trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and the Clinton administration have banded
together to push the bill through the House, where it is expected
to face stiff opposition when it comes to the floor for a vote on
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., has announced
his opposition, citing human rights abuses by the Chinese
government and the denial of religious freedom to its people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom, a bipartisan and multifaith organization, urged
Congress to reject permanent trading privileges with China, joining
environmentalists and labor organizations in opposition to the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said China ``continues to
flagrantly violate the human rights and religious freedoms of its
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley told business leaders that opening up China to
American-made goods will give the U.S. government more leverage on
human and religious rights issues, in addition to boosting sales of
U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the United States has a $69 billion trade deficit
with China, ``because our market is open, and theirs is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, China will become the second largest market for
personal computers. Daley said the Asian country continues to
expand wireless communication. ``It is like they add a new Baby
Bell every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said Texas companies such as
SBC Telecommunications Inc. would prosper by normalizing trade
relations with China, possibly creating more jobs in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think in terms of SBC,'' said Gonzalez, who represents
the San Antonio area where SBC is based. He is being lobbied by
union leaders trying to reverse his position and oppose the trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to soothe ruffled feathers, Gonzalez has asked
Daley to meet with San Antonio labor leaders Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Daley will meet with business leaders at McAllen
Country Club in the Rio Grande Valley on the request of Rep. Ruben
Hinojosa, a Democrat from Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa remains undecided despite a trip to China last week
with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Hinojosa has assembled Rio Grande Valley elected officials,
business leaders and professors with the University of Texas Pan
American in Edinburg for the meeting with Daley, who is expected to
announce an initiative that could boost high-technology development
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Daley will be joined by Mayor Lee Brown in Houston where he is
scheduled to speak to the Asia Society at a noon luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is always a tough vote for Democrats,'' said Debra
Silimeo, a Commerce Department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, only Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, a Democrat from San
Antonio, has come out in opposition to the trade measure, which
would grant permanent trade privileges to China as it enters the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China has agreed to open its markets to enter the WTO, but
American businesses and farmers will benefit only if Congress
approves permanent normal trading relations.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noting his agricultural district, Rodriguez said he is
``concerned that American businesses will be subject to a flood of
price-busting Chinese imports.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez noted that China is among the largest exporters of
livestock, corn, cotton and peanuts, products that would compete
against those grown in Wilson and Atascosa counties, as well as
those in the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that American businesses will be subject to a
flood of price-busting Chinese imports,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>

   ``We should not hastily grant a permanent contract to China,
without first ensuring the security of our small entrepreneurs. We
can't afford it,'' he said.

   Meanwhile, Rep. Solomon Ortiz, a Democrat from Corpus Christi,
is leaning in favor of the trade measure after taking a tour of
China with private business groups involved with the Port of Corpus
Christi.

   FORWARD MARCH IN THE PARADE FOR GAY CIVIL RIGHTS. This weekend,
hundreds of thousands of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender
people will arrive in the nation's capital for the Millennium March
for Equality, a three-day celebration and civil-rights rally.
``It's history in the making,'' writes columnist Chuck Colbert, who
says the governor of Vermont's recent signing of the same-sex civil
union bill will spotlight a featured weekend event _ a mass wedding
of same-sex couples that will take place at the Lincoln Memorial.

   WIRED GENERATION: HISPANICS ONLINE. Polls indicate that
Hispanics are at home in the online market. A recent Hispanic
Business/Zogby International poll found that almost one-half (49
percent) of Hispanics have made an online purchase in the last
three months, compared to 34.7 percent of Anglos, 31.3 percent of
African Americans and 14.9 percent of Asians. Find out why
Hispanics are more likely to spend larger amounts of money and time
on the Web compared to other groups. (slugged:

   HOW SOON WE FORGET GREATNESS. ``The people of America are
usually pretty fastidious about celebrating the dates of important
historical happenings,'' writes columnist Tim Giago. One such event
occurred in South Dakota 10 years ago, but one would never know it
happened. In 1990, Gov. George Mickelson (R-S.D.) spearheaded the
effort to pass a proclamation making 1990 ``The Year of
Reconciliation'' _ a year in which Native Americans and whites come
together to resolve their differences. Mickelson also got the
state's legislators to pass a bill making Oct. 12 _ Columbus Day in
the rest of America _ Native American Day in South Dakota. Now,
nearly nothing is reported to commemorate this historic event.
``Perhaps 1990 was not the year, and perhaps the races were not
ready to come to the table as friends,'' Giago writes. And racism
between whites and Indians continues to grow. (slugged:

   WE SEE NO EVIDENCE, BUT STILL HE WAITS. Imagine being in your
home eating breakfast with your family, when U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service authorities charge in, handcuff you in front
of your wife and children and drag you off to an unspecified
location _ all without charging you with a crime. Such an arrest
occurred in Tampa on May 19, 1997. The victim: Palestinian refugee
Mazen Al-Najjar, then a 40-year-old professor at the University of
South Florida in Tampa. The ``crime'': ``secret evidence'' that
allegedly connects him with Palestine Islamic Jihad, a notorious
terrorist organization in the Middle East. This is his story, as
reported by columnist Bill Maxwell.

 HEALTHY 20-MINUTE MENUS: MAPLE YOGURT DIP FOR STRAWBERRIES

   Giving new ideas to cooks for using strawberries is a rite of
spring. Certain recipes come immediately to mind, like strawberry
short cake. And if I could think of a way to serve strawberry
shortcake in the context of low-calorie dishes, believe me I would.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you could reduce the fat by using angel food cake
instead of biscuits. You could use yogurt instead of whipped cream.
But would this be shortcake? Better to have small pieces of the
real thing once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime you don't want to miss strawberries, and if you
are picking them yourself from your own garden or a nearby farm
there isn't much you have to do to them after they are washed. When
you tire of that here are a number of other suggestions that take
very little effort and provide great rewards.
</P>
<P>
   When picking or buying strawberries choose those with the least
amount of white at the stem, preferably none at all. The white is a
sign of an unripe berry.
</P>
<P>
   Next to eating them out of hand, strawberries can be sliced and
topped just before sitting down for dinner with orange liqueur.
Such a mixture is even better over lemon sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   The maple yogurt dip for strawberries is excellent with peaches
and berries. The sweet ricotta looks handsome when mixed with cut
up peaches and spooned into a tall slender glasses. The raspberry
puree is not only handsome but delicious with blueberries.

&HT;     COMPANIES DISCUSSED CLOSING SAN FRANCISCO DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. and rival Chronicle Publishing
Co. quietly discussed several plans to avoid competing against each
other, including one in which Hearst would shut its San Francisco
Examiner in exchange for a share of the San Francisco Chronicle's
profits ``in perpetuity,'' a Chronicle executive has testified.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Sias, president and chief executive officer of Chronicle
Publishing, also testified Tuesday that consultants had said the
Examiner could compete independently against the Chronicle. But
Sias said he doubted the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Sias testified during the trial stemming from an antitrust
lawsuit that seeks to block Hearst's $660 million purchase of the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, the lawyer for the plaintiff, said Tuesday he
would seek an emergency restraining order barring Hearst from
taking adverse action against any employee for testifying in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto cited Hearst's decision Tuesday to place Examiner
publisher Timothy O. White on indefinite leave after White's
testimony Monday that he had offered San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown favorable editorials in return for Brown's support of
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended Hearst executives had known the substance of
White's testimony for months, because White gave similar sworn
statements to the U.S. Department of Justice, which was reviewing
the proposed purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that Hearst took this kind of action against White
for saying something true that they knew about,'' Alioto said.
``That puts a chilling effect on anyone else we might call to
testify from Hearst or the Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by Clint Reilly, a developer and
unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner. The lawsuit claims Hearst's
plan to purchase The Chronicle and sell its smaller afternoon
Examiner to a local publishing company will result in Hearst's
having an illegal newspaper monopoly in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst denies the claim, saying the Examiner is an economically
failing business that could not survive outside its current
profit-sharing agreement with the Chronicle, and that closing it or
selling it, therefore, could not violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier Tuesday whether White's comments on the stand were
a surprise to Hearst Corp. officials, spokesman Paul Luthringer
said, ``I'm not going to comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   White appeared in court Tuesday morning, but left soon after
Hearst lawyers chose not to question him. They said they might
question him later when they put on their defense. White was
questioned Monday by Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto sought Tuesday to elicit testimony from Sias showing the
Examiner was not a failing business, and that Hearst and Chronicle
Publishing negotiated to avoid future economic competition with
each other as rival morning newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Sias acknowledged that Martin Jaffe, Chronicle Publishing's
chief financial officer, had done a study showing the Examiner
could compete independently against the Chronicle with what Alioto
called ``a high degree of success.'' But Sias said, ``We did not
give it any credence. My reaction was this was totally
unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto introduced a confidential April 6, 1996, memo from Sias
to Patricia Tobin, a member of the Chronicle's board of directors,
that discussed a deal in which Hearst would sell or close the
Examiner in return for 34 percent of the Chronicle's profits ``in
perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ongoing discussion we are trying to get a sense of the
final conditions under which Hearst would agree to close the
Examiner,'' Sias noted in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's owners were negotiating with Hearst because they
were unhappy with the joint operating agreement, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have had the
agreement to share printing, advertising and circulation. They
split profits after joint costs, then each pays the cost of their
separate editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements are an exception to antitrust laws, and are
allowed by the Newspaper Preservation Act, which is meant to keep
alive newspapers in danger of failing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle owners were displeased with the agreement because
although their larger morning paper generated 80 percent of total
revenue, they were required to share it evenly with the Examiner,
Sias testified.
</P>
<P>
   New York-Hearst announced Aug. 6, 1999, that it would buy the
Chronicle and sell or merge the Examiner into the larger newspaper.
The Justice Department has approved the deal.

NASDAQ ENTERS ALLIANCE WITH LONDON, GERMAN EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, updates throughout)  
 By KEVIN MAX   
 TheStreet.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market made a large stride Wednesday in the direction
of building a global unified trading place after entering an
alliance with the London and Frankfurt exchanges to provide the
single European source for high-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks from Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse and
blue-chips on the London Stock Exchange will trade on a new
exchange. The headquarters will be in London with operations in
Frankfurt and include the aspirations of the fast-growing Nasdaq
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The new exchange, to be called the iX, will open at 9 p.m New
York time after operations are under way. The iX will allow
Europeans to trade Nasdaq stocks by day and Americans to trade tech
stocks listed only on the German exchange and blue-chip stocks on
the London exchange by night. The new market will account for 81
percent of Europe's growth market.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the European exchanges will own 50% of the new entity,
according to a statement from the London exchange. Don Cruikshank,
LSE's chief executive, will become the chairman of iX. His German
counterpart, Werner Seifert, will become the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The London-Frankfurt agreement is subject to approval by British
and German regulators, and by stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The merger brings to a climax two years of fitful efforts by the
London and Frankfurt exchanges to combine.
</P>
<P>
   The combination spurs a shift toward around-the-clock trading,
and rivals the New York Stock Exchange, which has been reluctant to
accommodate Nasdaq stocks among its own issues.
</P>
<P>
   The iX market, however, will move quickly to capitalize on the
stalemate between the top two U.S. markets and cross-list Nasdaq
issues on the new exchange, Cruikshank told CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The volume and liquidity on the new exchange will dwarf that of
the NYSE, and could force the Big Board to reconsider its position
as an isolated market while the Nasdaq is opening new markets
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq currently trades more than twice the number of shares
a day that the NYSE does.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the NYSE said: ``We're continuing to talk to
everyone.'' But he declined to comment on any initiatives in
Europe. ``Our chairman has talked about creating an alliance in the
Americas, including Central, South and North America,'' he
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Also, more companies coming public in initial public offering
are boosting the growth rate of the Nasdaq while the NYSE brought
in a third less new companies in 1999 than the previous year.
Notably, NYSE's income has been contracting while the growth rate
of Nasdaq and its European partners has been growing.
</P>
<P>
   Executives behind the new exchange are also talking with
representatives from the Milan and Madrid exchanges about joining
the iX, according to a statement from the LSE.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, chief executive officer of Nasdaq, in a
teleconference from London, said, ``We have no preconditions as to
how far this can go, and will go, with respect to the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the IPO engine of choice for Europe,'' Zarb said.
</P>
<P>
   In the teleconference, Zarb would not answer a question as to
whether the NYSE will eventually be brought into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under current conditions, individual investors in the U.S.
currently have to either find a brokerage firm with access to
European markets, or take the less-direct route of buying a mutual
fund to own shares of Frankfurt- and London-listed stocks. European
investors face the same obstacles when investing in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Under the alliance, U.S. investors will be able to trade these
in the same way that they can now trade (CSCO:Nasdaq) or Amazon
(AMXN:Nasdaq). European investors will have local access all of the
companies listed on Nasdaq as well.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the deal will eventually hold all European
companies listed on the U.S. exchange to the American accounting
and financial data reporting standards, providing investors with
more information about the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert said in a statement that all market participants will
benefit from lower spreads due to higher liquidity. He added that
smaller trading firms will benefit from the trading system's remote
access and larger retail investors will have a wider choice of
products to trade.
</P>
<P>
   The new European exchange, to be headquartered in London but
operated in Frankfurt, will use the German trading system Xetra.
The board of directors will include up to 12 members will equal
representation from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said the link with Nasdaq should come early next year,
after the LSE and Deutsche Borse make their connection.

BIBLE BELONGS TO ALL, WRITER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For seven years, Amy Dockser Marcus was a foreign correspondent
based in Israel writing stories from one of the world's most
strife-torn regions.
</P>
<P>
   And few things stirred more passion than debates touching on the
Bible. In Israel, as Marcus quickly discovered, the Bible often is
used to divide people _ Israelis from non-Israelis to be sure, but
also Israelis from each other.
</P>
<P>
   There were instances when Israel's conservative religious
parties threatened to bring down the ruling government because of
controversies involving the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Her concern over what she perceived to be a near monopoly of
religious opinion is one reason Marcus wrote a recently released
book, ``The View from Nebo: How Archaeology is Rewriting the Bible
and Reshaping the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to believe that the Bible belonged to them,''
said Marcus, who covered the Middle East for The Wall Street
Journal from 1991 to 1998 and is now a senior writer at Money
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the idea that people might have to apologize for
using the Bible in a way that was not popular,'' added Marcus. ``I
feel the Bible is filled with fabulous stories and it is an
incredible heritage. But it doesn't belong to one people. It
belongs to everyone. I felt that the right to read the Bible and
see what you want in it and interpret it the way you want is
something worth fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaving together science, politics, history, and Biblical
scholarship, Marcus analyzes what insights modern archeology can
provide on some of the stories of the Old Testament. In some cases,
contemporary science buttresses what the Old Testament chronicles
and in other instances disputes the biblical record.
</P>
<P>
   And in a land where competing biblical claims have been the
cause of so much bloodshed, Marcus also wanted to underscore the
evidence archeology provides suggesting that the people living in
the biblical period had more things in common than is generally
believed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Marcus notes, it wasn't just the Israelites who did
not eat pork, but all the different people who populated the region
during ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to emerge from the archeological record is that
there was a lot of common ground between Israel and her neighbors
in artistic tradition, commercial trade back and forth, and
religious practices,'' Marcus said. ``I thought if people could get
more exposure to this other history, this fuller history, knowing
that there was a lot of cultural exchange, it would give them a
different perspective on how the Bible is used in a contemporary
political context and what the potential might be for that.''
</P>
<P>
   While archeological digs in the Middle East have been occurring
for more than a century, Marcus says recent technological
advancements have made it possible for researchers to more
accurately assess historical evidence _ and not always in ways that
please biblical defenders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Exodus story, one of the central moments in the
story of the Jewish people commemorated every year during Passover,
has come under scrutiny because of what archeologists have found.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence found in Egypt suggests that there might have been no
Israelites kept as slaves during the period coinciding with the
Exodus saga. The belief passed on through generations that it was
Israelite slaves who built the pyramids has been strongly
challenged by scientists who say sites unearthed around the
pyramids shows they were not built by slaves but by skilled
crafstmen and laborers compensated for their work, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, she points out, there is no evidence that the Jews spent
40 years wandering in the desert as the Bible describes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say that it could have been a small group of
Israeli slaves that escaped and it became a part of our national
myth just like the pilgrims and the Mayflower are part of our
national myth,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The point, according to Marcus, is not what is true or not true
in the Bible. ``The fact is that these biblical stories are an
ancient tradition that has kept together as a group for thousands
of years,'' she said. ``That's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Marcus said, the authors of the Bible did not mean it to
become a fossilized document.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from the moment the Bible was written down, people were
trying to change it,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible writers believed it was a living document. So
archeologists and even we who read the Bible who have our own
interpretation are part of an ancient tradition of reinterpreting
the Bible.''

   Question of the Week
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My question is about Mormons and their no-caffeine,
no-alcohol rule. Are they allowed decaffeinated beverages? What
about food cooked with wine? And how come Donny and Marie Osmond on
their show eat chocolate, which contains caffeine?
</P>
<P>
   - J.B.P., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Mormons, officially known as The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, do not avoid caffeine in all its forms, but are
supposed to avoid coffee and tea.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon dietary restrictions stem from the Word of Wisdom, a
health code written in 1833 by church founder Joseph Smith. That
code bars the consumption of tobacco, ``wine or strong drink,''
which is understood to mean liquor, and ``hot drink,'' which is
understood to mean coffee or tea. Many Mormons also avoid the
consumption of caffeinated colas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sue Schmidt, regional public affairs director for
the church, observant Mormons do not drink decaffeinated coffee or
tea. However, she said, there is no prohibition against food cooked
with small amounts of alcohol, or against chocolate, which contains
caffeine.

JOURNALISM IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more memorable letters that have fluttered into this
corner's mailbox was a handwritten note perhaps a quarter-century
back, a real ink-on-paper-none-of-your-cheezy-ballpoints-here
Palmer Penmanship missive from the late speaker of the US House,
John W. McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   I forget just what column sparked his writing, but what stands
out was the generalization from this shrewd old politician who'd
seen a lot of the wicked ways in which the world works: ``The
fabric of civilization is very thin,'' he cautioned, ``and easily
rent, so all in public life, press as well as politics, had best
tread warily, and don't push the poor too hard.'' That sober
warning recurs to me often, most recently this week on the occasion
of the convening of the 50th annual conclave of the International
Press Institute in Boston, where 500 publishers, poobahs, editors,
and assorted spear carriers.
</P>
<P>
   At speeches and panels much was made of the fluidity of
post-Cold War geography, the oppositional centrifugal and
centripetal forces spun off by globalization, and the evolving
roles of the news media in an era of disorienting technological
change.
</P>
<P>
   What is obvious to bosses of the planet's media and to
politicians whose agendas they frame, advance, retard, or condemn
is the interlocking nature of government and media. What's less
obvious to the great masses of news consumers is the parlous nature
of root-out-the-secrets journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The IPI keeps track of the relentless repression of journalists
in many of the world's countries, some as prosperous as Ireland,
some as poor as the most barren African outback. In just the past
10 years, 458 reporters, editors, or news technicians have been
murdered in the course of their work _ almost as many victims over
a decade as total delegates in the hall at one of the Press
Institute's plenary sessions.
</P>
<P>
   If your idea of a journalist is some ``hammy blowhard'' (Tom
Shales's un-toppable description of a certain ABC ``personality'')
spouting banalties with practiced self-assurance, you might want to
broaden the definition to include some of the 65 journalists and 21
support staff who were killed on duty last year alone or the 87
working reporters imprisoned last year or the 118 confined the year
before. They are paying the dues for all of us who pontificate
profitably from the safety of journalistic sinecures. In this
country, the opinion makers worry more about their 401(k) plans
than the sudden and unwelcome appearance in the driver's side
window of an AK-47 pointed by a trigger-happy teenager.
</P>
<P>
   With media bosses from all over the world dipping into canapes
and cocktails after weighty words from the likes of Vice President
Gore, Henry Kissinger, Tom Brokaw, and the rest, there was no
shortage of shop talk about the journalist job to be done in the
age of AIDS and HIV, famine and ethnic cleansing, the Internet and
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   The important things can never get done without ground being
prepared by sustained media coverage of a high order of accuracy
and reliability. Nothing will get set right without the commitment,
funding, and leadership that can be marshaled only by explanation
and debate in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The map is blotched in places by the blood spilt in precincts
where the papers and broadcast outlets are in the hands of despotic
regimes or proprietors. The Russian election was a case study in
the character assassination of rivals to the favored candidate. In
the late, lamented Yugoslavia we have seen a decade's worth of
death and destruction fomented, in large measure, by villainous
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague of mine at Oxford's Reuter Foundation told of
how Bosnia fell into the jaws of the dogs of war when prominent
journalists succumbed to the temptation to savage rival ethnic
groups, to become ``a soldier with a typewriter . . . a soldier
with a microphone.''
</P>
<P>
   China's saber-rattling over Taiwan, nuclear-tipped braggadocio
in Pakistan and India, the impotence of some African regimes in
confronting AIDS, the plundering of the Southern Hemisphere's rain
forests, all these high-risk behaviors flourish in the absence or
weakness of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   When the news editor of his family newspaper in Colombia,
Francisco Santos of Bogota's El Tiempo, is driven out of the
country by repeated threats on his life, that tells me, if not
Santos, that his country is not ready for prime-time US aid. The
overlapping drug and guerrilla warfare raging there for 36 years
left seven Colombian journalists killed last year alone, 24
kidnapped, and 15 forced to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, our problem is too much influence, not too
little. We have a terrible problem with credibility. We careen from
the stupefying to the soporific with the flip of a page, remote, or
mouse. And our audiences keep tuning out. You can track the decline
of serious TV network news from abroad as a mirror image graph of
the wild popularity of sadistic and degrading professional
wrestling, a tale of less bread and more circuses, please.

BLOOM OFF THE ROSES FOR TRAINER BAFFERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Things are quieter around trainer Bob
Baffert's barn than they have been during previous Kentucky Derby
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Baffert earned the limelight by saddling Silver Charm
to victory in the Derby at 4-1. The following year, having become
the darling of the media, he won the Rose Run again, as Real Quiet
scored at 8-1. Last year, he sent out the entry of Excellent
Meeting and General Challenge, which was favored at 9-2. However,
both had troubled trips and wound up off the board.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with only long shot Captain Steve, Baffert is on the
edge of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the love?'' said Baffert, ever quick with a quip, when
he saw a smaller-than-usual media contingent approach Tuesday
morning, after Captain Steve worked 5 furlongs in :59 2/5 over the
Churchill Downs strip.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert then turned serious and put matters into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Captain Steve is getting the treatment he should be
getting,'' he said. ``But he's got a chance. I've put him in
position to win the race, but he's got to get it done. Fusaichi
Pegasus is so talented, he can make a mistake and still get there.
Captain Steve has to get over the track without a straw in his
path. He just needs a lot of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get him any more prepared. I feel good about it. I
can sleep at night. But we still have to worry about the draw.
That's the magic pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, a son of Fly So Free, out of a Vice Regent mare,
was a relatively modest yearling, costing $70,000. By contract,
Fusaichi Pegusus is a $4 million yearling. Captain Steve has raced
three times this year, and been third each time. But he has one big
thing in his favor: He likes this track.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Captain Steve won the Kentucky Jockey Club at
Churchill, and he preceded Tuesday's eye-catching move with two
other superior workouts, going 4 furlongs in :47 1/5 over a muddy
surface April 17, the best of 28 horses who worked that distance
that day, and zipping 5 panels in :59 4/5 April 22. Also, Captain
Steve, who has raced with blinkers in his last eight starts, worked
without them Tuesday and will race without them in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work went great,'' said Baffert. ``It was the last major
hurdle. This is the workout that tips you off. He's still doing
great. He's more relaxed; he's much better with no blinkers. He was
getting hot behind the gate with blinkers on. Now, we'll let him
look around. I don't know if he's good enough to win, but he's fit
and ready, and he'll have no trouble with a mile and one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 15-1. There are some nice horses here, horses who have
accomplished more. He's earned over $900,000 but he hasn't won this
year. This is the first Derby I've been involved in where there is
so much depth. Before, there were two or three horses to worry
about. This field has talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Steve is different from Silver Charm. Silver Charm was
a gritty, gutsy horse. He liked to duke it out. Captain Steve is
more like Real Quiet, a green horse who is finding his best stride.
Whether he's as good as either of them, it's hard to say. But he's
won as much money as they had at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Robby Albarado, a fixture in Kentucky racing, will ride Captain
Steve, who is owned by Mike Pegram. Pegram is the laidback
fast-food magnate (he owns 18 McDonald's franchises in the Seattle
area) who also owned Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is a relaxed guy,'' said Baffert. ``He doesn't worry
about what I do with these horses. It's hard enough to worry about
the horses without having to worry about the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was time for more humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media makes the favorites in the Derby, and a lot of them
are false,'' Baffert said. ``You guys are bad handicappers. My
greatest fear in life used to be not having good horses. Now, it's
the media.''

IT'S FIRST AND 10 FOR WOMEN'S PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans have embraced the idea of women playing soccer;
they've gotten used to women playing basketball; they've warmed up
to the sight of women playing ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But women playing football, wearing pads and tackling each
other? The sport doesn't make it in the NCAA, and women only
grudgingly are allowed to play on some Pop Warner and high school
teams. Flag football is acceptable for the fair sex, and so is
rugby, but tackle football? Give me a break, the naysayers cry.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, though, enough men and women have ignored
that cry to plow ahead and form a national Women's Professional
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter the league had a trial run of six games, with
two teams in the Midwest and a team put together by women in New
York. The trial seemed to work; the league now has 14 teams,
including the New England Storm. Tryouts begin later this month,
team camps open in September, and the season starts Oct. 14, with
games every Saturday until the championship game on Feb. 4. The
all-star game will be Feb. 17 in Miami's Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   One of the organizers of the WPFL used to play for the Minnesota
Vikings and the San Diego Chargers, another promotes minor league
football, and a coach of one of the teams used to play for the Jets
and the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone ask if these women are serious?
</P>
<P>
   The stories of commitment include women who work the sport into
their schedules as doctors, lawyers, police officers, and
housewives.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Brook, 42, left her husband and two children every week
last fall to drive six hours from Rochester to Long Island to train
with the Sharks. Kim Ketchum, who turned 18 last August, said
goodbye to her home in San Diego to fly to Minneapolis to play with
the Minnesota Vixens. Jennifer Blum, a first-year student at
Western New England School of Law in Springfield, Mass., spent her
first semester driving to Long Island every weekend to train with
the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the others, Blum doesn't rant about Title IX, or
moan about the lack of opportunity for women in sports as her
motivation for doing this. In fact, she's simplistic about her
desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life I always wanted to be a football player,'' Blum
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was her chance.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Korpacz, a lawyer from Providence, R.I., didn't play in
the fledgling league last year, but is now one of the general
managers as head of the New England Storm. She has one friend as
her assistant and another as the team's graphic designer. They've
decided on the team's logo, and the uniform colors (``red, white,
and blue, like the Patriots''), but Korpacz is still on the lookout
for a field, and is interviewing potential coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Korpacz said she thinks contact football is a natural
progression for women who play flag football, the club sport in
which tearing off a flag substitutes for tackling. It should also
attract women who play rugby, do martial arts, or run track, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another level of sports that women can go to to
display their talents, and I have a feeling it will fill the
void,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who play in my flag football league, you don't know
exactly why you want to play, but you know that I'm good at this,
I'm good at catching the ball, handling the ball, running, doing
plays,'' she said. ``So the next logical thing would be to try out
for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   And Korpacz said she's prepared for the cynics who will wonder
why women want to don helmets and wear pads like the men do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had one negative comment yet, but bring on the
questions,'' she said. ``If people have questions or want to
trivialize it, that's fine; they have their reasons. But I think
the time is now, and women should be given a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter Turner, one of the league's founders, had a couple of
reasons to create the WPFL. One is his 15 years of experience with
World Wide Sports, a Minnesota-based organization that promotes
minor league football and college all-star games. The other is his
16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago she would have had no choice,'' Turner said.
``Now she can be a doctor, lawyer, or a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe in her spare time she can be a football player,
since the league will pay the women only $100 a game, although the
league will pay for uniforms and travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets will range from $5 to $20, and Turner said he hopes to
get between 3,000 and 5,000 people at a game. Each franchise will
have five games, and is expected to sell 1,000 season tickets by
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But he's optimistic based on the more than 300 women who showed
up for tryouts last fall, and on the ensuing exposure the league
got, with games in Chicago, Minneapolis, Miami, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones have been ringing off the hook,'' he said,
acknowledging that curiosity is part of the attraction. ``We know
there's a lot of novelty in it, but we'll capitalize on that. We
feel if people will come to one game, they'll come back for more.''
</P>
<P>
   John Turner, who for eight years played with the Minnesota
Vikings and coached the Minnesota Vixens, is the league's
commissioner. Former Jets player Bobby Jackson coached the New York
Sharks (the collection of flag football players who wanted to
challenge the WFPL), and former Jets and Giants player Lou Piccone
will coach the Rochester Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women had clashes with the boys when they were
growing up when they tried to horn in on ``their sport.'' The
controversy either inspired them or turned them off of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Blum, 26, said she was such a good soccer player that when she
was 9, a coach asked her to play on the boys' team. But the head of
the league protested, a lawsuit followed (her father is a lawyer),
and Blum lost her desire for soccer even though she won the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is very powerful, but society is very powerful, too,''
said Blum, who got harassing phone calls from men. ``Hey, it was
just soccer, but it ceased to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to play softball and basketball in high school, and
tried out for the Silver Bullets baseball team. She didn't make it,
so started playing flag football.
</P>
<P>
   Ketchum, a defensive lineman who is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs
190 pounds, grew up playing Pop Warner and high school football in
Oceanside, Calif. It was her grandfather who alerted her of tryouts
for the WPFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't really a tomboy,'' said Ketchum. ``I did have
Barbie dolls and Cabbage Patch kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Korpacz, sounds as if she's working almost as hard on the Storm
as she does with the law firm she started last summer.
</P>
<P>
   She'll announce tryout dates and places on the team's Web site
(www.newenglandstorm.com) on May 15, then invite 80 women to
training camp on Sept. 2, and eventually cut the roster to 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start somewhere, and if it works it's great, and
if it doesn't work, well, I was still a part of it,'' she said.

WHAT THE NATION LEARNED AT KENT STATE IN 1970 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle lasted only 13 seconds, yet it became the Dienbienphu
of the American involvement in the Vietnam War. On May 4, 1970, on
the sunny campus of Kent State University, Ohio National Guardsmen
opened fire on unarmed students. Their bullets wounded nine and
killed four.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking the nation and the world, Kent State would eventually
turn public opinion against the war, but in the short run, the
shooting aided the aims of those two self-admiring geniuses of
manipulation, Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger. Within a
week of the shooting, a Newsweek poll indicated that 58 percent of
Americans blamed students for the deaths at Kent State. Only 11
percent blamed the National Guard, which was ordered to Kent State
by Governor James A. Rhodes ``to eradicate the communist element''
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was elected in 1968, saying he had a secret plan to end
the war. In truth, he had no clue.
</P>
<P>
   With Kissinger, his national security adviser, Nixon widened the
war because, the president said on April 30, 1970, America would
otherwise become ``a pitiful, helpless giant.'' Nixon and Kissinger
concealed their plans to invade Cambodia from Congress and from
Secretary of State William Rogers and Secretary of Defense Melvin
Laird. When campuses erupted in anger, Nixon blithely said, four
days after Kent State, ``I have not been surprised by the intensity
of the protests.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the emotional intensity of the time, multiply the
Elian Gonzalez uproar by 100 million. The issue of Vietnam was not
symbolic but life and death. I know that my anger disturbed my
professional composure, which I found surprising, but not
regrettable. On May 4, I was at the White House when press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler read Nixon's statement that Kent State
``should remind us all once again that when dissent turns to
violence, it invites tragedy.'' Blaming the victim was a
Nixon-Kissinger trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1968, I had earned my place on Nixon's ``enemies list'' by
asking questions, but never heatedly. I seldom hassled Ziegler, for
whom I had a certain respect, repaid when he avoided trouble during
Watergate. I was also skeptical of the flag-burning elements within
the antiwar movement, which I covered eagerly because it was a
great story. My refusal to cooperate with J. Edgar Hoover's
investigations fattened my FBI file, but as a recent Army veteran,
I didn't think soldiers were automatically killers.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, I thought the Ohio Guardsmen were. ``How do you
know those students weren't walking to the library?'' I bellowed at
Ziegler. Startled, he began to backpedal, talking about ``further
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later, the FBI report stated that the students were no
threat to the Guard: ``Jeff Miller's body was found 85-90 yards
from the Guard. Allison Krause fell about 100 yards away. William
Schroeder and Sandy Scheuer were approximately 130 yards away from
the Guard when they were shot. . . . Sandy Scheur, as best we can
determine, was on her way to a speech therapy class. We do not know
whether Schroeder participated in any way in the confrontations
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began what Russell Baker called ``that sour decade'' and
what David Halberstam called the era of ``us against us.'' A few
voices in Congress warned against what the war was doing to
America. Tip O'Neill, then a midlevel member of the Rules
Committee, urged the House to ``look at the situation. No nation
can destroy us militarily, but what can destroy us from within is
happening now.'' But the House backed Nixon heavily, buying the
``helpless giant'' argument. So did most Americans. In 1972, Nixon
won reelection and 49 states.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist historians now argue that the war was somehow a
swell idea. They imply that Nixon and Kissinger were thus virtuous
and wise. I was there and bear witness that their legacy is one of
lies and blood.

&HT;     PETERS TAKES THE READER BY STORM IN `THUNDER IN THE SKY' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking up the latest Elizabeth Peters mystery, featuring
archaeologists Amelia Peabody and her husband, Radcliffe Emerson,
is like hearing from old friends and learning of their latest
adventures. And as always, it is pure delight.
</P>
<P>
   In ``He Shall Thunder in the Sky'' (William Morrow, $25, 400
pages), the Emerson clan has returned to Egypt even though war has
broken out in Europe. Emerson is put in charge of the excavations
at the Pyramids at Giza because the German who has supervised the
site for years has been barred from returning to Egypt until the
war is over. The Emersons' son, Ramses, has refused to join the
British army, and he's treated like a coward by most of the Britons
who live in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Their beloved nephew David has been deported to India because of
his support of the Egyptian nationalist cause. David's wife, Lia,
remains in Britain, awaiting the birth of their first child.
</P>
<P>
   Nefret, the Emersons' beautiful ward, works at a hospital for
women and tries to regain Ramses' trust and love, which she fears
she has lost forever. The Emersons' despicable nephew Percy is, of
course, one of the most respected members of the British general
staff in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard to maintain his pacifist image, Ramses actually is
impersonating the nationalist leader el Wardini and trying to
discover who is smuggling weapons to the nationalists. Emerson
uncovers an incredible statue that Peabody realizes had to have
been planted by their archenemy, the master criminal Sethos. As
each member of the Emerson family is hiding secrets from the
others, the dangers can only increase for all of them. Sins of the
past only add to their perils.
</P>
<P>
   ``He Shall Thunder in the Sky,'' the 12th in the series,
resolves many unanswered questions from previous books. Fans will
find it hard to put down (if you haven't read this series, begin at
the beginning when Emerson and Peabody first meet). Using witty
dialogue and deft plot devices, Peters instills her protagonists
with strength, high moral character and a deep sense of family.
They may not tell each other ``I love you,'' but each knows how
much he or she is cherished. That adds to the charm that has made
this series so much fun.

   ``Before I Say Good-Bye.'' By Mary Higgins Clark. Simon &AMP;
Schuster. $26. 332 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Higgins Clark is the undisputed queen of the cozy, the
mystery subgenre ``defined by its light tone and element of fun.''
Her legions of fans won't be disappointed by ``Before I Say
Good-Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Nell McDermott is a newspaper columnist; granddaughter of
Cornelius ``Mac'' McDermott, one of New York's most beloved former
congressman; and the wife of architect Adam Cauliff, who opposes
her decision to run for her grandfather's House seat.
</P>
<P>
   Nell and Adam quarrel over her decision, and he storms out of
the condominium. Later, his assistant, Winifred Johnson, shows up
at the couple's home to pick up his jacket and briefcase. Nell
senses that something very bad is going to happen. That evening,
during a routine business meeting on his yacht in New York harbor,
an explosion kills Adam and three colleagues _ Johnson, builder Sam
Krause and construction foreman Jimmy Ryan. Peter Lang, a prominent
real estate broker, missed the meeting due to a traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nell is devastated. Encouraged by her Aunt Gert, Nell visits a
medium, who gives her a message from Adam saying not to trust Lang.
Investigators find that the explosion was caused by a bomb. Mac
learns Adam was involved in some shady business practices. Ryan's
wife finds $50,000 hidden in her husband's work room, takes the
money to Nell and asks her to find out where it came from. That
investigation will put Nell in great peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I Say Good-Bye'' is a fast read, with interesting
characters and a strong plot. At first, I didn't think the medium
stuff worked, but the ending won't work without it. Higgins once
again strikes gold.

   ``The Lion's Game.'' By Nelson DeMille. Warner Books.$26.95. 677
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson DeMille's latest thriller would have been a sure-fire
winner if it had been just 200 pages shorter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Anti-Terrorist Task Force is waiting for the arrival of
Trans-Continental Flight 175 from Paris. On board is Asad Khalil, a
Libyan terrorist known as the Lion, who is wanted by most Western
governments because of his widespread terrorist activities. About
two hours out of New York, the control tower loses contact with
Flight 175, which remains on course.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane finally lands, crash crews are waiting. When the
plane is boarded, everyone is dead, and the Lion is not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins a massive hunt for the Lion, led by agents John
Corey and Kate Mayfield. Everyone who comes in contact with the
Lion dies. And it soon becomes apparent that Lion's mission will
wreak havoc across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion's Game'' is overwritten, which is too bad because
DeMille has a really good plot going. The protagonists are a little
too glib, but the Lion really is a well-drawn character.

THE WRONG OATH FOR THE BOY SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Boy Scouts of America is a private club, then Central
Park is Augusta National, the subway is Steinbrenner's skybox,
school lunch is Lutece, and the Lincoln Memorial is Studio 54.
These incongruities have not stopped the Scouts from coveting what
country clubs, luxury boxes, elite restaurants, exclusive beach
resorts, and chic dance clubs share in common: Maitre 'ds. Guards.
Bouncers.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts want it all. They want to bathe their club in red,
white, and blue strobe lights even as they scrutinize the line
trying to get in, flexing their biceps, cracking their knuckles,
and scowling at unwanted guests. They want to be all-American yet
do not want all Americans. They pledge to ``respect and defend the
rights of all people'' yet have obviously amended their oath to
say, ``I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country . . .
to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally
straight in order to jack up queer Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Boy Scouts of America argued before the Supreme
Court that it has the right to exclude homosexuals. The case
concerns the expulsion a decade ago of James Dale, an Eagle Scout
assistant scoutmaster, from his troop in Monmouth County, N.J.,
after the troop saw an article about him being gay. Dale was a
co-president of a gay rights group at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court said the expulsion was wrong
because the scouts are a public accommodation covered by state
antidiscrimination laws. The Boy Scouts of America says it is a
private club that can do what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   To be clear, not every scout troop feels as driven to expunge
gay Scouts and Scoutmasters. Asked what would happen to a Dale in
Boston, Brock Bigsby, executive of the Boston Minuteman Council,
said: ``I can't picture that it would play out the same way. Based
on what I know from the news, we wouldn't have taken any action. We
don't inquire. Frankly, it doesn't even enter into the equation. I
would suspect pretty much that our scouting membership represents a
cross-section of the society as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national organization is so pigheaded it makes you want
to just say, fine, go ahead, be a private club. But then, don't
take money from all the charities that would be nailed to the wall
if they, too, discriminated that way.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, for instance, the 1999 donor list includes the United
Way, Fleet, BankBoston, American Express, Hilton and Marriott
hotels, the Globe, BU, MIT, Northeastern, law firms, labor unions,
and law enforcement agencies, restaurants, real estate and credit
card firms, law enforcement agencies, and telecommunications,
energy and high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   If the Boy Scouts of America say it is a private club, it should
renounce its dependency on the public. In New Jersey, more than 600
public school and law enforcement agencies have ties to the scouts.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 5 million Boy Scouts. Two thirds of Boy Scout
troops are in churches, and two-thirds of the churches that sponsor
units disapprove of homosexuality enough to support the Scouts
against Dale (Mormons, United Methodists, Missouri Synod Lutherans,
and the National Catholic Committee on Scouting).
</P>
<P>
   Church affiliation or not, no one disputes the vast interaction
the scouts have with the public. Despite the dominance of churches,
the American Association of School Administrators says there are
425,000 boys in 12,000 troops in public schools. Law enforcement
and fire departments sponsor 7,000 troops with 132,847 members. The
2001 national Boy Scout Jamboree, which will bring together 37,000
people, will be held on US Army land in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting benefits from government for things as unspoken as
having ponds stocked for fishing trips. More than 90 percent of
police precinct houses in New York City support Explorer scouts.
Half of Newark's schools have scout troops. A brief filed by
several cities on behalf of Dale said, ``Municipal sponsorship is
the result of a conscious decision by the Boy Scouts to solicit
municipalities as their partners in scouting.''
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests we can end this matter very quickly. Give the
Boy Scouts a choice. If they want to remain an all-American club,
drop the suit, reinstate Dale, and follow the scout admonition to
``respect those with ideas and customs that are different from his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the scouts persist in living under a rock, companies,
universities, public schools, and police and fire departments
should rethink their support of the scouts. No one wants it to come
to this, given what the scouts do for a child's sense of
accomplishment and for communities across America.
</P>
<P>
   But neither do sensible people want to be part of a youth group
that teaches reverence on one hand and revulsion on the other. The
scouts would not be what they are without access to public spaces,
places, and institutions. They cannot be allowed, at their own
homophobic convenience, to become the Straight Country Club, Hetero
Head, or the Discrimination Disco. We love scouts for their
bravery. We will love them less as bouncers.

accent over the ``e.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Returning to China five years after moving away, I was
stunned by the new sights in Beijing: fashionably-dressed young men
and women sipping mochas at Starbucks, and mulling over living room
furniture and bathroom fixtures at Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   New sidewalk billboards had sprung up everywhere, with just
about every one taken up by advertisements for Chinese dot-com
companies. Massive new office buildings, indoor malls and luxury
apartment buildings dominate much of the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had become a far more international and modern city in
just a few years. Whereas culinary variety used to mean choosing
from Cantonese, Sichuanese or Hunanese, now options for eating out
include Italian, Brazilian, Lebanese and more. When a friend
recently said, ``I don't want Chinese for dinner, I had it for
lunch,'' it didn't sound ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Even government agencies have entered the digital era. The
Public Security Bureau, which issues visas and keeps an eye on
foreign journalists, has fancy new computers, as does every clerk
at the post office. But when a postal worker reached for her abacus
to add up my postage, it hit me _ some very fundamental things
haven't changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a lot of things: it still takes one month to get a
phone line installed; the English-language China Daily is as boring
as ever; purchasing anything at a department store still involves a
convoluted routine with glue, red rubber stamps and several layers
of carbon paper; and connections are still the key to getting
things done. Just about every aspect of life here _ from getting
into a good school and finding a good job to getting bureaucratic
problems resolved _ will go smoother if you've got good guanxi, or
connections.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in Beijing for three and half years in the early 1990s
and had made only two brief visits back since 1995. After getting
over the shock of the new Beijing my first few days, the hassles of
the old Beijing quickly came to haunt me.
</P>
<P>
   While China may have invented gunpowder and noodles, bureaucracy
may be one of its lesser-appreciated contributions to the world. To
live and work in China and get my shipment through customs required
the following documents:
</P>
<P>
   1. Housing contract in a foreign journalist-approved housing
unit;
</P>
<P>
   2 . Certificate of health, including HIV and syphilis screening,
from a local hospital;
</P>
<P>
   3. Journalist's work card, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   4. Journalist visa, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   5. Residence permit, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   6. News organization permit, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   7. And customs certificate, from Customs;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these couldn't be obtained in just any order. No,
there was a strict sequence. To get my shipment, I needed numbers
4, 5 and 7. To get numbers 4 and 5, I needed numbers 1, 2 and 3 and
a one-week wait. To get number 7, I needed numbers 3, 5 and 6. To
get number 6, I had to pay more than $100 for a two-line notice in
the Beijing Daily announcing Cox Newspapers' presence. Many of
these documents required photos _ some had to be 1-inch, some
2-inch.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this could've been done without the Cox Newspapers
chop, which thankfully, my predecessors left for me. Like most
chops, ours is nothing more than a simple rubber stamp with our
name, but every organization in China _ governmental or private _
has one, and nothing is official without it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the bureaucracy, though, is the almost feudal mindset
of some officials. While the Foreign Ministry is making efforts to
be more accessible to foreign journalists, other government
agencies seem stuck in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to a Beijing municipal department with a simple
question is met with: ``It's not my duty to provide that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Internet is flooding the country with as much
information as its citizens care to access, Customs thinks it can
seal China's borders and keep out dangerous foreign influences.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am a journalist, it insisted on inspecting my shipment
of personal belongings. When I was notified of the upcoming
inspection, a Chinese friend assured me they were looking only for
drugs, pornography and the like, and they wouldn't be so backwards
as to confiscate books and video-tapes as they did in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   But indeed, the Customs official found seven books he decided
could not be allowed in the country. His book choice was _ I hate
to say it _ inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Books I would have thought objectionable _ such as those by
Harry Wu, a longtime China critic and former political prisoner,
and Falun Gong, the banned sect _ made it through. The official
also gave a pass to ``The Road to Democracy'' by Lee Teng-hui, the
outgoing president of Taiwan so reviled by China, while objecting
to two innocuous Taiwanese governmental publications about politics
and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most unfathomable, though, was their choice of four titles that
can be ordered off Amazon.com and shipped to China attracting
little notice from authorities. In fact, ``In the Red: On
Contemporary Chinese Culture'' by Australian scholar Geremie Barme
tops Amazon.com's list of books that are unusually popular in
China. A second book, ``The Search for Modern China'' by Yale
University's Jonathan Spence, one of the most widely-read China
scholars in the world, is No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Only one selection made sense in the Chinese Communist Party
context: an autographed anthology of essays by Wei Jingsheng,
China's most well-known dissident, forced into exile in 1997. Even
his book, though, is available on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was ever given for the confiscations. I was told
only that the books were not allowed under China's regulations. No
further elucidation was provided for that term, and intervention by
the Foreign Ministry was fruitless. I looked for a logic behind the
book choice, but the word ``logic'' doesn't even exist in the
Chinese language. Instead, a transliteration from the English,
``luo ji,'' is used.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer lays in Spence's book, but alas, I shall have
to wait for my Amazon delivery before I can find out.

MIRABELLA FOLDS; GEORGE REBOUNDS, BUT MISSES MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trumpeted from magazines and the other clarions of popular
culture, comes the inescapable message: If you're not young and
beautiful, you're practically dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who are neither young nor beautiful may rail against
it, but too often, it is a notion not only objectionable but true.
For current evidence, take a look, while you can, at Mirabella
magazine, which is in fact dead: Its publisher put it to rest last
week.
</P>
<P>
   I'm as guilty as anyone for its demise. Except in the early
'90s, when an acquaintance was writing a column for it, I never
even glanced through its pages. But judging from its May issue,
still to be found ossifying at newsstands, hip it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Gracing the cover is actress Kristin Scott Thomas, who had one
huge movie, three movies ago. A tease to the inside proclaims an
``exclusive interview'' with Carly Simon, implying that they had to
use all their guile to pull off such a coup. Another siren sings of
Mirabella's check-ins with Betty Friedan and Helen Gurley Brown,
two trailblazers probably past their most important moment.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly for content, the best reason to buy this final issue is
Lynn Darling's affecting memoir recounting how she carried on with
life, and eventually renewed her love life, after her husband died.
But you might also want to pick up a copy in case you ever want to
start a magazine of your own; file it in the what-not-to-do folder.
</P>
<P>
   Friedan also pops up this month in George, which could be the
result of one of those corporate synergy deals, since both
magazines are (were) the spawn of the publisher Hachette
Filipacchi. George presents an excerpt from Friedan's memoir, whose
big headline is that while she was starting the National
Organization for Women, she was being beaten by her husband. But
there's much more depth and detail, as befits a trailblazer
probably past her most important moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Friedan connection isn't the only one between these
siblings. While Mirabella has breathed its last, George is just
getting its second wind, a circumstance that may be more than
coincidence: The New York Times reported last week that Mirabella
staffers were grousing that George got all the promotions budget,
hastening the mag's demise.
</P>
<P>
   The May George is the first issue entirely attributable to Frank
Lalli, who took the editor's chair after founder John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s death at sea last summer. It suggests that Lalli is keeping
George roughly on its course, which is to blend politics and
celebrity in hit-or-miss fashion. Regrettably, the misses win this
month.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the spread of Heather Locklear, telling
Rudy Giuliani how to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York
Senate race. As a conceit, it's brilliant: See, she plays a
political consultant to a fictitious New York mayor on the sitcom
``Spin City,'' and Rudy is the real New York mayor. Get it? There's
no way of knowing whether the stratagems are really Locklear's, but
it does offer the chance _ practically the obligation _ to publish
a full-page photo of the lovely Locklear.
</P>
<P>
   The issue's lead story is slightly more valuable, though
ultimately a bore. Writer Ann Louise Bardach has traveled to Cuba
to uncover ``the untold Elian story.'' It's a good idea, to try to
turn the 15 figures who originally set out on the ill-fated vessel
back into human beings, but we still end up with caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewees only extol the departed, undoubtedly motivated both
by the desire not to speak ill of the dead and by the basic, inbred
aversion to candor in a communist society.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback is that these people gained notoriety only in
death; after offering the survivors' sad accounting of the trip,
Bardach has little left to tell.
</P>
<P>
   George does offer some salient tidbits, such as how much each
presidential candidate spent per delegate won (the bargain: Al
Gore, at $13,356 per), and trying to divine how George W. Bush
spent his $63.3 million, which George (the magazine) says is $30
million more than any presidential candidate has ever spent on an
entire campaign (big tickets: $19 million for ads, $11 million for
fund-raising).
</P>
<P>
   Lalli's column, meanwhile, qualifies as the mag's biggest miss,
offering a weak suggestion on how John McCain might win the
presidency, in 2004. His premise is that McCain energized voters
with his straightforwardness, but that not enough of them wanted
change. If Al Gore wins and then the economy goes in the tank
(``two possible ifs'' _ well said, Frank), McCain could emerge. If
you consider that pallid, read on for Lalli's closing: ``We don't
have the answers. Nobody does. . . . But this magazine will
continue to cheer any candidate who gives honesty a chance, and who
stands tall to win rather than stoops to conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't try telling Grover C. Nordquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform, that drivel about no one having the answers: He
sure thinks he does. In a far more pointed analysis of the ``McCain
mutiny'' in the May American Spectator, he tells why McCain
prospered and how the conservative movement beat back the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Nordquist asserts that the episode ``exploded the myths that the
Reagan coalition was both weak and unstable,'' and cheers how all
its elements rallied to unmask ``the Trojan Horse McCain campaign
and defeated the largest accumulation of corporate wealth amassed
behind one candidate in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, isn't George W. the one with the Texas-size wallet? No,
Nordquist is referring, in the well-worn right-wing way, to ``the
uncritical and unflagging support of establishment media
corporations.'' He calculates that if McCain had had to purchase as
advertising all that fawning coverage, it ``would have cost at
least three times the $70 million Bush raised from Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to figure how Nordquist figures it, but given Lalli's
paean in George, Nordquist would undoubtedly say McCain's free ink
for 2004 is already gushing.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Returning to China five years after moving away, I was
stunned by the new sights in Beijing: fashionably-dressed young men
and women sipping mochas at Starbucks, and mulling over living room
furniture and bathroom fixtures at Ikea.
</P>
<P>
   New sidewalk billboards had sprung up everywhere, with just
about every one taken up by advertisements for Chinese dot-com
companies. Massive new office buildings, indoor malls and luxury
apartment buildings dominate much of the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing had become a far more international and modern city in
just a few years. Whereas culinary variety used to mean choosing
from Cantonese, Sichuanese or Hunanese, now options for eating out
include Italian, Brazilian, Lebanese and more. When a friend
recently said, ``I don't want Chinese for dinner, I had it for
lunch,'' it didn't sound ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Even government agencies have entered the digital era. The
Public Security Bureau, which issues visas and keeps an eye on
foreign journalists, has fancy new computers, as does every clerk
at the post office. But when a postal worker reached for her abacus
to add up my postage, it hit me _ some very fundamental things
haven't changed at all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a lot of things: it still takes one month to get a
phone line installed; the English-language China Daily is as boring
as ever; purchasing anything at a department store still involves a
convoluted routine with glue, red rubber stamps and several layers
of carbon paper; and connections are still the key to getting
things done. Just about every aspect of life here _ from getting
into a good school and finding a good job to getting bureaucratic
problems resolved _ will go smoother if you've got good guanxi, or
connections.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in Beijing for three and half years in the early 1990s
and had made only two brief visits back since 1995. After getting
over the shock of the new Beijing my first few days, the hassles of
the old Beijing quickly came to haunt me.
</P>
<P>
   While China may have invented gunpowder and noodles, bureaucracy
may be one of its lesser-appreciated contributions to the world. To
live and work in China and get my shipment through customs required
the following documents:
</P>
<P>
   1. Housing contract in a foreign journalist-approved housing
unit;
</P>
<P>
   2 . Certificate of health, including HIV and syphilis screening,
from a local hospital;
</P>
<P>
   3. Journalist's work card, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   4. Journalist visa, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   5. Residence permit, from the Public Security Bureau;
</P>
<P>
   6. News organization permit, from the Foreign Ministry;
</P>
<P>
   7. And customs certificate, from Customs;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these couldn't be obtained in just any order. No,
there was a strict sequence. To get my shipment, I needed numbers
4, 5 and 7. To get numbers 4 and 5, I needed numbers 1, 2 and 3 and
a one-week wait. To get number 7, I needed numbers 3, 5 and 6. To
get number 6, I had to pay more than $100 for a two-line notice in
the Beijing Daily announcing Cox Newspapers' presence. Many of
these documents required photos _ some had to be 1-inch, some
2-inch.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this could've been done without the Cox Newspapers
chop, which thankfully, my predecessors left for me. Like most
chops, ours is nothing more than a simple rubber stamp with our
name, but every organization in China _ governmental or private _
has one, and nothing is official without it.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than the bureaucracy, though, is the almost feudal mindset
of some officials. While the Foreign Ministry is making efforts to
be more accessible to foreign journalists, other government
agencies seem stuck in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   A phone call to a Beijing municipal department with a simple
question is met with: ``It's not my duty to provide that
information.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Internet is flooding the country with as much
information as its citizens care to access, Customs thinks it can
seal China's borders and keep out dangerous foreign influences.
</P>
<P>
   Because I am a journalist, it insisted on inspecting my shipment
of personal belongings. When I was notified of the upcoming
inspection, a Chinese friend assured me they were looking only for
drugs, pornography and the like, and they wouldn't be so backwards
as to confiscate books and video-tapes as they did in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   But indeed, the Customs official found seven books he decided
could not be allowed in the country. His book choice was _ I hate
to say it _ inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Books I would have thought objectionable _ such as those by
Harry Wu, a longtime China critic and former political prisoner,
and Falun Gong, the banned sect _ made it through. The official
also gave a pass to ``The Road to Democracy'' by Lee Teng-hui, the
outgoing president of Taiwan so reviled by China, while objecting
to two innocuous Taiwanese governmental publications about politics
and economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most unfathomable, though, was their choice of four titles that
can be ordered off Amazon.com and shipped to China attracting
little notice from authorities. In fact, ``In the Red: On
Contemporary Chinese Culture'' by Australian scholar Geremie Barme
tops Amazon.com's list of books that are unusually popular in
China. A second book, ``The Search for Modern China'' by Yale
University's Jonathan Spence, one of the most widely-read China
scholars in the world, is No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Only one selection made sense in the Chinese Communist Party
context: an autographed anthology of essays by Wei Jingsheng,
China's most well-known dissident, forced into exile in 1997. Even
his book, though, is available on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation was ever given for the confiscations. I was told
only that the books were not allowed under China's regulations. No
further elucidation was provided for that term, and intervention by
the Foreign Ministry was fruitless. I looked for a logic behind the
book choice, but the word ``logic'' doesn't even exist in the
Chinese language. Instead, a transliteration from the English,
``luo ji,'' is used.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer lays in Spence's book, but alas, I shall have
to wait for my Amazon delivery before I can find out.

 NEIL GOODWIN SEEKS A FATHER LOST TO THE SIERRA MADRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ When Neil Goodwin was in his early 20s,
helping his mother prepare a book on Apache culture that his father
had been working on before he died, he came across an old scrapbook
containing his father's field notes. ``I remember her saying,
`Here's the dairy of the Mexico trip,' '' the trip Grenville
Goodwin had taken into the Sierra Madre in the 1930s. ``As I read
it, I realized that when he wrote it, he was about the same age as
I was,'' Goodwin said. ``And my first thought was that I wished I
could do this thing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Goodwin was barely four months old when his father died in
1940, cutting short a pioneering career studying Apache life and
culture in southwestern mountain strongholds. Now, having
established himself as a documentary filmmaker, the 60-year-old
Goodwin has brought his father's studies to completion with the
publication of ``Apache Diaries.'' In the book, Grenville Goodwin's
field notes are interspersed with entries from a journal Neil
Goodwin kept as he retraced his father's trail into the Mexican
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the field notes for publication, Goodwin embarked
on a quest to understand the father he never knew. Even now, he
admits to being ``intrigued and puzzled.'' While the parallel
journeys recorded in ``Apache Diaries'' have ``taken me to an
understanding of what his life was,'' said Goodwin, ``I know I will
never know what he was entirely like.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Grenville Goodwin was an enigmatic figure, as
mysterious as the people to whose study he devoted his life.
``Grennie,'' as his son calls him, was the child of a prominent
Hartford family who as a teenager was stricken with tuberculosis
and sent to school in the Southwest ``to rough it and recover,''
his son writes. Except for a few brief visits, he would never go
back East.
</P>
<P>
   From an Indian policeman he meets in 1927, the elder Goodwin
first hears about elusive bands of Apaches living ``in a primitive
condition'' across the border in isolated camps in the Sierra
Madre, a detail that becomes the first entry in his field notes.
Two years later, he hears that these Sierra Madre Apaches have
ambushed a Mexican family, killing the wife and abducting a young
boy.
</P>
<P>
   As Goodwin reconstructs his father's reaction to this event, he
writes that if the raiders ``represent a pre-reservation form of
culture, they would be living history, a `lost people,' a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an ethnographer of the 1930s. A
heady thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``Grennie'' Goodwin spent the remaining 10 years of
his life in and around the Apache reservations _ and getting as
close as possible to the ``pre-reservation'' Apaches in the
mountains, recording everything in neat, precise handwriting in his
notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with all this,'' said Goodwin. ``There were
artifacts he had collected, and a kind of oral history from my
mother.'' His parents had met at a family wedding, and over the
next seven years, Goodwin said, ``I think they probably talked a
lot about the things he was doing, and he must have been a very
romantic figure to her.'' To their families' displeasure, they
eloped, drove across the country, and were married in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His father's field notes appear as pages from a college blue
book pasted into a scrapbook, the penmanship neat and regular,
perhaps a second draft of notes jotted down during the day and
rewritten by the campfire at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fairly dry,'' Goodwin said of the writing, ``but it was
clear this was something he was very excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got talking with an Apache Police here,'' begins an entry in
August 1930 at the Fort Apache Reservation in Arizona. ``He said
that sometimes in summer some of Geronimo's people come up from Old
Mexico and run horses off the reservation. These had been seen in
the summer of 1929 by an Apache, a friend of his, but were wild and
would not stop to talk. He only saw them from a distance, but they
appeared to be dressed in modern clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to imagine,'' Neil Goodwin writes in his own journal,
``what it must have been like to hear from an Apache that
`Geronimo's people' have been up from Old Mexico as recently as one
year ago. It must have had an electrifying effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the initial entry, Grenville Goodwin was in
Douglas, Arizona, and met with the local police chief. ``It would
be almost impossible to come in contact with these Apaches, he
says, they being so wild. But there would be a chance to see their
camps, etc. The country should be studied as there are many ruins
in the locality. However it would not be safe for one to go
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Very shortly, he found a guide to accompany him and headed into
Mexico. While he never encountered the elusive ``Geronimo's
people,'' he often came upon one of their encampments and would
find signs that they had been there very recently, perhaps a day or
two before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often,'' said Goodwin, ``there were indications that they were
not far away, maybe even observing him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for its dryness, the notes of that trip ``open the door to
the rest of his life, his life at the reservation,'' said Goodwin.
``He had a passion for witnessing. His whole technique was to sit
day after day, at first not taking notes, just listening.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Goodwin said, ``didn't want to be seen as a prying
anthropologist so he got a job at a trading post. To the Indians,
he was just the young guy behind the counter, but after a while, he
started asking questions and writing down people's life stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was not for another dozen years after he first saw his
father's journal that Goodwin got back to it _ after graduation
from Yale and Yale's School of Architecture, several years working
as an architect, and then making his first nature film, ``Following
the Tundra Wolf.'' Goodwin is now president of the Cambridge-based
Peace River Films, which has produced documentaries on cultural,
historical, and environmental subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin made the first of several trips to his father's
territory in 1976. ``I took the diary,'' he said, ``and followed it
like a treasure map.''
</P>
<P>
   While searching out locations his father had visited and even
meeting some of the people he had interviewed, Goodwin was
sometimes accompanied by his wife, Margot, and by his own son,
Seth. The more Goodwin learned, the more one great mystery loomed _
the underlying facts surrounding his father's death at age 37 (the
official cause was a brain tumor).
</P>
<P>
   For over a year Grenville Goodwin had been suffering severe
headaches, at one point telling his wife that it is ``as if the top
of my head is coming off.'' A tumor was not diagnosed until shortly
after Neil Goodwin's birth. Surgery at first seemed successful, but
his condition worsened and he died in July 1940.
</P>
<P>
   As he talked to Apaches who had known his father, Goodwin began
to pick up hints that Grenville Goodwin's death might have come
about because he knew too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' he said, ``I was offended by that. But I knew that
he had been very interested in their religious beliefs, especially
that there is a supernatural power that is with you all the time
and that your own well-being is dependent on this power and your
relation to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Apaches believe there is another side to that power, Goodwin
said. ``If you learn it, but are not powerful enough to use it, it
will turn on you and harm you.''
</P>
<P>
   He then began reading his father's notes from the period after
that coincides with ``The Apache Diaries'' and ``found references
to conversations he had with Apaches who would say things like,
`This is too dangerous, we can't talk about it now.' '' Often, he
would be told that he would have to wait until winter to talk about
it, because then all the supernatural beings would be asleep,
``hibernating like the animals so they couldn't hear you talking
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin is now working on these later notes for a series of
articles on his father for the Journal of the Southwest. These days
he tries to imagine his father as a living person. ``I often wonder
if he would have wanted me to bother to try and understand him,''
he writes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Goodwin muses, his father might say: ``Don't look
for me. I'm not there, not real. Only the Apaches are real.''

ALMOST LAST, BUT WITH A FINISHING KICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually every aspect of my life is governed by the magazine
Runner's World. I eat whatever they tell me to eat;
flatulence-inducing Balance bars? Yum! I buy the wildly overpriced
Pearl Izumi micro-mesh gear that is so essential for my
6-mile-per-hour slogs through suburban streets. I am thinking of
moving into a king-sized ``hypoxic tent'' advertised in RW, to
boost ``my red blood cell production and VO/2 max,'' whatever that
means. How I have come this far without it, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   So when Runner's World published its first ``Beginning Racing
Guide'' for tyro sloggers, I thought _ why not? ``The camaraderie
during a race _ especially a first race _ can be poignant,'' RW
claims. ``It's been known to reduce dyed-in-the-wool-stoics to
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend pointed out that, as a columnist, I could avail myself
of the Breslin Option. Jimmy Breslin wrote a hilarious column in
the fall of 1979, averring that he had spent the previous year ``in
the privacy of Queens,'' training for the New York Marathon.
Beautifully written (``The sparkling early morning fall air forced
its way into my lungs, the effect far more intoxicating than
brandy''), delightfully entertaining _ the column was complete
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Bad career move, Alex. He's Jimmy Breslin, you're not. You'll
have to run the race.
</P>
<P>
   The task, in a nutshell, was to raise my endurance to the 3-mile
level, so that I could finish a 5-kilometer race. Runner's World
had a 10-week scheme for doing this, which I followed, more or
less. I definitely spent the three days preceding the race
``tapering,'' which is RW-speak for sitting on my can.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday morning, I wolfed down the recommended high-carb,
low-fat breakfast, started ``hydrating,'' _ RW-speak for drinking
water _ and pointed my car toward bucolic Groton, for that town's
Ninth Annual Road Race. Perusing the course description, I couldn't
help noticing the half-mile long hill following mile two. That's
funny, I had specifically asked about _ oh, never mind. It was a
gorgeous day; I had my micro-mesh singlet, my race number, and
access to free Balance bars _ we're off!
</P>
<P>
   Duffers like me were advised to start at the very rear of the
750-person pack. Nonetheless, people kept passing me. The fact is,
I run quite slowly. (Have I told you that I have asthma?) First all
the parents pushing their kids in those creepy ``all-terrain
jogging strollers'' rushed past me. Then all the grade schoolers
passed me. The guy with the dog passed me. Where are the people on
crutches, or the Prosthetic Division? I kept wondering. Shouldn't
they be passing me, too?
</P>
<P>
   During mile one, I made a vow: No one would walk the course
faster than I would run it. So I spent the first half of the race
slogging past the power walkers who had somehow gotten out ahead of
me. (Have I told you that I have an unusually high body-mass index
of 26.2?) I hit the 2-mile mark at 23 minutes and then turned up
the Big Hill. This hill was quite gentle, but it did turn quite a
number of runners into walkers. I'm good on hills; it's a
personality thing. I did manage to crawl past a dozen or so racers.
</P>
<P>
   As the course wound back toward the finish line, I asked a
spectator if there was less than half a mile left to run. He said
yes, so I stupidly decided to accelerate, or ``kick,'' the last few
hundred yards. What can I say? Jim Ryun was a boyhood hero. This is
about the last thing Runner's World would recommend for a
first-time runner, and explains my difficulty in walking this week.
</P>
<P>
   My time was execrable (Have I told you about the hip
replacement? _ just kidding) and I finished 701st. Do you think I
pulled a Breslin? As they say in New York, you can look it up. Now
I look forward to returning to my life of casual dissipation _
full-time ``tapering,'' as it were _ and then doing the whole thing
all over again.

NETMINDER DIPIETRO IS CLOSING THE BOOKS AT BU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ricky DiPietro may be sitting on more than a million
bucks, but Tuesday the star Boston University netminder sounded
like something less than a phenom headed for a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm relieved, really,'' said DiPietro, reached
at his dorm by telephone. ``It's all kind of sad, to tell you the
truth _ sad that I have to leave such a good program and such a
great bunch of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 years old, DiPietro on Monday signed the form that
essentially declared him a professional _ a classification that
will become official June 24 when the NHL holds its annual entry
draft in Calgary. A star freshman this past season for the
Terriers, DiPietro decided to accelerate his career and opt not to
wait for the June 2001 draft. By declaring early, at age 18 rather
than 19, he is forced to surrender his remaining three years of
college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what a lot of people say,'' said DiPietro, who grew up
in Winthrop, hometown of another BU hockey star, 1980 Olympian Mike
Eruzione. ``They say, `It's the money, the money, the money _ take
it and run.' But that's not the issue, and it hasn't been the issue
here from the get-go. It's about my dream to play in the NHL, and
after talking to a lot of people, it just seems to me that this
year's entry draft will be the quickest and most efficient way to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are for the dreaming, of course, and DiPietro could be
the next Boston-area teenager to step directly into an NHL net. But
such quantum leaps are rare for less-than-twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Barrasso, still on the job as recently as 10 days ago with
the Ottawa Senators, was only 18 years old when he became a regular
starter for the Buffalo Sabres in the fall of '83. Barrasso, the
No. 5 pick in the '83 entry draft, went directly from Acton-Boxboro
High School to NHL stardom, named the league's Rookie of the Year
in '84.
</P>
<P>
   The forgotten Jim Carey, ex- of Catholic Memorial, turned pro
after two years at the University of Wisconsin and was playing
regularly for the Washington Capitals at age 19 after an AHL primer
in Portland, Maine. The following spring, in '96, he won the Vezina
Trophy. Less than a year later, he was dealt to Boston, his NHL
career all but finished.
</P>
<P>
   North Easton's Jim Craig, also a BU alum and member of the US
gold-medal squad in Lake Placid, played two seasons on Comm. Ave.
prior the Olympics and turned pro at 22. His career totaled 30
games.
</P>
<P>
   If DiPietro makes it to The Show, he likely won't get there
until he has played in the minor leagues for at least a year or
two. That's the conventional wisdom, the standard nurturing process
for even the best NHL netminders. For instance, Patrick Roy made it
to the Canadiens at age 20, but only after three years of major
Junior A netminding. Martin Brodeur became the Devils' regular at
age 21, but only after three years of Junior A and a full season in
the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Can DiPietro find a shortcut? Of course he can. But he will
still be an 18-year-old when he reports to his first NHL training
camp, and the overwhelming odds, the conventional wisdom, even the
Cliff Notes of Cage Success suggest that his route will be, at
best, circuitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it take me two years? Hopefully not,'' said DiPietro, who
went an impressive 18-5-5 with the Terriers in '99-00, with a
sparkling .913 save percentage and a 2.45 goals-against mark. ``I
think that will depend on how I approach the situation. If I
produce, then hey, it's a business, and I'll get my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, his declaration signed, the game DiPietro has been
playing all his life stopped being a game and became his chosen
career path. Soon after the draft, he will sign a rookie contract,
a mandatory three-year deal, with base pay of $1,075,000 per
season, more than half of which will be guaranteed. His agent, Jay
Fee of Woolf &AMP; Associates, likely will seek a deal similar to that
of Roberto Luongo, the Islander phenom-in-waiting, who was the
fourth pick overall in the '97 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo has yet to, shall we say, grow into the job, but his deal
made him eligible to earn an extra $2.4 million in bonuses _above
and beyond his $925,000 in base pay _ the first year of his
contract. Widely considered to be the hottest goalie prospect since
Luongo, DiPietro could get a three-year deal that, with incentives,
weighs in at around $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   In DiPietro's wake, BU must find another goaltender to work the
'00-01 season with junior returnee Jason Tapp. Head coach Jack
Parker no doubt was working the phones Tuesday, along with his top
recruiter, Mike Bavis, sifting through names of prospects. As of
Monday, they were plus a full scholarship but minus a franchise
goalie. And May is beyond late on the recruiting calendar _ it's OT
and then some.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, with about another 10 days remaining in his college
life, didn't scratch out his name Monday afternoon, just hours
before the NHL deadline to opt in as an ``underage,'' and take off
down Comm. Ave. in Mardi Gras spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there was no celebration, not at all,'' he said, still
sounding subdued some 24 hours later. ``Why? Because it was just
such a tough decision. I was torn. I know it's supposed to be
exciting, and a new beginning and everything. But more than
anything, I feel sad I have to leave.''

&HT;     NEWSPAPER REMOVES PUBLISHER AMID FALLOUT OF TRIAL TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE and PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp., owner of the San Francisco
Examiner, placed the newspaper's publisher on an indefinite leave
of absence after he testified that he had offered Mayor Willie
Brown favorable editorials in exchange for the mayor's support of
Hearst's plan to buy the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the New York-based Hearst also called for an
immediate internal review into whether the newspaper's editorial
pages had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy O. White, who previously was publisher of Hearst's Times
Union in Albany, N.Y., testified Monday that the proposed purchase
of the Chronicle raised questions about the newspaper's credibility
with its readers and caused a furor in the newsrooms of the
afternoon Examiner and the morning Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people read a newspaper's editorial opinion pages, they
are entitled to believe that the newspaper, whatever the opinion
is, has based the opinion on facts and philosophy and a considered
look at the situation and not based on something that will help the
news organization financially,'' said James Risser, a two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner with the Des Moines (Iowa) Register who now
directs Stanford University's Knight journalism fellowships. ``To
the extent that they can't believe that, then the credibility of
the newspaper suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Examiner officials vehemently denied that White had
pressured staffers to change editorials or news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown strongly defended the publisher, expressing shock at
Hearst's decision to put White on leave. The mayor said he did not
recall White's ever offering favorable treatment in the Examiner's
editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the Examiner has been an incredibly nasty newspaper
to me,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   George B. Irish, president of the Hearst Newspapers, will take
over publishing responsibilities while the matter is investigated.
Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein will remain in charge of
newsroom operations.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the Examiner, who packed into a conference room
to hear Bronstein announce the news Tuesday afternoon, said they
felt some relief that the company was taking swift action to
address remarks seen as undermining the newspaper's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein insisted that the integrity of the news staff was not
in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is absolute knowledge that our news pages have
never been compromised,'' he said. ``I think our coverage of Willie
Brown is only one example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newspaper's staff of 200 reporters, editors and
photographers said they were sympathetic to White, who has been
well-liked since he took over as publisher in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim White, on more than one occasion, expressed complete
support and encouragement for some of the toughest stories that the
Examiner's investigative team had done on the Brown administration
during the election,'' said reporter Chuck Finnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. White said may have left the Hearst Corporation
little choice in the short term but to take the action it took,''
he said. ``But in the long term, at the end of the review, I expect
they will determine that nothing improper was done or even
contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   White declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His controversial statements came Monday on the first day of the
trial in an antitrust suit brought by San Francisco developer Clint
Reilly. Reilly is asking U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker to
bar Hearst from buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends that Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle for $660
million and sell the Examiner to the publishers of the free
Independent newspaper will effectively end newspaper competition in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   White testified Monday that he had made the offer of editorial
support at a lunch with Brown on Sept. 1, 1999, at the height of
the mayor's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, quizzed White about an e-mail
he sent Irish reporting on the lunch. In the e-mail, White wrote he
had suggested to the mayor it would be difficult to ``support him
and cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to
make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked White whether he was ``doing a little
horse-trading'' _ Examiner editorial page support in return for the
mayor's backing on Hearst's bid for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, in a statement released by Hearst officials, White
backed away from his testimony. ``I was tired and confused by the
question,'' White said in the statement. ``The implication of my
answer that the pages of the Examiner can be influenced, under any
circumstances, is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended in court Tuesday that Hearst executives had
known the substance of White's testimony for months, because White
gave similar sworn statements to the Department of Justice, which
was reviewing the proposed purchase. A Hearst company spokesman
declined to comment on the allegation.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media specialists said that even if there was no quid-pro-quo in
the Examiner's editorial pages, the newspaper's credibility had
still been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers who care about this kind of thing would still tend to
be alarmed that the publisher might say this, offer this to a
politician or have it in his mind to do this,'' Risser said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Rosenstiel, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism at the Columbia School of Journalism, said Hearst's
quick action to put White on leave and review the matter might help
the newspaper deal with doubts about its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you deal with the crisis is more important than how the
crisis happened,'' Rosenstiel said. ``Nobody expects perfection out
of any business, and nobody expects perfection out of the news
business.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
presented the San Antonio World Affairs Council's International
Citizen of the Year award to Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and
chief executive of the Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who served under President Richard Nixon, drew strong
applause Tuesday from the crowd of almost 1,000 gathered at the
Convention Center when he said he was concerned that U.S. foreign
policy has become too focused on humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the current presidential campaign, like the two
previous elections, would not include significant foreign policy
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, who has served on a number of national boards and
committees with Bennack, called the Hearst executive ``wholly
dedicated and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought every institution he is associated with to achieve
the mission they were committed to achieve,'' Kissinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack, a native of San Antonio, has risen from being a
classified advertising salesman at the old San Antonio Light to
head Hearst, a privately-held company with interests in newspaper
and magazine publishing, broadcasting and the Internet. Bennack
described his return to the city as a special homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked with many people in this room over the past 50
years,'' Bennack said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker, publisher of the San Antonio Express-News, which
the Hearst Corp. owns, said Bennack's values and compassion are
keys to his success in the publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank's operating background gives him an insight into this
industry that most chairmen don't have,'' Walker said. ``He
intuitively understands almost every aspect of the problems we
face.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio World Affairs Council was founded to initiate
foreign policy education and debate in the city and throughout the
United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp., owner of the San Francisco
Examiner, placed the newspaper's publisher on an indefinite leave
of absence after he testified that he had offered Mayor Willie
Brown favorable editorials in exchange for the mayor's support of
Hearst's plan to buy the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the New York-based Hearst also called for an
immediate internal review into whether the newspaper's editorial
pages had been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony given by Timothy O. White, who previously was
publisher of Hearst's Times Union in Albany, N.Y., raised questions
about the newspaper's credibility with its readers and caused a
furor in the newsrooms of the afternoon Examiner and the morning
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people read a newspaper's editorial opinion pages, they
are entitled to believe that the newspaper, whatever the opinion
is, has based the opinion on facts and philosophy and a considered
look at the situation and not based on something that will help the
news organization financially,'' said James Risser, a two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner with the Des Moines (Iowa) Register who now
directs Stanford University's Knight journalism fellowships. ``To
the extent that they can't believe that, then the credibility of
the newspaper suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Examiner officials vehemently denied that White had
pressured staffers to change editorials or news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And Brown strongly defended the publisher, expressing shock at
Hearst's decision to put White on leave. The mayor said he did not
recall White's ever offering favorable treatment in the Examiner's
editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the Examiner has been an incredibly nasty newspaper
to me,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   George B. Irish, president of the Hearst Newspapers, will take
over publishing responsibilities while the matter is investigated.
Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein will remain in charge of
newsroom operations.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of the Examiner, who packed into a conference room
to hear Bronstein announce the news Tuesday afternoon, said they
felt some relief that the company was taking swift action to
address remarks seen as undermining the newspaper's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein insisted that the integrity of the news staff was not
in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is absolute knowledge that our news pages have
never been compromised,'' he said. ``I think our coverage of Willie
Brown is only one example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newspaper's staff of 200 reporters, editors and
photographers said they were sympathetic to White, who has been
well-liked since he took over as publisher in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim White, on more than one occasion, expressed complete
support and encouragement for some of the toughest stories that the
Examiner's investigative team had done on the Brown administration
during the election,'' said reporter Chuck Finnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mr. White said may have left the Hearst Corporation
little choice in the short term but to take the action it took,''
he said. ``But in the long term, at the end of the review, I expect
they will determine that nothing improper was done or even
contemplated.''
</P>
<P>
   White declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   His controversial statements came Monday on the first day of the
trial in an antitrust suit brought by San Francisco developer Clint
Reilly. Reilly is asking U.S. District Judge Vaughn R. Walker to
bar Hearst from buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly contends that Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle for $660
million and sell the Examiner to the publishers of the free
Independent newspaper will effectively end newspaper competition in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   White testified Monday that he had made the offer of editorial
support at a lunch with Brown on Sept. 1, 1999, at the height of
the mayor's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawyer, Joseph M. Alioto, quizzed White about an e-mail
he sent Irish reporting on the lunch. In the e-mail, White wrote he
had suggested to the mayor it would be difficult to ``support him
and cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to
make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked White whether he was ``doing a little
horse-trading'' _ Examiner editorial page support in return for the
mayor's backing on Hearst's bid for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, in a statement released by Hearst officials, White
backed away from his testimony. ``I was tired and confused by the
question,'' White said in the statement. ``The implication of my
answer that the pages of the Examiner can be influenced, under any
circumstances, is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended in court Tuesday that Hearst executives had
known the substance of White's testimony for months, because White
gave similar sworn statements to the Department of Justice, which
was reviewing the proposed purchase. A Hearst company spokesman
declined to comment on the allegation.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Media specialists said that even if there was no quid-pro-quo in
the Examiner's editorial pages, the newspaper's credibility had
still been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers who care about this kind of thing would still tend to
be alarmed that the publisher might say this, offer this to a
politician or have it in his mind to do this,'' Risser said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Rosenstiel, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism at the Columbia School of Journalism, said Hearst's
quick action to put White on leave and review the matter might help
the newspaper deal with doubts about its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you deal with the crisis is more important than how the
crisis happened,'' Rosenstiel said. ``Nobody expects perfection out
of any business, and nobody expects perfection out of the news
business.''

   GERMANY-BRITAIN-MARKETS (London) _ Europe's two biggest stock
markets, London and Frankfurt, agreed on Wednesday to merge in the
first step towards creating a pan-European exchange which should
drive down the cost of trading. The London Stock Exchange and
Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse also announced a tie-up with the
technology-laden U.S. Nasdaq market, offering up the prospect of an
eventual global market-place for stocks. The merged entity will be
called iX _ standing for International Exchanges _ and will command
53 percent of the traded volume in European equities and 81 percent
of the European market for high-growth shares. (Summary from wires)

   GERMANY-EXCHANGE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Germany's stock exchange
has quietly amassed clout through acquisitions, new technology and
a readiness to start up new ventures. Much of the credit goes to
its chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, a devoted gourmet and jazz
pianist who was an outsider when he arrived at the exchange in
Frankfurt 1994. For starters, he is Swiss rather than German. Now
50 years old, he had been a partner in Germany at McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
the management consulting firm. And while he had little experience
in the nuts and bolts of securities trading, he had a strong sense
that technology would transform the markets and erode national
boundaries _ particularly in Europe. By Edmund L. Andrews.

specifying a black superintendent -- attendance rates and

GETTING THAT TESTOSTERONE BOOST  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first tube of testosterone gel is scheduled to appear on the
market this summer and I, for one, can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, I can become a hairy, macho, studly,
hormone-spewing guy simply by smearing some goo on my body the same
way I would sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, there is the small matter of getting a doctor to
prescribe the stuff, called AndroGel, and there's a blood test, and
I think I saw something in the fine print about prostate tumors,
but I think it's clear that the rewards will outweigh the risks,
especially for testosterone-deficient guys like me.
</P>
<P>
   I can foresee many areas in which testosterone gel will improve
my quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Take driving, for instance. My wife says that I drive like an
``old man,'' which I think is a rather unkind way of saying that I
am cautious. Personally, I do not think that driving 45 mph in the
left lane of the Interstate is a sign of feebleness; I prefer to
think of it as setting a positive example for the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind. Once AndroGel hits the streets, the ``old man''
who followed at a respectful distance and always used his turn
signals will be replaced by a snarling, aggressive maniac whose
idea of a fun weekend is running over pedestrians while yelling
into a cell phone. In other words, I will become like other
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer suggests that you apply AndroGel by rubbing it
into hairless skin, so I plan on smearing the stuff on my chest. It
will take some practice unbuttoning my shirt and rubbing the goo
into my chest while performing a 70-mph U-turn across six lanes of
traffic on U.S. 41 at rush hour, but I trust that my
testosterone-in-a-tube will give me the confidence I need to pull
off the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of hobbies. When I was a kid, my
hobbies were chess and astronomy, two of the most
testosterone-deficient activities a young person could pursue.
Later, in my 20s, presumably at the peak of my
testosterone-producing years, I took up golf. I think you can see
why I have been waiting so long for something like AndroGel to come
along.
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone supplements have been available for some time, but
there are drawbacks. Injecting the hormone risks side effects such
as liver problems, blood thickening, acne and breast development.
Plus, I've never cared much for needles.
</P>
<P>
   There is a testosterone patch, but it works best if applied
directly to the scrotum. Plus, it's suggested that you heat the
area first with a hair dryer. This is a bigger sacrifice than I'm
willing to make for visible biceps and sideburns.
</P>
<P>
   The gel, on the other hand, appears to be relatively safe and
easy to use aside from the fact that you're supposed to slather it
on several times a day. There could be some embarrassing moments,
say at staff meetings or in a fancy restaurant, where I forget
where I am and rip off my shirt so that I can apply a fresh coating
of AndroGel.
</P>
<P>
   But a few embarrassing moments seem a small price to pay for a
new, testosterone-laden lifestyle, a lifestyle where chess and
astronomy have no place and where I grind my golf clubs into spears
for shark-fishing expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   And if daily applications of AndroGel help make my dry skin go
away, then so much the better.

   MIAMI-DESIGN (Miami, Fla.) _ After an exasperating search in New
York for a set of dining chairs for a dinner party at his
apartment, Augusto Botero was exhilarated when he found the perfect
chair at Room _ a sleek new store in Miami. ``I ordered six, and
they were delivered in three days,'' marveled Botero, a young
commercial photographer who stumbled onto the Miami Design District
_ a formerly desolate area north of downtown _ while shooting an ad
campaign nearby. During the past two years, more than 50 new
home-furnishing stores, many of them beacons of fresh, new design,
have opened in this 10-block area. By Christopher Mason.

   RUSSIA-DESIGN (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Andrei Dmitriev says he
is on a crusade to bring taste and style to Russian interior
design. In a move away from the usual Russian tendency toward
overkill, he gutted a former printing house at the Russian Academy
of Sciences to create a fashionable restaurant named Restoran. He
removed the glass from some of the 18th-century mirrors,
upholstered the furniture with sackcloth and covered the cavernous
vaulted ceiling and walls with several layers of plaster, but left
them unpainted. If customers ask incredulously when the interior
will be completed, Dmitriev waves them away imperiously. He
purposely designed the monotonous, almost sullen decor of Restoran,
he explained on a recent afternoon, so that it can come alive with
the appearance of people. By John Varoli.

   RUDOLPH-TRIPLEX (New York)_ They hate Starbucks and the Gap,
love flea markets and a good adventure, buy everything vintage
except socks and underwear, own at least 8,000 books, collect 500
chairs and thousands of other modernist artifacts, and now they're
moving to New York from the San Francisco Bay Area with all their
booty in tow to take up residence in a nine-story house that may be
Manhattan's most eccentric and uninhabitable. They're the Boyds _
Michael, 40, Gabrielle, 35, Sam, 9, and Henry, 5 _ and they're as
single-minded and iconoclastic as the dwelling they've just bought.
The $5.5 million Beekman Place triplex was designed and once
occupied by the late architect Paul Rudolph; proceeds from the
building's sale will support the collection of Rudolph's drawings,
models and papers that the architect bequeathed to the Library of

   CAPRON-DESIGN (New York) _ His brilliantly-colored asymmetrical
vases, drunken decanters and hand-glazed tile coffee tables have
become eminently collectible. Galleries in Europe and New York show
his whimsically humanoid sculptures. He receives large-scale public
commissions. But Roger Capron, the 77-year-old French ceramicist,
has been through all this before. One of the most prolific and
valued artisans of post-war European design, he was, not so long
ago, sufficiently unfashionable that a retrospective would have
been an unlikely proposition on either side of the Atlantic. But
here it is: ``Roger Capron. Art &AMP; Design: Postwar to Present,'' at
Gueridon, a store specializing in mid-century modern French and
Italian decor, running until May 31. By Rick Marin.

   GERMANY-BRITAIN-MARKETS (London) _ Europe's two biggest stock
markets, London and Frankfurt, agreed on Wednesday to merge in the
first step towards creating a pan-European exchange which should
drive down the cost of trading. The London Stock Exchange and
Frankfurt's Deutsche Boerse also announced a tie-up with the
technology-laden U.S. Nasdaq market, offering up the prospect of an
eventual global market-place for stocks. The merged entity will be
called iX _ standing for International Exchanges _ and will command
53 percent of the traded volume in European equities and 81 percent
of the European market for high-growth shares. (Summary from wires)

   GERMANY-EXCHANGE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Germany's stock exchange
has quietly amassed clout through acquisitions, new technology and
a readiness to start up new ventures. Much of the credit goes to
its chief executive, Werner G. Seifert, a devoted gourmet and jazz
pianist who was an outsider when he arrived at the exchange in
Frankfurt 1994. For starters, he is Swiss rather than German. Now
50 years old, he had been a partner in Germany at McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
the management consulting firm. And while he had little experience
in the nuts and bolts of securities trading, he had a strong sense
that technology would transform the markets and erode national
boundaries _ particularly in Europe. By Edmund L. Andrews.

&HT;     STUDY NOTES SIGNIFICANT RISE IN PESTICIDE USE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite a nationwide trend toward curbing
hazardous waste and industrial air emissions, the use of
cancer-causing pesticides more than doubled in California in eight
years, according to a study released Wednesday by the nonprofit
Pesticide Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the 1.5 billion pounds of pesticides used in that
time were acutely poisonous or chronically toxic, including
carcinogens and nervous and reproductive system toxicants,
according to ``Hooked on Poison: Pesticide Use in California,
1991-1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an era of progress in protecting air and water from
industrial emissions and cleaning up industrial hazardous waste
sites, such skyrocketing trends in pesticide use contradict our
nation's stated goal of reducing toxic emissions,'' said Susan
Kegley, staff scientist for the San Francisco-based Pesticide
Action Network and lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Soil fumigants metam sodium, the biocide that poisoned the
Sacramento River in 1991 after a train derailed, and Telone, a
replacement for metam sodium and methyl bromide, were the most
popular carcinogens and reproductive toxicants, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of all pesticides used in the United States are
applied in California, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency report on the pesticide industry's sales and usage.
Nationwide, during the past decade, agricultural pesticides
comprised 75 to 80 percent of the total use. The rest were used on
buildings, roadsides and forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics contend that California is going to use a lot of
pesticides because it has a lot of land under cultivation,'' Kegley
said. ``But the cultivated acreage in California represents only 2
to 3 percent of the total in the U.S., and we're using nearly a
quarter of the pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the state grows pesticide-intensive crops
like fruits, nuts and vegetables, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While government officials often say applying pesticides in
accordance with labels is adequate protection, the study said, ``In
practice, restrictions are often far too complex to be enforceable
and don't take into account the chronic effects of pesticides on
human and environmental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the label requirements don't work to prevent drift
of toxic chemicals into homes and schools, contamination of ground
water or poisoning of farm workers, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Veda Federighi, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Pesticide Regulation, blamed the high use of cancer-causing
pesticides on heavy rains. In 1998, the moisture brought diseases
that needed to be cured with fungicide, she said. On the other
hand, 1991 was a dry year, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the major fungicides ``are probable human
carcinogens'' and on the list of regulated chemicals under
Proposition 65, an anti-toxins law, Federighi said. ``As
regulators, we don't want to ban them. We want to get rid of the
pollution from them,'' Federighi said.
</P>
<P>
   Federighi praised the carrot, strawberry, lettuce, walnut,
almond, grape and cotton growers, among others, for financing
research to find alternatives to pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Pesticide Regulation and the University of
California have spent millions in grant money on finding safer
options to pesticides, Federighi said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Heisler, the EPA's liaison to California's pesticide
program, praised the state's pesticide use reporting system that
allowed the environmental group to do the analysis, calling it
``unique in the country'' and a comprehensive data set that can be
used to ``identify and evaluate trends'' in pesticide use.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 already has
weeded out some dangerous chemicals and will phase out more,
Heisler said. The EPA also has contributed grants to the state and
growers for research on alternatives.

</P>
<P>
   The study presented the following findings based on reports from
growers and estimates on sales of pesticides to exterminators for
use in buildings, roads and forests:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pesticide use on crops jumped 60 percent between 1991 and
1998, from 14.4 to 23 pounds per acre. The heaviest doses went on
strawberries, dates, sweet potatoes, pears and lemons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reproductive toxicants rose by 43 percent between 1991 and
1995, from 25.8 million pounds to a high of 37 million pounds. From
1995 to 1998, use dropped by 16 percent to 31 million pounds. Soil
fumigants again account for the growth.
</P>
<P>
   _ The neurotoxins, including organophosphates and carbamates,
started decreasing in 1995, down 26 percent from 17.5 million
pounds to 13 million pounds in 1998. The study credits the EPA's
scrutiny under the federal Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and
state programs to reduce insecticide runoff to surface waters.

 THINKING ON HER FEET: Rebecca Solnit wrote a book about walking
_  while on the move  
 (Eds. Art is being sent to NYT photo clients.)  
 By SAM WHITING  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Walkers always have time to think, but they
don't always think about walking. Not the way Rebecca Solnit does _
from a scholarly viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about all the great thinkers who thought while they
walked, Solnit has come in from her own walks to write
``Wanderlust: A History of Walking,'' (Viking; $24.95.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interesting project because there are no authorities
on walking as such. There are just authorities on bits and pieces
of a picture that hadn't been assembled before,'' Solnit says in an
interview conducted entirely while walking two or three miles South
of Market.
</P>
<P>
   Snaking through the alleys to avoid the clangor of construction
and traffic, she categorizes this as a ``conversational stroll,''
not a walk. Solnit doesn't really consider it walking unless a pace
of 3 miles per hour is maintained, which is too fast to do anything
besides think and dodge cars.
</P>
<P>
   To discuss her book it would make more sense to drive to some
quiet place, such as the Marin Headlands, and take a walk there.
But Solnit is not that kind of walker. If she wants to walk in the
Marin Headlands, she'd prefer to walk there first, all the way over
Lyon Street from her small apartment in the Western Addition, then
past Crissy Field and across the Golden Gate Bridge. Her most
productive walks start at her door _ walking for transportation, as
opposed to walking for aerobic workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk wherever my errands take me,'' says Solnit, who has
found that 3 mph is the speed at which her feet and mind work most
efficiently. An essayist, she had to walk three books out of her
system before she could focus on walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought the official version of what walking is are
these piously uplifting walks in rural places in which very little
happens,'' she says while making a hard right from Bonifacio Street
onto Lapu Lapu.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I started to pursue the subject more deeply I realized that
walking was this wonderful meandering path through everything I was
already interested in _ gender politics, public space and urban
life, demonstrations and parades and marches. The relationship
between walking and thinking and between the mind and the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Solnit uses first-person narrative in ``Wanderlust,'' but in the
interest of full disclosure she did not do all the types of walking
she wrote about. She did not do any streetwalking, and she did not
walk up Mount Everest. But she did walk 16 miles on a pilgrimage in
the high New Mexico desert, and she did walk in the rain around her
ancestral home in Ireland. She also walked through London, Paris
and Las Vegas, and all over San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Walking was the easy part. The hard part was reading everything
there is about walking, from theories of bipedalism to great quotes
from people in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely everybody has a walking anecdote,'' says Solnit,
who found enough of these to amount to 30,000 words, enough for a
second book. Instead, she strung these quotes together like an
electronic message sign along the bottom of each of the 291 pages.
There are some clever observations by famous walkers, but the most
clever may be her own succinct explanation on Page 5:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a
production-oriented society, and doing nothing is hard to do. It's
best done by disguising it as doing something, and the something
closest to doing nothing is walking.''
</P>
<P>
   By that definition Solnit has spent half her 38 years doing
nothing, starting when she was a child in Novato. Her family's
subdivision backed onto open space. There was a fence, ``but
private property isn't of much concern to a little kid,'' she says.
She walked to school, but that stopped after junior high. Not
because she stopped walking but because she stopped going to
school, avoiding high school altogether in the
alternative-education 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I sort of ran away to Paris when I was 17,'' she says.
She thinks that through and decides ``ran away'' is too strong a
term. ``My parents were busy getting divorced, so nobody was really
trying to stop me. I didn't really have to run. I sort of walked
away.''
</P>
<P>
   While walking around Paris she learned that ``you don't have to
go inside the museums to have things worth looking at,'' she says.
Back home, she got her bachelor's degree at San Francisco State and
her master's at the University of California at Berkeley Graduate
School of Journalism before she got her driver's license, at age
23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a hurry when I was young. I didn't slow down until
later,'' says Solnit, who just won a Guggenheim Fellowship for a
book she'll start after finishing ``Hollow City,'' a study of the
effects of gentrification on the neighborhoods of San Francisco
that she's walked for 20 years. The grant, around $35,000, will
allow her to ``join the lower middle class,'' she says, but her
feet will still be on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me being in a car or on an airplane is like being in
limbo. It's this dead zone between two places. But to walk you're
some place that's already interesting. You're not just between
places. Things are happening,'' she says while raising a hand in a
``stop'' gesture to oncoming motorists as she jaywalks across
Second Street.
</P>
<P>
   Though Solnit can be militant, she isn't a power walker. Her
equipment consists of street clothes and a pair of Clark's high-top
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you have feet and a place to go and a little bit of
free time,'' she says, ``you're pretty equipped as far as I'm
concerned.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My basement windows are slightly below ground level on the
outside and the builder installed curved ``window well'' soil
retainers around the outside of each window.
</P>
<P>
   These are partly below ground at the bottom and project up about
five or six inches above the ground around the window. There is
just soil at the bottom of this window well, and this soil is only
an inch or two below the level of the window.
</P>
<P>
   My problem is that in a heavy rain, water accumulates in the
bottom of this ``well'' and some of this seeps in under the window
and runs down on the inside of the basement wall.
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to solve this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dig out the soil inside the window well to a depth of about
10 inches, or until you are almost at the bottom of the well
enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Apply silicone caulking to the joint where the metal (or
plastic) meets the foundation wall, then fill the space you just
dug out with gravel or small stones.
</P>
<P>
   Pour in gravel until its height is about one inch below the
bottom of the window.
</P>
<P>
   Finish by making certain the ground around the outside of this
window well slopes away from the house foundation on all sides to
help it shed water more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am building a wall unit of plywood and want it to fit flat
against an existing wall when finished. However, the wall it will
fit against is slightly irregular and there is a baseboard at the
bottom that I want to leave in place.
</P>
<P>
   How can I trim the edge of the plywood panel that will form the
side of the unit so its contour will exactly match the contour of
the wall and baseboard and thus make the unit fit snugly against
the existing wall?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hold the plywood panel temporarily in place so its edge is up
against the wall where you want it to fit.
</P>
<P>
   Now take an ordinary pencil compass and scribe the back edge of
the plywood to exactly match the face of the wall and its baseboard
molding.
</P>
<P>
   You do this by holding the panel so its edge just touches the
front of the baseboard at the bottom, then measure the space
between the edge of the panel and the wall in several places to
make certain the edge of the panel is standing parallel to the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Set the legs of the compass a little wider apart than this
distance, then hold the metal point of the compass against the wall
as you slide the pencil leg over the face of the plywood.
</P>
<P>
   The pencil will then trace the outline of the wall and baseboard
onto the face of the plywood, which you can then cut accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Rusty nail heads are showing through the paint on the outdoor
siding on my house.
</P>
<P>
   I used a metal primer on these rust marks before repainting last
year, but some rust stains still show through.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a more permanent solution I can take to cover up these
rust stains without having to pull all the old nails out?
</P>
<P>
   A: Start by scraping and sanding all the exposed nail heads to
remove as much of the rust at possible.
</P>
<P>
   Then apply a liquid rust converter to each head and after this
dries, use a nail set to drive the nail head in about a quarter
inch below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Fill each hole with an exterior grade wood putty or wood
patching compound, then finish by touching up with matching paint.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My very old house has a brick foundation and some years ago a
layer of plaster was troweled on over the bricks on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture is apparently seeping up into the bricks from the
ground and this is causing the plaster to crumble and flake off in
places, although the basement is dry.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any idea as to how we can correct this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The problem may be insoluble because the plaster should never
have been applied directly to the bricks originally.
</P>
<P>
   Short of removing all the plaster, you may be able to improve
matters by doing what you can to improve drainage on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The ground should slope away from the foundation on all sides
and the gutter's downspouts should be connected to underground
plastic drainage pipes that will carry the water at least 10 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   It would also help to apply a waterproofing paint or sealer to
the exposed brick on the outside.
</P>

 &HT;    POPULIST CANDIDATE , BLAIR NEMESIS, LOOKS LIKE SHOO-IN FOR
LONDON MAYOR
 &HT;    (EDs: Contains optional trim.)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A loner known with both fondness and derision as ``Red
Ken'' almost certainly will become this ancient and influential
city's first elected mayor when voters head to the polls Thursday
to cast their historic votes.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an upset that would stun analysts and bankrupt England's
bookies, Ken Livingstone will become the leader of the largest
single electorate in Britain and one of most visible politicians in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Livingstone almost certainly will be a thorn in
the side of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who staged a spectacularly
unsuccessful campaign to keep Livingstone from becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   An unreconstructed leftist with a fondness for uttering somewhat
shocking statements, Livingstone is everything the prim and careful
centrist Blair detests.
</P>
<P>
   After Blair succeeded in blocking his nomination by the Labor
Party, Livingstone decided to run as an independent. Consequently,
he was acrimoniously banished from the party.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners responded sympathetically to the 55-year-old
Livingstone, who was seen as a maverick refusing to bow to the
national government.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Blair's handpicked candidate, Frank Dobson,
summoned little more than a yawn. Pre-election polls suggest
Dobson, formerly a dutiful bureaucrat, will finish more than 30
percentage points behind Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote for Frank Dobson will be bad to derisory,'' said
Patrick Dunleavy, the political analyst credited for designing the
American-style election process.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone is expected to win a commanding 51 percent of the
vote, while none from his opponents _ a field that also includes
Conservative Steve Norris and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer _ is
expected to top 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Blair who prepared the way for Livingstone _
a paunchy, middle-aged populist. As part of his push to
decentralize government, the prime minister advocated energetically
for a directly elected mayor for London.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to overstate the importance of this new role on the
British political stage. While London's mayor may seem of similar
standing to a mayor of a big American city, it is really much more.
</P>
<P>
   London is the dominant cultural and economic center for Britain,
while even a city such as New York is dwarfed by the rest of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the prime minister, who holds office because he is head
of the party in power and directly represents only his
parliamentary district, the mayor will have the clear legitimacy of
speaking for more than 5 million voters.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While Livingstone is loved by Londoners, many regret that the
city has been unable to produce a more illustrious candidate. Early
on, the ballot had more sex appeal with author Jeffrey Archer and
former actress Glenda Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But both fell aside. Jackson failed to get enough Labor Party
support. Archer dropped out last fall amid a scandal that suggested
he lied in a libel lawsuit he won against two newspapers that
reported he had a tryst with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Livingstone promises to add color to a city
that often seems overwhelmingly gray. For the last few weeks, he
has been cruising London in a purple open-topped bus wise-cracking
into a megaphone to amused crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone has made headlines by asserting that the
international financial system has killed more people than Adolf
Hitler. He has said that the now controversial World Trade
Organization will be unwelcome in his London unless demonstrators
have time to stock up rubbish to throw at its members.
</P>
<P>
   He also has said that the leaders of the International Monetary
Fund deserve to ``die painfully in their beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts don't know quite what to make of Livingstone.
``Left-wing populists are very rare in Britain,'' said Tony
Travers, a political scientist at the London School of Economics.
``But Livingstone is a loner and a left-wing populist. And he's a
politician who, as an individual can win a very big election. This
is rarer still.''
</P>
<P>
   If Blair and his followers regard Livingstone as an embarrassing
eccentric uncle, the Conservative Party considers him a
communist-coddling loony who will threaten the city's reputation as
the center of European finance.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives say Livingstone believes in higher taxes,
supporting rioters, persecuting motorists and legalizing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of popularity on the right is unsurprising. Livingstone
came to fame during the 1980s by throwing rocks at Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Then head of the Greater London Council, Livingstone used his
office to rail against Thatcher's government. He once hung a banner
from his offices across the Thames from Parliament displaying the
number of London jobs lost to Thatcher's campaign to trim
government and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Thatcher abolished the council, the last central
government in this city of more than 7 million. Since then, the
city has been governed by the national government and a variety of
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts think that Livingstone might be too busy with
potholes, horrific traffic and a burgeoning crime rate to be a
similar annoyance to Blair.
</P>
<P>
   He will oversee a budget of about US$6 billion, and will be
responsible for two major institutions: the Underground subway
system and the London police.
</P>
<P>
   He will have the expectations and responsibilities of an
American-style mayor with none of the structure in place to deal
with it. And he will have very limited powers to raise more money
to address the city's urgent needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is will Ken Livingstone be the kind of mayor
who is able to take that kind of active role,'' Travers said. ``On
that the jury is very much out.''

BUBBLE AND SQUEAK'S NO TOIL AND TROUBLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathy Housewright, Hurst, Texas, writes looking for a recipe for
bubble and squeak. This is a great way to use leftover mashed
potatoes. It was a big dish during the Depression because it was
economical and filling. The dish gets its name from the noises it
makes while cooking.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail sender would like the recipe for coconut pie using
Bisquick. A quick search on the Internet pulled up the version
we're running.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the spirit of Cinco de Mayo, here's the recipe for the
tortilla soup served at Luby's.

side.

   MIAMI-DESIGN (Miami, Fla.) _ After an exasperating search in New
York for a set of dining chairs for a dinner party at his
apartment, Augusto Botero was exhilarated when he found the perfect
chair at Room _ a sleek new store in Miami. ``I ordered six, and
they were delivered in three days,'' marveled Botero, a young
commercial photographer who stumbled onto the Miami Design District
_ a formerly desolate area north of downtown _ while shooting an ad
campaign nearby. During the past two years, more than 50 new
home-furnishing stores, many of them beacons of fresh, new design,
have opened in this 10-block area. By Christopher Mason.

   RUSSIA-DESIGN (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Andrei Dmitriev says he
is on a crusade to bring taste and style to Russian interior
design. In a move away from the usual Russian tendency toward
overkill, he gutted a former printing house at the Russian Academy
of Sciences to create a fashionable restaurant named Restoran. He
removed the glass from some of the 18th-century mirrors,
upholstered the furniture with sackcloth and covered the cavernous
vaulted ceiling and walls with several layers of plaster, but left
them unpainted. If customers ask incredulously when the interior
will be completed, Dmitriev waves them away imperiously. He
purposely designed the monotonous, almost sullen decor of Restoran,
he explained on a recent afternoon, so that it can come alive with
the appearance of people. By John Varoli.

   RUDOLPH-TRIPLEX (New York)_ They hate Starbucks and the Gap,
love flea markets and a good adventure, buy everything vintage
except socks and underwear, own at least 8,000 books, collect 500
chairs and thousands of other modernist artifacts, and now they're
moving to New York from the San Francisco Bay Area with all their
booty in tow to take up residence in a nine-story house that may be
Manhattan's most eccentric and uninhabitable. They're the Boyds _
Michael, 40, Gabrielle, 35, Sam, 9, and Henry, 5 _ and they're as
single-minded and iconoclastic as the dwelling they've just bought.
The $5.5 million Beekman Place triplex was designed and once

models and papers that the architect bequeathed to the Library of
Congress. By Bonnie Schwartz.

   CAPRON-DESIGN (New York) _ His brilliantly-colored asymmetrical
vases, drunken decanters and hand-glazed tile coffee tables have
become eminently collectible. Galleries in Europe and New York show
his whimsically humanoid sculptures. He receives large-scale public
commissions. But Roger Capron, the 77-year-old French ceramicist,
has been through all this before. One of the most prolific and
valued artisans of post-war European design, he was, not so long
ago, sufficiently unfashionable that a retrospective would have
been an unlikely proposition on either side of the Atlantic. But
here it is: ``Roger Capron. Art &AMP; Design: Postwar to Present,'' at
Gueridon, a store specializing in mid-century modern French and
Italian decor, running until May 31. By Rick Marin.

TEMPTING TREATS FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is one thing I really, really don't need added to my daily
menu _ a new line of snack cakes and sweet breads.
</P>
<P>
   I am already locked in a life's battle with cookies and cakes. I
shouldn't eat them, but they pull at me with a gravitational force
that could suck the moon right into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The tug of a new line is just too compelling to control,
especially when the snacks are displayed in the middle of a grocery
store, stacked on a table with plenty of room to park your cart and
ogle.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I found this weekend at the Carnival grocery store
at 28th Street and North Main in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The product line isn't exactly new; it is only new to most of us
who live north of the border with Mexico. Those who have lived in
Mexico know it very well.
</P>
<P>
   They know that Gansitos are little chocolate-covered sponge
cakes with a cream filling and a shot of strawberry puree in the
middle. They know that Submarinos vainilla are just like Hostess
Twinkies with a hint more vanilla and a bit more density in the
cake. We need more Twinkies.
</P>
<P>
   Pinguinos are chocolate cupcakes with a harder, more sugary
icing than our more familiar brands.
</P>
<P>
   The labels on the Marinela-brand goodies show they are
``Products of Mexico,'' but they are distributed by ``BBU General
Offices Fort Worth, Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Bimbo Bakeries USA, owner of the Mrs Baird's brand that
Texans are more acquainted with.
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo, which bought out Mrs Baird's a couple of years ago, has
been slowly bringing up its Hispanic brands and introducing them in
the Texas market. Aside from the Marinela cookies and snack cakes,
there are also the Tia Rosa-brand tortillas and Bimbo-brand bread
and sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Bimbo label _ always accompanied by a smiling Teddy
bear _ you can buy mini poundcakes called Panquecitos, or crispy,
cinnamon funnellike cakes called Bimbunuelos, or the more familiar
sweet rolls called Conchas.
</P>
<P>
   The Bimbo bread has even made it to local shelves. I haven't
tried it, but those who have say it is slightly sweeter than the
Mrs Baird's brand.
</P>
<P>
   Bimbo Bakeries USA is the U.S. subsidiary of Grupo Bimbo,
Mexico's largest food producer and the world's third-largest baking
company. Company officials intend to follow the Hispanic migration
into the United States, taking advantage of their familiarity with
the Bimbo brand, as well as spreading the products into other
cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is to follow Hispanic consumers _ our customers _ to
offer them the products they already know wherever they live,''
said Juan Muldoon, president of Bimbo Bakeries USA. ``Our brands _
Bimbo, Marinela, Tia Rosa _ are household names in Mexico and Latin
America, names that most Hispanics grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Muldoon also said Bimbo's vision is to become one of the United
States' baking leaders as well.
</P>
<P>
   All of the company's Hispanic products aren't in every grocery
store in the Fort Worth market, but there is a little in each. I
found the Tia Rosa tortillas at Albertson's, the Tia Rosa corn
chips at Tom Thumb.
</P>
<P>
   It was only at Carnival _ a Minyard's-owned store designed for
the Hispanic market _ that I found the entire line.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Bimbo has the incentive to grow in
this area. Here is the statistical profile it has come up with as
it follows its Hispanic consumers:
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics represent over 11 percent of the U.S. population _
more than the entire population of Canada.

   Terry Murray feels most alive when he is on the move _ which is
why he spent five years making the two-hour one-way hike to and
from his job as an engineering manager at Bio-Rad Laboratories in
Cambridge, Mass. It wasn't until he strapped on a pair of in-line
skates and headed out the door one morning last year, though, that
his commute became really interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a warrior on my way to work,'' said Murray, who
cuts a striking figure in black stretch pants, fluorescent
green-and-yellow top and helmet with red blinking lights fore and
aft. It takes him 40 minutes to skate 10 miles from his home in
Winchester to his workplace, past woods, lakes, streams and throngs
of trenchcoat-clad 9-to-5ers waiting forlornly at the train
station. For fun, he plows through puddles, throwing up a wake
behind him, or jumps over recyclable containers left on sidewalks.
``Every commute is like a day of skiing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the word ``commute,'' and most people make a face. And
no wonder. An overwhelming majority of Americans drive to work, and
according to a study of 68 urban areas by the Texas Transportation
Institute in 1997, they spent an average of 45 hours a year sitting
in traffic, up from 16 hours in 1982. Los Angeles had the highest
average, at 82 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Users of mass transportation, though smaller in number, tell
horror stories of delayed trains and overcrowded subway platforms.
Yet, a breed of worker is flourishing that actually likes the daily
commute. Some simply sit back and enjoy the ride; others have
figured out ways to make the ride more interesting, and still
others _ like Murray _ have switched from cars or trains to more
exotic forms of transport. The common theme is to try, somehow, to
make one of life's great frustrations one of the day's great
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Skinner, a travel consultant in New York City, is a
traditionalist who has commuted by train since 1959. Her favorite
commute, she says, began on ``the day Elvis died'' in 1977 when she
first took the 8:03 a.m. Metro-North train from New Canaan, Conn.,
to Grand Central Station. ``Everybody knows everybody,'' said
Skinner, who recently got a cake for her 70th birthday from the
train's engineer and conductor. ``In the morning, it's like a
kaffeeklatsch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s and '70s, she rode the 6:10 p.m. ``party train''
home and luxuriated in the smoky bar car, where bartenders hired
three-piece combos on holidays. Every Christmas, Skinner dressed up
as Santa and handed out gifts. Though she has since switched to the
more sedate 5:05 p.m. train, she still considers the ride a high
point of her day.
</P>
<P>
   The three-piece combos are long gone, but long-running card
games and bar cars endure as institutions on the Metro-North line.
Two years ago, Tom Skinner (no relation to Jacqueline), executive
producer for Touchscreen Media Group, an Internet company based in
New York, started the Web site www.barcar.com to give commuters a
way to keep in touch once they left the train. Contributors post
jokes and photos and comment on just about everything. One popular
section, named ``The Blue Lagoon'' after a blue disinfectant used
to clean the toilets, invites visitors to submit opinions of the
train's restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   New Canaan bar-car riders have posted their own Web page on the
site, decorate their bar car with lights each Christmas, are
fiercely loyal to their bartender, Vinnie, and tend to be a little
cliquish. ``If someone new walks in, they have to tell one good
joke that offends at least one person, or sing their alma mater,''
said Linda Hinckley, an advertising account supervisor and regular
on the 6:05 p.m. bar car to New Canaan. ``The more timid
personalities tend to turn around and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, a regular on the West Port line for 20 years, typically
stands at the end of his bar car with a can of beer and a bag of
peanuts, chatting with old friends. ``It's the only social life I
have during the week,'' he said. ``I see people on the train
sitting with their laptops playing solitaire, and I feel pity for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even fighting highway traffic can be enjoyable _ if you have
company. Derrick Mitchell, a San Diego city employee, organized a
van pool with seven other commuters not long ago and says the
hour's drive into the city now slips by almost unnoticed. ``We are
literally laughing all the time,'' he said. ``Wednesday is doughnut
day. On the way home, sometimes we go to a truckers' stop called
Messy's Burger for hamburgers. At Christmas, we all get together
with our spouses and go out to dinner. When someone is having a
personal problem with a child or a spouse or a job, we support
them. We are very close _ like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Brown, the owner of a restaurant in Cherry Hill, N.J., also
found a way to ease the angst of fighting his state's notorious
traffic jams. Five years ago, he began taking his son, Jordan, with
him and dropping him off at a day-care center near the restaurant.
``He demonstrates his karate moves for me, and we sing Motown
songs,'' Brown said. ``It's our best time together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers take extreme measures to relieve ennui. On a crawl
along 25 miles of California Highway 17, Emil Gallant of Soquel
said he and a friend used to ``take pictures of people doing stupid
stuff while they were driving _ like putting on makeup, eating
breakfast, talking on cell phones, reading books.'' They would post
the photos on a Web site they entitled ``The Highway 17 Page of
Shame.'' Gallant has since found a job closer to home and zips over
country roads to his new workplace on his Triumph motorcycle. ``I
love it,'' he gloated.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Head loves riding two-wheelers, too. Head, a postal worker
in Carrollton, Ga., gave up her Chevrolet Suburban for a bicycle
when gasoline hit $1.44 a gallon. Now, her 30-minute ride to work
past flowering dogwood and apple trees, a lake, a river and all
kinds of wildlife ``has turned into more of a pleasure than a
protest for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best part of the day. The kids aren't bothering me,
and the telephone isn't ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   If she thinks her commute is serene, she ought to meet Pat Doud,
general manager of the Scuttlebutt Brewing Co. in Everett, Wash. He
paddles a kayak across Puget Sound from his home in Marysville.
Though the ride takes up to an hour, versus 15 minutes by car, it
gives him an unhindered view of the Cascade and Olympic mountains,
bald eagles, seals, osprey, blue herons and spectacular sunsets on
the way home.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, ``it's a great upper-shoulder and arm workout,'' Doud
said. ``I bring an extra set of clothes, and when I get to work I
hose off with one of the brewery hoses _ a quick cold shower.
Invigorating.''

SHOPPING AROUND: RENTING A EUROPEAN HOUSE

 &HT;    
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Anyone who has enjoyed Frances Mayes' best-selling book, ``Under
the Tuscan Sun'' (Broadway, 1997; $14) has probably fantasized
about living in a European house or apartment. The good news is
that it's easy enough to live like an expatriate, for a week, a
month or longer, thanks to a large network of European rentals.
 &HT;    Whether the fantasy is a villa set in the hills of Tuscany, a
small cottage in Provence in the south of France or a Swiss chalet
overlooking Lake Geneva, European house rentals are surprisingly
affordable and easy to organize.
 &HT;    Romance, location and atmosphere loom large as prime reasons to
consider a rental. Travelers can awaken to their own clock, not a
hotel's.
 &HT;    Markets and shops, particularly in countries like France and
Italy, become more than mere scenery. Shopping with locals is a way
to experience a country in a manner that the average tourist never
really does.
 &HT;    A European rental is not about rushing around to cathedrals,
restaurants and museums. It's a surefire way to slow down and smell
the espresso.
 &HT;    Space, that final frontier of travel, is also a reason to rent.
Even the smallest studio apartment in Paris has more room than most
four-star hotel rooms in a city known for its tiny spaces. In
Scotland or Ireland, a rural cottage bestows a living room, a
dining room and bedrooms, as well as a garden.
 &HT;    Saving money is also one of the greatest benefits of renting.
The rule of thumb for rentals is that the savings can amount to 30
percent or more off the cost of a comparable hotel room.
 &HT;    For example, Paris Sejours Reservations has studio apartments in
the Marais district of Paris from 350 to 900 French Francs per
night, about $51 to $130 per night, or about what one would pay for
a one- or two-star hotel.
 &HT;    For a longer stay, a one-bedroom apartment can offer the kind of
space and luxury that one couldn't touch in a hotel at twice the
price. Since every rental comes with a kitchen or kitchenette,
dining out is an option, not a requirement.
 &HT;    Rentals are especially ideal for families or couples traveling
together. With four or even six people, the savings are even
greater.
 &HT;    The Parker Company has properties like Il Colombaiolo, in
Montepulciano, Tuscany. This luxurious three-bedroom house sleeps
six and is priced from $1,800 to $2,070 per week, which costs out
from $257 to $296 per night. Split among three couples, it's a
modest amount.
 &HT;    Group rentals also permit travelers to extend their buying
power, not merely save money. Those fabled villas with pools,
tennis courts and vast gardens become a reasonable buy, not a mere
romantic indulgence.
 &HT;    To find a rental, contact an agency by phone or visit their Web
site. When choosing a property, note that location is crucial. For
a city apartment, a quiet residential neighborhood can be a bonus,
especially for the noise-conscious, who may not want a rental on a
main city street. In rural areas, rental cars are essential, and
have to be factored into the overall cost.
 &HT;    Every good rental agent should provide a checklist of amenities
that are included with the rental, from linens to access to a
washer and dryer.
 &HT;    It's important to know how frequently the unit will be cleaned
and whether a deposit is required for the telephone. It's also
essential to have a nearby contact in case a pipe bursts or the
stove won't work, preferably someone who speaks some English.
 &HT;    Note that the minimum rental period is usually one week and that
prime properties in Italy and France should be booked months in
advance of high season.
 &HT;    Shoulder season is usually 20 to 30 percent less, and low season
can offer great value. But don't forget to factor in the weather.
November brings the chilly Mistral wind to Provence, while rural
England is not as delightful when it's cold and rainy.
 &HT;    Here are some major rentals companies.
 &HT;     At Home in France  (P.O. Box 643, Ashland, Ore., 97520;
541-488-9467; www.athomeinfrance.com/ahif.htm) focuses exclusively
on France.
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, N.Y. 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has
hundreds of ``gites,'' rural French vacation homes, as well as
Paris apartments.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) offers a handful of carefully
chosen properties in Italy and France.
 &HT;     Italian Villas  (8 Knight St., Suite 205, Norwalk, Conn. 06851;
800-700-9549; www.italianvillas.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, Vt. 05301;
802-254-6868) offers rentals in restored historic residences
throughout Britain.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, Ill. 60611; 800-582-7274; www.psryourhomeinParis.com) is a
specialist in Paris apartments.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, Mass.
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) is devoted exclusively
to Italy.
 &HT;     Vacation Rentals by Owner  (PMB308, 4255 South Buckley Road,
Aurora, Colo. 80013; http://vrbo.com/) is an Internet rental site
that brings independent homeowners together from around the world.
They have extensive European listings, from Swiss apartments to
Italian villas.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, R.I. 02840; 800-932-3222;

   Monument Valley has been used as a backdrop for so many movies,

cathedrals, craggy spires and wind-sculptured buttes are

<P>
   As a child, I watched so many of those old movies that Monument
Valley came to symbolize the West for me. The valley's stark
landscape, with its looming red-rock monoliths, some of which rise
1,000 feet from the desert floor, haunted me for years. They looked
like giant pawns scattered on an ancient god's chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   I had to see the place, which I did for the first time in the
mid-1980s. And then I had to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, I had viewed Monument Valley from a distance.
My vacations in the Four Corners have tended to be jampacked:
Durango, Colo., one day, then Mesa Verde National Park, then Canyon
de Chelly. There's so much to see and do in the area that my
husband, Dan Malone, and I would make a quick run in our car to
Monument Valley's edge, take some photographs of the famous
outlines of spires and buttes and head on to other destinations in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Those small tastes, though, left me hungry to see more. In early
March, we finally made a sojourn into the valley's heart for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Monument Valley, on Navajo land, straddles the Utah-Arizona
border. Until recent decades, the 2,000-square-mile area was hard
on travelers, with mostly dirt roads and rough accommodations.
Goulding's Lodge, where Harry Goulding, a Federal sheep inspector
from Mancos, Colo., and his wife, Leone (nicknamed Mike), settled
in 1923 on the Utah side of the border, was originally just a
trading post with a spectacular view over the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Gouldings and their Navajo neighbors suffered terrible
hardships, including a lack of food and cash during the Great
Depression. So when the Gouldings heard in 1938 that Ford was about
to make a new western, they went to Hollywood to persuade him to
shoot ``Stagecoach'' in Monument Valley and bring jobs to the
impoverished area. They were successful, and Goulding's became the
headquarters for Ford's films. At the time, it had the only
accommodations in the valley _ tents.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and I had originally planned to stay in the largest town
close to Monument Valley _ Kayenta, Ariz., 24 miles south _ until a
friend in Durango told us that Goulding's had expanded into a
full-fledged motel and lodge with modern accommodations. We changed
our plans and had no trouble getting a room in the early spring
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   One begins to appreciate Monument Valley's remoteness when
planning how to get there. We started our trip in Durango, 188
miles to the northeast, and drove a leisurely five hours to the
valley, stopping to take photographs and investigate shops selling
silver and turquoise jewelry and kitschy souvenirs in the scattered
small towns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Monument Valley on a blustery afternoon. A light
snow dusted the russet rocks. The spires shimmered in golden
sunlight and cast long dark shadows on the red earth.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's Lodge is about a mile off U.S. Highway 163, near the
turnoff to the Navajo Tribal Park headquarters, the official
entrance to Monument Valley. Situated at the base of towering
sandstone cliffs, the long, two-storied coral adobe motel faces
east, toward the formations. In the off-season, it was quiet, with
only a few guests, many of them Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The original two-story stone trading post has been turned into a
museum that gives a feel for the history of Goulding's. The cabin
occupied by John Wayne's character in Ford's ``She Wore a Yellow
Ribbon'' (1949), Capt. Nathan Brittles, has been preserved, too,
behind the old post. There's also a campground, a convenience store
and a gas station adjacent to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge was expanded and modernized in 1985; it is still the
only large accommodation in Monument Valley. Our room (like all of
Goulding's 62 rooms) opened onto a small balcony, overlooking
formations about five miles away with colorful names like Eagle
Mesa, the Stagecoach and the Bear and the Rabbit. It had a
king-size bed, a television with VCR, a small refrigerator and a
coffeemaker. The bedroom was decorated in the same desert hues we
saw through the sliding glass doors to the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   That evening we dined on grilled trout at the lodge's Stagecoach
Dining Room, which has a long picture window facing the valley.
It's staffed by Navajos and decorated with pottery and native
weavings.
</P>
<P>
   The food is basic _ steaks, hamburgers, chicken, a salad bar _
but quite good. Navajo tacos _ shredded beef, chilies, lettuce,
tomatoes and cheese in a big round piece of fry bread (like a puffy
tortilla) _ are a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Monument Valley is a sacred place to the Navajo Nation, the
largest American Indian tribe, with about 155,000 members and a
reservation of almost 16 million acres, including the Four Corners
area, larger than West Virginia. The Navajo are believed to be
descendants of Athabascan-speaking tribes from the Pacific Coast,
Canada and Alaska that arrived in the Southwest at least 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known exactly when the Navajo first settled Monument
Valley. Others came before them: Anasazi sites and ruins in the
valley date from before 1300. Navajos have lived in the valley for
generations, herding sheep and livestock and raising small crops.
</P>
<P>
   Religious ceremonies and practices are an essential part of
traditional Navajo daily life. There is no worship center: the
people consider the world around them holy.
</P>
<P>
   That belief is reflected in the names the Navajos gave to
Monument Valley's formations. One wind-sculptured monolith is
called the Yei-Bi-Chei, an important holy figure among Navajos. Cly
Butte is named for a chieftain buried there with his worldly
possessions, including his cattle, goats, sheep, horse and saddle.
</P>
<P>
   There's even the core of an ancient volcano that the Navajo call
Agathlan, renamed El Capitan by Kit Carson, the cavalry soldier who
starting in 1863 waged what some historians call a ``war of
extermination'' against the Navajo people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864, 8,000 Navajo were marched across New Mexico to Fort
Sumner on the New Mexico-Texas border and imprisoned for four
years; the survivors _ about 25 percent are believed to have died
on the march _ were allowed to occupy part of their old homeland
under a treaty signed in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1940s, when Hollywood discovered Monument Valley and
tourism started to become a business, Monument Valley was
primitive, largely empty and a difficult place for living or
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   While the area is more accessible now in terms of paved roads
and comfortable accommodations, a non-Navajo faces restrictions
seeing it. There are basically two options: going on a guided tour
or driving a self-guided 17-mile loop that starts at the Tribal
Park headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's and several independent Navajo guides offer daylong
or half-day tours in open-air sightseeing vehicles, in
four-wheel-drive jeeps or on horseback. Some tours take visitors to
Mystery Valley, a section of southwestern Monument Valley with
natural arches, pictographs and Anasazi ruins.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer to explore places on our own and at our own pace, so
we decided to take the self-guided drive. After paying $2.50 each
at the park entrance (the fee has since gone to $3) and receiving a
map of the loop, we headed off on the rutted dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   We had rented a Ford Explorer, but the road was dry and not so
bumpy that we needed to engage the four-wheel-drive (although it
might be needed if the roads were muddy).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors aren't allowed to go beyond marked roads and designated
points for viewing the landscape, except with a Navajo guide, to
protect tribal burial grounds and holy places. There are no hiking
trails, although hiking can be arranged with a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was the off-season, we passed only a few vehicles as we
wound around the mesas and buttes. Some of the formations have been
photographed so often that they seemed familiar _ like the Mittens,
two eroded buttes with thumblike spires.
</P>
<P>
   Other monoliths and pillars sport colorful and descriptive
names, too, like Castle Butte, the Sitting Hen, the Three Sisters
(a trio of spires standing close together, almost gossiping;
they're said to resemble three Catholic nuns in habits) or the Big
W, Totem Pole and the King on his Throne.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through the desert landscape with its sculptured rocks
was a sharp contrast to our trip from Durango through the snowy,
heavily forested Rocky Mountains. Yet Monument Valley was formed
from the Rockies, or, more specifically, their detritus.
</P>
<P>
   As material eroded from the Rockies millions of years ago, it
was deposited in layers and cemented into sandstone. Underground
pressure produced an uplift that made the surface bulge and crack,
forming canyons. Over millenniums, wind and water carved the hard
and soft rock into the striated orange and red natural wonders that
seem to pop out of the desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   We got out at several points and walked around a bit at the
designated viewing points. One of the most dramatic views came near
the end of the trip, at a place called the North Window.
</P>
<P>
   The loop drive consumed several hours because we stopped at all
11 scenic viewing points. At John Ford's Point, we parked in a lot
where several Navajo families had set up tables to sell silver and
turquoise jewelry. We followed a short trail to a finger of rock
jutting into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The director supposedly liked to film from this vantage point
with its sweeping views of the valley. On the day we visited, the
cameras were still rolling at John Ford's Point _ only now they
were video cameras held by French and German tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But to visit Monument Valley is also to realize that the
big-screen images and Technicolor can't do the place justice. It
takes the human eye to capture the 360-degree views and record the
way the valley changes color during the day, turning from lavender
and pink at dawn to gold and terra cotta in the late afternoon. Or
the way the monoliths cast long, ghostly shadows at dusk and become
otherworldly silhouettes against the blue twilight.
</P>
<P>
   For a place that has remained the same for so long, Monument
Valley remakes itself with every take.

   Monument Valley has been used as a backdrop for so many movies,
car commercials and magazine advertisements that its rock
cathedrals, craggy spires and wind-sculptured buttes are
immediately recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the credit goes to the director John Ford, who filmed
the 1939 western classic ``Stagecoach'' there and returned to make
seven more westerns.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I watched so many of those old movies that Monument

9 EDUCATORS ACCUSED OF ENCOURAGING STUDENTS TO CHEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A seventh-grade teacher was accused of leaving a
sheet of answers to a citywide math test near a pencil sharpener,
then urging the class to sharpen their pencils and leaving the
room. More than half the students marked the answers correctly.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-grade teacher was accused of sneaking a peek at the
state English test, discovering that the essay question concerned
Cubist art, and giving her students a lecture on Cubism on the eve
of the test.
</P>
<P>
   They were among nine educators _ seven teachers, one
paraprofessional and one librarian _ at eight schools in New York
City accused of encouraging students to cheat on standardized
tests, in a report issued Tuesday by the special investigator for
schools, Edward Stancik.
</P>
<P>
   What made Tuesday's report particularly striking was that it was
issued four months after Stancik, to great fanfare, issued a
similar report that suggested that cheating on standardized tests
was almost epidemic throughout the city's public schools. That
investigation, which covered five years, implicated 52 educators at
32 schools, made headlines as far away as Scandinavia and hastened
the ouster of Chancellor Rudy Crew just two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Half the new cases occurred after the first Stancik report, and
after the Board of Education took steps to strengthen security.
</P>
<P>
   The new report ranges from dramatic accounts of teachers'
erasing wrong answers and aggressively luring students to cheat, to
more ambiguous instances, such as a teacher who changed the tone of
her voice while reading a passage out loud during a test. Stancik
contended that the modulation in the teacher's voice was a cue for
her students to take notes highlighting important points they would
need to write an essay.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik said there were more than 100 allegations, mainly by
parents and teachers, about cheating on standardized tests
administered from the spring of 1999 to March 2000. He said the
allegations were substantiated in eight schools scattered through
every borough but Staten Island, and on three tests: a city English
test, a state English test and a city math test.
</P>
<P>
   The number of tests affected and the geographic diversity, he
said, suggests that cheating is more widespread than just in the
small number of cases detected.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, who criticized the last report as flimsy, said Tuesday
that this latest report was more restrained and documented, and
that if the charges were upheld, ``there should be serious
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight schools affected are about 1 percent of the city's 675
elementary and 197 middle schools. No high schools were implicated.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised several gray areas between legitimate test
preparation and flagrant cheating. For instance, Joohi Chun, the
fourth-grade teacher at Public School 150 in Queens, who was
accused of giving children an unfair advantage by modulating her
voice, said in her defense that she was reading with expression to
keep the material interesting. Her students told investigators they
had not been coached to listen to her tone of voice.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Hodas, executive vice president of the Princeton Review,
a national company that prepares students to take standardized
tests, said that although he was not familiar with this particular
case, reading with expression is a natural way to help students
understand material.
</P>
<P>
   Chun was scrutinized after teachers scoring her class' exams
noticed that her students took especially thorough notes. Chun told
investigators that she had worked intensively on note-taking,
teaching children to use bullets to mark short phrases or words.
</P>
<P>
   Harold O. Levy, interim chancellor, said Tuesday that he had
ordered intensified monitoring Thursday when elementary and middle
schools administer a citywide math test. He also invited Stancik to
send his investigators to the schools during testing.
</P>
<P>
   Weingarten said she was heartened that in six of the nine cases,
educators were turned in by their own colleagues, suggesting, she
said, that most teachers have no tolerance for cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Egan, a teacher at IS 113 in the Bronx's District 11, was
the teacher who allegedly left the answers to 11 questions near the
pencil sharpener. Nineteen of his 32 students got answers right.
After the exam, Egan told students: ``Don't tell anyone that I
helped you, or you'll be the ones that will get into trouble,''
Stancik said. Nonetheless, he was reported by one girl and her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Nevis, a teacher at PS 7 in Queens District 24, not only
gave her students a lesson on Cubism, but said that they should
remember the words ``motivation'' and ``inspiration,'' Stancik
said. Both words were important to the essay the children had to
write the next day. Before being given copies of the state exam,
teachers were required to sign an agreement promising to keep the
contents secret.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik urged the dismissal of seven of the nine educators: Paul
Egan, Paul Zomchek, Alice McNally, Jane Nevis, Virgilio Rivera,
Fritz Alexandre and John Paizis. He recommended counseling for Luz
Rodriguez, a paraprofessional, and Chun, because, he said, their
intent to cheat was less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   The affected schools are PS 92 in Brooklyn and PS 161 in
Manhattan, both in the chancellor's district for failing schools;
PS 40 and PS 163 in Manhattan, IS 113 in the Bronx, PS 191 in
Brooklyn and PS 7 and PS 150 in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cheating allegations involved the state's fourth-grade
English test and the city's Performance Assessment in Mathematics
and Performance Assessment Language tests.

COMPANIES INCREASINGLY TURN TO CORPORATE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We fly higher and faster,'' said Bill Wagner, a pilot. ``We can
get from Des Moines, Iowa, to Washington, D.C., in about two hours
with no delays. And we've never lost a piece of luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   But hold on before inquiring where to book your next business
trip on this astonishing airline. Wagner flies an executive jet for
the Townsend Engineering Co. of Des Moines, one of more than 11,000
American companies that own corporate aircraft. To take a business
trip on Townsend's Cessna Citation X, an eight-passenger mid-size
executive jet, or its six-passenger Piper Cheyenne propeller plane,
you generally have to be an employee or a customer of the company,
which manufactures processing machines for domestic and foreign
meat packers.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate-jet business has abandoned the defensive crouch it
went into for years after the shareholder revulsion generated by
the celebrated business excesses of the mid- to late 1980s, when
legendary corporate Champagne Charlies like F. Ross Johnson of RJR
Nabisco presided imperially over fleets of expensive jets that
could be dispatched on a whim, say to fetch a pet.
</P>
<P>
   The business has come back at full throttle, thanks to a booming
economy, a reaction against the delays and frustrations of
commercial airlines, and a pronounced change in attitudes as
corporate managers justify the expense of a company plane as a
business tool. It is seen as a productive way to transport not only
top executives, but also the middle-management teams that are
increasingly spanning out on ever-wider business trips.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate jet is ``very expensive _ so they'd better provide
a return on that investment of significant value or you cannot
realistically own one,'' said Ted Townsend, the president of
Townsend Engineering. Some big companies, like Wal-Mart Stores,
operate big fleets of aircraft for a variety of business reasons,
but even smaller operations like Townsend Engineering use planes
for functions besides transportation, including things like
shipping spare parts to outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
   Though he admits to fervently loving his jet, Townsend says that
its value is strictly practical for a company like his, a machinery
maker whose sales and service staffs have to be quick-footed,
wide-ranging and happy on the job. ``With our location in the
central part of the country, we can go anyplace in the United
States and still come home for dinner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies owning jets and other turbine-engine
aircraft increased more than fivefold over the last 30 years, to
more 11,000 by 1998, according to the National Business Aviation
Association. American companies now operate about 6,200 jets; 5,100
turbo-prop planes; and 5,000 helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But the climb wasn't steady. After a steep ascent through the
1970s, sales of business aircraft flattened in the late 1980s. In
1992, manufacturers delivered 348 new business jets and
turbo-props, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers
Association. Last year, the number was 778.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long haul to change the corporate jet's image as a toy
for pampered executives, industry experts say. ``To a certain
extent, the community brought this upon itself many years ago when
they emphasized the tremendous comfort, luxury and special
privilege of a company airplane,'' said Jack Olcott, the president
of the National Business Aviation Association, a trade group that
represents corporate aircraft owners. ``The excesses of the '80s
were really only very limited examples, but they received
tremendous media attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even corporations with big corporate fleets depend heavily on
commercial aviation for most of their business travel, he noted.
``The enlightened company uses the airlines when appropriate, and
business aviation when appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fastest-growing areas in business aviation is in
companies that operate corporate jets for charter and for use by
clients who purchase fractional shares of a plane or a group of
planes, allowing them to have an aircraft available when they want
it. The number of companies with fractional-ownership deals
doubled, to 1,125, from 1997 to 1998, according to the business
aviation trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the corporate jet back, but it's getting bigger.
Boeing Co. is now marketing its new Boeing Business Jet, which has
an 807-square-foot interior _ about twice the space of other
top-line corporate jets. The plane costs about $38 million, with
another $8 to $12 million for accessories and other options. So
far, Boeing has orders for 56 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Kelley, a spokesman for the Boeing Business Jet division,
described the plane as ``basically a hybrid 737,'' with
modifications, including bigger fuel tanks that give it a flying
range of about 6,200 miles, similar to the Gulfstream V and twice
the range of the Boeing 737 aircraft used domestically by many
commercial airlines. The appeal of having a ``global presence''
accounts for the longer range, Kelley said. The size reflects a
demand for flying more people, including management teams, and
equipping them to work in flight with ``all the things you would
have in a normal office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley and other Boeing executives recently returned from a
40-day barnstorming trip on one of the new planes through Europe
and the Middle East. Negative public attitudes toward business
aircraft remain especially entrenched in Europe, where ``if you
have a private jet, you don't talk about it,'' Kelley said, adding:
``We're trying to convert people's thinking into seeing it as a
business tool, rather than it being an excessive perquisite for the
CEO, the royal barge kind of image.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said the trip was productive. ``I flew 150 hours, 48,000
miles, in 40 days,'' he said. ``I wouldn't want to even think about
doing that on commercial flights.''

EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE PART OF PHILADELPHIA'S WELCOME WAGON FOR GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As he prepares for the Republican national
convention this summer, David Cohen, an urbane political insider
and civic factotum worthy of the Medicis, is willing to risk the
ultimate rhetorical jabbing at his beloved city.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't have low expectations of Philadelphia; they had
no expectations of Philadelphia,'' Cohen, co-chairman of the city's
convention host committee, said in his 52nd-floor law office
overlooking a city that undeniably gleamed with the stuff of
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought of Philadelphia: old city, falling apart, dirty,
unsafe,'' said the advocate, recalling two catastrophic mayoral
images that long beset this place. ``You know, Frank Rizzo lining
up African-Americans on North Broad Street with a billy club in his
cummerbund; Wilson Goode dropping a bomb on his own city.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen beamed down upon the turnaround in that image across the
last decade, an exuberant rebirth confirmed by the Republicans'
choice of this Democratic bastion above eight other contenders as
precisely the attractive, entertaining city they need.
</P>
<P>
   Basic hospitality and civic elbow grease is at the heart of the
turnaround. The city, long a modern conventioneer's backwater, has
succeeded at the breakneck task of building 4,500 new downtown
hotel rooms in the past four years. Philadelphia thereby more than
doubled its goal and finally ascended to the heavyweight class by
being able to offer the 20,000 rooms that the convention industry
requires for a city to be rated a prime destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge opportunity for the city,'' said former Mayor
Edward Rendell, still a popular politician here for conceiving the
fast-forward construction plan four years ago when virtually no one
believed Philadelphia could pull it off. Invincibly excited at the
possibilities of his city, Rendell has since become the new
Democratic national chairman in charge of defeating the
Republicans' ticket. Far from feeling conflicted, he promises to be
dancing discreetly in the streets when the Republicans pack into
town July 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the Republicans a tremendous first-class experience,
but I'll be around to respond to the content of the convention as
the loyal opposition, pointing out the hyperbole,'' he happily
promised. ``I might even wear an elephant necktie one day out of
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphians know Rendell would have donned a clown suit if
that is what it took to win a presidential convention, the city's
first in 52 years. In 1948, Philadelphia had all three, including
the Progressives. But hotel space gradually became the main
shortcoming in a city well noted for its stock of fine restaurants
and peerless settings of American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Philadelphia is right on the cusp of being one of the
premier destination cities in America and this convention will put
us over,'' predicted Cohen, celebrating the Republican flood of
45,000 political and media visitors to a city that did not have a
modern convention center until seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It now has two, and James DiPaula, the Republicans' convention
manager who is known as Chip, is delighted to be using both plus
the city's trove of historic and cultural treasures _ from the
Liberty Bell to the Museum of Art's ``Rocky'' steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had fine local support in past conventions, but nothing
like what this city is showing us,'' said DiPaula, citing the host
committee's creation of a shuttle bus system that will operate 15
hours a day on 21 routes among 95 hotels as free transportation. In
contrast, Republicans at the 1996 convention in San Diego had to
pay $60 each for a shuttle system that operated only 8 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 residents anxious to show off their city have
volunteered as unpaid guides, drivers and greeters for a convention
that so far is an affair of symbiosis, not partisanship. Mayor John
Street, the city's ranking Democrat, garnered more than 7,500 new
local jobs alone from the new hotel space. He, in turn, is working
on new municipal contracts to make sure city workers stay aboard
the hospitality wagon.
</P>
<P>
   As Republican major domo, DiPaula savors the 6,600 miles of
fiber optic cable and the studio-quality television lighting that
blankets the city's First Union Center. This is the three-year-old
sports arena and convention hall in south Philadelphia, three miles
from downtown, where delegates will hold their sessions and flash
their campaign message to the world.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet looming large this year for both major party
conventions, DiPaula is preparing enough electronics to serve not
just the estimated 25-million-member broadcast audience, but a more
participatory audience of another 25 million on the Web. The
convention will have extensive rows of ``Internet Alley'' space for
Web reporters and ``streaming video'' computer broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A former speaker once said all politics is local,'' DiPaula
noted, quoting the late Tip O'Neill. ``No more: All politics is
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, politics is both and no one knows that better than
former Mayor Rendell, who worked closely with Republican Gov. Tom
Ridge to win the convention. It was the governor who urged
Republicans to ``go into some nontraditional constituencies'' and
broaden their convention image.
</P>
<P>
   Peripheral delegate meetings will be held at the downtown
convention center on Market Street, which embraces the
spectacularly refurbished Reading railroad terminal shed. The
center was built in conjunction with the Marriott convention hotel,
the badly needed keystone to the city's recovery that came close to
failing when, Cohen recounts, banks lost faith in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Marriott chain finally had to finance the hotel with its own
cash, all the while predicting it would be the city's last new
hotel, Cohen loves to note. ``Well, Marriott has since built three
more,'' he adds with an airy smile that exemplifies the city's mood
right now in awaiting the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great moment for Ed, but perhaps an awkward one,
too,'' said Cohen, who for eight years was Rendell's most trusted
adviser, providing Panza practicality for the Quixote impulses of
Rendell. But the expansive Rendell, who many expect to run next for
governor, says no problem, he will somehow manage to survive a week
that includes Philadelphia's biggest opportunity for free media
since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. About 15,000
news workers are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could not buy this,'' said Cohen, anticipating the
hundreds of foreign and heartland television crews who, even more
than the network anchors, will broadcast the images of a renewed
city. ``It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, it will be back to donkey neckties and uninhibited
partisan hyperbole for Rendell in Los Angeles, where the Democrats
convene on Aug. 14. For his city, if not his party, the former
mayor is hoping that the Republicans disprove the notion that
Democrats just naturally throw better parties. ``But the
Republicans spend more money,'' he always emphasizes, ever the
Philadelphian.

A PARENT'S VIEW OF 16, THE YEAR OF COMPETING FURIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Lessons Column) 
 By HUBERT B. HERRING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was 16 once. My mother, in the midst of tearing her hair out,
used to mutter, ``When you have a 16-year-old, you'll understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, suddenly I do, and I'm starting to.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, though, that being 16 isn't what it used to be. As
I've quickly come to realize, it's worse. I'd love to be able to
harrumph to my son, ``Why, in my day ... '' and then reel off the
horrors of coming of age in the early '60s. But once I told him I
grew up without a VCR (``You're kidding!'') or had to learn to
drive a stick shift (``What's that?''), I would have to admit that
the pressures now are far greater.
</P>
<P>
   For those out of the teen-age loop, 16 might seem just another
number on the steady climb from 0 to 21. But just look at the
pressures that our society, in its infinite mischief, has conspired
to load onto children _ or are they young adults? or what? _ in the
year following their 16th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Educational pressure is surely the worst. It used to be that we
wandered into the College Boards without much thought, looked at a
few colleges and sent in our applications. But these days, high
school juniors _ who are typically 16 _ often go to tutors or
special classes for the tests. My wife and I tried to resist this,
thinking of such prepping as a gimmick, a low-cal short cut, but
since most students do it, the playing field would be tilted
distinctly against our son without it. We succumbed, and off he
went each week to two different tutors, one for English, one for
math _ preparing to submit himself to the College Boards ordeal not
once but twice this spring.
</P>
<P>
   This time-consuming process came just as high-pressure
advanced-placement exams loomed, along with _ in his case _ Regents
and International Baccalaureate exams. That last program, as I
understand it, gets students both to learn more rigorously and to
approach learning in a new way _ noble goals indeed. It's still
fairly rare in this country, but I was glad to hear at least one
college admissions officer speak of it with respect. Innovative as
it is, it adds yet another round of exams and another layer of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the day-to-day classroom, it has been drilled into
these students that solid junior-year grades are vital for getting
into a good college, and they feel this pressure daily, test by
test, paper by paper. To top it off, many sports-minded teen-agers
have hit the varsity level _ for our son, it's tennis _ and the
endless practices and bus trips gobble a big slice of time. Since
such activities are essential for college admission, what parent
will say no?
</P>
<P>
   Even as all this is happening, guidance counselors are telling
students they really need to start getting a sense of what the
college scene is all about. So we, like many other parents,
dutifully tried to find little pockets of time this spring to
squeeze in college visits _ to a chorus of ``No, the SAT's are that
weekend'' or ``That's the prom'' or ``I've got to work that weekend
to get money to buy clothes.'' Or, perhaps, the day came and he was
simply exhausted. (Do these people ever sleep?)
</P>
<P>
   We did manage to visit several colleges this spring, but were
flying a little blind until we knew our son's SAT scores _ and thus
which colleges would be realistic choices.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's tuition. A generation ago, a middle-class family
could probably just write the check; now, unless there's a new
dot-com or some old money in the family, that's unlikely. So, like
many other parents of college-bound students, we've had to give our
son a crash course in matters financial: there's this much money,
and beyond that you have to play a part in making the numbers add
up, whether through scholarships, loans, of opting for a less
expensive school.
</P>
<P>
   And in a cruel quirk of timing, all this often coincides with a
host of extracurricular pressures, notably that liberating,
get-out-of-my-way-world moment: getting a driver's license. One
moment they're children, suffering the indignity of having bald,
badly dressed parents chauffeur them around; the next they're
full-fledged members of an on-the-go society.
</P>
<P>
   A driver's license, in turn, expands the social possibilities
exponentially, and these, in turn, create a dire need for cash,
which means an intense desire to earn money even as all the other
distractions mount.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of these pressures could be heavy going; when they all
converge in the spring of junior year _ well, it makes my head
spin, and I'm mainly just watching in awe from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder: Does it put too much stress on students and
parents alike to have childhood rattle over so many bumps
simultaneously? Can any tinkering be done to spread these pressures
out?

THE BOSS COLUMN: ADVENTURE THE CHINESE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH KAPLAN: Founder and Managing Director of Informatics East
China Inc. Written with CRAIG SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I came to Shanghai in the summer of 1996 with a 20-year plan.
People thought I was crazy, as no one moves to a city on the other
side of the world _ especially to one in a developing country _
with a 20-year plan. But I did, and I have 16{ years left.
</P>
<P>
   I have always wanted to create a business running schools. I
wrote my thesis at Wharton on how to manage for-profit schools. And
so, after much research, I decided to develop a chain of
universities for Chinese students and started raising money.
</P>
<P>
   It was very difficult at the beginning. Doing business in China
is complicated and completely different from in the U.S. I couldn't
just walk into some government office and register a company and
then begin. I had to find a local partner and navigate the
government bureaucracy. It took a year to get approval.
</P>
<P>
   We planned the opening of the first school in Nanjing, booked a
hotel, informed the parents of 100 students and arranged for
reporters to attend, on a Sunday. On the Thursday night before,
about 9 p.m., I'm having a quiet evening doing a little bit of work
in Shanghai when the phone rings. The vice governor, one of the top
five officials in a province of 71 million people, wants to attend
the school's opening ceremony. But he's available only on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now he can't just come; he has to get approval from his
higher-ups. So we spent Friday running around helping track people
down, and by 3 p.m. we were told he could attend. Then we needed to
confirm the hotel. But as Saturday fell on a very auspicious day in
the Chinese calendar, every hotel in Nanjing was booked for
weddings. We had no place to hold the event, and we still hadn't
informed the parents or reporters about the change.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after many hours of phone calls, we were given
permission to use a government guesthouse on the grounds of the
former U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, from the days when the Kuomintang
government was there. It wasn't until 7 p.m. that we managed to
start calling all the parents to tell them about the change. But
because schedule changes to suit high-ranking officials are common
in China, no one was upset. And everyone looked good because the
children were going to a school that had a vice governor as host at
its opening.
</P>
<P>
   In China, you must be ready to create and take opportunities the
Chinese way. The other day the train I was taking to Nanjing
stopped suddenly. After waiting two hours, we heard rumors that
protesters in a town farther down the line, who were upset about
losing money in an investment fraud, had blocked the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   When I realized we weren't moving anytime soon, I started
telling people around me we should just abandon the train. Before I
knew it I had 20 people following me. Many people in China are
willing to do very adventurous things, but they won't take the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   We set out on foot, with no paved road in sight, nothing but
farmland as far as the eye could see. We walked for a long time
along a muddy track, all of us city folks from Shanghai, through
tiny villages, past goats, pigs, ducks, chickens and farmers still
wearing Mao suits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally we got to a paved road and waved down an old Russian
car. The driver agreed to take four of us. He drove very slowly,
never more than 30 miles an hour, but got us to Nanjing. We were
only three hours late, and I made my 2:30 meeting on schedule.

 &HT;    Crim: An optimist during turbulent time of transition
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At the news of his death today, Alonzo Crim was
remembered as the courtly, optimistic superintendent who brought
Atlanta schools through tumultuous years of desegregation and white
flight, and managed to teach the city something about civility in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``His genuine belief in community, which included all sorts of
conditions of people, was a key factor in his ability to draw
people who may think they disagree into some sort of consensus,''
recalled Charles V. Willie, an emeritus professor at Harvard
University's Graduate School of Education, of which Crim was one of
the most honored doctoral graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Crim came to Atlanta in 1973 to be the superintendent specified
in a desegregation compromise that avoided massive cross-town
busing, but required an African-American superintendent and a
balance among blacks and whites in administration.
</P>
<P>
   The late Benjamin E. Mays, school board president at the time,
took on as a personal mission seeing that Crim succeeded, said
Willie, whose 1984 book ``School Desegregation Plans That Work''
includes a chapter by Crim on Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Mays and Crim developed a mentor-protege relationship, Willie
said. ``Never has there been such a warm and intimate interaction
between a superintendent and a president of a school board. They
taught the system, as well as the students, something about the
fundamental concept of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   During Crim's 15 years as head of Atlanta schools, he oversaw
the transition of a predominantly white system to a predominantly
black system and withstood questions of academic decline. He put
the best face on things, highlighting student awards and
achievement. Critics accused him of hiding academic problems in
order to project an upbeat image.
</P>
<P>
   But history will see him as a great leader during a crucial time
for Atlanta, said Joe Martin, a board member during most of Crim's
years as superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a white businessman who often clashed with Crim, said
Crim was always professional and courtly. He handled the criticism
and political pressure of the period, Martin said, noting that Crim
often joked about his diminutive stature by saying that he had been
6-foot-8 when he first came to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw his job as restoring confidence and showing that black
leadership could get the job done,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was a pioneer, in the truest sense of being in a
position no one had ever been in for Atlanta. ``He not only
survived, but distinguished himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Willie both said that Crim will be seen in the light
of history as an important figure for Atlanta and the history of
school desegregation. ``I'm totally shocked,'' said Sara Lawrence
Lightfoot, a Harvard University professor who researched Crim for
her book ``The Good High School.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of him as an extremely thoughtful, elegant, quietly
charismatic gentleman, always a gentleman,'' said Lightfoot. ``But
with some very progressive values, a commitment to all children,
particularly those children who are typically disenfranchised from
American education.''

director of information services, Leviton Manufacturing Co., Little
Neck, N.Y. Written with PATRICIA R. OLSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe: I've been traveling in sales jobs for 27 years. I'm on the
road most of the time. I don't think I could take a job that didn't
involve travel now. It gets in your blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dave: I go on most trips with Joe to train the salespeople.
</P>
<P>
   Joe: On a flight back to New York from California, there was a
burning odor. The pilot turned the plane around and told us not to
be upset at the fire trucks that would be waiting for us. We hopped
on a second plane and had the time of our lives in the last row
playing cards with a guy from our human resources department. We
were trying to figure out how to keep track and play for money but
we had no chips, so a flight attendant gave us about 30 swizzle
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Dave: I won $119 from Joe in that game.
</P>
<P>
   Joe: The whole time we were playing we were talking business.
We're hiring two training people, and we couldn't agree on a job
description or who they would report to. Dave acted as mediator,
pointing out some things we hadn't thought about. I'm 53, and he's
30. We get along well. It's rare to find an information-services
guy who has a sales personality. We have fun, but we're dead
serious about what we do.
</P>
<P>
   Dave: I got engaged on that trip. My girlfriend came out on
Friday, before the Sunday sales meeting, and I chartered a boat for
a cruise. As the sun went down, I got down on one knee and
proposed. On the way to another meeting, I loaded a new casino game
on my laptop. Joe and I started playing in the airport, listened to
voice mail on our cell phones while we were playing, and continued
the game on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Joe: The flight attendants even got into it _ each time they'd
pass us they'd check to see who was winning.
</P>
<P>
   Dave: I was bragging because I was winning, but then Joe hit a
hot streak. We were yelling at each other about the game _ we
instigate each other _ but like always, we were carrying on two
conversations at once. I was trying to make Joe understand how our
e-business initiative could help his salespeople. I needed his
buy-in so he'd take it to upper management.
</P>
<P>
   Joe: Our in-house travel agent can't believe how many hours we
work when we're on the road. Recently I attended three different
regional sales meetings in the United States, came home, and then
went to Mexico, all within three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After a flight where we lost an engine, I returned to the office
to find phone messages from my co-workers joking that they weren't
going to fly with me again. I sent a group message back saying:
``You know you are. If you don't fly with me anymore, you're not
going to have any fun.''

 &HT;    FEDERAL AGENCIES GET LOW SCORES ON 'PERFORMANCE REPORTS'
 &HT;    220&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If federal agencies were private corporations,
nearly all of them would be in trouble with government regulators
for issuing annual reports that are hard to obtain, difficult to
understand and lacking in measures on how well they deliver
services, says a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a scorecard for 24 top federal agencies, the Mercatus Center
at George Mason University flunked the majority of their
performance reports, which were issued for the first time last
March as part of the Government Performance and Results Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agency reports should mirror standards required in the reports
of Fortune 500 companies, which suffer severe penalties if they
fail to report accurately and ethically to their shareholders,''
the academic review said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said they made no attempt to gauge the
actual success of government operations, only to analyze the
quality of the information they provide the public.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., said the ranking of reports did not indicate which
agencies best fulfill their missions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said he was concerned about the agencies with the
lowest-rated reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not doing a very good job, then you don't want
people to know what you're doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Only three agencies scored high marks for their reports. They
included the U.S. Agency for International Development (which has
since been merged with the State Department) and the departments of
Transportation and Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The rest had scores of only 37 to 21 out of a possible 60
points. The National Science Foundation came in last and was
criticized for its lack of candor. Instead of acknowledging any
failures, the NSF report used only the categories of ``successful''
or ``marginally effective,'' the Mercatus study noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Commerce fared almost as poorly, scoring only
22 points. Not only was its report hard to find, but it was almost
unreadable, the study said. ``Slim chance that many people will
read its 180 pages laden with undefined acronyms, technical jargon,
and poorly designed tables,'' the reviewers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department's report was also among the bottom
three. ``USDA appears to consider its results disappointing but
offers no explanation of why,'' said the study.
</P>
<P>
   The review team was led by Jerry Ellig, a research fellow at the
center who previously served as an economist for the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress and research director for the conservative
group, Citizens for a Sound Economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercatus Center, which describes itself as having a
pro-small business, libertarian orientation, was established by
George Mason University and is partially supported by private
donations to the George Mason University Foundation.

&HT;     FISH AND GAME COMMISSION GETS A RAW DEAL UNDER DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gov. Gray Davis has appointed the most qualified
candidate to the California Fish and Game Commission. That is,
qualified for lining up at the public trough as one of the
governor's buddies.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled commission, which had only one of five members show
up for a monthly meeting this year, opened April with three
vacancies. That has been somewhat alleviated by Richard Theriot,
who agreed to stay on after his term expired and a replacement
could be named.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Commission is one of California's most
powerful small boards. It serves above and independently of the
Department of Fish and Game and its $208 million budget and sets
state policy for fish and wildlife management, endangered species,
introduction of exotic species and administration of state lands.
Almost as a sidelight, it sets all seasons, limits and methods of
take for sportfishing and hunting and several highly-contested
commercial fishing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Getting appointed to the commission by the governor is
considered a dream job for a candidate who had prepared with a
lifetime of work within the conservation or wildlife management
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Since Davis was elected governor, there was a 17-month wait for
his first appointment to the commission, which can define a
governor's conservation ethic. After this long wait, and apparent
search for the right candidate, Davis appointed Michael Flores, who
comes complete with only his political dues having been paid. Here
is the Flores bio provided by the governor's office:
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Flores was named Governor Gray Davis' Secretary of
foreign Affairs in May 1999. Secretary Flores facilitates Governor
Davis' international relations and acts specifically as his liaison
for California-Mexico affairs. Mr. Flores also has administrative
responsibility for the Governor's office and regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Flores is responsible for orchestrating the
Governor's trips abroad as well as receiving foreign dignitaries in
California. He carries out functions akin to the diplomatic corps
on behalf of the Governor; working directly with embassies and
foreign officials to ensure closer social, economic and political
ties between California and its international partners. Secretary
Flores has played an integral role in the planning and
implementation of various events including the Governor's visits to
Mexico, the visits of the Irish and Mexican Presidents to
California, and the Governor's Business Development Mission to
Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to his appointment in the Governor's office in January
1999, Mr. Flores served as Lieutenant Governor Davis' Chief of
Staff. He also represented Lieutenant Governor Davis on the
California World Trade Commission, the State Lands Commission and
the State Job Training Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Flores was appointed by former State Treasurers Kathleen
Brown and Matt Fong to serve as Chief Information Security Officer
and Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff. In this position, Mr.
Flores supervised adherence to the policies and procedures
protecting the information assets of the State Treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1986 to 1991, Mr. Flores was an Associate Consultant for
the Senate Democratic Caucus. His largest accomplishment in this
role was the drafting of legislation to protect terminally ill
patients' insurance claims. He also composed editorial op-eds,
conducted research, and analyzed proposed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Flores is deeply concerned with issues of juvenile crime.
Prior to his political involvement, he dedicated sixteen years of
state service to the California Department of Corrections, the
California Youth Authority, and the Department of Justice, among
other state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Flores, a native of Sacramento, received his degree in
psychology from California State University, Sacramento and
attended the graduate school of clinical psychology at Morehead
State University in Kentucky.''
</P>
<P>
   You waited 17 months for this?

CINCINNATI TAKES STOCK OF A LAUGHINGSTOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Cross one of the bridges that spans the Ohio River
and connects Kentucky to Ohio, and you will arrive in downtown
Cincinnati, in view of a large construction site with huge cranes,
slabs of concrete and busy workers blending like bees. It is a
jungle down there. Paul Brown Stadium _ the Bengals' new $318
million home _ is nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Now to stick a blast of dynamite into the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise that has not produced a winning record in
the past nine seasons and went 3-13 and 4-12 the past two years.
During that span the Bengals have employed three coaches (Sam
Wyche, Dave Shula and Bruce Coslet), a slew of quarterbacks, a ton
of unsuccessful draft picks, devastating injuries and controversy
followed by more controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Bengals trudged to an 0-4 start and began
thinking about next year. The team president, Mike Brown, said
then: ``It has been our worst nightmare, worse than imagined. We've
got to go with the young guys; it makes not sense to go in the
direction we're going in.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, the Bengals let quarterback Jeff Blake flee to
New Orleans and Blake offered this parting shot: ``I've felt the
losing aura. I've been on a team where as soon as you walk in the
facility you can smell it.'' The Bengals are about to rid
themselves of receiver Carl Pickens, who said of Coslet: ``Bruce
has never had a winning record here or anywhere else so why would
you bring him back?''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy, frustration, futility, embarrassment. Losing.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is lost on the current cast of Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have happened here,'' Coslet said. ``There has been a
lot of the `Here we go again' syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bengals used their second-round pick to draft a
spiffy cornerback, Charles Fisher, from West Virginia. After a
dozen or so plays in their season-opening game, he was out for the
year because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``And from the sidelines last year,'' Fisher said, ``I could see
the problems. A lot of breakdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Rod Jones said, ``When you're in the NFL,
you've got to be proud of where you're at because the opportunities
are few.'' That does not keep the Bengals from being jokes and
fodder for their peers. They have been called the Black Hole of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also have a reputation for being thrifty, which has
resulted in protracted contract holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third year here, and we've been a team that once
one or two things kind of negative happen, everybody on the team
lets that take over.'' linebacker Brian Simmons said. ``Once that
happens, you are already defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the quarterback for this season, the man they hope will
return the Bengals' home field to the Jungle is Akili Smith. The
third player selected in the draft a year ago, Smith talks as if he
has been here for 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this town and this team, and I see a lot of people
in a box,'' said Smith, who played at Oregon and grew up in San
Diego. ``I see a lot of people struggling to get out of that box to
explore more. Everybody walking through that door must know that we
can't have another season like last year. We'd get behind in so
many games by 10 points or more in the first quarter and guys would
start hanging their heads and basically give up. We're talking
about releasing some demons. The Bengals have been haunted by
demons for the last 10 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Bengals have been in two Super Bowls (1982 and
1989) and though both losses were to San Francisco, at least the
Bengals have been there. (There are a handful of National Football
League franchises that have never had a whiff of the Super Bowl.)
Their fans came early and stayed late and their stadium became
known as the Jungle, a frolicking place where running back Ickey
Woods did his shuffle and where quarterback Boomer Esiason made his
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Many trace the origin of the Bengals' struggles to the death in
1991 of their founder, Paul Brown. As the Bengals opened minicamp
last week, Coslet pondered what has gone wrong for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through quarterbacks here like it was nobody's
business; I've never had the same starter two years in a row,'' he
said. ``There has been no continuity in the offensive line.
Injuries have hurt us. This is not sour grapes. And it hurts you if
you dwell on it, so I have selective memory. You look at Ray Rhodes
fired in Green Bay for going 8-8 in the first year of a five-year
contract and I go 4-12 in my third year and I'm back. But it's no
surprise to me. As a player and coach, I've been a Bengal off and
on for 24 years. There is a sense of loyalty here. I've done the
best with what I've had to work with. We've got better players now.
We like our draft picks. Our offensive line returns intact for the
first time. We've got strong linebacking. Our special teams hurt us
and we've improved there. Akili will be the most important single
player on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Real problems, though, remain. Pickens is in limbo; he will
probably be released. Ki-Jana Carter recently suffered another
setback, another knee injury, and the oft-injured running back
hopes to return when training camp opens. Running back Corey
Dillion is a contract holdout, but Brown believes he will be
signed.
</P>
<P>
   The draft produced Peter Warrick, the Florida State receiver,
with the fourth pick over all. Many scouts rated Warrick the best
player in the draft. That is Smith, a No. 3 pick, throwing to
Warrick, a No. 4. That could be a signature connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter came into minicamp this week and showed a lot of
exceptional things,'' Smith said. ``His quickness, his elusiveness.
I threw one up there and I was impressed with the way he went up
and got it. That was something I didn't know he could do. Don't
forget about Darnay Scott and some of our other guys. We've got
receivers. We've got runners and blockers. Our defense is better.
There is great hope here.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick said: ``I know how to play this game. I'm ready to play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he will, immediately, as a starter. Coslet said that maybe
the rest of the Bengals can learn what it takes to be champion from
Warrick, who was dominant at the collegiate level in leading
Florida State to the national championship last year. Coslet
believes that Smith has that edge, too, that feel and style of a
champion. Smith is being given the ball and the team. Run it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith played in seven games and started four last season before
missing the last eight games with a toe injury. After the Bengals'
0-4 start, he made his first start against the Cleveland Browns and
won. Smith has been in Cincinnati since Feb. 14 working with Ken
Anderson, the team's offensive coordinator. Smith said he will be
there for most of the off-season. ``I'm not going anywhere for a
while,'' he said. ``Basically, they are putting the franchise in my
hands. I'm excited but I also know there is pressure that comes
with being given the ball. I'm going through this locker room every
day trying get people on board and help get the ones out of here
who don't want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has made changes. Bigger planes for travel. Breakfast is
now served to the players and a PlayStation game for them to enjoy
is available near the locker room. The new stadium and new practice
fields are adjacent. So the Bengals now have some of it little
things that several NFL teams have long offered.
</P>
<P>
   But, receiver Tim McGee said: ``You can sleep in silk pajamas,
but that doesn't guarantee you go out and create havoc on the
field. It's about leadership and accountability. We're going to get
behind Akili and build that.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Keep debt reduction atop U.S. agenda
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Wednesday's Atlanta
Constitution.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whichever spot on the political spectrum you occupy,
you ought to be delighted by a report this week from the Treasury
Department that it expects to pay down the national debt by a
record $216 billion by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the $88 billion paid down in 1999 and the $51
billion paid down in 1998, and it means that in a mere three years
the federal government will have reduced what had once seemed a
permanent, ever-enlarging burden by $355 billion. In other words,
thanks to three straight budget surpluses, the administration is
cutting the U.S. debt owed to the public in bonds and other
securities by nearly 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly President Clinton's goal of paying off the national
debt by 2013 and extending the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare doesn't seem so farfetched after all _ not as long as
Washington adheres to policies that encourage growth, dampen
inflation and resist self-indulgences like overgenerous tax cuts or
extravagant spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently 13 cents of every dollar in government spending goes
to pay interest on the national debt. Only a few years ago,
government economists forecast that Uncle Sam might be paying
double that figure in 2013. Now it appears that with discipline and
good economic luck, the interest charge may be zero in a little
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Steadfastness in paying down the federal debt will free up funds
on private money markets for fresh capital investment at reasonable
interest rates, the surest way for national policy-makers to help
the U.S. economy keep firing on all cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, both major presidential candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, aren't nearly as
committed to driving down the debt as they should be. Gore is fuzzy
on the topic while Bush places too high a priority on a massive tax
cut. A concerned public needs to insist the two of them take the
pledge to prioritize debt reduction and sign it in black _ not red
_ ink.

<P>
   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

ECONOMIC SCENE: EARNED-INCOME TAX CREDIT IS A RARE WELFARE-REFORM
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   J. Bradford DeLong is a professor of economics at the University of
California at Berkeley and co-editor of The Journal of Economic
Perspective  
 By J. BRADFORD DeLONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1990s began with a burst of intellectual and political
energy in support of genuine welfare reform. By the beginning of
the decade mainstream political opinion had finally coalesced
around the idea that the welfare system based on Aid to Families
with Dependent Children _ cash payments to nonworking single
mothers _ was a failure. Welfare recipients remained very poor, the
incentives the system gave them were horrible, and the lessons
implicitly taught about responsibility and opportunity were
destructive.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed better, according to the consensus of opinion makers,
to make a big push to shift people from welfare to work. The idea
was to bolster the wages of low-skilled workers, to provide
training programs so that long-term AFDC recipients could build
enough skills to escape the system and to offer job-search
assistance so that they could find employers who would pay for
those skills. Such an extensive welfare overhaul would be more
expensive for the government than would simple cash grants to
nonworking single mothers, but to many liberals and conservatives,
it seemed worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 welfare reform of Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole and Bill
Clinton, however, largely dropped the ball. Instead of making a big
push on training and job searching, it basically gave each state a
blank check _ roughly equal to the money the federal government had
formerly spent on welfare _ to spend as it saw fit. A few states
have used their money to do remarkable and innovative things. But a
lot more have paid lip-service to the goal of reform, and used
large chunks of the federal money for programs that the state
budget used to pay for, reducing rather than increasing the total
amount of money spent to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   True, the number of people on welfare has dropped significantly.
But in spite of a booming economy, the incomes of the poor have not
risen significantly. Very little money has been spent on building
skills. Little has been devoted to providing assistance in finding
jobs. No one knows but everyone fears what will happen to America's
single-parent poor when the boom ends and the next recession
begins.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of the original welfare reform program, however, was
quietly put into place in 1993, as part of President Clinton's
deficit-reduction program. And unlike the 1996 law, it may prove to
be the most enduring and effective anti-poverty instrument the
federal government has ever devised.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument is the earned-income tax credit. In 1993 the
government significantly expanded the already-existing program so
that it now gives a family with two children a 40-cent payment from
the IRS for every dollar of income earned up to $9,500. A part-time
$8-an-hour job thus becomes, after taxes, an $11.20 an hour job for
the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit means that a two-child family with a full-time
minimum-wage worker is lifted _ just barely _ above the poverty
line. Two economists at the Economic Policy Institute (epinet.org),
Max Sawicky and Robert Cherry have found that more than five of six
families eligible for the tax credit actually collect it, and that
the credit manages to push more families above the poverty line
than any other government program.
</P>
<P>
   Is the earned-income tax credit perfect? No. But, like
democracy, it is better than any of the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are three standard criticisms of the program: It is a
subsidy to low-wage employers, and low-wage employers should be
discouraged; it penalizes working-class two-earner families; and it
is overly bureaucratic and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The first criticism seems completely wide of the mark. If we
want to raise the wages of the working poor, we want to see a lot
of employers competing to hire them. To provide subsidies to
employers of low-wage labor is to raise their numbers and so
increase the bargaining power of low-wage workers in the labor
market.
</P>
<P>
   The second criticism has a point. As the income of a two-child
family increases from $12,500, to $30,850, it gradually loses its
$3,816 tax credit. When this reduction is combined with the 15.3
percent Social Security wage tax paid by both employee and employer
and the payment of income tax at a 15 percent rate, the burden on
American families earning $28,000 ends up with them paying the
highest marginal federal tax rates of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   An easy way to make the earned-income tax credit a better
program would be to reduce the speed with which the credit is
phased-out as income rises. But that takes money. Politicians are
almost always more excited about seeing their signature on some new
initiative than about improving effective but existing programs.
Moreover, the political leaders who made the credit their signature
initiative _ former Sens. Russell Long and Lloyd Bentsen in
particular _ are mostly long gone from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And the third criticism has a point as well. The earned-income
tax credit is a social insurance program administered by the IRS,
an agency whose core mission does not involve lifting the incomes
of the working poor. Moreover, the tax credit's details are
unnecessarily complex: the family as defined by the earned-income
tax credit is not necessarily the family as defined by the rest of
the tax code, and the income concept that determines whether you
qualify for the program is not necessarily the income that appears
anywhere else on your tax form.
</P>
<P>
   But this flaw could be overcome with relatively modest changes.
Cherry and Sawicky have made a proposal to fix it by simplifying
the tax credit and combining it with other child-centered tax
provisions into a universal unified child credit.
</P>
<P>
   Most important of all, even if nothing is done to improve the
program right away, the validity of these criticisms should not
blot out the tax credit's broad success: $32 billion a year
channeled to 15 million working poor and lower-middle class
families to increase their real wages and make work pay.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder whether the training and skill-building and job-search
components of the original 1990s welfare reform dream would now be
regarded as equal successes, had they been undertaken, too.

HARVARD MED TO PARTICIPATE IN AETNA WEB HEALTH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School has agreed to provide consumer
health-care information to Aetna US Healthcare's InteliHealth Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna hopes to draw on the school's expertise to broaden its Web
site, www.intelihealth.com, including more information targeting
minority consumers and the health needs of children.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to be completed
within the next several weeks, were not disclosed. A spokesman said
Monday the medical school does not intend to take an ownership
stake in InteliHealth.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School will replace Johns Hopkins University,
which since 1996 has offered consumer advice, reviews, and articles
written by InteliHealth staff. The relationship ended shortly after
Aetna announced plans to expand its Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future business interests were not going in the same
direction,'' said Steve Libowitz, director of Hopkins' office of
consumer health information.
</P>
<P>
   Libowitz declined to elaborate, but health-care analyst Ken
Abramowitz speculated that Johns Hopkins, which had owned a
minority stake in InteliHealth, did not want to invest more money
in the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually disputes involve two issues: money or capability,''
said Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.
``I suspect that Johns Hopkins did not want to put more money in.''
</P>
<P>
   The InteliHealth Web site has more than 1 million visitors each
month and licensing agreements with more than 400 broadcast, print,
and other media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Internet business, attracting more visitors and
revenue does not necessarily lead to profits. And so far,
health-care sites like Drkoop.com have struggled with ballooning
losses and wary investors. Aetna does not release InteliHealth's
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear whether there's a sustainable business model in
putting up large numbers of advertisements and providing free
information,'' said Dr. William Hersh, head of the medical
informatics division at Oregon Health Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and other insurers, however, may have a better shot at
becoming large providers of online health-care information, Hersh
said. Unlike sites like Drkoop.com, they can provide consumers with
more services and products.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say both insurers and their content
providers, like Harvard Medical School, will need to be careful to
avoid potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me this represents potential good, in a
sense that more information is made available to the lay public,''
said Benjamin Moulton, executive director of the American Society
of Law, Medicine &AMP; Ethics. ``But it also represents some conflict
issues that should be well thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Gibbons, a spokesman for Harvard Medical School, said the
school will have ``strict editorial content'' and control over the
placement of advertisements next to its name.
</P>
<P>
   At Johns Hopkins University, professors, nurses and doctors
reserved the right to review and correct any inaccuracies in
Intelihealth's articles.

CABLE MODEM ADS IRRITATING EXCITEATHOME  
 BY TODD WALLACK  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pacific Bell claims that some people find its new ``Web Hog''
television ads so funny that they're asking for copies on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is laughing at ExciteAtHome, the country's largest
provider of cable modems, which claims the ads are misleading. The
Redwood City-based company sent a letter to Pac Bell last week
threatening to sue unless it pulls the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, designed to promote Pac Bell's speedy Internet service
over phone lines, focus on an idyllic neighborhood where residents
start signing up for superfast Internet service over cable TV
lines, like the type offered by ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the service works great, the ads report. But as more
people sign up _ all using shared TV lines _ the cable modem
service slows to a crawl, and the once friendly neighbors turn on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web hog!'' a group of kids yell at a middle-aged neighbor
working on his lawn. ``No. You're the Web hog!'' he shouts back.
One neighbor pours water into a neighbor's car. Others paint
garages and trucks with words like ``Log off'' and ``Web hog.'' The
ads end with the tag line: ``Get Pacific Bell DSL. Always fast.
Never shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell points out that its service uses telephone lines, which
run separately from each home to a nearby switching office. But
ExciteAtHome uses cable television lines, which are all connected,
much like a party line.
</P>
<P>
   But cable proponents say they can easily split a cable network _
called a node _ into smaller pieces as more users sign up.
</P>
<P>
   And even with DSL, once telephone lines reach the central
switching office, e-mail and other Internet traffic are all merged
together, just like cable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pacific Bell's own service agreement warns: ``Pacific
Bell ... operates on shared resources. Excessive use or abuse of
these shared network resources by one customer may have a negative
impact on all other customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Allison Bowman said, ``We believe that
the ads are misleading to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ExciteAtHome quietly fired off a letter to Pacific
Bell President Bill Blase, demanding the telephone company yank the
ad, according to people familiar with the matter. In the letter,
signed by ExciteAtHome executive Byron Smith, ExciteAtHome said it
``may consider legal action'' if Pac Bell didn't pull or change the
ads. (Pac Bell hadn't received the letter as of yesterday, the
company said.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ExciteAtHome executives are exploring lodging a
complaint with a group like the National Advertising Division, the
arm of the Better Business Bureau that helps sift through false
advertising complaints, one person said. Spokeswoman Melissa Walia
said she couldn't comment on either action.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Pac Bell says ExciteAtHome is just thin-skinned
because the ads zero in on a key problem with cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're upset because it's effective,'' said Pac Bell
spokesman John Britton.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the bottom line is that both services are similar.
PC World magazine couldn't find any major differences in speed in
its tests, according to this month's issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it is more or less the same,'' said Yankee Group
analyst Fritz McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome admits there have occasionally been slowdowns in
some neighborhoods, such as in Fremont, but says such problems are
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Calic, president of Fremont's cable modem group, said he
thinks the ads are largely ``accurate, but not the whole story.''
He added, though, that he thought the ads are ``very, very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell has also had its own service problems. At least twice
in recent months, the company has acknowledged that e-mail has been
backed up for hours or days because its mail computers were
swamped.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear, though, how a judge would rule if the dispute
actually wound up in court.
</P>
<P>
   First, ExciteAtHome would have to prove that the ads are false.
But that depends on how you interpret the ad. Pac Bell claims the
ads just focus on the neighborhood level where DSL runs over
separate phone lines, but cable doesn't. ExciteAtHome claims the ad
misleads people into thinking DSL offers a direct connection to Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases where it is not a straightforward
inquiry,'' said Andrew Schau, a New York lawyer who has handled
false advertising cases. He said the case would turn on how viewers
interpret the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pac Bell says the ads have been running in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego since March. SBC
Communications, Pac Bell's parent company, also started running the
ads in Texas and Missouri last month. ``It's not a case where we
will just run it a couple times,'' said Beth Kachellek, SBC's
executive director for advertising.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Just south of a park called Dreamland on an
abandoned airfield surrounded by slums, Edward Soeryadjaya is
testing the Internet's powers of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   In a country dominated by corporate dynasties, Soeryadjaya is
famous as the scion who broke his family's bank and cost his family
the car company his father founded in 1957, Astra International.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Soeryadjaya (pronounced sir-ya-JAI-ah) has returned to the
corporate stage as a high-technology entrepreneur planning to build
a stable of dot-coms and turn Jakarta's old airport into
Indonesia's Silicon Valley. In the process, he wants not only to
resurrect a fallow property investment but also to prove at last
that he was an unwitting pawn of politics and to help restore his
family's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting my future at stake,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I believe that information technology, as an enabler
for the Indonesian nation, is in line with the development of
technology in the world and has a very good future.''
</P>
<P>
   His vehicle is PT CyberCity Indonesia, a holding company with
what he calls a ``bag of goodies,'' which he hopes will attract
$76.5 million in new investments before listing by year-end. Inside
the bag are stakes in an Internet service, two Web portals, an
incubator for Net-related businesses, a multimedia academy and a
7.5-acre sliver of a 109-acre piece of overgrown airport that he
hopes to turn into a high-technology commercial and residential
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clicks and bricks,'' Soeryadjaya intoned in his sonorous
Indonesian drawl. He says he already has a heavy list of backers,
including the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan, as well
as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of naysayers, however, many of whom point
to Soeryadjaya's reputation for financial misfortune. ``I'm always
skeptical about whatever Edward does,'' said Manggi T. Habir,
president of the credit-rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   While the Soeryadjayas' influence with Indonesia's new
government has spurred criticism, some skeptics wonder about
Soeryadjaya's high-technology connections. They question the
seriousness of a project that, despite claiming to have set up at
least five different ventures, has yet to establish a corporate Web
site. CyberCity, they say, is more about bailing out a $50 million
project Soeryadjaya was in charge of developing on the site of the
old Kemayoran domestic airport before the colossal failure of the
bank he ran, Bank Summa, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya is not the only Asian tycoon to become a pioneer of
the new economy. Though brash unknowns have won many of America's
new fortunes, the high-technology start-up scene in Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand is dominated by the rich and
powerful. Skeptics say it is a sign of how much buzz surrounds the
Internet; in Asia, as elsewhere, there is nothing like an Internet
play to give an old-economy stock a new shine. Others say it is a
symptom of economies in which wealth is still tightly concentrated
and local capital markets are developing too slowly to fuel the
speedy growth of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of entrepreneurs who want to start up but
don't have resources,'' said Vasant Chatikavanij, executive vice
president of Loxinfo, a Thai Internet service owned by his family's
conglomerate. ``They end up selling themselves cheap. They sell to
companies like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia may seem an unlikely venue for dot-com mania. Most
bankers and economists will not even discuss its Internet
potential. This, after all, is a country whose government still
depends on the International Monetary Fund to make ends meet, where
a personal computer costs nearly twice the average annual income.
Only 4 of every 1,000 Indonesians use the Internet, according to
International Data Corp., compared with 14 of every 1,000 Asians
overall. Most people do not even have a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and Internet entrepreneurs like Soeryadjaya say such
statistics show the market's promise. Indonesia, the world's
fourth-most-populous nation, already has more Internet users than
Singapore, and millions of wealthy urban residents with money to
spend online. New and cheaper ways of connecting to the Internet,
like television set-top boxes and mobile phones, they say, will
quickly extend the Net to more of Indonesia's 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large market coming out of the crisis that has
spending potential,'' said Jonathan Morris, 26, a Bostonian who
dropped out of the Harvard Business School a year and a half ago to
start Indonesia's most popular Web site, astaga.com.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya, 51, comes to the Internet world with more business
experience _ and, some say, more baggage. The eldest son of William
Soeryadjaya, a respected businessman who built Astra from a small
importer of diesel generators into a $2.4 billion automotive giant,
Edward Soeryadjaya started out as a salesman at an Astra unit. He
then ventured into finance, first with a bank in Germany and later
a finance company in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he bought a small Indonesian bank, renamed it Bank
Summa and expanded rapidly though the Summa Group. By 1991, Bank
Summa was one of the country's largest private banks, with about $1
billion in assets, most in the form of loans to Summa companies and
much of that for property investments.
</P>
<P>
   One such investment was the $50 million Jakarta International
Trade Fair Corp., a joint venture of Soeryadjaya's Griya Nusantara
Pratama, the Indonesian State Secretariat, Jakarta's city
government and a group of Japanese investors. The corporation was
to develop 109 acres of the sprawling old Kemayoran airport, which
had closed in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1990, Indonesia adopted a tight fiscal policy, and
Summa's world began to unravel. The property market tanked, and
Bank Summa was faced with $303 million in losses in 1991.
Soeryadjaya's father moved in to bail Summa out, removing his son
as chairman and pledging Astra shares against the bank's
obligations. The more he struggled to prop the bank up, the lower
Astra's share price sank and the deeper Bank Summa's hole grew. By
late 1992, the central bank closed Summa amid a depositor run. To
help meet the bank's $690 million in liabilities, the Soeryadjayas
relinquished virtually their entire 76 percent stake in Astra to
several businessmen close to President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   That is only half the story, according to a version of events
that Soeryadjaya said could be told only now that Suharto has
fallen. The government set him up, he said, by encouraging him to
lend, only to later impose restrictions and then remove government
pension funds from Bank Summa to precipitate its collapse. He said
his father would eventually spell out who was behind the intrigue
in a tell-all biography. ``I blame ourselves for being naive,''
Soeryadjaya said. ``We refused to be a crony.''
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya suggested he was victimized because his first wife,
who died of cancer the year the family lost Astra, was the daughter
of President Sukarno, whom Suharto ousted in 1965. Astra had long
been uncharacteristically independent of the Suharto clan. Suharto
was reportedly less than appreciative when, in mid-1990 Bank Summa
built a network of banks for rural Muslim communities with a
powerful cleric named Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wahid is Indonesia's president, the Suhartos are fending
off prosecutors, and the Soeryadjayas are rebuilding. In 1998,
Edward Soeryadjaya was reinstated as a board member of Jakarta
International Trade Fair. Last December, his father was named
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The family's comeback has forced Wahid to counter accusations
that the Soeryadjayas have become neocronies. Last month, the
president sold his stake in the Muslim finance company he set up
with Soeryadjaya in mid-1990 after it bought a stake in Mandiri
Inti Finance, a company Edward Soeryadjaya took control of last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Mandiri was trying to raise funds for a last-minute bid to buy
back the Soeryadjayas' stake in Astra _ it was on the block after
being seized from the indebted cronies who had bought it seven
years earlier _ before the government sold it to a Singapore-led
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya denies trying to capitalize on his presidential
connections. ``If I were doing it, why didn't I do it before, when
we were fighting for our existence?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mandiri Inti Finance changed its name to Siwani
Trimitra and said it would start raising funds for CyberCity. But
most of Soeryadjaya's Internet deals have so far been conducted by
L&AMP;M Group Investments, a financially troubled engineering company
in Singapore, which Soeryadjaya's younger brother, Edwin, ended up
controlling after taking over a different Singapore company.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Soeryadjaya remains listed as L&AMP;M's deputy chairman and
his father is chairman; Edward Soeryadjaya became a member of the
board last year and, after slowly building up his stake in the
company, was named chief executive last month.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the tangled shareholdings and cross-shareholdings
that make Indonesian business so nebulous, L&AMP;M owns part of
CyberCity together with Jakarta International Trade Fair and
Soeryadjaya's own Griya Nusantara Pratama, which still owns part of
Jakarta International. Just how much of CyberCity each owns,
Soeryadjaya said, is ``now being arbitrarily decided.'' CyberCity,
in turn, owns only a portion of the five Internet-related ventures
it is involved in.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, L&AMP;M's stock has become a proxy on the project. It
rose 20 percent in November when L&AMP;M announced that MyWeb Inc.com,
an American set-top box maker, would take a 10 percent stake in
CyberCity and help build an Internet service in Indonesia, then
fell 8 percent when the deal fell apart a month later. Soon
afterward, when L&AMP;M said it was in talks to replace MyWeb with
Microsoft, the stock shot up more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   L&AMP;M's share price has drifted down about 28 percent this year,
tracking the decline of Asia's stock markets. But L&AMP;M has also been
dogged by concerns about whether partnerships will materialize. The
company has announced that Singapore Telecommunications' Internet
unit, SingNet, is considering a 30 percent stake in CyberCity, and
that Detecon Marketing Consulting, unit of Deutsche Telekom, will
buy 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, L&AMP;M said it had signed a memorandum of understanding
with SingTel to help develop CyberCity but gave no details. Detecon
said it was in talks but that no deal had yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In February, L&AMP;M finally signed a deal with Microsoft _ not to
take a stake in CyberCity but rather to help build a news and
information Web site in return for a share of revenues the site
generates. The site is scheduled to start this month. The only
CyberCity venture that appears to be up and running is the Jakarta
Multimedia Academy, which L&AMP;M established with Malaysian Technology
Development, a government-owned venture capital concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support CyberCity fully, but we're still waiting for
something to be realized,'' said Pandji Choesin, executive director
of the Indonesian Association of Internet Service Providers.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya wants to sell a 50 percent stake in CyberCity for
$26.5 million by June 28, when he plans to officially introduce it
at an Internet trade show at Kemayoran. He hopes to raise another
$50 million by the end of the year, despite the fact that there are
still no revenue projections for the group. ``From June 28 onward,
I trust that the price tag of our company will be in excess of $100
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a big capital buildup might not be unusual for an Internet
start-up, but it would represent an especially neat turnaround for
Jakarta International Trade Fair's original airport investment.
</P>
<P>
   Property analysts say prices in Jakarta have fallen at least 50
percent the last 10 years, though with no sales anywhere in two
years it is hard to tell. Soeryadjaya said CyberCity was valuing
its 7.5-acre property at $5 million, a price that would make
Jakarta International's entire 109-acre spread at Kemayoran worth
around $73 million _ a 46 percent paper profit.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya rejects criticism that his high-technology vision is
a property deal in disguise, though he does not deny that CyberCity
could be good for the local real estate market. ``We know we have
to push it as a cyber initiative because that's where most of the
funds are basing their decisions,'' he said. ``We're not cheating
anybody.''

 BOOK EXPLAINS COMPUTER MYSTERIES   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're the type who does poorly with a computer, but does
well when reading a textbook, there may be hope lurking in
``Computer Friendly!''
</P>
<P>
   This 96-page book is written in easy-to-understand language. It
shuns computer terms until it can explain what they mean to the
reader.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, it has a little exercise so readers will know if
they're getting things right. One example: ``When would you use the
following options? Shut down; restart; stand by.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can correctly answer those situations, know how to remove
and copy files, and can change desktop options, you'll probably
find Computer Friendly a little too friendly for your skill level.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, you'd like to make better use of the
control panel _ or understand why it's there in the first place _
Computer Friendly can provide the guidance to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course assumes the reader never had any computer
experience,'' said a publicist for the author, Raymond Steinbacher.
He's a 34-year-old Web page designer and former manager of a
software department for a retail chain. While selling software one
day, Steinbacher found himself talking to Ernest Weckesser,
president of Green Tree Press Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond combined the two elements of genuine helpfulness I'd
been seeking for years: simple explanations and plain English,''
wrote Weckesser in the forward to the book published by Green Tree.
``It was just a matter of time until I realized that here was the
one guy most qualified to write and develop a truly basic computer
course; something we'd been wanting to publish here at Green Tree
for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in February 1999 and has sold nearly
500,000 copies. It's available directly from the publisher for
$15.95, shipping included. For more information: Green Tree Press,
3603 W. 12th St., Erie, Pa. 16505. Tollfree: 800-834-3888.

<P>
   HOAX BUSTER
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't true that the Federal Communications Commission is
going to end religious broadcasting on radio and television. No, it
is not true that you need to forward the e-mail about Petition
Number 2493 to all the people you know.
</P>
<P>
   Any time you see the words ``to all the people you know,'' or
``to as many people as possible,'' or ``everyone in your address
book,'' think: Hoax.
</P>
<P>
   This hoax about the FCC and religious broadcasts has been going
on for nearly 25 years. And while there indeed was a petition
numbered 2493, it did not have anything to do with banning
religious broadcasts. And the petition was not filed by atheist
Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who disappeared mysteriously in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was filed by two attorneys (neither were connected
with O'Hair or any of her followers) who asked the FCC to
disqualify religiously affiliated organizations and institutions
from broadcasting on channels reserved for noncommercial education.
The petition was turned down in August 1975, with the FCC saying it
could take no position on religion.
</P>
<P>
   That was the end of it. But the FCC still receives a dozen or so
protests a day against the petition _ a number that increases
around Easter and Christmas, when the e-mail makes its rounds on
the Internet and into conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it true that the Cat4'lic church is trying to collect
signatures against the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take on a life of their own,'' a church spokesman
told a reporter last year. ``I'm sure anybody who passes the (FCC
rumor) on, they mean well ... It's just that they've fallen prey to
a hoax.''

 &HT;    Bringing home the bacon a brand new way
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They've done it. They have finally done it. They have
come up with a gimmick to lure men into grocery shopping. It's
called shopping for groceries using Priceline.com, a kind of
win-win lottery that turns buying diapers into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, familiar to many of us as the outfit that
auctions airplane seats and hotel rooms, has a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo here in metro Atlanta,
Priceline now has us bidding for baby carrots, live lobsters and
Folgers coffee.
</P>
<P>
   I can testify that just a little time and practice has me
trimming 25 percent and more off food and grocery items and having
a lot more fun than sitting on the floor clipping coupons.
</P>
<P>
   There are several online approaches to shopping _ some, like
Peapod and Webvan, aimed at meeting the needs of busy, working
households. The Priceline service, however, focusing on cost
saving, addresses the pocketbook issue that is precious to many
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process struck me at first as kind of clunky and slow,
even on my speedy computer, but with some practice _ and
considerable savings _ I warmed up. Saving money makes you patient,
and while it has limitations and is not the whole answer to grocery
shopping, the Priceline game clearly could gain fans among the
computer crowd _ especially those whose minds may not turn to
groceries until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in a ``guy'' way, I figured the smartest approach
to this grocery auction business was to go for the commodities, the
big-ticket items that are consumed heavily _ the detergents, paper
towels, toilet tissue and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea. I bid successfully for three 92-ounce boxes of
Tide at $3.55 each and three triple-roll packages of Brawny paper
towels at $1.57 each, which experienced shoppers will recognize as
a saving of nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   Getting bolder, I went for an immediate need, kitty litter, and
wrestled away three 14-pound containers of Tidy Cats Scoop Cat
Litter for $4.52 each, though they sold off the shelf for about
$6.50.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll, I have now gone for coffee, juices and bottled water.
I'm even eyeing those live lobsters. What fun!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   First you take out a membership, obtain a Priceline card and
submit a credit or debit card that is stored in the system's
memory, allowing you to pay online, in advance, for items as you
strike deals.
</P>
<P>
   Then you go to the main shopping page and begin compiling your
shopping list, cruising the cyber-aisles and making choices. When
you select an item, the bargaining begins with a pop-up screen that
offers three or more brands, all of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you the going shelf-price range of the items and
invites your bid, advising that you have a ``great chance'' to get
your choice with an offer of 85 percent of the list price. It's a
good chance at 66 percent, a fair chance at 50 percent and a poor
chance at 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing rejection, you tend to go high as a beginner, but later
you take chances and learn that if you are rejected at a low price,
you can always inch back upward.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement comes when you have compiled your list and
submitted the collective bids.
</P>
<P>
   A suspenseful minute passes as an on-screen display that looks
like a slot machine spins, alternating ``yes'' and ``sorry'' next
to each item, and then finally the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   You confirm your acceptance of the sales prices; your bank
account or charge card, as you prefer, is automatically debited,
then out prints your shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   You then go to the store, pick up your items from the shelf,
where you can see plainly how much you saved on each, and then you
check out, running your Priceline card through the slot. It
dutifully reports you have already paid.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick up your groceries, you begin to learn how and why
this is worthwhile for the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   First, I have never picked up the items without also picking up
other items that catch my eye. So luring me into the store results
automatically in additional sales, either from impulse or from me
remembering empty spots on the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not for everybody. It is very slow and
time-consuming at times. Many favorite brands or product sizes are
not offered, even though they are in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that battle to limit yourself to the bargains,
and the fight not to give in to picking up additional impulse
items. But there is appeal, a novelty, that could catch on. But
what's the reasoning behind the grocery auction?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Brown, senior vice president of the Washington-based Food
Marketing Institute, gives a grocer's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about going after all the types of customers out there,''
she said. ``It's about searching for ways to help and enhance a
shopping experience, using all of the technologies and other
approaches at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While many consumers are drawn to the convenience of Peapod and
Webvan, services that deliver goods to the home at a price, others
are interested in bottom-line savings, as reflected in the ardent
pursuit of discount coupons in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline approach, which is being adopted in partnership
with supermarket chains all across the country, adds a bit of the
glitz and glamour of gamesmanship, tapping into an experience that
many online shoppers recognize from eBay and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose organization represents supermarkets and online
retail services, says the Priceline service is one of many
experiments in progress as the volume-sensitive grocery business
struggles to build traffic in stores and online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing in retail as the average customer,''
Brown said, ``but we do what we can to pull together all of the
segments.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the cost of the bargains to the retailers?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the cost is being borne now by wholesalers and
retailers in an effort to build the volume, though there are
obvious questions about how long the sizable discounts can last.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodgett, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, says he is
optimistic about Priceline's possibilities in near term but wonders
what will happen when the ``grand opening'' sale runs its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the
consumers won't be getting such a great deal,'' Blodgett said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that all seems far away. For now, let's go after those
live lobsters for next weekend!

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 &HT;    An eBay trip offers lots of information for browsers
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether you do it online or at a real-world flea
market, there's nothing quite like the thrill of buying something
you want and not having to pay full price for it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a discount clothing chain that uses the slogan
``Everybody loves a bargain.'' At the moment, some of the hottest
sites on the Web are auction sites that let you bid on anything
from vintage china and dolls to airline tickets and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions bring the thrills and chills of bidding on rare
and unique items to people who used to think auctions were all
about society matrons in mink and pearls bidding on impressionist
paintings in fancy New York auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. You don't have to be a millionaire to go
online and bid on everything from vintage Wedgwood china to compact
discs. Bargains abound, and for novice collectors it can be
educational, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one example: Not too long ago, I went to a flea market
and bought a set of vintage china for what I was pretty sure was an
outstanding bargain.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine was more skeptical. ``You should get on eBay
and see what it's really worth,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   I went straight to eBay the first chance I had. I scrolled
through three pages of pictures and descriptions of my new china.
Judging by the auctioneers' prices and the current bids, I'm happy
to say I did get a pretty good deal.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly when Web auctioneer eBay (www.ebay.com)
became the last word on flea market bargains. However, there is no
doubt that eBay was one of the founders of the ``name your price''
craze sweeping the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just this past week eBay showed Wall Street that
there's gold in all those pages of what may look like junk.
First-quarter operating results for the online auctioneer exceeded
expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its site
surpassed $77 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of Fiestaware.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to eBay in a while, this might be a good
time to take another look. The site has been completely redesigned
to make the virtual flea market experience much easier than it used
to be. Users can click on a tab called ``gallery'' in their
selected area and just view pictures and current bids on the items
they are interested in. You can find out what a certain collectible
is going for on the eBay market or just browse the selection of
goods available.
</P>
<P>
   This is much better than the old eBay, which was just a text
list. You took a chance that the item you clicked on would be
something you might want. This was time-consuming and, unless you
were a very serious collector, not that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The new method lets you see the dishes, watches, oriental rugs
or whatever captures your fancy before you decide to find out more
about the item or even place a bid.
</P>
<P>
   While I was making sure my flea market china was truly a
bargain, I also learned a lot about my new china as I read the
descriptions the sellers posted with their items. Some of the
auctioneers were dealers who had shops in cities and towns across
the country and offered links to related sites, collectors' clubs
and other points of interest. If you want to begin a collection,
eBay can help you learn about various items and how much you can
expect to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Passing time on eBay doesn't have to be about shopping. It's a
great place to play your own at-home version of the hot PBS series
``Antiques Roadshow.'' Here's all you have to do: Find an item in
your house you think might be worth some money. Then head over to
eBay to see if there is a matching category for your collectible.
</P>
<P>
   You might be pleasantly surprised, as was my friend Alex after
browsing eBay's Beatles section. To her great surprise, she found
that a book about making the film ``A Hard Day's Night,'' which she
had bought in a dollar store, is fetching nearly $50 on eBay. Think
about that the next time you see a bin of remaindered books.
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you have a couple of million or just a couple of
hours, online auctions can teach you about fine art or oriental
rugs or just help you figure out how much that strange bowl in your
grandmother's living room is really worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's e-commerce with a kick.

 &HT;    Office 2000 shows Microsoft's prowess
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While I do not expect to lose any sleep wondering what
will become of Microsoft, I will say this for Bill and his Merry
Men and Women: They have given us some pretty fine software.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over Office 2000, and the portions of it that I use
regularly, it is undoubtedly the best collection of the standard
programs available today.
</P>
<P>
   Take FrontPage, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   I've been through most of the Web creation programs on the
market. The really simple ones are capable of creating only really
simple Web sites _ usually the one-page kind your children might
wish to set up. A couple of pictures, ``Hi! I'm Eric! I Love The
X-Files!'' _ that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated ones are, in my experience, a very mixed
bag. I put up a fairly complicated site using Symantec's Virtual
Page, and it was a chore. Strange things occurred _ like huge gaps
between one line of text and the other _ for reasons I could never
determine.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all _ and this is not all the fault of Virtual Page, by
any means _ the site looked entirely different depending on which
browser you used to examine it. It usually looked better in
Microsoft Internet Explorer. As a result, after years of resisting
attempts to shove Explorer down my throat, I began using it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   When Office 2000 arrived, I pulled all the elements of my site
into FrontPage and worked on picture alignment, so difficult in
Virtual Page that I just about gave up using pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot better now, although there are still some
discrepancies between browsers. That, I fear, is unavoidable. But
FrontPage is, as far as I'm concerned, head and shoulders above the
rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Word will certainly remain my high-powered writing program, too
_ although I must admit that WordPad meets 98 percent of the
requirements I'm ever likely to have. Most people who write, I
believe, do not make huge demands on a writing program. (I'm trying
to avoid the accursed phrase ``word processor'' here. Food may need
processing; words do not.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, what is there beyond cut and paste, paste and drag,
find and replace, spellcheck and undo? Well, it's fun to play with
fonts once in a while, put things in italics and look at print
preview to make sure you got it all on one page, but the rest of a
huge program like Word is used primarily by secretaries, and people
like professors and researchers who must write formal papers for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The big thing in Word 2000 seems to be foreign languages. You
can set it up to write in a huge number of languages and to
translate between them, too. And, with a nod to those writers with
special needs, when you choose New under the File menu, you can
find a vast array of choices in addition to good old Blank Page.
</P>
<P>
   Writing a report? You can choose among Contemporary Report,
Elegant Report and Professional Report. I have no idea what you
must do if you want an elegant, contemporary, professional report
all in one.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legal pleading wizard to help you through the
construction of a legal pleading. Unfortunately, no simple begging
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   So I suppose there's still room for improvement.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Nyko's Viper PSX ($30; www.nyko.com) is the slickest, most
functional, coolest, highest-tech video game controller on the
market. Any PlayStation gamer without it is underpowered. It comes
in sexy translucent colors, has an auto-fire turbo mode _ useful
for scrolling shooters _ and can function in digital or analog
modes even with games that shouldn't. The only real drawback is
that the cord is a little short and forces one to sit about a foot
closer to the electromagnetic wash of that big screen TV in the
living room. That can't be good for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK, MA, NO WIRES
</P>
<P>
   If your Sony PlayStation controller wires are weaving a tangled
web, try MadCatz's new wireless Dual Force controllers ($40;
www.madcatz.com). These little marvels are easy to set up and a
blast to use. Plug the receiver into the controller port on your
PlayStation and you're good to go. They look and function just like
Sony's Dual Shock controllers but can be configured to function as
a TV remote, allowing you to channel-surf while the game is loading
or to mute the volume when the phone rings. MadCatz's Dual Force
controllers feel good, look cool and function perfectly.

 &HT;    Croc2: Newer isn't always better
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For gaming with kids, the original Croc was a fun romp with lots
of eye candy and a cute little backpack-wearing crocodile. And
though the sequel, Croc2 (Fox Interactive, $20, for PC and
consoles), is fun, some unfortunate changes have robbed the concept
of a lot of its zip. As in the original, Croc must battle little
red imps and an array of cartoonish monsters in a silly-scary but
beautiful 3-D world, whacking them with his tail and a loud
''kerpow!'' Croc2 also adds fun new vehicles such as go-carts and
speedboats, as well as a larger-feeling world. But overall it's a
step down from the straightforward fun of Croc with its misguided
attempt at simplifying the controls _ you simply have less control
_ and annoying conversations with characters that interrupt play.
Also frustrating are bugs that make some simple tasks impossible
and the removal of the original camera controls. The bottom line is
that Croc2 is still a fun game, but somewhere on a corporate
flip-chart at Fox Interactive are a lot of mediocre ideas that
somehow made it into the game.

 &HT;    Based on test version, Windows Millennium's a winner
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few weeks ago, I sat down at my computer to install
still another new version of Windows. This is the version that will
be released later this year to replace Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat there and listened to the hard disk spin and whir, I
realized I was in danger of feeling nostalgic about a computer
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind getting misty-eyed over a sunset or walks on the
beach in Oregon, but I hadn't planned to turn into the kind of guy
who gets warm and tingly over Windows. Truth is, back when I
installed the first version of Windows ever, it was little more
than a poorly done rip-off of the Macintosh operating system. It
would have had to improve greatly to aspire to bad.
</P>
<P>
   But by now I've used all the versions, including Windows 2000,
which is aimed at the business market and was released this year.
Over the years, Windows has gotten better. And the latest version,
Millennium Edition (which ends up with the too-cute nickname of
ME), is the best Windows yet, at least on first impression. Don't
rush to the store yet. It's still a beta, or test, release, but _
to start with a highly technical evaluation _ it works real good.
</P>
<P>
   I installed the test edition of Millennium on my home PC. If
that machine was a human it would need a good therapist. So many
programs have been installed and removed, so many internal changes
have been made, that it crashes more often than the stock market
has lately. So I did not have high hopes when I installed Windows
ME.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that my Frankenstein of a computer has run
flawlessly since that moment. It hasn't frozen or crashed since.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ before I get carried away _ some disclaimers: For
starters, it's impossible to really judge something as complex as a
new edition of Windows after trying it for just a few weeks on a
single computer. And it is possible that a fresh installation of
any operating system would have made things better. But there are
some solid reasons why this new Windows should be more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Windows ME is not a radical departure from Windows 98.
That's good, not bad. Since much of the computer code stayed the
same, programmers were able to refine the way Windows works without
injecting a lot of new programs. For another, this new Windows
incorporates a technology called SFP, System File Protection. This
technology prevents new applications from mistakenly overwriting
old system files _ a fairly common problem _ and that keeps the
system more stable, according to Microsoft. For once, my computer
agrees with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another noticeable advance is the speed with which Windows ME
loads and closes down. That may not seem like a big thing, but in
this instant world, most of us have grown to expect that kind of
response from microwaves, TVs and other gadgets. The reason for
this is technical _ Microsoft got rid of some of the old code used
in DOS operating systems that had hung around past its time _ but
you'll see the difference that has made and like it.
</P>
<P>
   The last item I'll mention may be the most important. Anyone who
has tried to use the interactive help features in Windows 98 will
appreciate this. The suggestions offered for fixing a problem were
often more complicated than the problem itself and could only be
understood by people so technically savvy that they didn't need the
help in the first place. The new interactive help truly does guide
you through fixing many common problems and doesn't start off with
the assumption that you are an honors graduate from MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Windows isn't perfect. But this new version is the most
worthwhile upgrade I've seen in a while. It's especially impressive
that I'm making this judgment based on a beta version of the
program, so _ with any luck at all _ the final shrink-wrap version
that you'll find in stores will be even better.

 &HT;    Web opens new doors for stores
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Going Cyber!''
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting is a bit crooked and hard to make out from a
distance, and yet the sign on the front door of ``The Family
Jewels'' in downtown Decatur, Ga. speaks volumes. Next week, the
13-year-old antiques and collectibles store will become an
online-only operation, joining a host of other businesses for whom
the Internet is the greatest thing to come along since customers
with unlimited lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can move anywhere in the world and I'll always have my
inventory with me,'' enthused owner Lisa Cohen. ``My computer is
the world!''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Jewels isn't going out of business. Only
``shifting,'' according to the hand-lettered sign. It's just one
more sign of these times, when countless business owners are using
the Internet to discover and develop their rightful niche in the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a matter of staying right where they are, offline
and behind a counter. Others, like Cohen, come to see that they and
their customers would be better served by ``going cyber''
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like a beautiful Lalique bowl could sit in the store
for years because maybe only five people who came in knew what it
was and they didn't collect it,'' said Cohen, who's selling on
Yahoo and eBay and will do business by e-mail
(famjewlinc(at)aol.com), and her own Web site
(http://members.aol.com/famjewlinc/collect2/index.htm). ``But I put
it on the Internet and get 500 people who'll see it in seven days
and who'll know what they're looking at.''

 &HT;    Vintage bookstore's horizons expanding
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a mid-17th century Bible for sale and copies
of every Life magazine issue ever printed. Recently, an urgent
request came in for ``any and all pre-1960 poultry books.''
</P>
<P>
   Something interesting's always happening at Atlanta Vintage
Books, though the most intriguing development of late doesn't
involve what's on the shelves: Some of the store's best, most loyal
customers have never set foot in the place.
</P>
<P>
   They're cybershoppers. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they
may be helping rather than hurting independent stores savvy enough
to see venturing onto the Web as one more way of keeping their
doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of the business is steadily growing,'' said Alice
Otten, who took Atlanta Vintage Books online soon after buying the
store four years ago. ``Originally, 20 to 30 percent of our sales
in dollars were over the Internet. That's already up to about 40 to
45 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply a case of customers who once visited the
12-year-old store in search of Santayana or Tom Swift now logging
on instead. Otten said its Internet presence actually allows
Vintage Books, which is renowned for its children's, aviation and
African-American book areas, to reach new customers all over the
world. On a recent Friday morning employee A.R. Swan logged on and
found 21 e-mails waiting to be read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're totally expanding our customer base,'' said
Swan, who is primarily responsible for maintaining Vintage Books'
presence on five Internet sites and responding to e-mail orders and
inquiries. ``Very few of our online sales are to locals, and many
are repeat customers.''
</P>
<P>
   What those Internet shoppers may never get to see is a cozily
eclectic shop where the glass case filled with illuminated
manuscripts lies just beyond bookshelves labeled ``Nazi Germany''
and ``Whales,'' but before ``Success'' and ``Climate.'' Where the
47-volume, circa-1898, English Classics collection of Shakespeare's
works is, alas, not signed by the author, but Suzanne Somers'
poetry book is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Internet users everywhere could react
instantly when a copy of ``The Duke Kahanamoku Story'' recently
washed up at Atlanta Vintage Books. Priced at $65, the bio of the
circa-1920s Olympic gold medal swimmer, early surfer, sometime
movie actor and later, sheriff in his native Honolulu, was sold
within 10 minutes of being listed online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got over 100 calls and e-mails,'' Swan laughingly recalled.
``Surfer guys saying, `Heey dude!,' people from the South Pacific.
I don't think it ever even made it onto the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon _ sometimes called ``clicks-and-mortar,'' refers
to the blending of computer-based sales within traditional
bricks-and-mortar shops. The impact of clicks-and-mortar on used
bookstores is undeniable, helping savvier owners sidestep many of
the problems ``new'' bookstores face from huge Internet and chain
competitors who can outstock them and reach customers around the
world. The number of used bookstores in the United States increased
14 percent between 1995 and 1999, according to a study conducted by
Book Hunter Press; Internet sales ranged from 10 percent to 50
percent of gross sales at stores online during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While media reports have chronicled the Internet's negative
impact on new bookstores, the opposite is the case with used
bookstores,'' the report concluded. ``The Internet has enabled many
used booksellers to expand their customer base to the entire world,
and at the same time, it has provided used bookstores with an
additional revenue stream that supplements their in-store traffic
and other non-Internet mail order sales.'' Instead of relying on
word-of-mouth, expensive catalogs or print ads that may or may not
be seen by customers, used bookstores can join others listing their
stock on searchable sites like Advanced Book Exchange
(www.abe.com), Bibliofind (www.bibliofind.com) or even Internet
uberforce Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Potential drawbacks for ``bricks-and-mortar'' stores include the
time and expense of maintaining their Web site lists and responding
to e-mail, while continuing to run a store. Atlanta Vintage Books
lists the same 5,000-plus books (out of an inventory of about
60,000) on all the sites it uses, including one it just joined at
an annual cost of $185.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only went on there because one of our very good customers,
who we've never met, asked us to,'' Otten explained while Swan
worked through a minor glitch in the first order via that Web site.
``When I looked it up, there were about 35 orders we'd gotten from
(the customer) in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   If clicks-and-mortar operations like Atlanta Vintage Books
ultimately succeed, it likely will be for the most old-fashioned
reason: Customers think they can count on the people who run them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawkins is such a customer. The Greenville, S.C., Top 40
radio disc jockey was referred to Vintage Books by another store. A
collector of volumes in a particular biographical series and by
``Tarzan'' creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, he still goes online
occasionally to do research and look for books. Increasingly,
though, he finds himself dialing the phone to speak directly with
Atlanta Vintage Books manager Carrie Stikeleather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like calling your family and saying `I need this,'''
Hawkins said fondly about the store and staff he has never laid
eyes on. ``Everyone there has been great. I know I can trust
Carrie. If she says I need it, I need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he ever venture to Atlanta, Otten vows, the store will be
there. For her, the Internet could never entirely replace spending
time in a shop where every customer or book is potentially a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to make a lot more money doing this,'' Otten said
on a recent weekday morning when the people in the store included a
woman checking out a book of dog drawings she had seen described
online, and a book ``scout'' offering a carton full of Nabokovs and
Ferlinghettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make a fortune on the Internet and I'd just have to
hire someone to type up orders all day,'' Otten said. ``But that's
not the type of store any of us want.''

   Ask Michael Rothschild, the 47-year-old chief executive of
Maxager and he'll diplomatically answer that many of his young,
techie programmers are ``interesting looking.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to selling Maxager's product, software that
helps industrial companies determine what to bid during Internet
auctions, Rothschild sends out a sales force that's a lot closer to
his age _ people he has recruited from the basic industries that
Maxager serves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his potential customers are themselves middle age and,
while eager to buy or sell industrial goods on the Internet, they
are afraid, Rothschild explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid with the nose ring and crazy hair may do well in our
research labs, but he's not going to allay those fears on the
manufacturing floor.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the new economy rendering obsolete the old pros of
the old economy.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more business-to-business electronic marketplaces
crowd onto the Internet, the selling of goods and services may
often seem to have turned into a youngster's game _ a forum in
which techno-entrepreneurs in their 20s and early 30s are running
the show. And in fact, that perception is pretty accurate when it
comes to writing the software, designing the Web pages and
otherwise building the backbone of those electronic services.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, the young entrepreneurs are recognizing
that, in the same way that their parents often have trouble
comprehending exactly what it is that they do for a living, so do
many of their prospective customers.
</P>
<P>
   And that is particularly true in the so-called b-to-b segment of
the e-commerce world, where the suppliers and purchasing folks that
make up the customer base are often less conversant with HTML and
URL's than they are with the old-economy talk of ``RFQ's'' and
``SKU's'' (Those last two abbreviations refer to ``request for
quotations'' and ``stock-keeping units,'' if any Web-heads ask; and
if they do, the defense rests its case).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the b-to-b dot-coms are scouring the steel mills, the
auto parts companies and other basic industries, looking for people
who can talk the talk that will persuade the target customers to
switch their main transactional mode from the handshake to the
mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 30-year-old who understands the technology is an important
part of the success equation, but it takes a grizzled industry
veteran to persuade corporate buyers to change their entrenched
habits,'' said Andreas W. Eversbusch, the 39-year-old chief
operating officer for EDS CoNext, an electronic corporate
purchasing service owned by Electronic Data Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the ``grizzled veterans'' don't have to be all that
grizzled to qualify as a Mr. or Ms. Outside for an e-commerce
company. By age 32, Diana L. Wright had clocked 10 years in sales
for industrial stalwarts like Honeywell and General Electric before
becoming director of industrial supplies in February for
EqualFooting.com, an online marketplace for industrial supplies and
construction equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as a prospective supplier realizes I have similar
experiences, our conversation goes up to a higher level,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   How does she like being on the dot-com side of the digital
divide? ``I didn't take a pay cut to come here, but I would have,''
she said. ``Things are so rigid in the corporate environment, and
so stimulating here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Diana Wrights of the world are not always easy to find.
Signing on with an e-business is by definition riskier than
sticking it out with a Fortune 500 company. Recent gyrations in
technology stocks have made compensation packages that rely heavily
on stock options _ the dot-com dangling carrot _ seem even more
risky than they did a month or so ago.
</P>
<P>
   And, Wright's enthusiasm notwithstanding, the culture shock can
be a job killer. Thomas V. Colella, a recruiter at Korn/Ferry
International, recently recruited a paper industry executive with
30 years' experience to work at a fledgling electronic paper
exchange. The man quit after six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hated working with kids who knew nothing about running
a business,'' Colella said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Colella and other recruiters say there are many industry
who willingly heed the Internet's siren call.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've been with an organization for 25 years leave a
chunk of money on the table, but they make the move because they
want equity and because they're bored,'' said Christopher C.
Nadherny, a recruiter at Spencer Stuart who recently placed ``a
lifer at Dow Chemical'' into the presidency of an online chemicals
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The old-economy transplants bring more than a fluency in
industrial jargon; they bring an inside track to their former
companies, which are often the kinds of customers over which
e-commers salivate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shirley, a former Federal Express executive who is now
senior vice president for sales for the online printing service
NowDocs.com, helped NowDocs get a $30,000 contract _ its largest
single job yet _ to print and deliver training manuals for FedEx.
Similarly, Michael S. Oswald, NowDocs' staff lawyer, who had
previously worked for a software company called Acuity, has brought
in so many law firms as customers that ``Rob says he's our best
source of leads,'' said Brad Adamske, 36, NowDocs' founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I hadn't thought of recruiting people from industry
for sales leads, but I'm sure thinking about it now,'' Adamske
said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, NowDocs hired Tamara Johnson, a saleswoman from Xerox,
figuring she could bring entree to that company as well as to other
customers that were tired of doing their own printing. And Adamske
is wooing a salesman who he hopes will help persuade his soon-to-be
former employer to invest in NowDocs.
</P>
<P>
   After those recruited from the industrial ranks help land
clients, they can serve as translators, explaining to their dot-com
bosses how to keep old-economy customers happy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the three founders of EqualFooting, all of whom
are tech types and thus used to working at Internet speed, had been
giving prospective buyers only four hours to respond to a
supplier's price offer. Wright persuaded them to change that to 24
hours. ``They just didn't realize that buyers are out in the field,
not tied to a desk or a phone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also persuaded the company to run a promotion in which
buyers could win free safety gloves and goggles for buying specific
amounts. Why? She knew from her own experience that extra safety
equipment always comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   EqualFooting.com plans to set up a financing service on its Web
site soon, and the company is already looking for someone familiar
with making small-business loans to run it, according to Aaron
Martin, 30, who is one of the EqualFooting founders.
</P>
<P>
   Martin extols the value of recruiting from the old economy. He
noted that it was the people recruited from industry on his staff
who persuaded him to run pictures next to every item on his Web
page, rather than expect customers to click for a photograph. And,
at their suggestion, Martin has put industry types on his telephone
help desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to train them on how to answer tech
questions,'' he said, ``than to teach them about industrial
supplies.''

WEB MUSIC SERVICE HOPEFUL OF SETTLING WITH RECORD INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online music service MP3.com expressed guarded confidence
about reaching a settlement with the Recording Industry Association
of America, following a federal court ruling on Friday that MP3.com
had violated copyright law by creating an online database of 80,000
major-label recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cautiously optimistic of a business resolution,''
Michael Robertson, the chief executive of MP3.com, said in an
e-mail message responding to questions. The recording industry
association and major music conglomerates have asked for up to $6
billion in damages, almost half of the more than $14 billion retail
value of recordings sold in the United States in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vidich, an executive vice president for Time Warner's
Warner Music Group who has been negotiating with MP3.com's lawyers,
said the major labels represented by the recording industry
association were not trying to shut down MP3.com's music storage
service, which is called My.MP3.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the settlement discussion is to establish the
legitimate basis on which the service can continue,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone in the recording industry is looking to stop new
business models that take advantage of the uniqueness of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies praised the decision as an affirmation of
copyright protection. ``A validation of the legal standing of a
copyright is very good news for anybody who's directly involved
with artists,'' said Danny Goldberg, chief executive of Artemis
Records, an independent label that releases CDs and runs Internet
radio and music subscription services.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does not affect the widespread use of MP3 (a
compression technology that is not owned by MP3.com) to make copies
of music available across the Internet. The popularity of MP3 has
alarmed the recording business because it allows listeners to copy
and distribute music from any compact disc. Still, according to the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, CD shipments
in the United States rose by 10 percent in 1999, even as MP3 use
exploded and many companies offered full-length songs as free
samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems counterintuitive, but an increase in free downloads
coincided with an increase in paid sales,'' Goldberg said.
``Particularly among the young audience, the people who are most
wired, the evidence is that it's bonding a new generation to
music.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also does not address the issues in the suit the
recording industry association has brought against Napster, an
online music service whose software allows listeners to freely swap
songs in the MP3 format over the Internet, since Napster does not
retain any copies of songs.
</P>
<P>
   My.MP3.com is a small part of MP3.com, most of which is devoted
to offering free music from thousands of performers. ``Almost none
of our revenues are attributable to My.MP3.com currently,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   My.MP3.com is an online storage system for music in the MP3
format, allowing listeners access to the music in their own CD
collections over the Internet. Other music storage services, like
myplay.com, require listeners to convert songs from their CDs into
MP3 files, a time-consuming process. My.MP3.com recognizes a
compact disc in a listener's computer, and if the recording is in
MP3.com's database, it can be added instantly to an individual's
online collection, which is protected by a password.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com purchased 80,000 major-label CDs for its database in
order, it argued, to provide consumers with easier access to music
they had already bought. The recording industry's suit successfully
contended that My.MP3.com was using copyrighted recordings without
paying licensing fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere existence of technology that allows for an easy
subversion of copyright protection doesn't make it correct,'' said
Al Teller, chief executive of Atomic Pop, an independent label that
sells CDs and MP3 downloads. ``If you're building a commercial
enterprise by virtue of performing this service, then you have an
obligation to get the rights from the owners of the copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said that the ruling would only affect those CDs
released by the companies in the suit. ``The My.MP3.com
infrastructure will continue to be in place,'' he said. ``There are
tens of thousands of CDs in the system which labels and artists
have requested we put into the system.'' The service has 400,000
registered users.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Griffin, chief executive of Cherry Lane Digital, a
consulting firm for digitally distributed arts companies, said the
current case is part of a broader conflict. ``Music is the canary
in the coal mine for all digital entertainment,'' he said. ``This
is a minor skirmish in the war between record companies and their
so-called pirates.''
</P>
<P>
   The dot.com companies thrive on an image of constructive
rebellion, he suggested, so the lawsuit could add to MP3.com's
prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, MP3.com's biggest risk is of obscurity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any damages borne by MP3.com must be weighed against the value
of distinguishing the company as the prime mover for digital music
and change.''

GROUP STARTING WORK ON NEW CYBERSPACE DOMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Armed with a formal but vague go-ahead from one of
its advisory panels, the Internet's international oversight body
has begun writing a plan for new suffixes that would be added to
ones like .com, .net and .org in network addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The work follows a recent report from one of the group's
committees recommending that the Internet addressing system be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposed that the group, Internet Corp. for Assigned
Names and Numbers, or ICANN, consider creating four different types
of of address suffixes, known as domains. The four new domains
would include those that are open to anyone, others that are for
specialized businesses, some for noncommercial interests and others
for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, issued on April 20, avoided many tough
questions, leaving it to ICANN's staff to make recommendations to
the board on what the new domains should be called (e.g., .per or
.shop), how many should be added, and when.
</P>
<P>
   The report also gave no guidance on how to protect trademark
holders from a new round of speculative buying of their famous
words by so-called cybersquatters, although that issue is still
being studied by ICANN members. One industry proposal would give
trademark holders an opportunity to register their names before
those words were opened to the public for registration.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's president, Michael M. Roberts, said the staff would try
to answer the implementation questions in a report that he hoped to
release for public comment within a month. A final decision by
ICANN on how to proceed is expected at the board's next public
meeting in Yokohama, Japan, in July. It is unclear whether that
decision will include a go-ahead for introducing new domains.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the lack of consensus or guidance from the different
business and noncommercial interest groups that were involved in
writing the report, Network Solutions _ the company that operates
the worldwide registry for .com, .net and .org _ has proposed that
only two domains be added initially, .shop and .banc.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has also proposed that the new registries be
run by industry organizations rather than by individual companies.
Network Solutions was the sole registrar of addresses for the .com,
.net and .org domains, until the Clinton administration set up
ICANN in 1998 to break up that monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions still controls a large part of the
registration business. Last week the company reported that it had
registered 2 million new domains in the first quarter of this year,
more than one-third of the total number of domain names registered.

COMPANY PLANS MOBILE WEB PORTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   When most technology professionals and consumers hear the name
Excite(AT)Home, they generally think of cable modems. After all,
the company was formed by the merger of the Excite Web portal and
the At Home cable modem venture.
</P>
<P>
   But with much of the buzz in the Internet and communications
industries these days surrounding mobile data applications,
Excite(AT)Home is making a mobile move as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the company, which is controlled by AT&AMP;T, intends to
announce that it has developed a version of the Excite portal for
mobile applications, to be called, naturally enough, Excite Mobile.
The concept is to let consumers use wireless phones or other mobile
communications devices to receive e-mail, news, weather and other
electronic items provided by Excite. The address for the new site
is mobile.excite.com .
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, one of Excite's main competitors, has already staked its
claim in the mobile world, striking partnerships with Sprint's
wireless phone unit and Bell Mobility, a big wireless
communications provider in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Although Excite might be expected to work closely with AT&AMP;T's
wireless communications operation, one of the nation's biggest,
Excite has not yet announced partnerships with any wireless
providers.

SOME SAY IT MAY BE TOO LATE TO DISMANTLE MICROSOFT 
 BY JOHN MARKOFF  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the government's proposal to break up
Microsoft and set new ground rules for its business practices, the
beneficiaries are supposed to include other software companies _
especially the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, reaction to the government's proposed helping hand
seems muted, or outright skeptical, among software developers _ the
primarily small and mid-sized companies that create a variety of
products that make computers work faster or more easily, or that
act as tools used by other programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Why so little rejoicing?
</P>
<P>
   Some developers view the plan the Justice Department and 17
states filed last Friday as too backward looking, aimed at a
personal computer software industry the Internet is already passing
by. And some of these same developers and others predict Microsoft,
even split in two, will remain too mighty a force to counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is the ocean,'' said Mark Eppley, a veteran software
industry executive who is president at Laplink Inc., a maker of
software that enables users to synchronize the files on their
desktop and portable computers. ``Even if you divide it into
Pacific and Atlantic oceans, I still have to swim in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eppley's company is an example of one that has been able to
continue to compete, even though Microsoft offers a similar utility
program called ``the briefcase'' as a free part of the Windows 98
and 2000 operating systems. Laplink, based in Bothell, Wash., has
been able to survive by offering more features than are available
through Microsoft's briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Eppley noted that Laplink, like most other companies in the
software business, was now moving its products rapidly to Internet
versions. And he said he hoped that Microsoft would not develop its
own Internet formats for storing and retrieving files _ because
unified or divided, Microsoft would present a formidable
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at some other small companies still focused on the
traditional personal computer software business said they did not
see how a Microsoft breakup would create new possibilities for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not obvious where the opportunity would occur if a
breakup were to occur,'' Lawrence A. Zulch, chief executive officer
of the Dantz Development Corp., a company in Orinda, Calif., whose
software is used for making back-up copies of personal computer
data and files. ``We don't see a logical fracture line that
wouldn't turn into a dominant company that would overtake the other
one and create a new Microsoft. So it's not clear how it would help
the personal computer industry and, therefore, us.''
</P>
<P>
   By proposing to separate Microsoft's Windows operating system
business from its Office applications software business, the
government hopes to unleash personal computer makers to pursue new
business strategies and relationships that Microsoft has opposed.
The government would also be counting on the breakup to re-ignite
the kind of brushfire of innovation in the personal computer
software industry that flourished in the early days of the PC in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, Microsoft had pretty well won the war for
operating systems _ the software that controls the basic operations
of a computer. But before Microsoft's Office suite of desktop
personal computer applications became the de facto industry
standard, the industry was awash with small and medium-size
software publishing firms developing hundreds of different kinds of
competing application programs. These applications ranged from word
processors, databases and spreadsheets to programs used for
enabling PC's to communicate and utility programs for helping PC's
work better.
</P>
<P>
   But since the mid-'90s, with Office dominating applications, new
investment in the software industry has largely flowed instead to
products for the Internet. The traditional software industry has
languished, with even name-brand products like Wordperfect changing
corporate owners, while many other companies merged or went out of
business and the survivors scrambled for niches that gave some
shelter from competition's risks.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, many _ though not all _ industry executives who
discussed the government's plan for Microsoft said they were
skeptical that slicing off Microsoft's application business would
create a meaningful resurgence in applications software. Besides
predicting that the spun-off company would continue to dominate PC
applications, many executives argued that there were simply no
longer enough opportunities for growth in the traditional
applications field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking Office and Windows apart doesn't seem to prepare for
the future,'' said William Gurley, a venture capitalist at
Benchmark Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The majority of new
innovation and spending isn't going into desktop. It feels like
that game is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some industry executives who have battled Microsoft for
years said they could now envision new designs for software
products that might not have been viable in a Microsoft-dominated
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be selling packaged software the way we did in the
1980s,'' said Mitchell D. Kapor. He was founder of the Lotus
Development Corp., a company that was once a leader in spreadsheets
and other applications. But after the Microsoft Office onslaught,
Lotus sought refuge by selling itself to IBM in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's worthwhile conducting some experiments in new kinds
of application architectures,'' said Kapor, who is now an investor
and venture capitalist. ``If the applications aren't linked to the
operating system, there are some real possibilities for
innovation.'' But he declined to be specific, for competitive
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some other software designers said that it would be almost
impossible to predict the consequences of the splitting of
Microsoft _ and that unintended consequences might surprise the
industry and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't know what these things will do; it's hard to
debug remedies,'' said Daniel S. Bricklin, who was co-inventor of
the software spreadsheet and is now co-founder of the Trellix Corp.
Trellix, based in Concord, Mass., publishes an application software
program that helps users create documents suited for reading on the
World Wide Web, rather than being printed out.
</P>
<P>
   One example of an unintended consequence of the government's
antitrust case may already be taking place, in the view of Hal
Varian, an economist who is dean of the School of Information
Management &AMP; Systems at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Varian said that the Justice Department is hoping that a newly
spun-off applications company will make a copy of Microsoft Office
available for use with the Linux operating system, which many
Microsoft denigrators hope will be a viable alternative to Windows.
``But because of Microsoft's monopoly,'' he said, ``Sun
Microsystems recently began giving away a free copy of Star Office
for Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   By offering its own free alternative to Microsoft Office, Varian
said, Sun may discourage any new Microsoft spin-off from trying to
compete in the Linux market. That, presumably, would not be the
kind of competitive response the government would hope for with a
Microsoft breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, several executives in the Linux community said they hoped
that a Microsoft spinoff would create versions of its applications
for Linux, making the free operating system much more attractive to
nontechnical computer users. So far, Linux has tended to be an
operating system only a geek could love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft shows up on Linux, everything would change; it
would be a big enabler for Linux,'' said Michael Boiche, co-founder
and chief executive of Eazel, a company designing software intended
to make Linux easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   One formerly competitive sector of the computer industry that
appears to have been overlooked by the government proposal is
programming languages, a field that Microsoft also dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Programming languages like C, C++, Basic and Java are used by
software developers to build desktop computer applications like
word processors and Web browsers. But they are also used for
creating network applications like Web-searching programs that
reside on network server computers and are queried by multiple
people using individual Web-browser programs.
</P>
<P>
   Development tools are any variety of software programs that help
software programmers do their jobs. And just as in automotive
repair, it matters whether a mechanic's tools are based on the
metric system or gauged in fractions of inches, so do programming
languages govern the basis for software tools.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal would place Microsoft's development
tools business within the new applications company. But several
executives said that not enough attention had been paid to the
importance of programming languages in giving Microsoft a
commercial and technical advantage. Microsoft's Visual Basic
program is but one of several of the company's development tools
that help it dominate this part of the software world.

MANY ANALYSTS THINK EXPENSIVE PORTAL DEALS DESERVE MORE SCRUTINY

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last two years, Web portals, the jumping-off sites for
many Internet surfers, have grabbed a piece of the e-commerce pie
by offering retailers prime real estate on their sites. In
exchange, the portals receive stratospheric tenancy fees.
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Yahoo, AOL, MSN, Excite, Lycos, AltaVista and Go
flourished, as retailers fought for top billing within the portals'
shopping categories. In the frenzy of dot-com investment last year,
those deals cost merchants like Drugstore.com, Pets.com and Value
America between $2 million and $5 million for every portal they
signed with.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the spending made sense. Portal deals not only
provided direct access to customers, but more important, they
virtually guaranteed a pre-initial public offering buzz, as
evidence that an electronic merchant was a major force within its
retail segment.
</P>
<P>
   But since e-tailers have become Wall Street's personae non
gratae, they have had to begin thinking of marketing budgets as
something that must actually serve the purpose of attracting
customers _ not investors. And so portal deals have been the second
line item on the budget, after TV ads, to come under the microscope
of e-tailing executives no longer willing to pay hundreds of
dollars to acquire each customer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and e-commerce executives predict that the new scrutiny
will affect all the portals, most drastically those ranking below
the big three, AOL, Yahoo and MSN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's re-evaluating the wisdom of portal deals,'' said
Jonathan Gaw, research manager at IDC, a technology research firm.
``One reason is, we have more to re-evaluate. Three years ago,
people were pulling numbers out of the air, trying to figure out
how the deals would perform. Now we have some data.''
</P>
<P>
   And some of the data is not pretty. Jim Rose, chief executive of
MobShop (www.mobshop.com), a Web site that lets groups of customers
bid on items in hopes of getting a bulk discount, said he had tried
a partnership deal with Excite(at)Home last year. That agreement,
for an undisclosed amount, entailed putting MobShop links on
various parts of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said that the company calculated the number of Excite
visitors who actually bought from MobShop, then divided that number
into the overall price charged by Excite(at)Home. After discovering
a customer acquisition cost of more than $1,000, MobShop promptly
pulled out of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go to another site like washingtonpost.com, and it
drops to $20,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's standard tactic among the portals,'' he said,
``was to take a category with maybe six competitors, then create
three premium tenant slots for them and let them bid up the value
until it ultimately got absurd. Now, there's not going to be as
many e-tailers left to bid, and there aren't many who really want
to, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Rose said, ``e-tailers will say, `Here's how much
we're willing to pay for customers. If you can guarantee that,
fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arno Harris, vice president of business development for
WineShopper.com, an Internet-only wine store, said he looked into
tenancy deals with all of the portals last year, but signed none
because they were ``economically not viable.'' The fees would
inflate his company's customer acquisition costs, he said, ``and
customer acquisition cost is the Rosetta stone of this whole
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he planned to approach the portals again in coming
months in hopes of finding what he called the silver lining of the
recent shakeout among dot-com retailers _ more flexible bargaining
environments. ``We're seeing more interest now among the portals in
coming to more reasonable terms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But to hear the portals tell it, Harris and other Internet
merchants may not find many bargains. An executive at the At Home
Corp., for one, said e-tailers had renewed their tenancy deals at
rates comparable with last year's. Jon Skinner, Excite(at)Home's
senior vice president for sales, said he expected the site's
tenancy fees to remain stable. He disputed the notion that
retailers were holding out for lower fees but said they wanted
better performance. Excite(at)Home is controlled by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said Excite(at)Home was developing different models for
delivering customers to tenants. One strategy is to put more
shopping links into editorial areas on the site _ so-called
contextual commerce. For example, Skinner said that instead of
simply displaying a jewelry store on the site's shopping channel,
the site's producers could create an editorial page about choosing
engagement rings, and put links to the featured jeweler near the
text.
</P>
<P>
   James F. McCann, chief executive of 1-800-Flowers.com, said
performance was the watchword of the moment. McCann said that of
the company's half-dozen portal deals, ``the only ones we'll renew
are the ones that pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company had signed a four-year $37 million
deal last fall to be the exclusive floral tenant for AOL. ``We're
happy with that,'' he said, ``because AOL really gets commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   On AOL, McCann said, he pays less than $30 to acquire each new
customer, which is in line with his company's expectations and well
below the industry average of $80 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the portals with the most visitors, AOL, Yahoo and
MSN, had fared best recently in attracting new tenants. And
according to James Kinsella, vice president for sales and marketing
at MSN, part of Microsoft, perhaps two e-tailers had dropped out of
tenancy deals because the bottom had fallen out of their stock.
Otherwise, he said, ``we've seen an upturn in the last month,'' as
media managers closed their ad budgets for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Kelly, chief financial officer of America Online,
said his company, too, had avoided fallout from the financial woes
of e-tailers. That, he said, was partly because AOL screened its
potential tenants for financial soundness before signing deals, and
partly because the number of purely dot-com tenants on the site was
not significant compared with the Web extensions of traditional
retailers, like Sears.com.
</P>
<P>
   Such a weighting, some analysts predict, will insulate the
top-tier portals from the e-tailer shakeout. ``The top portals have
only a 20 or 25 percent exposure to dot-coms in terms of their
tenancies,'' said Rob Martin, an analyst with Friedman Billings
Ramsay, an investment firm. ``But as you go down the food chain, to
Lycos, Go and the others, dot-coms become a larger percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Such portals, Martin said, ``will definitely run into issues
when the dot-coms start to run out of cash, and there definitely
will be a shakeout among the portals as the dot-coms shake out.''
</P>
<P>
   Speeding that shakeout could be the tendency of some e-tailers
to shy away from anything that is seen as second-tier.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Evans, director of business development for Boo.com, a
Web retailer of sporting goods, said her company had shunned deals
with the top portals because they were too expensive. But instead
of settling for more-affordable deals among the second tier, she
said, the company simply looked for partnerships that relied on
marketing techniques that were more narrowly focused, like creating
a network of affiliates that refer prospective customers to
Boo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what you get from a deal with one of the top three or
four sites is P.R. value, so you're taken seriously as a player,''
she said. ``You lose that with the other sites.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCann of 1-800-Flowers questioned the assumption
by some of the portal executives that traditional retailers would,
in fact, continue to prop up the demand _ and thus the costs _ for
portal deals. ``Traditional retailers aren't so dumb and crazy that
they can just blindly give portals a bag of money,'' he said. ``And
they have different capital constraints: they have to make money.''

VIRTUAL REALTY LEADS HOME BUYERS TO THE REAL THING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sandy and Christopher Carlson made an offer late last
year on a $460,000 one-bedroom loft in Manhattan's East Village
before they had even walked in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlsons, who lived in Los Angeles, did not want to cross
the continent each time a broker called. Because waiting is not an
option in the Manhattan real estate market, they took a tour of
another kind _ on the Internet _ looking at floor plans and
photographs sent by e-mail and taking virtual tours on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been inside,'' Carlson said in a recent telephone
interview from Los Angeles before her move. ``I just couldn't
afford to fly back there every time I heard of something that
interested me, and I couldn't afford to stop work for three months
and just look out there. So, the Internet was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more, prospective home buyers and renters are
window-shopping by computer. This is particularly true in the New
York market, where listings disappear so fast that waiting for the
Sunday classifieds can be risky. House-hunting through the Web also
permits would-be customers to view a potential home before even
contacting a broker.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are being hailed by consumers and most real estate
brokerages, but have drawn concern from some individual brokers.
They fear that potential clients could use the World Wide Web to
contact sellers directly, bypassing brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were more than 3 million homes advertised on
the Web in April, compared with the more than 2.4 million that are
listed each month in other places, like classified advertisements,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that unlike many new Web ventures, which have high
start-up costs and low revenues, some real estate sites have
already found a way to become profitable by taking a percentage of
sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Most New York real estate sites are run by brokerages, but a
handful _ like www.mlx.com, which allows anyone to list properties
_ are independent companies that have begun to move into the
market. These companies make money by charging anyone who wants to
browse their listings. Others charge small fees, much lower than
standard sales commissions, for listing a property.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Internet companies have a hard time making money
because they are trying to reinvent the wheel,'' said Tan Chan, the
chief financial officer of Corcoran.com, the site through which the
Carlsons recently bought their apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran.com has spun off from the Corcoran Group real estate
brokerage in New York, and will soon move into offices in lower
Manhattan. The new company plans to make money by allowing
affiliate brokerages worldwide to list real estate on its site.
Corcoran.com will receive 25 percent of the commission on any sales
that come from its leads, said James W. Kim, its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Corcoran, the president of the Corcoran Group and the
chairwoman of both companies, began the Web site with plain text
listings in 1994. Over the next three years, brokers _ some of whom
were not even using e-mail _ began getting calls from clients
interested in listings they saw on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Corcoran has added features like floor plans and a
database that allows prospective buyers and renters to search for
properties with certain amenities, in specific neighborhoods and
within their price range. She has also added photographs, e-mail
links to brokers, and 3-D virtual tours. Last year, the company
received 28,879 e-mail requests and sold 225 apartments to clients
who came to the brokerage through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is little concern among those working in
newspaper advertising that sales of classified ads will decline
because of online real estate sales. The reason: Real estate
companies still need to use classifieds, as well as television
spots and display advertisements, to draw consumers to their Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   But some brokers already are worried that the online companies
are cutting into their commissions. Information that brokers once
provided _ Is this a good neighborhood? Is this a realistic price
for a two-bedroom in this area? How do I finance a mortgage on this
apartment? _ is increasingly available on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf T. Wigand, the director of the Center for Digital Commerce
at Syracuse University, said real estate agents ``are trying to
find their new role in this process'' because customers can now
partially bypass them.
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran hopes brokers will be willing to give up some of their
commissions if Web sites bring additional clients. She also says
the Web, by educating buyers about what is available, can cut down
on the amount of time agents have to spend with clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One benefit the Web sites offer is speed. And the Carlsons, who
are builders, took advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson flew to New York to look for an apartment last fall
after her broker found a one-bedroom loft apartment in the TriBeCa
section of lower Manhattan. Carlson visited the apartment and took
pictures for her husband. She returned home and made an offer, but
was beaten out by a higher bid.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson decided she was not going to let that happen again. In
early December, she clicked onto Corcoran.com and found another
apartment she liked. She called her broker, asking him to visit the
apartment and take digital pictures that could be sent by e-mail.
The next day, after speaking with her husband, Carlson made an
offer that was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlsons have moved into the apartment, and say that the
virtual visit lived up to the real thing.

SITE OF THE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold Violin: A shopping site for older Web-savvy citizens or, as
the site puts it, ``shopping for heroes.'' It goes on to describe
them at ``people who live rich, long lives and inspire us with
their experience and insights. They braved the Depression in the
'30s...defended the world's freedom in the '40s ... and claim that
we are their greatest accomplishment.'' &QL; 
Where: www.goldviolin.com &QL; 
What's cool: The shopping selections, pitched toward gift-giving
for a faraway family member, include nifty products like a leather
``brag book'' for all those photos of grandchildren, an
``aristocratic'' walking stick, a ``big keys'' computer keyboard,
and ergonomic tools that just might be of use to more than your
arthritic elder. Decent prices, though it's hard to judge product
quality without actually using the stuff. &QL; 
Features: This site breaks down the offerings in a number of ways,
such as by lifestyle, room of use, and basics, along with a
gift-suggestion area that includes price ranges. I'd prefer to see
the site come with a button to automatically enlarge the type for
easier reading, but you can adjust that yourself in your Web
browser (though it'll probably mess up the layouts; a good reason
for the site to provide a well-designed alternative). I'd also like
to see more product choices, though that may come with time. What's
here will appeal to many folks, either elderly, ailing or
handicapped, who need tools for living that fit their particular
lives' demands. These kinds of goodies aren't always sitting in
Aisle 14 at Wal-Mart. &QL; 
You'll like this if: You're feeling like an everyday hero, or want
to be treated like one. &QL; 
Think your Web fave is good enough for Site of the Week? Send your
suggestions to davidbloomearthlink.net.

THIS GIG MAY NOT LAST AS LONG AS YOU HOPE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am well past 65, but my husband and I took
enough courses to find our way around a computer. We should have
bought one with more memory. However, we are stuck, since money is
scarce when you live on Social Security. Don't tell us to go buy a
new computer! We have a 1.5-gigabyte hard drive, and I have filled
1.25 GB of that. I found that I can compress the drive and get more
storage. How will this affect the info I have in the machine?
</P>
<P>
   _ Senior Citizen
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SENIOR: If there was one thing I could rip out of Windows
and beat Bill Gates over the head with, it would be that stupid
disk-compression software. Years ago, I thought using it would be a
great way to avoid spending money to update my computer. And it
worked right up until it murdered my data.
</P>
<P>
   Software like Microsoft's DriveSpace compresses everything on
your hard drive into one big file that looks like just another
drive. When you run a program off that compressed image, the
software unpacks it, restoring it to its original size.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, if the program that keeps track of where all the
compressed stuff is gets hammered, you've got no way to get to your
files.
</P>
<P>
   With the price of hard drives dropping faster than the value of
my dot-com portfolio, I think you ought to add a second drive or
maybe just replace the first. You could probably get a 10-gig or
better installed for under 200 bucks. I know that's still a lot on
a fixed income, but it beats losing everything to some software
hocus-pocus.
</P>
<P>
   Find a local clone maker to do the work. You're more likely to
guilt him into cutting you a break than you would be with a
superstore clerk.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I tried your suggestions about running the
Msconfig program to eliminate things running in the background and
increased my resources from something like 63 percent to 80 percent
by deactivating three or four files. How does one know which
programs can be deactivated without causing major problems?
</P>
<P>
   _ Resourceful
</P>
<P>
   DEAR RES: It's fairly simple. If you take things out one at a
time, then do a restart and if nothing works right, you took out
the wrong deal. Trust me, most of the stuff running in the
background you can live without. Sure, your scanner may not scan
when you press the button, but you can always put that particular
program back in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Msconfig, for all of you thoughtful readers who took time to
write in and call me a bonehead, is available only if you have
Windows 98, reason enough to upgrade. Another thing that makes it
worthwhile is ScanRegistry. Every time you start up, it checks the
Registry and makes a backup.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event you goober things so badly with Msconfig
that Windows won't even start, bring the computer up in DOS mode,
type in ``Scanreg/restore'' and press Enter to revert to a
previous, working Registry file. Don't type the quotes. Did I
really have to say that? Sigh.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Why is it that when I try something that you
suggest on my computer, I can never get the desired results?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dissatisfied Customer
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DISS: Must be your fault.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, software evolves. If I tell you how to do something
and don't specifically mention a version, you should assume I'm
using the latest. I thought everybody knew that.

ADDING A CENTRAL VACUUM SYSTEM TO YOUR HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make purchase
one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A central vacuum system is a convenience, especially in large
homes, because it eliminates the need to drag a vacuum cleaner from
room to room or up and down the stairs. The heart of the system is
the power unit, which produces the suction for vacuuming. It
consists of the motor and dust-collection canister, and is usually
located in the basement, attic or garage. Because the unit remains
in a fixed location and need not be carried about, it utilizes a
larger, more powerful motor than portable ones.
</P>
<P>
   A trunk line with branches runs from the power unit to strategic
locations throughout the house. At the end of each line is an inlet
valve with a spring- loaded closure gate and a power switch.
Plugging the vacuum hose into an inlet valve will activate the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   If your home doesn't have a central vacuum system, you can have
one installed, or if you are reasonably handy, you can do it
yourself. These units cost anywhere from $500 to $1,500, depending
on the quality of construction, the size of the motor, the amount
of pipe needed and the extra features included in the kit.
</P>
<P>
   The skills required for installation are basic ones, and you
will only need a few common tools. However, in order to run the
trunk lines through the walls, you will have to drill large holes
(about 2 1/4 inches in diameter) through the floor plate. This task
can be made easier if you rent a right-angle drill and a hole saw
at a tool-rental store.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of the installation will depend on the size,
shape and construction of your house. It will be easier to run a
vacuum line around a house with a simple floor plan and only one
level. A two-story house may require a main trunk line and a large
number of branch lines to adequately service all the areas. It is
also easier to run lines through a house with an unfinished
basement or attic.
</P>
<P>
   The first step, then, is to look at the house plan and determine
the best place for the power unit; it should be near an electrical
outlet in the garage, basement or attic. Next, plot locations for
the inlet valves. Keep in mind that you do not have to put a valve
in every room. Most central vacuum systems come with a 30-foot
hose. This is usually long enough to vacuum a room, then work into
the hallway and into an adjacent room without having to reconnect
the hose. The trick is to position the valves so they service
overlapping cleaning zones.
</P>
<P>
   When locating an inlet valve, consider that interior walls may
have obstructions, like plumbing and electrical lines. To avoid
these roadblocks, choose walls that do not have outlets or
switches. Stay away from ceiling or floor vents since there is apt
to be ductwork that feeds them.
</P>
<P>
   After establishing the location for the power unit and inlet
valves, outline the best route to connect them with trunk and
branch lines. Check your plan carefully before you start cutting
into the walls. It's a good idea to show the plan to the vacuum
dealer when you buy your unit. He may be able to offer advice on
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Begin the installation by mounting the power unit. If you place
it in the basement or garage, you will probably want to mount it on
a wall. In the attic, it's best to secure it to the floor joists.
Next, install the inlet valves. They should be mounted at the same
height as the electrical outlets. Trace the outline of the mounting
bracket on the wall. Cut around the outline with a drywall saw to
make a rectangular hole. Use the angle saw to cut a round hole in
the floor plate directly below the inlet-valve hole.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to run a low-voltage electrical line from the
power unit to the activator switch on the valve. An easy way to run
this wire is to tape it to a length of PVC pipe, then push the pipe
through the wall cavity to the inlet valve.
</P>
<P>
   Connect the low-voltage wire to the activator switch connection
on the back of the bracket. Attach a 90-degree elbow to the back of
mounting bracket. Push the assembled unit through the hole, being
careful not to dislodge the wire from the valve, and secure the
valve by screwing the bracket to the wallboard (the necessary
screws should be provided in the vacuum kit).
</P>
<P>
   The trunk lines are usually made of standard PVC plumbing pipe.
The pipe cannot be bent, so straight lengths are combined with
elbow and T-fittings to make right angles. All the pieces must be
bonded together with solvent cement to keep them from pulling
apart.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   The Oxalis Tribe
</P>
<P>
   Q. We recently purchased two small potted Oxalis plants. I know
that there are varieties too numerous to mention, but in general,
what is the recommended care, indoor and outdoor, soil content,
temperature, drainage preference, watering and sun requirements? Do
they winter over? If so, how does one treat them?
</P>
<P>
   A. You're right about the size of the Oxalis tribe.
Unfortunately, a genus with species too numerous to mention is also
one about which it is difficult to generalize. Though all Oxalis
are more or less rounded plants with cloverlike leaves and all of
them have delicate, five petal flowers, that's about it for family
resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   Pink-flowered O. acetosella, for instance, is a rhizome-forming
woodland dweller that spreads readily into wide mats. It blooms in
spring, stays green all summer and comes through Canadian winters
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   O. lobata, on the other hand, is a bright-light lover that can't
stand frost. A tuberous-rooted native of Chile, it makes leaves in
spring, goes dormant for summer and then puts out new leaves and
brilliant yellow flowers in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the showiest Oxalis have a dormant period, but since
your plants came label-free, they're probably from a species that
doesn't mind skipping this step. If they have bands of purple at
the top of grass green leaves, they could be Iron Cross, usually
classed as O. tetraphylla. If they have large purple leaves and
bright pink flowers, suspect O. regnellii.
</P>
<P>
   Both are perennials that should be treated as houseplants
anywhere north of the Carolinas. They do well in bright light, but
not hot sun, and can take some shade. A loose soil that drains well
is best, since they like a lot of water but not soggy feet. Add
some perlite if you have them in regular potting soil. Though they
will droop if allowed to dry out, they have amazing powers of
recovery once watered.
</P>
<P>
   Feed monthly with a bloom-encouraging fertilizer as long as
they're flowering, then let them rest. Avoid high-nitrogen plant
food, which will encourage leaves at the expense of flowers and
encourage rot at the expense of the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Arugula
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a fund-raiser, I bought a small plant that was labeled
perennial arugula. Now that it's about 6 inches wide, I'm afraid
it's something else. The leaves are smaller, shinier and darker
green than arugula from the store. They are also much narrower than
regular arugula. Is it really the same plant?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't the same plant (it isn't even the same genus), but
it is very similar in flavor and is often called wild arugula or
arugula selvatica.
</P>
<P>
   Your new friend is Diplotaxis tenuifolia, also known as D.
erucoides. True arugula is Eruca vesicaria subsp. sativa, and
although it's the bigger mouthful to say, it's the smaller one to
eat. Selvatica is almost hot, decidedly more pungent than garden
arugula, though it is also sweeter. To many palates, it also has a
cleaner, less old-radishy taste, and it holds up better when
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The two arugulas have similar growing habits. They thrive in the
cool of spring, then as the weather warms become stronger flavored
and shoot up flowers that are also edible. At that point, they part
company. True arugula flowers are white with a hint of lavender,
and once they show up, that's pretty much it for the leaves.
Selvatica flowers are yellow, and you can enjoy them, then cut the
plants back and get another crop in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Like garden arugula, the wild kind will self-sow. Let it go to
seed this summer, and you'll have babies by late autumn. But if you
turn out to like it at all, one plant won't go far. Better plant
more right away; seed is available from Cook's Garden, PO Box 535,
Londonderry, Vt. 05148, (800) 457-9703, and Pinetree Garden Seeds,
PO Box 300, New Gloucester, Maine 04260, (207) 926-3400.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 West
43rd St., New York, NY 10036, or by e-mail to
gardening(at)nytimes.com. Those of general interest will be
published. Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

AS GADGETS SHRINK, THEY MAY WIND UP IN SURPRISING PLACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The standard advice may be ``take two aspirin and call me in the
morning.'' But it soon may become ``take these tablets, and they
will call me in the morning'' _ and in the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   That is what some researchers are predicting for the
fast-growing field of embedded computing _ a futuristic place of
microscopic medical devices packaged in grains of medicine as small
as grains of sand.
</P>
<P>
   Within the decade, some researchers say, patients will swallow
these tiny grains, and down will go microscopic sensors,
microscopic processors and microscopic radio transceivers, all part
of a delivery and communications network. The devices will, for
instance, track a medical condition and release drugs to treat it
while constantly sending wireless data transmissions on the
patient's physiological responses to a portable server in the home.
The data will then be sent via the Internet to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   This medicine will be more than smart _ it will be downright
voluble. But it is only one practical application expected to come
out of a future wave of embedded devices in wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such applications are nearer to happening than even educated
observers might think,'' said Gaetano Borriello, a professor in the
department of computer science and engineering at the University of
Washington in Seattle. He is a co-author of the article ``Embedded
Computation Meets the World-Wide Web,'' which appears in a special
section on embedded computing and the Internet in the May issue of
Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Embedded devices are already all around us. ``Ninety-eight
percent of all processors we have on the planet are not in desktop
systems,'' Borriello said in an interview. ``They are, in fact, in
cars, on factory floors, in homes.'' For example, he said, a dozen
or so processors are found in an older car, a hundred or more in a
newer one. These embedded devices are task-specific computers, he
explained, ``so tailored that you don't think of them as computers
_ for instance, the computer that controls your anti-lock brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, embedded devices will become even smaller and
communicate wirelessly, as well as through wires, forming a
universe of ubiquitous networked computing, said Borriello and many
other researchers writing in the special issue. And one of the many
applications of such networks would be for monitoring, medical and
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Estrin, a co-editor of the journal's special section and
a professor of computer science at the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles, said: ``It's much more serious than
whether your coffeepot is smart enough to talk to your
refrigerator. This is the next dimension in scaling up the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrin said there would soon be numberless small devices used as
controls and monitors in fields as varied as agriculture and
environmental sensing, with nary a human in the loop.
</P>
<P>
   In medicine, embedded computers that will one day monitor blood
sugar or oxygen levels in the bloodstream with unprecedented
precision may be liberating, but they will also be quite nosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might want a program to keep track of my habits,'' Borriello
said, ``but I might not necessarily want my physician to know when
I've been a bad boy. I can imagine programs you buy along with a
set of sensors you could wear so that information stays home
instead of going directly to the physician.'' Patients might wear
sensors in a belt or wristband and transfer information wirelessly
to a home computer. ``You could buy a health-o-meter program that
would tell you how you were doing in the same way cars have
diagnostics that tell them when to get serviced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Borriello and his co-author, Roy Want, a principal
scientist and former manager at the embedded systems area in the
Computer Science Laboratory at Xerox PARC, in Palo Alto, Calif.,
pointed to the profound issues of security and privacy that were
bound to be raised by the networking of embedded computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to build these systems so that they have the
capability for users to determine who sees the data,'' Borriello
said. ``Right now we don't have that, and it's going to be a key
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   G.J. Pottie, an associate professor in the electrical
engineering department at the University of California at Los
Angeles and an expert in low-power wireless sensing, is one of the
researchers working on the wireless integrated network sensors that
will one day provide distributed network and Internet access for
controls, processors and sensors embedded in equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Such networks need to be self-organizing, Pottie said. ``We want
the whole network to come up on its own without people having to
configure any part of it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Borriello said one trend that would hasten the development of
networks of embedded devices was the falling cost of wireless
communications. The wireless chips that translate digital signals
into radio waves and back again, called transceivers, are now
comparable in cost with a microcontroller. Industry consortiums are
in the process of design standards for the wireless networking of
embedded devices.
</P>
<P>
   Want and Borriello both said that many challenges remained
before the interconnection of embedded processors became a reality.
One pressing issue will be the concern about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But predictable advances in chip fabrication, in
microelectromechanical devices and in radio and sensor design are
going to lead us inevitably into the world of ubiquitous
computing,'' Borriello said. ``The major issues to solve are in
software architecture, which lags far behind the hardware.''

   How Pixels Add Up To a Good Picture
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to buy a digital camera, but I find
advertisements with terms like megapixels and resolutions
confusing. What kind will take decent pictures?
</P>
<P>
   A. With the prices of digital cameras dropping to more
comfortable levels and the picture quality getting better, digital
photography has become more popular.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of digital cameras, a pixel is the smallest unit of
data in the image. Like building blocks, a bunch of pixels all
grouped together will create something larger: the image itself.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``resolution'' refers to the sharpness of the picture
the camera produces and how clear that image appears.
</P>
<P>
   A camera with a lower resolution number, like 640 pixels by 480
lines (often referred to as just 640 x 480 in advertisements),
produces a total of 307,200 pixels to display each picture.
</P>
<P>
   Megapixel cameras, which use more than a million pixels to
create the image, have a higher resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A camera with a resolution of 1,800 pixels by 1,200 lines can
produce images containing 2.16 million pixels. The resulting
pictures are much sharper than those taken by a lower-resolution
camera because the picture is made up of more pixels.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, the higher the resolution of the camera, the
higher the price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Adjustable lenses and storage capacity (how many digital
pictures the camera's memory will hold at one time) are two other
factors that can affect the price.
</P>
<P>
   But prices for cameras in the middle of the resolution spectrum
have fallen, and it is possible to buy cameras with resolutions of
1,280 x 960 and 1,440 x 1,080 for about $300 to $400.
</P>
<P>
   The type of camera that would be best for your needs depends on
what type of pictures you plan to take and what you plan to do with
them.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to take photos that will look good if you print them
out at a traditional photo-lab size, like 4 inches by 5 inches, a
midrange camera with a 1,280-by-960 resolution should do the job.
The resolution of the printer that you are using, be it a regular
all-purpose printer or a photo printer, will also affect the
overall picture quality.
</P>
<P>
   If you want good-looking 8-by-10 pictures, you will probably
want a higher-resolution camera. If you just want a camera to take
quick photographs to put up on a Web site or to attach to e-mail, a
lower-resolution camera may be all that you need.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am getting a new computer, and I know I can transfer all of
my data from the old PC to the new one with an Ethernet cable. But
is there a way to transfer my programs, Explorer favorites and
system configurations so I don't have to kill a day getting
everything on the new machine the way I want it?
</P>
<P>
   A. A number of utility programs on the market will help you with
this problem. They will generally let you transfer your old system
settings onto the new PC in a relatively painless manner, although
the software will probably need a small dose of hands-on help from
you to get everything in place.
</P>
<P>
   Programs like PC Transplant Pro by Altiris and Desktop DNA by
Miramar Systems are expensive (about $250) and are aimed more at
computer professionals maintaining an office full of machines than
at the average home user upgrading the family hardware every few
years. But these programs give you a lot of control over what you
want to transfer, leaving behind the files you don't want or need.
</P>
<P>
   More in the price range of the typical home user is Aloha Bob's
PC-Relocator, which costs around $50 and can be ordered from the
www.alohabob.com site.
</P>
<P>
   The program doesn't let you pick what you want to transfer,
though; it simply moves everything. Your browser favorites,
programs, settings and other important files should show up in the
right place to work properly on the new machine.
</P>
<P>

MEASURING THE VALUE OF A GOOD USED BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a history of addiction. I have never been able to pass a
used-book store without feeling compelled to buy an armload. So I
felt very virtuous about my ability to withstand the wiles of the
flashy ad campaign staged last year by Alibris, an ambitious online
bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have seen some of the full-page ads showing
beaten-up classics; the ads have appeared in dozens of magazines
since November. One showed a dog-eared paperback copy of Jack
Kerouac's ``On the Road'' that looked identical to the one I owned
in college. Another showed a vintage edition of ``Valley of the
Dolls'' that brought back memories; its pill-strewn dust jacket
looked so dangerous 30 years ago when my mother and her friends
were passing it around.
</P>
<P>
   Both tempted me sorely. But I passed them up, smugly
congratulating myself for being strong enough to resist the full
force of this early phase of a five-year, $100 million marketing
attack that Alibris (www.alibris.com) is directing at nostalgic
shoppers like me.
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw the smart little mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Paging through Bon Appetit last week, I came across an Alibris
ad that showed him inhabiting a knothole on the cover of the
children's book called ``Smart Little Mouse,'' published in 1950.
Honestly, I hadn't thought about the big-eyed little gray fellow in
more than 30 years, not since the days when my brother and I fought
over whose turn it was to sleep with that book. Did it matter that
I had happened to stumble upon him after all these years?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it did. He was a treasured friend from my childhood.
It was all coming back to me now. I used to sit by the window in
that leather chair (the brown leather chair!) and look at the
pictures before I was old enough to read it.
</P>
<P>
   I had to have that rodent.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I have a problem. Usually when I succumb, I search
for used books online at Bookfinder.com (www.bookfinder.com), a
homegrown search engine created in 1996 by Anirvan Chatterjee, who
at the time was a 19-year-old student at the University of
California at Berkeley. Over the years, the project has grown into
a small company, still overseen by Chatterjee, called 13th
Generation Media.
</P>
<P>
   I have used Bookfinder.com for about a year and a half and like
it for many reasons. It is, in its simplicity, very different from
a company like Alibris, which marks up books 20 percent and acts as
a liaison between buyers and sellers, repackaging books under its
own label before mailing them.
</P>
<P>
   Bookfinder.com, on the other hand, does not get in the middle
and does not tack on a finder's fee. (Chatterjee said the site's
main source of revenue was advertising, augmented by referral fees
from some individual booksellers.) Bookfinder.com puts buyers and
sellers directly in touch with each other to close the deal. With a
database of 20 million books (compared with the 10 million that
Alibris has for sale) and listings from 20,000 sources, including
those of large listing services like the Advanced Book Exchange and
Bibliofind, the search engine eliminates the need for separate
visits to multiple sellers' sites. It recently began listing books
available on Half.com, where amateurs like me try to sell copies of
old books gathering dust in back rooms. It also carries Alibris'
listings (there is a lot of overlap in online book listings).
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, I forgot about Bookfinder.com. All I could
think about was that big full-color ad. I went right to Alibris'
Web site, which describes itself as ``the world's leading supplier
of hard-to-find books.'' There I typed ``Smart Little Mouse'' into
the search query box, prepared to sift through dozens of copies in
search of just the right one (was it too much to hope for a copy
with a nick on the cover, like the one caused by my brother's
propensity to wield the book like a hammer?) and ready to pay any
price.
</P>
<P>
   The search results announced: ``Sorry. No matches were found!''
</P>
<P>
   Had I done something wrong? Or was Alibris advertising a book it
did not have? I phoned Martin Manley, the company's president and
chief executive, to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books we advertise tend to sell out,'' Manley explained.
He recommended that I list my request on the site's Bookhound
feature, which would notify me if a copy became available.
</P>
<P>
   That sounded logical. And sane. And totally unfulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead I went to Bookfinder.com, where I found a copy of ``The
Smart Little Mouse'' that was available for $12 from a Baltimore
bookseller. I bought it. I then searched both Alibris and
Bookfinder.com for five other titles recently featured in Alibris
ads. In all five cases, Bookfinder.com's results offered more
copies, more editions and lower prices. In one case, Alibris and
Bookfinder.com each had an identically worded listing for a first
edition of ``Valley of the Dolls.'' On Bookfinder.com, which listed
the dealer's name and address, the price was $450. On Alibris,
which did not, it cost $540.
</P>
<P>
   Manley said the difference in price was not a typographical
error; shoppers are willing to pay the extra 20 percent in return
for a high level of customer service. ``You may be able to able to
get the book directly from a dealer, and in some cases that works
just fine,'' he said. ``Our experience is that many people prefer
buying from a company that is building a recognized brand and who
will guarantee quality and reliability of inventory.'' In fact,
Alibris offers a full refund on any book for 30 days. In a recent
case, Manley said, a form stated the reason for return simply as
``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I say we take books back for any reason at all, I mean
you can send it back if you decide it didn't match the drapes,''
Manley said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? Although I have never encountered a problem
dealing directly with a seller in the past year and a half, I have
to admit that the stakes have not been high. I am not in the market
for rare or expensive editions; I usually buy the cheapest copy I
can find. What if I wanted an expensive first edition of ``Valley
of the Dolls?'' Would $90 be too much to pay for insurance?
</P>
<P>
   While I am trying to decide, I think I'll ask my mom to look for
her old copy.

 &HT;    BAD TIMING? NEWLYWEDS FIND UNEXPECTED GUESTS ON ISLAND
HONEYMOON: PROTESTERS, NAVY WARSHIPS
 &HT;    With Photo of the Bartels.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Bob Bartels wanted to surprise his
bride-to-be with a honeymoon she'd never forget: a week of sun and
sand on a little-known Caribbean gem where deserted beaches are
lapped by azure waters.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised her, all right, but Wednesday he was wondering if a
contingent of U.S. Marines and a couple of Navy warships might
crash the party.
</P>
<P>
   Married on Sunday in Montgomery, Ala., the couple arrived on
Vieques Monday, just as a showdown between the U.S. government and
protestors camped out on a Navy bombing range appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out when we got to the San Juan airport,'' said
Bartels' bride, Andrea, 28. ``He showed me a newspaper and I said,
'Oh my God, we're going to a war zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the couple found Vieques to be all Bartels promised:
quaint, laid-back, stunningly beautiful and filled with friendly
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just adds a little bit of excitement in addition to the
basic honeymoon,'' Bob Bartels said, as the couple stopped to see a
clump of protestors gathered outside the main gate to the bombing
range. ``We'll keep the newspaper clippings and have a little more
to remember it by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels _ formerly a public relations executive with Fitzgerald
and Co. in Atlanta, and now an employee of the Public Utility
Commission of Texas in Austin _ booked the honeymoon months ago. He
had visited Vieques once, and fell in love with the tiny island,
where horses and cows sometimes graze along the narrow roads that
wind through the hilly countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a hidden treasure,'' he said. ``Let everybody else
go to Jamaica and St. Thomas. We've got the beach to ourselves
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels, 30, had heard about the long-simmering controversy over
the bombing range, and grew a little worried as the wedding drew
near and news reports said the conflict was heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before the wedding, a friend told me he had seen news
about Vieques on CNN,'' he said. ``That got me a little worried, so
I made a few calls and decided it shouldn't be too much of a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he told both sets of parents to keep them from
worrying, he kept the trip a secret from Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept dropping hints about it,'' she said. ``I kept thinking
there might be a hurricane or a problem with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no signs of federal agents or U.S.
Marines, although a couple of giant Navy ships have been patrolling
the waters off Vieques and military helicopters sometimes beat
through the otherwise clear Caribbean sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really won't affect us,'' Bartels said. ``We're still
having a great time. The beaches are still beautiful and the
weather is incredible.''

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After Barry Bonds' home run splashed down in the
San Francisco Bay, my wife said, ``That's it. San Francisco is a
world-class city. New York doesn't have anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we were among the lucky 40,930 who saw the first homer
leave Pac Bell Park for a dip in the Bay. And, no, my wife does not
ordinarily use the words ``world-class city.'' Usually, when
someone says their city is world-class, you know it's
Sunbelt-class.
</P>
<P>
   But not San Francisco. We have an urban ballpark with yachts
docked around it. Across the street are restaurants as good as New
York's, and condos with rents as high as New York's and just as
little room to park or drive.
</P>
<P>
   New York isn't as exciting as San Francisco right now, though.
When a home run leaves Shea or Yankee Stadium, it may hit a beer,
but it won't hit salt water.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the home run that caused my wife's
uncharacteristic effusion _ and she was effusive, objecting that
baseball officials didn't give us the equivalent of a whole inning
to cheer Bonds and his shot into salt water.
</P>
<P>
   We stood and cheered as long as we could, all us fans, for a
nearly perfect game in a nearly perfect park. Let Barry be Barry.
Who cares about the arrogance? That game was worth the price of
admission to San Francisco, all $120,000 down and $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   OK, San Francisco has totally unreal prices for property. But
lots of other things about San Francisco are unreal, and always
have been. Now we have the surreal dot-com economy.
</P>
<P>
   The heartening part of being at the ballpark for Barry's brine
ball was that you could still sense the saltiness of San
Franciscans, despite the wealth and slickness of the new ballpark
district of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The guy behind me may have been using a cell phone, but he was
calling someone at home to ask if a mutual friend was at the park _
he thought he spotted the guy across the field. See, cell phones
can bring us together, as well as divide.
</P>
<P>
   A young fellow in front of me wore a hat with some obscure
dot-com logo, but he was filling out a scorecard, and when Mets
manager Bobby Valentine was hit on the shin by a foul ball, the
dot-commer yelled, ``Don't rub it, Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a fan. And so was the working-class woman in front of me,
who brought her two kids and pumped her 2-year-old's arms to the
ballpark music. She economized by bringing her own snacks, but when
she ordered $12 worth of Cokes (not all that much Coke), she tipped
the waitress two bucks and the delivery man another buck.
</P>
<P>
   You can always tell the working people by the way they tip.
Here's hoping our civic leaders find some way to keep them from
being driven to Yuba City.
</P>
<P>
   People in the stands razzed Rickey Henderson and Mike Piazza,
the way good San Francisco fans are supposed to. The fans seemed
awe-struck by the amenities of Pac Bell Park, as if they had been
cowed by years of abuse by Candlestick Park.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back from the park on the streetcar, everyone treated
each other with the greatest of respect. There was banter about
sardines and the Japanese subway system, but no prickliness,
N-Judah rage or much resentment of the Municipal Railway.
</P>
<P>
   Muni is trying, and not doing such a bad job, considering the
system needs fleets of cars going in two directions from
Embarcadero Station at rush hour. Even the traffic didn't look that
horrible, at least to someone who wasn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the dire predictions, the people of the Bay Area
have risen to the very special occasion of going out to the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   As we Muni sardines passed along the waterfront with our noses
jammed involuntarily against the windows, we stared at the fancy
restaurants and workout rooms filled with beautiful bodies on
treadmills.
</P>
<P>
   When I made a crack about people going out at night to run in a
window, the craggy and work-worn baseball fan in front of me said,
``If I looked that good, I'd run in a window, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy had every right to be resentful of San Francisco's new
class of buffed and stock-optioned young people, but he was
generous and humorous about them. It was so damn San Francisco of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Resenting the rich is a great game in this country where
everyone wants to be rich. The game gets very confusing in San
Francisco, a socialite-ruled, near-socialist city that sits atop
entrepreneurial Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Another old game in San Francisco is resenting newcomers. Again,
the game is confusing because newcomers sweep into town every
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, the hippies arrived in search of peace
and love in a world where material things besides a good stereo
wouldn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dot-com kids are arriving in search of the hottest Web
innovation, the coolest restaurant and enough material success that
they can retire and find peace and love at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   You know what? We can rail against them in the abstract, or rage
against their SUVs and Beemers when they're sealed inside them. But
still, they're San Franciscans, and at the ballpark or on Muni the
usual rules of respect apply.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how one horsehide ball hitting fuel-slicked water can make
you feel so good. I honestly thought it was going to be just a
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   When my wife and I got back downtown, cars parked on the street
were lightly sprinkled with drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they got splashed by that ball,'' my wife said.
</P>
<P>
   No, she wasn't on drugs, just $6 beers.
</P>

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Bob Bartels wanted to surprise his
bride-to-be with a honeymoon she'd never forget: a week of sun and
sand on a little-known Caribbean gem where deserted beaches are
lapped by azure waters.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised her, all right, but Wednesday he was wondering if a
contingent of U.S. Marines and a couple of Navy warships might
crash the party.
</P>
<P>
   Married on Sunday in Montgomery, Ala., the couple arrived on
Vieques Monday, just as a showdown between the U.S. government and
protestors camped out on a Navy bombing range appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out when we got to the San Juan airport,'' said
Bartels' bride, Andrea, 28. ``He showed me a newspaper and I said,
'Oh my God, we're going to a war zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the couple found Vieques to be all Bartels promised:
quaint, laid-back, stunningly beautiful and filled with friendly
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just adds a little bit of excitement in addition to the
basic honeymoon,'' Bob Bartels said, as the couple stopped to see a
clump of protestors gathered outside the main gate to the bombing
range. ``We'll keep the newspaper clippings and have a little more
to remember it by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels _ formerly a public relations executive with Fitzgerald
and Co. in Atlanta, and now an employee of the Public Utility
Commission of Texas in Austin _ booked the honeymoon months ago. He
had visited Vieques once, and fell in love with the tiny island,
where horses and cows sometimes graze along the narrow roads that
wind through the hilly countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a hidden treasure,'' he said. ``Let everybody else

here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels, 30, had heard about the long-simmering controversy over
the bombing range, and grew a little worried as the wedding drew

weather is incredible.''

   GERMANY-BRITAIN-MARKETS (London) _ The London and Frankfurt
stock exchanges announced plans for a full merger and an alliance
with New York's tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange on Wednesday, seeking to
build a pan-European trading heavyweight and a 24-hour global
market in new economy stocks _ both unthinkable only a few years
ago. The combined exchange will be Europe's biggest by far. The
announcement offered the most dramatic evidence to date of a
sea-change in European markets, driven by a clamor among investors
for cheaper trading, a challenge from Internet-based and electronic
trading systems and an increasing trend to treat Europe as a single
investment arena following the introduction of the euro. By Alan

$250 million system is in the final stages of testing in the United

 &HT;    CONGRESS URGED TO WARN TRAVELERS OF ROAD DANGERS ABROAD
 &HT;    By ANGEL WILSON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Road accidents will become the third greatest
health burden worldwide within 20 years, members of Congress were
told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people worldwide die annually from road deaths.
Of these, nearly 80 percent occur in developing countries. Road
accidents are the leading cause of death and serious injury to
healthy Americans traveling abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., hosted the Association
for Safe International Road Travel's ``Day on the Hill'' to urge
survivors of international motor accidents to speak to lawmakers.
The goal, Wexler said, is to convince Congress that the United
States must warn its citizens of dangerous traffic conditions
overseas and actively work with developing countries to improve
road and traffic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ross, former technical director and road safety adviser of
the Global Road Safety Partnership, said that by 2020 road
accidents will become the third greatest health burden, knocking
HIV/AIDS down to around number 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Ross urged the U.S. government to become active members of the
fight against such tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a superpower, it is an obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, which conducted a study concerning the amount of
money involved in road accidents, has also gotten involved in the
fight. According to the study, the global economy loses $500
billion annually to road accidents. In cooperation with several
other governments and private sector organizations, the Bank
created the Global Road Safety Partnership, whose goal is to
improve road safety worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road safety is an issue of immense human proportions, it's an
issue of economic proportions, it's an issue of social proportions,
and it's an issue of equity. Road safety is an issue that very much
affects poor people,'' said James D. Wolfensohm, president of the
World Bank Group.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler circulated a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright urging the State Department to expand the information it
compiles on traffic accidents worldwide and to make it more readily
available to international travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Such information would highlight road conditions, traffic
customs _ such as which countries drive on the left side of the
road and which don't require use of headlights at night _ and
statistics on which countries have the highest international
traffic death rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler and his wife, Laurie, have a personal interest in the
issue. The son of their daughter Rachel's fourth-grade teacher was
killed, along with 22 other passengers, in a bus accident in Turkey
five years ago Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, the teacher, Rochelle Sobel founded the
Association for Safe International Road Travel, which educates
Americans on international road and traffic conditions.

   RUN-GA-NOTRACK _ As the girls state track championship begins
today in Albany, high school coaches and college recruiters assess
how Georgia measures up against other states' talent. While they
contend that Georgia has as much raw talent as any in the nation,
it doesn't get as well developed during the high school season,
because Georgia's season is shorter than most other states'. The
season ends earlier than most, so athletes are often competing in
weather conditions that don't lend themselves to the best
performances. (Lee, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

 &HT;    Nurses celebrate fifty years of friendship
 &HT;    By Kim Folstad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The mementos smell a little musty. The
yearbook is starting to yellow, and some of the pictures pasted to
the scrapbook pages are curling at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The memories are still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years have gone by since their graduation from Good
Samaritan Hospital's School of Nursing, but the women of the Class
of 1950 are still close, and the history they share remains dear.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Clark Wheat was the funny one. Still is. Jean Acuff was the
best student. They called Gloria Gaines Foster ``Speedy'' because
she was always in a hurry. Nancy Haddock, who became an operating
room nurse, was nicknamed ``Fearless.''
</P>
<P>
   They were all bright and brave and caring. That's why they chose
nursing ... or it chose them.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the 15 women lived together, worked together,
played together. ``It was like a big family, really,'' Wheat says.
</P>
<P>
   And so, like family, they all make the effort to get together
every few years. In five decades, they've held 15 reunions.
</P>
<P>
   This year's reunion was special, though: The class marked its
golden anniversary. Thirteen of the 14 surviving graduates were in
West Palm Beach recently for the celebration, and a luncheon was
held at the Good Samaritan Medical Center. They used the time to do
a little catching up and a lot of reminiscing about their days at
the school.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses _ retired now _ still make faces about the
green-and-white-striped seersucker uniforms they had to wear for
their first six months of training. They roll their eyes about the
old curfew, too: 8:30 p.m. the first year, 10 p.m. the second, and
finally a bearable 11:30 that senior year at Good Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were especially daring would try to sneak out anyway,
with a raincoat over their pajamas. But ``Mother White,'' house
mother at Dodge Hall, the lodge where the nursing students lived on
the hospital campus, made it tough. Getting in was sometimes
easier: A gal could always look for engineer Jim Thompson, who
might be willing to prop a ladder up to the second-floor fire
escape.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the students were under the watchful eye of John
Wymer, who began his 34-year tenure as hospital administrator when
the Class of 1950 was starting its first year of training. ``He
took care of us,'' says Louise Dorothy Muller, a West Palm Beach
native who came from New Jersey for the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses liked and admired Wymer so much, they made him an
honorary member of their class. And he tells the best stories of
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no air-conditioning,'' Wymer says. ``The season then
was about three months long. Then we had to sweat out a half-empty
hospital.'' But the nurses found ways to keep cool: During the day,
they'd walk to the beach. At night, there were the ``submarine
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the girls from Good Sam managed to get their share of
attention around town.
</P>
<P>
   Wymer also will tell you that this is a special group of women,
and the training they received 50 years ago at Good Samaritan _
before the big, new medical center dwarfed the old hospital behind
it _ were top-notch even by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which opened in 1923 and closed in 1961, offered a
three-year nursing education that was more hands-on than other
programs. It included off-campus instruction for tuberculosis
nursing in Orlando, psychiatric nursing in Chattahoochee and a
month at the Palm Beach Crippled Children's Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got theory in junior college. We got practical on-the-job
training,'' says Marylou Garner Rogers Smith, who later became the
first director of nurses for the Martin County Public Health Unit.
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital, the student nurses were assigned patients and
worked the wards in crisp white uniforms, white shoes and white
caps.
</P>
<P>
   About those caps: Each nursing school's has a unique style _ the
difference is in the fold. The women in the class of 1950 had their
``capping ceremony'' after six months of probation, and they still
remember how special they felt that day.
</P>
<P>
   Few nurses wear their caps anymore, of course. Times have
changed, and so has the dress code at most hospitals. ``It took me
a long time to break down,'' says Wheat, who spent most of her
career at Good Samaritan. ``To me, that gave me _ this is kind of
corny _ that was my dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   The cap isn't the only thing that's changed over the years, and
the changes haven't always been for the better, Wymer and the
nurses say. Things have gone from ``high touch to high tech,'' and
they worry about what's been lost. ``This is the age of
specialty,'' says Haddock. ``Then, there weren't the specialties _
pediatrics, the ICU, the ER.'' Good Samaritan didn't have an
intensive care unit. ``So no matter how traumatized the patients
were, we took care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest and care the nurses gave their first patients is
evident in the photographs they've included in their yearbook and
scrapbooks. Along with shots of the beach and their dorm rooms,
there are photos of them cuddling babies in the hospital nursery
and swimming with patients from the Crippled Children's Clinic.
Notes from former patients thank them for their kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, the patient came first,'' Wheat says. ``Now, the
paperwork comes first. That's the reason I retired.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they all say they encourage both women and men to follow
in their footsteps. And each puts her money where her mouth is,
donating generously to the John F. Wymer Jr. Endowed Professorship
in Nursing at Florida Atlantic University.
</P>
<P>
   They also say _ and this is perhaps the most significant sign
that the school did a good job preparing them for a challenging
career _ they'd do it all again. Nursing isn't an easy profession,
it isn't financially rewarding, and few find fame. But it has its
own rewards, the women of the Class of 1950 agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love each other,'' Foster says. ``And we loved what we were
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   So together they celebrated 50 years of friendship _ and three
unforgettable years of learning that sent them on their way.

endured a ban on its beef by European nations. But what is alarming
in France is that the numbers are going up, given that preventive
measures were put into place in 1991 and then even stricter ones
were ordered in 1996. By Suzanne Daley.

   GERMANY-BRITAIN-MARKETS (London) _ The London and Frankfurt
stock exchanges announced plans for a full merger and an alliance
with New York's tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange on Wednesday, seeking to
build a pan-European trading heavyweight and a 24-hour global
market in new economy stocks _ both unthinkable only a few years
ago. The combined exchange will be Europe's biggest by far. The
announcement offered the most dramatic evidence to date of a
sea-change in European markets, driven by a clamor among investors
for cheaper trading, a challenge from Internet-based and electronic
trading systems and an increasing trend to treat Europe as a single
investment arena following the introduction of the euro. By Alan

   SCI-AUTISM (Undated) _ Children who become autistic or mentally

high levels of four brain chemicals that can be detected the day
they are born with a blood test, scientists reported. Since each of
these chemicals plays a major role in constructing animal brains,
the finding supports what many experts believe may be the root
cause of both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present
from birth. By Sandra Blakeslee.

   SCI-ANTIROCKET-LASER (Undated) _ The Israeli Defense Ministry
formally announced Wednesday that it would deploy an advanced laser
system along the northern border that would be capable of shooting
down guerilla rockets after Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon this
summer. Dan Weinreich, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said that the
$250 million system is in the final stages of testing in the United
States and Israel. Designed and built by a California defense
contractor, TRW, for Israel and the U.S. Army, the powerful laser

BROKERS FIND A NICHE ESCORTING NOVICES INTO THE WORLD OF EBAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<P>
   Liz Parella had a big problem. She needed to sell a Baldwin baby
grand piano that was taking up too much space in her New York City
apartment. She got in touch with an antiques dealer, but the dealer
offered her only $1,000, far less than what she thought the piano
was worth.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, Parella, a secretary at a financial management firm,
saw a magazine advertisement for an eBay broker service. Although
she knew about online auctions, at that point she had never used
the Internet. On a whim, she decided to give the broker a call and
subsequently entered the online auction market by proxy.
</P>
<P>
   As the term implies, eBay brokers photograph, list, sell and
ship auction items for people who cannot do it themselves or do not
want to. Some people, like Parella, say they do not have the online
know-how needed to list an item for sale. Others just want to avoid
what they consider to be the hassle of posting, selling and
shipping items.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Temkin, the eBay broker who sold Parella's piano, said: ``I
got the idea from observing that a lot of people I knew were
interested in selling things online but just didn't have the time.
We live in a very service-driven society. I've been a booker at
Ford Models; I've sold real estate. I've always been involved in
customer service. This is just another way of using my talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Temkin, a full-time eBay broker in New York, charges a flat-rate
listing fee of $10 and a 25 percent commission on each item's sale
price (with no extra charge for eBay's fees). The listing fee is
nonrefundable even if an item does not sell, and that happens
frequently, especially with items that have high reserve prices,
the lowest prices sellers say they will take.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike antiques dealers or secondhand-goods dealers, Temkin does
not set prices. She lets customers decide how much they want for
each item. If they do not know, she will help them find reputable
appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   Temkin, who said she was doing very well with her business,
specializes in expensive items like jewelry and art. She will not
accept items like $5 Beanie Babies or $50 home furnishings. ``By
the time someone pays my commission and listing fee, it would cost
them more than if they just gave it away to charity,'' Temkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike and Cheryl DeWolfe, brokers in Victoria, British Columbia,
also limit the types of items they list. They specialize in store
liquidations and collectibles and have sold board games,
knickknacks and figurines on eBay for clients, most of whom find
them through word-of-mouth. Mike DeWolfe also runs a Web
development service.
</P>
<P>
   The DeWolfes have expanded their eBay business to include buyer
services. A customer, usually a collector, can hire them to find a
specific item and purchase it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife goes online for a customer _ she can usually get an
item cheaper online for a collector than she can if she buys it
locally, even with our commission,'' DeWolfe said. The DeWolfes'
commission is 50 percent of the seller's profit on an item. They
spend 30 to 35 hours each week scrutinizing eBay's millions of
listings and buying and selling items for customers.
</P>
<P>
   The DeWolfes also cater to clients with items too inexpensive
for them to list. They offer such customers coaching and computer
templates that make it easy to post items on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Brokering is more of a sideline for Steve Eaton, the owner of
the Hotlink Cyber Cafe in Romeo, Mich. Eaton, who advertises his
service in the local newspaper, and his store manager, Amber Mills,
sell items like wall hangings, Pokemon cards and computer equipment
for customers. Most of their customers are, like Parella was,
people who have never been online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers can come in, bring their item, and we take care of
everything,'' Eaton said. ``We scan or photograph the item, take
care of the posting and bidding process and handle the payment and
shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the commission and listing fees, which are much higher
than the 1.25 percent to 5 percent commission and listing fee of 25
cents to $2 that eBay charges, most eBay broker users come out
ahead, compared with what they would pay an offline consignment
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Most consignment stores charge a commission of 30 percent to 50
percent, based on each item's sale price. Most will not take large
items, like the piano that Parella sold. And upscale auction
houses, like Christie's and Sotheby's, will not bother with
inexpensive items.
</P>
<P>
   Although eBay brokers are starting to be seen across the
country, their services are not available directly through eBay,
said Matt Bannick, the company's vice president for product and
community. Instead, eBay will integrate a question-and-answer
service offered by Keen.com into the eBay site so users can help
others. Under a three-year agreement announced on Tuesday, eBay
users will be able to pay a fee for answers to questions about how
to list and buy items.
</P>
<P>
   Bannick said eBay's community boards also offered help. ``People
can post questions, and other users post responses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Parella is pleased with her experiences with an eBay
broker. Two weeks after the antiques dealer offered her $1,000, her
piano sold for just under $4,000 on eBay. Since listing her piano,
Parella has used Temkin's service six additional times to list two
Japanese woodblock prints, two handbags, a necklace and a bracelet.
Although only four of her seven items sold, Parella said she would
use the eBay broker service again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For items that she wouldn't be interested in selling, we might
do it ourselves,'' Parella said. ``But using someone like Liz, who
is extremely professional and kept us from having to deal with
e-mail and all the bother, is a real time saver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful to sell things and get rid of stuff. Downsizing
is great when you're not just throwing things away.''

<P>
   Ten years ago, the computer industry gave desktop computer
owners a choice of options when it came to printers. But it was
pretty much a Henry Ford kind of choice: You could print in any
color as long as it was black.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, most people used typewriter-style daisy-wheel
printers or clacking dot-matrix printers to put ink on paper. If
you wanted a silent printer, your cheapest option was an inkjet
machine _ and back then, that would cost you more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like most computer hardware, inkjet printers have plummeted in
price. New models start at less than $200 and are soon discounted
below $100. Some computer dealers give inkjet printers away as
bonuses with the purchase of new computers.
</P>
<P>
   As the costs have gone down, the print quality has improved.
Many inkjet printers can produce color pages that are almost
indistinguishable from photographs. The quality is so high, in
fact, that inkjet printers are widely cited as one of the reasons
the U.S. Treasury has been redesigning its paper currency in the
past few years _ it was becoming too easy to print passable
counterfeit bills with a good inkjet machine.
</P>
<P>
   It is strange that a technology that produces such sophisticated
results began with an accident involving a soldering iron. The
story goes that in 1977, an engineer at Canon put a hot soldering
iron a little too close to an ink-filled syringe. The heat boiled a
tiny amount of the ink in the needle, making it expand into a gas.
That pushed some ink out of the tip of the needle.
</P>
<P>
   The physics behind this accident became the foundation of what
Canon called bubble jet technology, a printing technique in which
electrical resistors heat up tiny bubbles of ink, pushing ink
droplets through an array of hair-thin nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   Other inkjet printer makers, including Hewlett-Packard, Lexmark
and Xerox, have adapted Canon's thermal technology for their own
printer lines, adding enhancements (and patents) along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Another printer manufacturer, Epson America, developed its own
variation on the theme. Epson printers use piezoelectric crystals
to do the job of the bubbles in inkjet printers. Piezo elements
change shape when subjected to an electric charge; they are used in
loudspeakers to convert signals from a stereo tuner into sound
waves. In Epson's line of inkjet printers, microscopic piezo
elements subjected to tiny charges are distorted, pushing out tiny
droplets of ink.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is more to inkjet printing than the firings of
microscopic squirt guns. It is a complicated dance of motors that
move a print head with 300 to 600 nozzles across a sheet of paper,
squirting 5,000 or more droplets of ink per second in a precise
minute pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Most color inkjet printers use four colors of ink: cyan (a pale
blue), magenta, yellow and black. They are combined to create all
the colors the eye sees in a finished printout. To orchestrate this
technique, the computer that is attached to the printer uses driver
software that determines the exact color for each dot that will
appear on the page. It then figures out how many droplets of each
ink color must fall on each dot on the page to make that color.
Even when printing at 300 dots per inch (a fairly modest
resolution), a letter-size page is more than 2,000 dots wide.
</P>
<P>
   Since photographic prints contain the most complicated shades of
color, it is a huge mathematical task for the software to figure
out the combination of ink colors needed for each dot. And
rendering that subtle color with only four inks can be slow. That
is one reason why manufacturers are producing desktop printers
specifically for photographic printing. These printers use six ink
colors, adding paler shades of cyan and magenta to help create
realistic halftones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that precision, inkjet printers must contend with
one great unknown that can radically affect the look of a printout:
the paper it is printed on.
</P>
<P>
   With the quick-drying inks that Epson, Hewlett-Packard and
others use and the tiny ink drops that current printers squirt out,
it is possible to get decent text and spot colors even on cheap
photocopier paper. But big blocks of color, as in photos, can soak
and buckle thin paper stock. The higher contrast and lower
absorbency of brilliant white inkjet paper handles color better.
And naturally, the best results of all come from glossy
photographic paper (which is what you would hope for after paying
the premium price of about a dollar a sheet for it).
</P>
<P>
   You can ensure good results by tinkering with the software
settings. If inkjet software can calculate how much yellow and
magenta and cyan ink to spit onto a dot the thickness of a human
hair, you can be sure that it can adjust that calculation for more
or less absorbent paper. Most printer driver software provides a
setting for different paper types, so when you put inkjet or photo
paper into the tray, make sure that you adjust the software to
compensate for it. Just don't do it to print facsimiles of
currency.

 &HT;    Shear agony
 &HT;    By Marija B. Vader
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It's spring: sheepshearing time in the
Rockies' verdant valleys.
</P>
<P>
   At Oscar Wyatt's Morapos Ranch, nestled in an oxbow of the White
River between Meeker and Rangely, sheepshearing takes on an
international flavor.
</P>
<P>
   For one week each year a flock of international shearers,
including many New Zealanders, clips the wool of some 7,000 sheep
here to prepare the animals for lambing season and summertime
mountain grazing.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign voices seem incongruous in the bucolic setting _
placid rolling hills, stretching for miles to the base of rugged
peaks, even a quaint, red log house for the ranch manager.
</P>
<P>
   On the sheepshearing platform, there is no idle chatter.
</P>
<P>
   Bent at the waist, New Zealander Jimmy Clark seems to work a
dance with each sheep, moving his electric hand shearer quickly,
but gently and gracefully, over the animal from head to hoof, while
a perpetual drop of perspiration poises indeterminately at the tip
of his nose.
</P>
<P>
   During the time a nearby boom box blasts Led Zeppelin's
``Stairway to Heaven,'' Clark sheds two sheep of their fleece.
</P>
<P>
   The shearers enjoy loud music with a heavy beat, perhaps to
drown out the interminable drone of the electric shears. Sheep
after sheep after sheep, 12 shearers work in a nonstop, no-nonsense
methodical, mechanical manner.
</P>
<P>
   These guys aren't the big, bulky men one might think they'd be
from the hard physical work of manhandling that many sheep. They're
tall but wiry, strong but slender, and constantly bent at the
waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything hurts when you learn to shear _ your hands, back,
legs, arms, but you get fit to it,'' says New Zealander Stuart
Caldwell, 36 and in his 12th year shearing on the international
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have three years of pain, then you get over it,'' agrees
Keith Oliver, at age 48 the oldest in the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disease, shearing,'' Caldwell adds with his thick Kiwi
accent. ``Once you get it, you're hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lifestyle's good. It's hard sometimes to put the finger on
it, but you always meet new people all over the world,'' Caldwell
says. ``It keeps us alive. No one's getting rich. We keep coming
back, we've got to.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it makes the beer taste better afterwards,'' he adds,
grinning. ``We do play fairly well, too. We go into town _ there's
always something to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   But while working, the quick shearers take only a few brief
moments to clip the fleece from the beast, nudge it off the
shearing platform, then reach for yet another sheep from a chute
that feeds the shearing wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the shears slip, clipping a bit of skin, leaving a red
bloody streak on the white wool.
</P>
<P>
   Some sheep appear dazed as they leap off the platform, as if
asking, ``What just happened to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Others scamper off to huddle with their sheep pals, bleating.
</P>
<P>
   Shearers are paid by the piece _ $1.50 per fleece, while the
backup crew of fleece handlers and the press operator split 21
cents per fleece.
</P>
<P>
   That's good money, especially when quick shearers clip up to 250
sheep a day.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell bought a house last month in his hometown of Piopio, on
the north island, but he hasn't moved in yet because he was
shearing sheep in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend lives in England, the group's next stop on the
shearing world tour.
</P>
<P>
   From there, he'll venture on to Wales, Australia, and then to
his new home, where the shearing season lasts through the Northern
Hemisphere's winter.
</P>
<P>
   The shearers realize the limitations of the physical work and
say that's one deterrent to attracting young people to the line of
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do it forever. There's not enough money in it and
it's hard physical work,'' Oliver says. ``If something better comes
along, you hang up your handpiece and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   To greener pastures.

MORE THAN PUSHING THE ENVELOPE FOR CREATIVE VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (Editors: product notes at end of article)  
 By PETER OLAFSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soldier of Fortune'' does not simply push the envelope for
computer-game violence. It seals the envelope, stamps it and posts
it, then empties a clip into the mailbox for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   In fundamentals, this new first-person shooter developed by
Raven Software doesn't appear significantly different from similar
games on the market. Cast as a mercenary on the trail of stolen
nuclear warheads, the player explores a hostile three-dimensional
environment through 26 game levels spread over 10 missions, lays
waste to a host of enemies and uses an array of weapons and
supplies to clear a path.
</P>
<P>
   The twist: You can inflict wounds with unprecedented
specificity. In most shooters, every hit to an enemy does the same
amount of damage, regardless of its location on that enemy's body.
(For instance, in Nova Logic's recent Special Forces shooter,
``Delta Force 2,'' you can kill enemies as effectively by shooting
them in the foot as in the head.)
</P>
<P>
   However, 1998 releases like ``Sin,'' ``Vigilance'' and ``Tom
Clancy's Rainbow Six'' introduced the concept of ``one shot, one
kill'' _ with wounds to the head instantly fatal _ and ``Soldier of
Fortune'' extends this conceit to the rest of the virtual body. An
enhanced version of Id Software's ``Quake II'' game engine allows
the player to hit 26 zones on the polygonal enemy bodies, with
results that range from the disturbing to the practical.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with all the violence options enabled, I shot off
enemies' legs in the opening level in the New York subways. I shot
off arms aboard a speeding freight train in southern Africa. I left
chests and groins spattered with blood in the Kosovo sewers. (When
enemies fell forward, I could see the exit wounds.) In an Iraqi
marketplace, guts poked out of the hole I had drilled in an enemy's
midsection. In Siberia, I liberated some heads from their bodies
and reduced others to something resembling partially eaten apples.
</P>
<P>
   And when I finished a level, I was provided with a checklist of
carnage performed, including ``throat shots,'' ``head shots'' and,
ahem, ``nether region shots.'' These are unusual things for a
computer game to be adding up.
</P>
<P>
   Does the game go too far? Initially, I would have said yes. How
many ways should you really see an enemy's head explode? (``Soldier
of Fortune'' is not suited for children. Parents and the squeamish
will be grateful for a password-protected filter that allows users
to disable five violent elements in the full-violence version. A
``tactical low-violence'' version is also available in which the
filter is permanently enabled.)
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that once you've seen one screaming soldier
with his leg shot off, you've seen them all. The effects are
shocking the first few times around, and then they begin to recede
into the body of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is something to be said for a game that offers
enduring evidence of the player's passage through the game world.
Details like bullet holes and bloodstains on walls helped make
``Duke Nukem 3D'' a huge hit in the mid-'90s, and it might be
argued that ``Soldier of Fortune'' represents the next bloody
footstep in this trend.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of violence isn't the only creative twist. Soldier
takes a novel approach to saved games. Saves are snapshots of the
player's position, which enable one to resume play from a given
point at a later time. Most three-dimensional shooters allow saves
at any point during the game _ a strategy that allows players to
finish games more easily, but one that, when abused, can squeeze
the fun out of a game by sacrificing its challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Soldier gears the number of saves allowed within a game level to
the difficulty level selected at the start of a new game _ from
unlimited at the Effortless level to five at the Medium level to
none at the Unfair level. At the harder levels, this turns saving
from a simple reflex into a strategic decision. Can you finish the
rest of an unseen level with the available saves?  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Soldier also takes a step toward addressing reduced capacity
in injured enemies. In most games, enemies simply pound away at the
player until they are killed, regardless of the level of damage
they have taken. Soldier of Fortune interrupts this cycle. A shot
to the leg may leave a live enemy hopping on one foot, and the
hopping means that at least for the moment, the enemy isn't
shooting at the player. You can also force enemies to drop their
weapons and surrender or flee the field. The game in which enemies
and the player lose proficiency as they take damage still awaits
us, but in the meantime, it's agreeable to find other ways to
resolve combat.
</P>
<P>
   Gore finds its justification only in what it adds to game play,
and when the novelty of blood-spouting necks wore off, I found
myself wishing this advanced damage model had served as inspiration
for other elements of the game. The creators seem so taken with the
depictions of violence that they have neglected the fear and dread
that the carnage should inspire in its victims and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies with such diverse vulnerabilities should be smart enough
to better protect their nether regions _ they are little more than
the usual bunch of dumb bunnies _ and engagements should be smaller
and more tactical. After all, when you are going up against an army
of enemies who are all blazing away at you, you don't have time to
try for critical hits. All you can do is survive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these shortcomings are a sign that although the
developer has surely pushed the envelope, it hasn't finished
addressing it.

WOULD A BREAKUP MATTER?

<P>
   The Proposed Final Judgment in the case of the United States vs.
Microsoft Corp. is on the Internet at
www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ms(underscore)index.htm
</P>
<P>
   Less than a decade ago the preceding sentence would have
indicated that the reporter had fallen asleep in mid-sentence and
smashed his forehead onto the keyboard. Today, however, we
instantly recognize the gibberish as a World Wide Web address.
</P>
<P>
   As if you haven't already read or heard enough about the
proposal to cleave Microsoft, you can follow the link and view the
document in one of three formats: in Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML), which requires a standard Web browser; in Adobe's Portable
Document Format (PDF), which requires a free program called Acrobat
Reader; or as a WordPerfect document (WPD), which requires any word
processing program that can read WordPerfect files. Besides the
government's petulance in not making the document available in the
popular Microsoft Word's .doc format, what do you notice?
</P>
<P>
   The operating system does not matter. HTML is the common
language of the Web, and it is operating system-agnostic. Adobe
Reader can handle 13 different operating systems, including
Windows, Macintosh, OS/2, Unix and Linux, and 14 different
languages.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system is just the dial tone that you need to make
a call to the Internet. Just as any phone company can provide the
dial tone for a telephone these days, any company _ not just
Microsoft _ can provide the operating system for an
Internet-connected device.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Windows is not a requirement to use the
Internet. And that worries Microsoft far more than the dubious
proposal made last week by the Justice Department and 17 states to
break up the company into two companies. One would be based on
operating systems, and the other would be based on a gaggle of
applications that include Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, the
MSN network and the Microsoft Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is moving so fast that by the time this legal mess is
resolved, consumers may not even notice or care whether Microsoft
is one company, two, or 57. The Internet, not the desktop computer,
is becoming the center of power. Consumers will routinely tap into
the Internet not just from personal computers, but from a variety
of devices, including smart phones, handheld computers, Internet
appliances, Web pads, television sets, ATM machines and automobile
dashboards.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has no monopoly in this world of Internet-enabled
devices, and almost no chance of creating a monopoly even if it
ultimately wins its court case. When people decide to go online to
read the latest headlines, check their e-mail or trade stocks,
chances are that they do not pause to consider their operating
systems. They may think ``AOL'' or ``WebTV'' or even ``browser,''
but when it comes down to it, I suspect that most people do not
care whether their Internet access devices are powered by Windows,
Linux, BeOS, America Online, Sprint, DoCoMo, Palm OS, Java, Odwalla
juice or hamsters on a treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users are a special case. They care passionately about
the Mac OS and would rewire their own bodies to run on Mac OS X if
such a thing were possible. But for most other people, the
operating system is about as significant in their daily lives as
the plumbing system.
</P>
<P>
   In no way is this argument intended to diminish the findings
that Microsoft violated federal and state antitrust laws through
its predatory behavior, which in turn was fostered by its Windows
monopoly. A lot of people lost jobs and money when Microsoft
unfairly bullied rival companies out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it suggest that personal computers are on the wane. PC
sales have never been more robust, in fact. Microsoft still puts
its plumbing in more than 90 percent of all new desktops and
laptops. When the PC first emerged as an alternative to big,
expensive mainframe computers, I compared it to the small mammals
that eventually inherited the world from the dinosaurs. Is the PC
now itself a dinosaur? No way. But insects outnumber even the
mammals, and cell phones outsell desktop computers by a big margin.
In several countries, cell phones outsell even regular phones.
Phones that surf the Web and handle e-mail are just around the
corner, and Microsoft has the wrong number.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of conjecture about what impact the
proposed breakup of Microsoft would have on people who use personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   First, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is under no obligation to
accept the proposed remedy. He may decide that disintegrating
Microsoft is a fundamentally dumb idea, given that the integration
of new features into software, and the integration of one piece of
software with another, is the goal of every other company in the
industry. He may decide instead to fine Microsoft several bazillion
dollars for making annoying software. (If I were judge, I'd fine
them a billion dollars just for trying to foist Microsoft Bob on an
unsuspecting public. And I'd fine them another billion for that
silly ``Where Do You Want to Go Today?'' marketing tag.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, Microsoft will appeal whatever remedy the judge
proposes, with all the legal firepower at its disposal. A higher
court could reverse Jackson's ruling. Meanwhile, a breakup order
would be stayed until all appeals are concluded, which could take a
couple of years. If you think it takes a long time for Windows 98
to boot up and shut down, just wait until you see the Windows
appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the appeals could extend well past the election of a new
administration, and a new attorney general might be more inclined
to settle the case instead of pursuing a breakup, even though the
state cases could remain active.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the chances of Microsoft being broken up are zero,''
said Mark Anderson, author of the influential Strategic News
Service newsletter (www.stratnews.com), which has an admirable
track record for technology forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's president, Steven Ballmer, vows that the company
will never be broken up. In a letter published in newspaper ads
earlier this week, Ballmer wrote that the proposed remedy would
``send a signal that companies in America that are `too' successful
will be punished harshly _ a signal that will be welcomed by
foreign competitors seeking to overtake America's global leadership
in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a half-century after General Motors made the
same arrogant argument, Microsoft is saying that what's good for
Microsoft is good for America.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Japanese carmakers clobbered General Motors in the
1970s and 1980s, not because GM was hamstrung by unreasonable
government regulations, but because it failed to react to the
changing market caused by the demand for smaller, less expensive
and more fuel-efficient cars. Today you may be driving a car made
by a company you had never heard of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The software market is now in a corresponding upheaval because
of the rising demand for access to the Internet through small,
inexpensive devices. A few years from now, you may be connecting to
the Internet using software from companies that you don't hear much
about today.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the dial tone was always provided by AT&AMP;T. Today
there is so much competition that obnoxious calls from phone
companies are as much a part of the dinner hour as family
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1987, there was an opportunity for companies
besides Microsoft to dominate the market for personal computer
operating systems. Apple's Mac OS was at its peak, and IBM's OS/2
was superior to Windows in many ways. But both Apple and IBM
blundered, and Microsoft seized power.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's monopoly on personal computer operating systems
seems bulletproof, even in the unlikely event that the government
succeeds in its plan to give the software giant a lobotomy,
separating the left-brain lobe (operating systems) from the
right-brain lobe (applications). But even without the surgery,
Microsoft is in no way assured of dominating the Internet era in
the same way it has dominated the PC era.

FERTILITY RATE DOWN SHARPLY IN POST-COMMUNIST EUROPE, U.N.
REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The collapse of communism in 1989
produced a rapid and sharp drop in the fertility rate throughout
Eastern and Central Europe that could reduce the region's
population nearly 20 percent by the year 2050, according to a
United Nations report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With political collapse and economic uncertainty, many women
almost immediately stopped having children or decided to delay
motherhood, according to the report by the U.N. Economic Commission
for Europe, part of a larger economic survey of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And in more developed countries, the transition to capitalism
has produced new economic opportunities for both women and men,
making early childbearing less common.
</P>
<P>
   A result will be a smaller labor pool and a quickly aging
population, said Miroslav Macura, the chief of the population unit
the prepared the report. With the rise in emigration and at least
temporary increases in mortality rates in large parts of the
region, which includes Russia and the European parts of the former
Soviet Union, he said, a population of some 307 million could fall
to about 250 million in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   With the fall of communism, real incomes have declined in the
region and are only slowly recovering, with larger gaps between
rich and poor. At the same time, governments have cut back support
for families with children, while services like day-care centers
have become private or more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been impoverished and decided that having kids at
a time of poverty and misery is not the right thing to do, so they
cut back,'' Macura said in a telephone interview from Geneva.
``This is family downsizing comparable to company downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe is also facing reductions in the fertility rate _
which measures the average number of children born to women of
childbearing age _ and an aging population, which is raising the
prospect of an economy without enough young, skilled workers to
grow and pay for the rising number of pensioners. The answer is
likely to be more immigration from Central and Eastern Europe,
which may create new political problems in Western Europe and
further diminish the skilled work force to the east.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern and Central Europe, the decline in the birth rate is
much sharper than in Western Europe. When a population has a
fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, it replaces itself,
Macura said. But by 1997, the average fertility rate in the
transition economies was 1.37, a third lower than in 1988. In the
market economies of Western Europe, by contrast, the average rate
was 1.58.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rate fell most sharply after 1989 in the former East
Germany, where in 1993 the rate had dropped to 0.76. By 1998, it
had improved to 1.06, rising to a figure still smaller than both
Latvia and Bulgaria, whose birth rates had fallen to 1.09 and 1.11
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The more prosperous and developed countries of Central Europe
will make up some of their population decrease from new immigration
that will come from even poorer countries to their east, suggested
Tomas Kucera, a professor of demographics at Prague's Charles
University.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the large generation born in the early 1970s,
which is currently postponing motherhood, is likely not to postpone
it forever, especially as economies stabilize. But they will have
fewer children, often no more than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fertility will never again reach pre-1989 levels,'' Kucera
said. Given the high levels of unemployment and underemployment in
central and Eastern Europe, having fewer children is ``rational
economic behavior in some ways,'' Macura said. He suggests that in
Russia and many of the poorer states, a drop in the size of the
labor force will help. But he concedes that paying for the benefits
and illnesses of an aging population will be difficult, and that
some countries, like Russia, will see a sharp decline in its
population as a strategic threat to its influence and power.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite Russia's high mortality rate, women are still
having babies early in Russia, as well as in Ukraine and Belarus,
Macura said. The U.N. study projects Russia's population to decline
by 18 percent in the next 50 years, but the drop is relatively
small in percentage terms compared with Hungary, 25 percent,
Bulgaria and Latvia, both 31 percent, and Estonia, 34 percent.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration heavyweights went to Capitol
Hill Wednesday to pressure a divided House to approve permanent
trading rules for China.
</P>
<P>
   The secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture and Commerce and
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who negotiated the
trade deal with the Chinese, told the House Ways and Means
Committee that normalizing trade with China would reap economic and
political advantages for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said to deny permanent trade relations ``would be to
severely damage American trade interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be to set back the cause of reform in China. It would
be to risk, without cause, a fundamental deterioration in the U.S.
relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade legislation is one of the last major policy
initiatives of the Clinton administration, which is lobbying
feverishly for House approval. A vote is scheduled for the week of
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official acknowledged Wednesday that the
administration is 15 to 20 votes shy of the 218 needed for passage.
The Senate is expected to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, Congress has annually reviewed America's trading
status with China and granted Beijing the same privileges as most
other trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has selectively reduced tariffs on some products,
China has maintained high tariffs to protect its domestic
industries.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing has agreed to lower tariffs for all nations with
which it has a permanent trade agreement in order to gain admission
to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which oversees trade among
its member states. China's acceptance into the WTO is almost
assured, and it is expected to have permanent trade deals with
every other member nation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement negotiated by Barshefsky would reduce China's
tariffs on U.S. goods significantly while Chinese goods would
continue to flow into the United States under the same favorable
tariffs as before.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not approve the permanent agreement, China
would be able to continue charging high tariffs on American goods
while other nations would benefit from lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To forgo that opportunity (for low tariffs) would be to
inappropriately disadvantage American producers,'' Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers told the House panel. ``At a time when
it is a matter of great economic importance that we promote our
exports, this type of market-opening agreement is very much in the
national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said American farmers would
benefit from normalized trade ties with China. He recalled a trip
he had made to China in January where he saw in a supermarket
fruits from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese people really like what we are selling them,'' he
said. ``There will be a dramatic potential market there'' for
American goods.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House faces strong opposition from some of its
traditional Democratic allies, including organized labor and
environmental groups. They fear lax labor and environmental
standards will give Chinese producers advantages over American
companies and cost jobs in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The two highest-ranking Democrats in the House, Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri and the minority whip, David Bonior of
Michigan, are also against the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, noted that giving
support to the bill ``is not easy for my Democratic colleagues when
their two top leaders are opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill argue that the annual review of trade
relations with China gives the United States leverage to demand
that Beijing improve its treatment of political and religious
dissidents. But the administration officials dismissed that
criticism, noting that China's abuses have continued despite yearly
reviews. They said opening China's markets would open China to U.S.
values as well.
</P>
<P>
   The annual review ``doesn't really accomplish, I believe, what
needs to be accomplished to see effective and sustained reform in
China,'' Barshefsky said. ``The cementing of a reformist element in
China, which is what (permanent trade) will do will provide far
greater leverage than an annual process.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley responded to critics who say
China won't live up to the agreement by announcing a department
initiative that will begin immediately. It will monitor trade with
China and teach American businesses about their trading rights.
</P>
<P>
   China's ``track record, frankly, has been mixed,'' Daley said.
But he added that the Chinese ``do want to join the WTO and follow
the rules.''

&HT;     COMPANIES DISCUSSED CLOSING SAN FRANCISCO DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Subs grafs 3-4 to add restraining order denied; pickup:
Alioto contended.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corp. and rival Chronicle Publishing
Co. quietly discussed several plans to avoid competing against each
other, including one in which Hearst would shut its San Francisco
Examiner in exchange for a share of the San Francisco Chronicle's
profits ``in perpetuity,'' a Chronicle executive has testified.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Sias, president and chief executive officer of Chronicle
Publishing, also testified Tuesday that consultants had said the
Examiner could compete independently against the Chronicle. But
Sias said he doubted the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Sias testified during the trial stemming from an antitrust
lawsuit that seeks to block Hearst's $660 million purchase of the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, the lawyer for the plaintiff, requested a
restraining order barring Hearst from taking adverse action against
any employee for testifying in the case. U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker denied the request Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto's request cited Hearst's decision Tuesday to place
Examiner publisher Timothy O. White on indefinite leave after
White's testimony Monday that he had offered San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown favorable editorials in return for Brown's support of
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended Hearst executives had known the substance of
White's testimony for months, because White gave similar sworn
statements to the U.S. Department of Justice, which was reviewing
the proposed purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd that Hearst took this kind of action against White
for saying something true that they knew about,'' Alioto said.
``That puts a chilling effect on anyone else we might call to
testify from Hearst or the Chronicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by Clint Reilly, a developer and
unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner. The lawsuit claims Hearst's
plan to purchase The Chronicle and sell its smaller afternoon
Examiner to a local publishing company will result in Hearst's
having an illegal newspaper monopoly in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst denies the claim, saying the Examiner is an economically
failing business that could not survive outside its current
profit-sharing agreement with the Chronicle, and that closing it or
selling it, therefore, could not violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier Tuesday whether White's comments on the stand were
a surprise to Hearst Corp. officials, spokesman Paul Luthringer
said, ``I'm not going to comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   White appeared in court Tuesday morning, but left soon after
Hearst lawyers chose not to question him. They said they might
question him later when they put on their defense. White was
questioned Monday by Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto sought Tuesday to elicit testimony from Sias showing the
Examiner was not a failing business, and that Hearst and Chronicle
Publishing negotiated to avoid future economic competition with
each other as rival morning newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Sias acknowledged that Martin Jaffe, Chronicle Publishing's
chief financial officer, had done a study showing the Examiner
could compete independently against the Chronicle with what Alioto
called ``a high degree of success.'' But Sias said, ``We did not
give it any credence. My reaction was this was totally
unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Alioto introduced a confidential April 6, 1996, memo from Sias
to Patricia Tobin, a member of the Chronicle's board of directors,
that discussed a deal in which Hearst would sell or close the
Examiner in return for 34 percent of the Chronicle's profits ``in
perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ongoing discussion we are trying to get a sense of the
final conditions under which Hearst would agree to close the
Examiner,'' Sias noted in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's owners were negotiating with Hearst because they
were unhappy with the joint operating agreement, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have had the
agreement to share printing, advertising and circulation. They
split profits after joint costs, then each pays the cost of their
separate editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Such agreements are an exception to antitrust laws, and are
allowed by the Newspaper Preservation Act, which is meant to keep
alive newspapers in danger of failing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle owners were displeased with the agreement because
although their larger morning paper generated 80 percent of total
revenue, they were required to share it evenly with the Examiner,
Sias testified.
</P>
<P>
   New York-Hearst announced Aug. 6, 1999, that it would buy the
Chronicle and sell or merge the Examiner into the larger newspaper.
The Justice Department has approved the deal.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will combine with slow-moving low pressure to promote
thundershowers with areas of heavy rain from eastern parts of Texas
and Oklahoma to the southern parts of the Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys. Local flooding will occur, especially where the ground has
been saturated by recent rain. Farther east, scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will form in the increasingly humid air from the
Tennessee Valley to the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Northeast will begin a protracted warm spell as
breezes from the southwest circulate around a sprawling
high-pressure system. Late Thursday, scattered thundershowers will
erupt from the eastern Ohio Valley to the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build beneath sunny skies from the western Plains to
the northern Mississippi Valley. Afternoon readings near 90 degrees
will be common.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: MICROBURST
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane reconnaissance aircraft, which usually flies
unscathed into the most powerful storms on earth, was damaged by
high winds late Monday while on the ground in Galveston, Texas. The
violent gusts were caused by a microburst, a channel of
fast-sinking air less than 2 miles in diameter. As falling
raindrops evaporate far above the ground, the surrounding chilled
air plunges to earth. Like water running from a tap and striking
the sink below, the downward-rushing air spreads out on impact,
sometimes reaching speeds of more than 150 mph.

IN IRANIAN COURT, ACCUSED ASSASSINS CALL VICTIM AN ENEMY OF ISLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a packed courtroom covered with flowery
carpets, two smiling young men told a judge Wednesday that they had
decided to shoot one of the country's leading reformers because
they believed that he was corrupt and an enemy of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, in which eight men are charged in the attempted
assassination of the reformer, Saeed Hajjarian, an editor and
political strategist close to President Mohammad Khatami, has
mesmerized this city.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian's plight is the most vivid illustration of the
setbacks suffered recently by Iran's reformers. The bearded young
men who say they attacked him out of religious zeal are seen as an
ominous reminder of the violence that lurks under the surface of
Iran's political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in a courtroom in the southern city of Shiraz,
two of the 13 Jewish men charged with spying for Israel confessed
Wednesday to charges of espionage, according to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The admissions do not prove the government's case, the lawyers
said, because no evidence has been presented to show that the men
disclosed classified information. In all, three of the accused men
_ all of those brought to trial so far in two days of closed
hearings _ have now said they spied for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   They and most of their co-defendants have been in prison for 15
months but were able to consult with lawyers only three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both trials are being heard in Revolutionary Courts, the branch
of Iran's legal system that deals with political and moral
offenses, drug trafficking and crimes involving national security.
In those courts, the judge investigates, brings charges, prosecutes
and renders a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The Hajjarian trial is being held in open court attended by
several hundred people, with a large yellow banner reading ``The
Judiciary Is the Axis of the Islamic System'' stretched across one
corner. The spy case is taking place with only the defendants and
their lawyers present, despite the protests of family members and
human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   But both proceedings have focused unusual attention, in Iran and
outside, on the quality of justice that victims and defendants
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian was shot once in the face on March 12 by a man who
fled on the type of high-powered motorcycle reserved for members of
Iran's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, security officials said that ``rogue elements''
within their ranks had assassinated democracy advocates. No one has
yet gone on trial for those killings. One security official who was
arrested died in prison while awaiting trial. The authorities said
he had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The two defendants who have testified so far in the Hajjarian
case maintained that they were not part of any official group and
knew each other only through a neighborhood vigilante squad that
had assigned itself the job of attacking those they believed to be
un-Islamic.
</P>
<P>
   They said they had been encouraged to shoot Hajjarian by a third
associate who had convinced them that the reformer was an enemy of
religion. Hajjarian was released from the hospital late Tuesday, in
a wheelchair and with a bullet still in his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting raised alarms in Iran about the effect of recent
statements of several leading conservative clerics and members of
the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is controlled by the clergy.
In speeches and communiques, the hard-liners have justified
violence against anyone who opposes the Islamic system of
government and have labeled many reformers as anti-Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In the present charged atmosphere, in which the reformers who
won a sweeping victory in first-round voting for Parliament in
February have been arrested and jailed for insulting Islam, such
talk is dangerous, reform leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement quoted Wednesday by the official Iranian press
agency, Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's brother and leader
of the reform coalition that swept the polls, said those advocating
violence in the name of religion harm Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advocates of violence under the current situation present a
tarnished image of Islam,'' he said, adding that ``Islam, with such
friends, needs no other foes.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for that view was not on display when two of the eight
men charged in the Hajjarian shooting took the stand Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Asgar, 20, the confessed gunman, said in the first session
of the trial last week that he believed he was performing his
``religious duties'' by shooting Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
   In the second session Wednesday, he said he had not even known
what Hajjarian looked like and had needed a signal from one of his
friends to point him out on a crowded street outside the Tehran
city hall. On that signal, Asgar told the court, he walked up to
his victim and fired once, then rode away on a waiting motorcycle
driven by an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Some distance away, he removed the extra pair of pants he was
wearing _ so as not to be recognized by witnesses, he explained. He
then went to a movie theater and later paid his water bill at a
local bank before heading home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really want to kill him,'' Asgar said. ``The
agreement between us was to beat him up.'' He added that he did not
know why the plan was changed.
</P>
<P>
   A second man, Mohsen Majidi, said he had provided the motorcycle
and the gun in for the shooting. He said a third friend, who has
not yet testified, urged the attack on Hajjarian. ``He came to my
place and criticized him as a symbol of vice and said he was doing
stuff against the Islamic system,'' Majidi told the court.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The casual attitude of the defendants appeared to puzzle even
the Revolutionary Court judge, who ordered psychiatric evaluations
earlier this week of the eight defendants. The examination, a
doctor told the court, found them all sane and responsible for
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of the defendants in the espionage trial in Shiraz
has also puzzled many observers, including their lawyers, human
rights activists and foreign diplomats monitoring the intensely
watched trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after the first closed hearing, Hamid Tefileen, a
shoe store clerk who is the accused ringleader of the spy network,
confessed to spying first in Revolutionary Court and then in an
interview on state television. He said he has visited Israel, where
his mother and two of his siblings live, and in 1994 received
``training'' from Israel's secret service, an assertion that Israel
has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Tefileen was brought from the courtroom to meet with reporters
Wednesday and again proclaimed his guilt, saying he was motivated
by money and a misplaced enthusiasm for ``the promised land.'' Two
other men, Ramin Nematizadeh and Shahrokh Paknahad, joined him in
admitting to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead defense lawyer in the case expressed skepticism at
the confessions, which he said are not admissible under Iranian law
because they came from suspects who have spent a year or more in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accused may have been sick and tired of his condition and
may be willing to say anything to get his ordeal over with one way
or another,'' said the lawyer, Esmail Nosari.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers also rebutted the Revolutionary Court judge's charge
that the Jews have committed espionage under the law, saying the
defendants had no access to classified information.

&HT;     MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the fiscal woes of the San Francisco
Health Department, we are supposed to be as flush as a city as we
have been in history.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't find enough money to keep the city's modest tree
planting program operating at its current level?
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture of a $4 billion budget, we are not talking
about a lot of acorns here. We are talking about $1 million, the
amount that the Department of Public Works has been spending each
year to plant and maintain city trees and to fund the Sheriff's
Department's excellent Tree Corps program.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1985, Tree Corps is one of those ideas that is so
commonsensical, it's genius.
</P>
<P>
   Women and men who are about to be paroled from the county jail
are trained and employed as arborists. Working with the nonprofit
Friends of the Urban Forest and Public Works, the inmates earn
taxable income by planting and nurturing trees throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these people, their paychecks are the first
legitimate money they've earned in decades. For almost all of them,
the actual work is the very first time in their lives that they
have plugged into the natural world and literally connected to the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As several of them told the San Francisco Board of Supervisors
last week, the Tree Corps changed their lives in ways they never
dreamed could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just grow trees, we grow people,'' said an ex-convict
named George Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as former San Quentin inmate Rumaldo Centeno told me a few
years ago: ``When I see things growing, I think, `Look what I am
doing. I'm growing this living thing.' The trees I plant, maybe I'm
not going to be here for my grandchildren, but they will be here,
the trees will be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when voters approved a 20-year, half-cent sales tax
to pay for street improvements and transit projects, the
Transportation Authority has handled that tax money. Tree planting
and maintenance was allocated $10 million out of the projected
20-year total.
</P>
<P>
   Given the slow-growing nature of trees, the Department of Public
Works decided wisely to pour the tree resources into planting right
away. The only problem: Now, the $10 million has been spent.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Public Works has been reluctant to ask the
Transportation Authority for the usual $1 million tree budget.
Among other pressing needs, the department must raise $5 million
for its share of a matching federal grant bridge repair project.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael Yaki, however, thinks the trees should come
first _ at least for one more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be only a stop-gap measure, but it will give us time
to figure out some long-range funding for the city's trees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of Milton Marks III, executive director of
Friends of the Urban Forest, Yaki has asked his fellow board
members to urge Public Works to request the customary $1 million
for trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the realities of state and federal funding, money for
bridges almost does grow on trees, but money for trees doesn't,''
said Yaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the supervisors) can't tell DPW how to spend its money,
but we do approve their budget requests. An extra million for trees
is available in the Transportation Authority tax money. If that
money is allocated for something instead of trees, that project
might have some difficulty getting passed by the board.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm with Yaki.
</P>
<P>
   As lovely as San Francisco is, we could plant $5 million worth
of trees each year and still not have enough. Even though Friends
of the Urban Forest has put in thousands of saplings in 700
projects in every city neighborhood, there are still scores of
blocks with nothing green and leafy growing on them.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen producing, trees are a direct and immediate contributor
to the quality of urban life. They are also an investment in the
future face of a city.
</P>
<P>
   When you include an element as personally transforming as the
sheriff's Tree Corps, trees become an investment in the health of
an entire citizenry.

could recommend, but we can't.
</P>
<P>
   The beer is not horrible, but there isn't anything distinguished
about it. It is amber with a yeasty aroma. And it's unpasteurized
and unfiltered, which means there is some sediment. At $12 a
six-pack, you can easily do better.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Dog doesn't have much head, but there's much about it that
is very wrong-headed.
</P>
<P>
   First, one wonders about the marketing plan. With a name like
Bubba Dog, it would seem the folks at Yellow Rose Brewery are
trying to appeal to your good ol' boy with a pickup, a gun rack,
and a dawg or three in back.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trouble here is that guys in this group _ of which I am
a charter member _ do not buy beer that costs $12 a six-pack. (I do
only because the newspaper pays for it.)
</P>
<P>
   While we are stereotyping here, let us also point out that your
effete, $40 dollar haircut, Lexus-driving gent for whom a $12
beverage is slumming, isn't about to buy something called Bubba
Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more important, the label includes an offensive yarn
about ``Bubba Dog, a forgotten hero of the Alamo,'' who survived
the battle despite being shot and kicked by a Mexican soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The label goes on: ``Today Texans often recall `Remember the
Alamo,' but if you listen more closely, you will hear the haunting
ring of the last words passed man-to-man amongst the Alamo martyrs
_ `Remember the Bubba Dog.'''
</P>
<P>
   This, friends, is a shameless trivialization of the Alamo and
those who died there, in a feeble attempt to sell beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It offends me and I ain't even a Texan,'' said Maj. Tom Bob
Rocket (USMC) retired, who hails from a far-off flat land called
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did some advertising goober from New York City think this up?
This is demeaning to Texans and Mexicans, and being from San
Antonio they ought to know better than to say something that
dishonors the Alamo ... and to say a Mexican kicked a dog. What
kind of person kicks a dog? No fighting man would kick a dog. Not
even a Communist would kick a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is offensive to the memory of the Alamo, to war heroes
everywhere and even to dogs,'' said the Maj.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba Dog does not deserve a rating.

UNORTHODOX MUSIC FOR `PETER PAN' CAN FLY ON ITS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth Dallas Ballet and composer
Stewart Wallace may have broken the rules, but he scored a rousing
success with the new music for a ballet version of ``Peter Pan.''
</P>
<P>
   This production of Peter Pan opened on April 21 at Fair Park
Music Hall in Dallas, with Fort Worth Dallas Ballet on stage and
Wallace's music played by the Fort Worth Symphony, conducted by Ron
Spigelman. Peter Pan arrives at Bass Performance Hall on Friday for
four performances through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-reared, New York-based Wallace, 39, is used to challenging
the accepted way of doing things. He majored in liberal arts, not
music, at the University of Texas at Austin; he was a teen-age rock
musician who trained himself as a composer by poring over the
scores of Stravinsky. He made his name in the music world with
operas about comic-book hero Dick Tracy and gay rights' activist
and martyr Harvey Milk; one upcoming project is a concerto for
electric guitar and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that he leapt at the chance to write a
ballet score to fit existing choreography, which is opposite of the
way it is usually done. Fort Worth Dallas Ballet had the sets,
costumes and choreography from Scottish choreographer Graham
Lustig's ``Peter Pan'' ballet of 1988; but Fort Worth Dallas Ballet
artistic director Ben Houk and executive director David Mallette
wanted music more immediately appealing for their family-friendly
production.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace compared the task to writing a film score, wherein a
composer makes music to go with already-filmed action. Wallace sat
down with a videotape of Lustig's ballet and turned down the sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance to look at how music affects dance,'' Wallace
says.
</P>
<P>
   The result sounds unlike any other ballet score; if it calls
anything to mind, it's the full-length scores of Prokofiev and
Tchaikovsky _ but with important differences.
</P>
<P>
   The style is pure late-20th-century/early-21st-century
eclecticism. It's mostly tonal, but with free use of dissonance.
The orchestration is unusually thick and colorful for a ballet
score; composers tend to stick with lighter textures for a ballet
score, but Wallace paints with bold strokes and succeeds in
enhancing, rather than distracting from, the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Like the big ballet scores of Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev,
Wallace's ``Peter Pan'' is loaded with memorable melodies. Ballet
scores are, by necessity, rhapsodic and sectional in structure,
because the action generally falls into short scenes. As a
recurring theme, Wallace borrows a Bernstein-like lullaby melody,
Pictures on Your Pillow, that his father wrote for him and his
siblings when they were young. The effect is heartwarming even if
you don't know the personal connection of the melody.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace does something that neither Tchaikovsky nor
Prokofiev would have done, borrowing freely from well-known and
not-so-well-known sources: There are snippets of Bernstein's
``Candide,'' Britten's ``Peter Grimes,'' his own ``Where's Dick?''
and Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker,'' for a gloriously drunken version
of the ``Waltz of the Flowers.'' Only a master could get away with
this, and Wallace gets away with it handsomely. And there are
several repetitions of that fine old ballad ``No Place Like Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, choreographers are inspired by existing music _
as, for instance, when Tchaikovsky's Serenade for Strings, a piece
of abstract concert music, inspired Balanchine's masterpiece of
semi-abstract ballet, ``Serenade.''
</P>
<P>
   For a story ballet, a choreographer may have a composer-arranger
draw together existing music with the appropriate mood, as Houston
Ballet artistic director Ben Stevenson did for his ballet version
of ``Dracula,'' which features music by Liszt, arranged by
contemporary composer John Lanchberry, and will be performed in the
fall by Fort Worth Dallas Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   And often, a choreographer may have a concept and then
commission a composer to write music to go with his ideas, after
which the choreographer, usually working closely with the composer,
creates the choreography. That's how many of the masterpieces for
the repertoire _ for instance, ``Nutcracker'' _ evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wallace nor Fort Worth Dallas Ballet executive director
Mallette would reveal how much Wallace was paid to write the score;
Mallette says that it was a major investment for the company.
</P>
<P>
   And it was worth it. With all respect to the wonderful action on
the stage, this is one ballet where you can almost close your eyes
because the music is so good.

ANDREI DMITRIEV INTRODUCES RUSSIANS TO HAUTE SACKCLOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN VAROLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Andrei Dmitriev says he is on a crusade
to bring taste and style to Russian interior design. In a move away
from the usual Russian tendency toward overkill, he gutted a former
printing house at the Russian Academy of Sciences to create a
fashionable restaurant named Restoran. He removed the glass from
some of the 18th-century mirrors, upholstered the furniture with
sackcloth and covered the cavernous vaulted ceiling and walls with
several layers of plaster _ but left them unpainted.
</P>
<P>
   If customers ask incredulously when the interior will be
completed, Dmitriev waves them away imperiously. As he explained on
a recent afternoon, he purposely designed the monotonous, almost
sullen decor of Restoran so that the appearance of people can bring
it to life.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Tea Room this is not. But then, nothing is as you
might expect it these days in St. Petersburg, where a fusion of
past riches, present poverty and a rising fashionista class is
fueling Dmitriev's cutting-edge visions. Restoran's sleek and cold
simplicity, startlingly original in the post-Soviet period, has
rocketed Dmitriev to fame in the world of Russian interiors, which
is grappling with freedom after decades of stagnation and state
control and looking for its own identity amid an onslaught of
Western influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 80 years, Russia has been ruled by zhlobi'' _ the
uncouth and the uncultured _ said Dmitriev, 43, a former race car
driver, auto mechanic and antiques dealer who took up interior
design six years ago. ``Though they've lost power, it is still
difficult to break the mentality they instilled in most people. But
I plan to do the job, and want to create a whole new way of life,
not just do interiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he often feels like a prophet without honor in his
own country. Or even on his own staff. ``The workers mess
everything up and then call me when it's too late,'' Dmitriev said
with mock exasperation as he surveyed a work in progress, another
trendy restaurant, at the Mariinsky Opera and Ballet Theater,
formerly known as the Kirov. ``As if I am a doctor whose job it is
to fight a cancer after it has spread throughout the entire body.
The theater will have to either do it my way, or do it without
me.''
</P>
<P>
   There has never been much regard for the customer in Russia.
Dmitriev, while often impeccably charming and polite, seems imbued
with this spirit. The customer does best to shut up and sit back
while Dmitriev does the real work: creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do what the client likes, the way I see it,'' he said
airily as he surveyed his kingdom from a table at Restoran, which
is fast becoming St. Petersburg's most popular and fashionable
dining spot. In the four months it has been open, Restoran (the
name is Russian for restaurant) has already seen two celebrities
from France, the design-minded nation whose ties to St. Petersburg
date to Napoleon's time and beyond: the uber-chic Catherine Deneuve
and the rock star Mylene Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Restoran provides a spiritual home and a convenient backdrop for
the theatrical Dmitriev, who often holds court there. A small sign,
``Andrei Dmitriev Design,'' thoughtfully greets English-speaking
visitors at the door. For those who cannot make the pilgrimage,
several dozen photos are available at Dmitriev's Web site
(www.ad.sp.ru).
</P>
<P>
   Criticized by some as a dictator, Dmitriev is seen by others as
a blessing. In today's volatile economy, those with means are often
those in sorest need of guidance in matters of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitriev is regarded as one of the best interior decorators in
this city of five million, but then, there are only several dozen,
despite growing demand for their services. In Russia, interior
design has often been left to architects.
</P>
<P>
   While offices, apartments and country houses form a large part
of his portfolio, Dmitriev's reputation flows from his restaurant
interiors. His first creation, the six-year-old Staroe Kafe, is
cozy and charming, a five-table cafe decked out in 1900-era
antiques. A more recent work, called Kama Sutra, serves Indian
cuisine and is decorated accordingly, in a minimalist style that
nonetheless includes graphic sexual drawings, phallic ornaments and
Indian fabrics and sofas.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitriev abhors all that is loud and gaudy. He stripped
Restoran's interior to the bone, foregoing varnish on the spruce
tables, floors and window frames. As he explained how people become
the brightest elements in the room, his puckish smile broadened
into a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by artists like Vermeer, the 18th-century French
still-life master Chardin, and David Sterenberg, a Russian
still-life master of the early 20th century, Dmitriev values proper
positioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My interiors are in fact a real-life still life, which is born
in my imagination,'' he said ambiguously.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Restoran said they had originally hoped for an
easy tourist draw, featuring Russian-village-style decor with the
usual rustic motifs like farm tools, folk art and bright red
peasant clothing for the staff. But after working with Dmitriev on
smaller projects and coming around to his point of view, they
decided to give him free rein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worried about how it would go over with customers,'' said
Olga Urusova, one of the owners. ``In Russia, Andrei's interiors
are a new approach to design, and we were a little frightened by
his ideas. But then we thought, St. Petersburg is also a part of
Europe, so why can't we take brave steps forward, as they do in
London and Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dmitriev said he was ``fed up'' with folksy
decors, ``which better exemplify the tastelessness of cities such
as Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitriev has taken cues from London, where he worked with the
designer Nicholas Haslam (who has done home interiors for Rupert
Everett and Bryan Ferry, and party decorations for the royal
family); he also spent six years in Amsterdam as an antiques
dealer. But he transforms his Western European experience by giving
it a distinctly Russian soul. Old and new, poverty and luxury, all
figure prominently in his style. He also draws inspiration from the
kabak, the popular, rough-and-tumble pre-revolutionary tavern of
the lower classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I search for a way to combine the old with something new and
ultra modern,'' Dmitriev said, switching between Russian and
English. ``It's controversial and contradictory, but such a
combination allows you to see the beauty of both in the comparison.
The stark difference of luxury on the background of poverty
enhances its beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter later in the day seemed to hammer home the
point. Confronted by a fetid public toilet, Dmitriev howled with
laughter. ``To best understand beauty,'' he said, ``one needs only
to visit a Russian toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Born into a family of musicians and artists, Dmitriev spent 10
years working with cars and antiques before finally taking to
interiors. He never lost his love of rallying, and spent a month
last summer accompanying a Dutch rally team in two vintage Bugattis
on the Silk Road leg of its world tour, from Islamabad in Pakistan
to Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, via northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in cars, he said, led him toward design, albeit
indirectly. Running a black market garage in Soviet times, Dmitriev
earned more in a day than the average worker did in a month. His
off-the-books accumulation of capital allowed him to amass a
sizable collection of antiques, a passion that is echoed in his
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering with cars, however, may have been less a way to make a
killing than a way to avoid the depressing realities of Soviet
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``While working as a mechanic, my workshop became my own little
world,'' he said, ``and this tendency has remained with me today in
my interior design. I try to create something new, something my
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is rare in Russia, where repetition of the past is
preferred. Soviet ideas of design were often pedantic in pursuit of
authentic historical styles. Dmitriev, who graduated from Leningrad
State University with a degree in French, credits his success to
his lack of a formal design education.
</P>
<P>
   These days Russian designers can choose from a wealth of
materials, but many are short on knowledge and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitriev suspects there are mental blocks as well. ``Sometimes
Russians are too used to living in wretchedness to be able to enjoy
something of quality,'' he said. ``So, when people want what they
believe is top quality, it often degenerates into kitsch styles,
blindly reproducing what they find in other countries. The result
is often something forced and unnatural that lacks a harmony with
the Russian reality.''
</P>
<P>
   His iconoclastic views are slowly attracting supporters.
``Thanks to Andrei, St. Petersburg design is strongly developing,
because it was kept down for so long,'' said Andrei Pecholin, a St.
Petersburg design critic. ``Under the Soviets, Russia was ruled by
the lumpen proletariat, which had no taste and had no need for
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Dmitriev still finds Russia a lonely place. A few
times a year he visits fairs and design shows in London, where
tastes are more sophisticated and his talent is better appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Which can make life back in St. Petersburg a bit of a trial
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a monument to Russian idiocy,'' Dmitriev shouted at
his workers as they toiled away on the Mariinsky Theater
restaurant. ``You're going to have to redo everything.''

NATURE CONSERVANCY AGREES TO BUY PRISTINE ATOLL IN THE PACIFIC 
BY TODD S. PURDUM 
 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a bid to preserve one of the most pristine
places left in the tropical Pacific, the Nature Conservancy has
agreed to buy Palmyra atoll, a spectacular cluster of uninhabited
coral islets 1,052 miles south of Hawaii, from the Honolulu family
that has owned it for nearly 80 years, with plans to create a
nature preserve for marine and climate research and limited,
ecologically sensitive tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The precise purchase price was not disclosed, but Nature
Conservancy officials say they must raise $37 million to buy the
atoll, establish operations and an endowment, making it the
nonprofit conservancy's single most expensive acquisition in its
49-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra has five times as many coral species as the Florida
Keys, and three times as many as Hawaii, and is home to the world's
largest land invertebrate, the rare coconut crab, and a population
of red-footed booby birds second only to that of the Galapagos
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the last marine wilderness area left in the U.S.
tropics,'' said Chuck Cook, the conservancy's project director for
Palmyra. ``The fact that there are no human pressures to speak of
is unique and the opportunity to protect this pristine reef is
fantastic. It is one of the few nesting areas for seabirds in a
450,000-square-mile area.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has already raised about $10 million, and hopes
to raise another $8 million by selling part of the area to the
Interior Department for use as a federal fish and wildlife refuge.
With 15 feet of rain a year, yet as much sunshine as Hawaii,
Palmyra is a rare, ``wet'' atoll able to sustain life and
vegetation, including one of the last remaining undisturbed stands
of Pisonia grandis beach forest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Palmyra has been a stopping point for Pacific
yachtsmen, a U.S. Navy supply base in World War II, and the site of
a proposed nuclear waste dump, an unsuccessful coconut plantation
and various development schemes that never got off the ground. Two
years ago it attracted the attention of Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, who considered buying it as his own private getaway.
</P>
<P>
   But it is perhaps most famous as the scene of a 1974 murder in
which a married couple were killed and their boat stolen by fellow
yachters whose own craft was sinking. The case became the subject
of a best-selling thriller, ``And the Sea Will Tell,'' by Vincent
Bugliosi, the lawyer who won an acquittal for one of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra, situated about 300 miles north of the equator and two
hours by jet from Honolulu, was named by an American ship captain,
whose vessel, the Palmyra, blew ashore in a storm in 1802. In 1816,
a Spanish pirate ship, the Esperanza, loaded with plunder from
Incan temples, was wrecked on the atoll's coral reefs. In 1862, two
New Zealanders who had married Hawaiian women obtained a deed to
the atoll from King Kamehameha V, but when Hawaii was annexed to
the United States in 1898, Palmyra was specifically excluded, and
in 1922, a family of Honolulu roofing contractors, the
Fullard-Leos, bought the atoll for $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1938, the Fullard-Leo family embarked on a
long-running feud with the Navy, which built an airstrip on the
atoll and used it as a base in World War II. Ultimately, the
Fullard-Leos took their successful fight for title all the way to
the U.S. Supreme Court, and when Hawaii became a state in 1959,
Palmyra was again excluded.
</P>
<P>
   But three surviving Fullard-Leo brothers who control the
property, Leslie, Ainsley and Dudley, are now all in their 80s or
90s and repeated efforts to develop the property have either failed
or been rejected by the family as too disruptive to the atoll's
pristine ecology. The Nature Conservancy has been negotiating to
buy the parcel, which includes 680 acres of land and 15,512 acres
of reefs, for more than two years, at a price well below the $47
million the family initially sought, with the family taking a tax
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potential buyers all had plans for much larger developments
than the family was comfortable with,'' said Peter Savio, the
Honolulu real estate agent who represented the Fullard-Leos and who
himself had made an unsuccessful stab at developing the island as a
resort. ``The family is very happy at the sale to the Nature
Conservancy. It's the kind of use they've always looked for.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has until the first quarter of next year to
raise the needed funds. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
identified Palmyra last year as its No. 1 land purchase priority,
and $8 million in federal funds have already been appropriated to
help defray the cost, subject to the conservancy's ability to
acquire the atoll.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the conservancy is now in the process of building a
small tent camp and improving the overgrown runway, with the
expectation of eventually teaming up with a tour operator that
could allow 30 to 40 people at a time to visit the atoll for scuba
diving, snorkeling and catch-and-release bonefishing, at a cost of
$3,000 to $4,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``eco-tourism is not our primary objective;
preserving these robust and abundant habitats is.''

MIAMI IS THE LATEST MECCA FOR STYLISH FURNISHINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After an exasperating search in New York for a set of
dining chairs for a Sunday night dinner party at his Riverside
Drive apartment, Augusto Botero was exhilarated when he found the
perfect chair at Room _ a sleek new store in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ordered six, and they were delivered in three days,''
marveled Botero, a young commercial photographer who stumbled onto
the Miami design district, a formerly desolate home-furnishings
quarter north of downtown, while shooting an advertising campaign
nearby. In the last two years, more than 50 stores, many of them
beacons of fresh, new design, have opened in that 10-block area.
</P>
<P>
   When Milly de Cabrol headed to Florida two months ago to unwind
from the cruel vexations of life as a New York interior designer,
she paid a first-time visit to the newly dynamic district and was
startled by what she saw. ``I found a fantastic mix of ethnic and
contemporary stuff at incredibly reasonable prices,'' she said.
``And I discovered that it's a lot more fun to shop in Miami. The
sun's shining, everyone's helpful, and you get to see a lot in a
short time because everything's concentrated in one area.''
</P>
<P>
   At Orson, a store crammed with decorative American and French
furniture, Cabrol found for $2,400 a 1940s sofa, which she says
would cost $8,000 in New York. Next month, she plans to bring to
Miami a client who has a Park Avenue town house. ``We're going to
fly down there, fill a container and have it sent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the expanding lineup of sophisticated stores and with cheap
round-trip air fares, the design district is emerging as a mecca
for those in search of high style, welcoming the public with none
of the to-the-trade restrictions of many New York showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spectacular, huh?'' said Craig Robins, the neighborhood's
foremost developer, as he bounded up a glass stairway at the new
Holly Hunt store, designed by Alison Spear. Robins is leading an
ambitious effort to revitalize the formerly woebegone district,
once plagued by muggings and burglaries.
</P>
<P>
   For Robins, 37, a Miami Beach native, the opening of Hunt's
showroom is a remarkable coup. Just two years ago, he said, the
building was a dark, dilapidated quilting factory. Over the last
year, however, news of the 25,000-square-foot Holly Hunt store has
spurred confidence in the district. It has become a gleaming
showcase for the wares of innovators like Rose Tarlow and Christian
Liaigre, current darlings of design. These days, there are 120 or
so storefronts in the district, many concentrated along Northeast
40th Street and Northeast Second Avenue _ the principal
thoroughfares of an area that is now abuzz with commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial move, the Chicago-based Hunt has abandoned
to-the-trade-only rules for her Miami showroom. Like Robins, she
believes that the best way to expand the market for upscale
furnishings is to admit the public. Such populist tactics are key
to Robins' agenda, which has been driven by past successes.
Thirteen years ago, he was one of the first to redevelop the
shabby, boarded-up Art Deco hotels of South Beach and to reap a
handsome profit when the area became a booming resort. Now, in his
efforts to reinvigorate the design district, he hopes to capture
some of the dynamism of South Beach, a five minute drive across
Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to be a place that inspires creativity, where it's
fun for the public to come and check out great design and hang out
at cool cafes,'' Robins said. So far, however, the cafes are in the
planning stage. Just how eager Miami's thong, sarong and bikini set
will be to abandon the beach and come ogle furniture remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone stands to profit from that eventuality, it is Robins.
Through Dacra, his real estate company, he has since 1994 bought 18
buildings in the area, investing about $25 million, which makes him
its biggest landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not about what percentage we own,'' he said,
earnestly. ``What's important is that the whole neighborhood be
vibrant and successful.'' Rents in Robins' buildings in the
district are $20 to $25 a square foot, he said, and 85 percent of
the 500,000 square feet he controls is rented. When Dacra began
investing in the area six years ago, 50 percent of the neighborhood
was vacant, and rents were around $5 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1980s, when the district took a nose dive,
store owners fled to the Design Center of the Americas, an immense,
corporate-looking edifice on the outskirts of Fort Lauderdale. The
120-showroom center is, like the Design and Decorating Building in
New York, open officially to the trade only. Anyone wishing to view
or buy its upscale wares must be accompanied by an interior
designer, a restriction that has long exasperated sellers and
buyers. An April visit to the fortresslike Design Center of the
Americas proved how intractable the to-the-trade-only rule can be.
</P>
<P>
   This writer, intent on shopping, was met with questions and
comments like these: ``Are you a designer?'' ``You can't come in
without an appointment.'' ``Are you registered with us?'' ``If you
need any help, I have to have a letter from your architect or
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, at Sola Topee, in the Miami design district, where
Indian daybeds, arches and columns summon up tropical splendor, a
strategically placed jug of fresh iced tea awaits visitors who
wander in from Northeast Second Avenue. Espresso, wine and
Champagne are also available.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our guests are furnishing their home, we want them to feel
at home, so they can experience what it's like to live with our
furniture,'' said Bruce Platt, the store's sales director. A former
model, Platt worked at the Polo Ralph Lauren store on Madison
Avenue before moving to Miami four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That Miami is a resort destination for visitors with large
disposable incomes has contributed to the district's rising
fortunes. Platt said that the majority of Sola Topee's out-of-town
clients are from New York, Europe and South America, either
vacationers or owners of second or third homes. ``Because of where
we are, we're tapping a huge audience,'' he said. ``The design
dstrict is only five minutes from Miami Beach, the airport and the
port of Miami, so it's easy for people to drop by.''
</P>
<P>
   After 5 p.m., the district is usually deserted. But lately,
openings for photography exhibitions in the neighborhood have drawn
large crowds after dark. So far, Room, the smallest of the
furniture showrooms, is making the biggest splash. It is run by
Juan-Carlos Arcila-Duque, an interior designer who furnished a
waterfront home in Coconut Grove for the architects Laurinda Spear
and Bernardo Fort-Brescia, founders of Arquitectonica. Room
recently played host to a packed reception for Fernando Bengoechea,
a New York-based interiors photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike South Beach, with its winning cluster of Art Deco
buildings, the design district holds little appeal beyond the
convenience of storefront buildings within easy walking distance of
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to transform the district and set the design standard
for others to follow, Robins hired the New York architect Walter
Chatham in 1997, starting him with a slender budget of $1 million
to spruce up Dacra properties. ``The first time I saw it, the
district was completely shabby and deserted,'' Chatham said. ``So
we began by giving the buildings a fresh coat of paint, putting on
awnings, adding new signs and planting trees in order to cultivate
a sense of neighborhood.'' Chatham's efforts with Dacra properties
have prompted others to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   Robins persuaded city officials to underwrite a detailed plan
for improvements conceived by Andres Duany and Elizabeth
Plater-Zyberk, the Miami-based urban designers known for their New
Urbanist plans for Seaside, Fla. The design district plan, based on
a workshop held three years ago, takes note of Little Haiti, a
low-income community to the north, and sets guidelines for
everything from street plantings and improved signs to the creation
of public spaces and improved access from the expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Chatham has also worked on the art-filled waterfront home on
nearby Sunset Island that Robins shares with his Cuban-born wife,
Ivelin, and their two young children. That house has been furnished
with acquisitions from the design district. A family favorite,
Robins said, is a new living room sofa from Dilmos, a fashionable
Milan-based company that has opened a showroom on Northeast Second
Avenue. The sofa has surprisingly comfortable clear-plastic
cushions stuffed with straw. ``I love it,'' he said. ``Because it
makes you ask, What's art, and what's furniture?''

MIAMI: what's furniture?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors intrepid enough to venture into the design district
before last year were unlikely to come away with anything
resembling a chic straw-filled sofa. In 1994, the area was mostly
composed of showrooms and quiet antiques stores. Robins lured his
first tenant, Knoll, with an offer of a prime corner and, as he put
it, ``an extremely affordable rent,'' roughly half the market rate.
Jim Lutz, the national sales manager for KnollStudio, said that the
gamble paid off. Since relocating from upscale Coral Gables in June
1998, he said, retail sales have doubled. Since Knoll's arrival,
other well-known showrooms have followed, including ICF and
Waterworks, where gleaming faucets designed by Thomas O'Brien of
Aero Studios are on display.
</P>
<P>
   In another shrewd move, Robins rented the Moore Building, a
majestic four-story 1921 structure at 191 Northeast 40th Street, to
Leah Kleman, a colorful character, who arrived from Lincoln Road in
Miami Beach two years ago with a following for a mad mix of
neo-Classical style, vaudevillian and Deco antiques. ``For me, the
design district is a major gig,'' said Kleman, who counts Sylvester
Stallone, Cher, Elton John and Michael Jackson as clients.
</P>
<P>
   Kleman has observed a turnaround in the district in two years.
``First off, it was like a war zone,'' she said. ``But I started
renting out my space for events, and everyone came.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she was one of the first in the district to open her
store on Saturdays for weekend visitors. ``The South Americans love
glamour, and they're compulsive buyers,'' she said. ``They all have
pied-a-terres, and they come in on Saturdays in the complete Chanel
hardware, his and hers couture.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading Miami interior designers have also set up offices in the
district. ``It's handy, having everything on the doorstep,'' noted
Peter Page, a New York transplant, whose projects include elegant
redesigns of the Astor and Nash hotels in South Beach. ``Without
getting in my car, I can check out samples at Knoll, ICF, Dilmos,
Waterworks or Holly Hunt. And I can walk my clients over to check
out the marble for their bathroom without having samples shipped
in.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alison Spear, a celebrated interior designer, architect and
social force in New York, relocated to her native Miami two years
ago, she was reluctant to take an office in the district. She said:
``A friend told me: `You can't do that, it's too dangerous. You
could never bring your kids there.''' But she has seen the
neighborhood improve. Much of the turnaround, she noted, is owed to
the marketing and advertising by Robins' company. ``It makes you
wonder _ is the hype driving the success, or is the success driving
the hype?'' Spear said. ``Whatever it is, it seems to be working.''

MOST AMERICANS SAY COLLEGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER, SURVEY
SAYS

<P>
   In a shift experts attribute to the changing economy, higher
education is increasingly seen as the ticket to the middle class,
with 87 percent of Americans saying ``a college education has
become as important as a high school diploma used to be,'' a new
study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, a majority of Americans believed too many
people were going to college rather than directly into technical
trades like plumbing or computer repair; now, three out of four
think the country could never have too many college graduates. The
study shows that 77 percent of American believe college is more
important now than it was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market demands it,'' a woman from Old Bridge, N.J., said
in one of several focus-group discussions held around the country
as part of the study. ``Before you could get a good job with a high
school graduation. Now, you need a college degree, a master's, or
even a Ph.D.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of parents of high school students see a
college education as ``absolutely necessary'' for their children.
Even more noteworthy are the views of minorities, whose enrollment
in higher education lags behind that of whites. When asked to
choose the single factor that most determines success, 67 percent
of Hispanic parents and 45 percent of African-American parents
picked a college education, compared with 35 percent of parents
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been this coalescing of opinion in this country
around the notion that college is critical to opportunity,'' said
Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education, a research group in San Jose, Calif.
``It isn't just a piece of paper. It's a necessary factor for
middle-class life.''
</P>
<P>
   The $315,000 project on attitudes about education was financed
by a trio of groups that study education policy, and conducted by
Public Agenda, an organization based in New York that conducts
in-depth research on a variety of issues. It began with telephone
interviews of 1,015 adults _ particularly parents _ in December,
and included in-depth discussions with groups in six cities.
</P>
<P>
   The strong support for higher education among minority parents,
experts said, belies the oft-stated view that one barrier to black
and Hispanic enrollment is the low priority placed on college by
members of their ethnic groups. Only 20 percent of Hispanics 18 to
24 years old are enrolled in college, compared with 37 percent of
whites, yet more than twice as many Hispanic parents (65 percent)
as white parents (32 percent) believe a college education is
necessary for a person to be successful in today's working world,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pattern that we've been waiting to see emerge,''
said Robert Zemsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania
and director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education.
``It now follows other groups that have seen higher education as a
means of transformation. The Jewish community, the Italian
community, the Asian community _ now we're seeing it in the
African-American and the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what students should gain from attending college,
those surveyed emphasized job-related skills rather than the
traditional tenets of the liberal arts. Sixty percent said computer
proficiency and specific expertise in a chosen career were
``absolutely essential'' outcomes, while just 32 percent gave that
level of importance to ``exposure to great writers and thinkers''
in literature and history (14 percent said this is ``not too
important''). At the top of the list were basic skills in living,
including a sense of maturity and an ability to get along with a
diversity of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us in the academic world like to think that the purpose
of higher education is to master the great philosophies and read
the great books,'' said Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the
American Council on Education, which represents 3,500 colleges and
universities. ``But the public, throughout this past century, has
really seen education in very instrumental, very practical terms.''
</P>
<P>
   While 71 percent of those polled think paying for college is
more difficult than it was a decade ago _ and four out of five say
students have to borrow too much money to pay tuition _ an
overwhelming 93 percent of parents are confident they will find a
way to work out the cost of higher education. Still, 69 percent of
parents are worried about meeting college expenses and 61 percent
say they ``should have done more'' to prepare financially.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about various forms of financial aid, more of those polled
favored tax credits and work-study programs than loans or direct
grants to students. Fewer people (47 percent) believe there are
many qualified applicants who lack the opportunity to attend
college now than who believed so in 1993 (60 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``If the desire is there, you make a way for your children,'' a
parent from Philadelphia said in a focus group. ``A lot of times
you prepare from the day they're born. Other times, if they're
ready to graduate from high school and you don't have all the
money, you make choices.''

ROGER CAPRON, THE UNKNOWN HERO OF MID-CENTURY MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers
can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or
888-346-9867.) 
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Capron's brilliantly-colored asymmetrical
vases, drunken decanters and hand-glazed tile coffee tables have
become eminently collectible. Galleries in Europe and New York show
his whimsically humanoid sculptures. He receives large-scale public
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   But the 77-year-old French ceramist, would be more impressed
with these tributes if he hadn't been through all this before. ``I
never turn back on what I have done before,'' Capron said Tuesday,
fresh off a flight from Nice.
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the most prolific and valued artisans of postwar
European design, he was, not so long ago, sufficiently
unfashionable that a retrospective would have been an unlikely
proposition on either side of the Atlantic. But here it is: ``Roger
Capron. Art &AMP; Design: Postwar to Present,'' opening Thursday
through May 31 at Gueridon, a store on Lafayette Street near Bond
Street specializing in mid-century modern French and Italian decor.
</P>
<P>
   Here was Capron, with his wife and collaborator, Jacotte, at
Gueridon, surrounded by pieces they had not seen in 30 or 40 years.
They had come directly from the airport to the store, which was
still only half set up for Thursday night's opening. A compact,
vigorous man with wiry gray hair and mustache, he was dressed in
his all-denim uniform of jeans, shirt and vest with bright red
cravat and bifocals. There was no mistaking his country of origin.
He flipped through the first-ever catalog devoted to his life and
work. ``It is like a youthful wind,'' he said in French, as one of
Gueridon's two owners Jean-Philippe Mathieu translated. ``So many
things I had completely forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Capron's reaction needed no translation: ``C'est formidable!''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the occasional Capron piece turned up at stores
like the rarified 1950, also on Lafayette Street. But as recently
as three years ago, neither Mathieu nor his partner, Alfonso Munoz,
knew anything about this forgotten French master. They belong to a
generation born around the time Capron was at the peak of his
renown, the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   In the well-picked-over period of mid-century modern, he is,
Cristina Grajales, the gallery director at 1950, said, ``an unknown
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Capron was a charter member of the formes libres (free forms)
movement in postwar French pottery centered in Valluris, a
working-class town in the hills above Cannes known for its ceramics
since Roman times. Capron came to Valluris from Paris, where he had
been an art student, in 1946. Picasso arrived a year later. Both
started ateliers. Capron knew Picasso, not intimately but well
enough to refer to him as ``PP'' in his journals and
correspondence. PP thought well enough of RP to defend his
1,600-square-foot modernist mural for the Gare Maritime in Cannes,
which had been panned when it was finished in 1955. (The building
is to be demolished within the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was very influenced by Picasso, Capron exclaimed,
``Ooh la la! It is impossible not to be influenced by Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Capron bought an old cookware factory and stepped up
production, while maintaining the handmade process. By the
mid-'60s, he had abandoned the formes libres style, whose
popularity had reached Saks Fifth Avenue and Gimbels. The new phase
was devoted to tiles whose ``wildly bright glazes,'' the catalog
notes, ``became emblematic of the modern 1960s jet-set lifestyle
along the Cote d'Azur.'' But imitation, it seems, is also the
sincerest form of pottery. Competition from makers of cheaper,
mass-produced tiles shut down the Capron factory. In 1984, he was
forced to sell the Atelier Capron name to a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black years,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Mathieu and Munoz came across their first Capron piece three
years ago _ two pieces of ceramic tile painted with birds _ and
made an image of it for a New Year's card.
</P>
<P>
   The more they saw of Capron _ who, like Picasso, has gone though
enough styles and periods for a dozen artists _ the more intrigued
they became. In France, his work was a cliche, thanks to bad
imitators. Munoz said, ``We saw it with fresh eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Word got back to Capron that he had fans in New York and he
invited the partners to visit him in Valluris. Mathieu, who grew up
in Nice, did not hesitate. The old master entrusted his young
promoters with a cache of his photographs, old catalogs and some
rare test tiles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 pieces are in the show, not counting the scores of
four-by-four-inch tiles. These multicolored building blocks of much
of Capron's work are being sold off as coasters ($180 for six) or
the raw material for customized tables.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, dozens of decorative household objects from the
'50s are molded in off-kilter shapes. Essential accessories for
what French hipsters might call ``le bachelor pad'' are the bottles
marked ``cognac'' and ``vodka'' and ``rhum,'' striped and studded
with color in a paraffin technique developed by Picasso. Containers
for sugar, rice and tea are adorned with hand-painted bulls.
(Prices range from $200 to $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiled coffee tables ($2,500 to $5,000) were produced from 1958
to 1970. Later, in the late '60s, Capron started embedding leaves
and flowers into clay, then firing it, creating a sort of modern
fossil effect in his tiles and tables.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few large, dramatic wall panels. One is a
five-by-five-foot square of irregularly shaped and angled gold bars
($50,000). Another is a smiling sun _ one of Capron's favorite
images _ from 1971 ($30,000). The sun was a collaboration with
another formes libres artist Jean Derval, but the most visible
influence is, again, PP.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of energy then,'' Capron said. He often worked
seven days and nights a week, with no vacation. The hand-painted
pieces, of which there are thousands, are all painted by Capron.
That pace has not abated. He is at his studio by 7:30 a.m. and
works until 6, six days a week. Sunday he spends making designs for
the week to come.
</P>
<P>
   Etienne Sassi, who has know Capron for 20 years and has sold his
work at a gallery in Valluris and the Hammer Galleries in New York,
said: ``He is a workaholic. He is always drawing and drawing. I
swear, he never stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Absorbed in his current sculptural project, a group of
12-foot-high figures commissioned by Valluris for a new sports
complex, Capron shrugs at the renewed rage for his old stuff. ``I
know about it but I am not interested in it,'' he said. ``The only
thing I want to be thinking about is the new sculptures. I never
turn back on what I have done before.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will be forgiven for wanting a few coasters.

EURO DROPS TO NEW LOWS, AND NO ONE IS EXACTLY SURE WHY 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The euro fell to new lows against the
dollar and other major currencies Wednesday, settling below 90
cents for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the euro _ which at Wednesday's late price in New
York of 89.61 cents is more than 23 percent below its value when it
was introduced in January 1999 _ has become a source of
embarrassment to European political leaders and of bewilderment to
currency traders.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the common currency's recent steep decline
remain murky. The most obvious source of pressure continues to be
the strength of the U.S. economy, which is growing faster than
those in Europe and has been a magnet for capital from around the
world. Moreover, the dollar's value has been pushed up by
expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise
interest rates _ a step that ordinarily increases the exchange rate
of a currency.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts note that the euro has also been losing ground to
other currencies. It has fallen further against the Japanese yen
than against the dollar, and fallen as well against the British
pound and Swiss franc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the strength of the dollar explains everything
that is going on,'' said Joachim Scheide, an economist at the
Institute of World Economics in Kiel, Germany. ``This is a problem
of euro weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   By most measures, economic growth and optimism in the 11-nation
euro zone are stronger than they have been in years. Growth is
expected to exceed 3 percent in 2000, price rises are lower than in
the United States, exports are booming, and even unemployment _ in
the last few years Europe's intractable problem _ is declining
markedly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, currency traders have begun talking about
``panic sales'' of euros in recent days. One reason is that
international fund managers had been betting on a strong increase
in the euro. When the currency defied their expectations and
declined further, many institutions were caught with low-value
euros that they are now selling every time the rate creeps up a
bit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It probably did not help the single currency that the European
Commission and European Central Bank recommended that Greece,
rejected for entry into the monetary union two years ago, should
now be allowed to join. But analysts said the decision on Greece
probably had little real effect, as most considered it a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, some specialists have begun to blame the
European Central Bank and European political leaders for making the
problem worse. When the euro was introduced, central bank officials
indicated that they had little interest in the day-to-day movements
of exchange rates, but were concerned about signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, central bankers have changed their position and
made it clear that they are now worried that the euro's weakness
could ignite inflation by pushing up the prices of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   That was the main reason that European Central Bank gave last
week when it raised its benchmark short-term interest rate to 3.75
percent from 3.5 percent _ a move that did not stop the euro from
sinking immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Noyer, vice president of the European Central Bank,
said in a speech Wednesday that the euro's slide ``puts pressure on
price stability,'' and most analysts expect more rate increases in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Europe's central bankers remain convinced that
intervening in markets to prop up the euro would be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very doubtful whether intervention can be successful
against the market trend,'' said Ernst Welteke, president of
Germany's central bank, in remarks carried by Bloomberg News. ``If
one looks, for example, at current U.S. interests,'' Welteke added,
``it's unlikely that concerted intervention is even possible.''

A RIPE OLD AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A combination of research breakthroughs and the odometer flip of
the year 2000 has helped put a spotlight on the subject of aging
and on those among us _ the country's estimated 70,000 centenarians
_ who have weathered it most successfully. The beneficiaries of
good genes and this century's remarkable progress in sanitation,
vaccination, nutrition, and disease treatment, their ranks should
expand to about 1 million by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   As a seminar on the subject held at the Massachusetts
Biotechnology Council in Cambridge this week demonstrated, skilled
scientists are at work both to make that projection come true and
to ensure that those who live so long will continue to have their
faculties, including vision. Good health and an occupied, active
mind go hand in hand, as last year's ``Living to 100'' study of New
England centenarians by Dr. Thomas Perls and Dr. Rachel Hitt
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of aging moved into the headlines last week, when
researchers in Worcester said they had managed to clone calves
whose cells gave evidence of being younger than their original
cow's. Because the cells of Dolly, the cloned sheep, had shown
evidence of being as old as Dolly's original ewe's, some scientists
had worried that the dream of using cloned human tissues to replace
or repair diseased organs might not come true. But other scientists
dispute the evidence of ``oldness'' in Dolly's cells and question
whether it really ever portended a shortened lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there is another tip for human beings who are
eager to live a long time but not anxious to be patched with cloned
heart tissue of uncertain shelf life: Cut calories by 25-30
percent. Experiments with several species _ from worms to yeast to
mice, with primate trials under way _ show it to be a surefire way
to extend lifespan substantially.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Leonard Guarente, are trying to figure out just why this is so. If
he and others can track down the biochemistry behind it, there may
be a pill someday that can get the same results for human beings,
changing forever our notions of ``old.''

IRAN'S SHOW TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hardliners in Iran who are trying 13 Iranian Jews on charges
of spying for Israel are repeating an all-too-familiar lesson about
the distinction between revolutionary justice and the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a state based on a genuine rule of law, innocent citizens are
not accused of preposterous crimes in order to make a political
point. But that is what has happened to the accused Jews in the
city of Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   The principal evidence against them is that some have traveled
to Israel to visit relatives _ a journey that is against the law of
Iran's Islamic Republic. Thus they have the forbidden stamp of the
Jewish state in their passports. Of course, a real spy who knew
that traveling to Israel was a cause for suspicion would hardly
allow himself to be found with an Israeli entry stamp in his
passport.
</P>
<P>
   Another arrow pointing to some of the accused is that they
exchanged e-mail with relatives in Israel and the United States.
The Iranian laws against such innocuous activity are not merely bad
laws; they are tell-tale signs of a repressive, paranoid regime.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are being tried in a Revolutionary Court in which
one man serves as judge, investigator, prosecutor, and jury. Human
rights groups, diplomats, reporters, and Jewish groups have been
denied access to the courtroom. The reason given is the familiar
excuse of ``national security.'' In reality, these show trials are
held in secret to veil the hardliners' travesty of a fair trial by
a real court.
</P>
<P>
   The plainly coerced confession from three suspect who had no
access to any state secrets represents a shameless effort by
hardliners to justify their persecution of the 13 citizens. Because
Iranian reformers backing President Mohammad Khatami are also
facing revolutionary judges for their political activities and
writings, nobody from the reformist camp has felt secure enough to
come to the defense of the railroaded Jews.
</P>
<P>
   If the democratic powers are serious about human rights and the
rule of law, they will make it plain to Iran's hardliners that they
will have to pay a high price for any injustice done to the 13
scapegoated Jews of Shiraz.

 &HT;    It's one stale argument: The big loaf
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While on vacation at Jekyll Island last fall, I fell into a
conversation about the single life with sisters Ethel Colquitt and
Kathleen Fink of Barnesville.
</P>
<P>
   It seems whether you're 30-something or 80-something, some
things are harder to do alone _ flip a mattress, put up a Christmas
tree and use a whole loaf of bread before it goes stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't they just make a smaller loaf of bread?'' Ethel
wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Why can't they? I must throw out half a loaf every week.
With the number of one- and two-person households approaching 50
percent, it's curious the bread industry has failed to offer
smaller loaves. Even families find that with so many different
breads _ buns, dinner rolls, white, wheat _ some always goes to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a pint of milk or a gallon; a half-dozen eggs or
whole. Why not a half loaf of bread?
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to get an answer from the bread industry proved as
challenging as following a bread crumb trail through a midnight
forest. I was directed from expert to association to institute.
Matt Hall, spokesman for Earthgrains in St. Louis, which produces
Colonial and Earthgrains breads, finally offered an explanation.
It's cheaper to have one size for bread pans, wrappers and storage
racks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people say they want a smaller loaf, but since we
can't sell one for half the price, there wouldn't be a market for
it,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so sure. I admit to raising an eyebrow when I saw that a
half loaf at Harry's in a Hurry wasn't half-price. But I bought it
anyway. (Harry's makes its own bread, so it has more packaging
flexibility.)
</P>
<P>
   It seems that as long as flour is plentiful and folks will buy
the big loaves, the industry figures why bother? Never mind that
multitudes of loaves go to waste on grocery shelves and countless
partial loaves go to waste in people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we'd like to see consumers do is urge their
grocers to work out a system with local food banks so all the
unbought bread doesn't go to waste,'' said Bill Bolling, executive
director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Then we need to adopt a more European attitude at home and treat
stale bread as a pantry item (it keeps best in the freezer). For
ideas, pick up Carole Lalli's new cookbook, ``Yesterday's Bread''
(HarperPerennial, $12.95). She recommends making bread crumbs for
coatings and stuffings or for thickening soups like gazpacho. Stale
bread also makes a base for sweet or savory bread puddings.
</P>
<P>
   Or follow Lalli's recipe for this salad _ an Italian specialty
that is delicious with vine-ripened tomatoes, which you can buy in
grocery stores now. This summer, enjoy it with locally grown
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   italian panzanella salad
</P>
<P>
   Tear stale bread into chunks and soak in water (2 cups for 1/2
pound of bread) and 1/8 cup red wine vinegar. Thinly slice an onion
and chop 1 pound of tomatoes and 2 stalks celery. Then tear up 1/2
cup basil leaves. Drain the bread and squeeze out as much
water/vinegar as you can. Toss with the other ingredients, cover
and chill for 30 minutes. Remove, let stand 10 minutes, drizzle
with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

 &HT;    Funny things happened on way to Rome
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the glory that was Kirk Douglas in ``Spartacus.'' The
grandeur that was Charlton Heston in ``Ben-Hur.'' It's been a
couple of decades since we've seen a really good Roman Empire
flick, but ``Gladiator,'' opening Friday in metro Atlanta, revives
the genre with panache. And, even better, with Russell Crowe as our
hero.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few video suggestions to remind you that, sometimes,
there's no place like Rome:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Robe'' (1953): The first movie made in CinemaScope, it
was also the movie that was supposed to make Richard Burton a huge
Hollywood star (ironically that would happen thanks to another
Roman epic, ``Cleopatra'' and a huge Hollywood star named Elizabeth
Taylor). Anyway, Burton plays Marcellus, a Roman tribune who wins
Christ's robe in a dice game, falls in love with Jean Simmons and
is converted to Christianity by his slave, Victor Mature, who
spends a lot of the movie looking devoutly ... well ... up.
</P>
<P>
   The picture looks a little '50s-square these days, but in its
time it was considered a serious and intelligent attempt to deal
with the nature of faith. Burton gave it his all, including
thoughtful interviews in which he told reporters, ``Playing
Marcellus is like playing Hamlet.'' Still, he ended up back in
London with his big break a decade away.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Demetrius and the Gladiators'' (1954): In this sequel to
``The Robe,'' Mature moves center stage as does the wonderfully
decadent Jay Robinson who, as the insane Emperor Caligula,
initiates a search for the robe, thinking it has the power to grant
him immortality. That lands Mature in the gladiator's arena, where
he catches the eye of beautiful and duplicitous Susan Hayward.
Mature, wearing skimpy red trunks (possibly what caught Hayward's
eye), single-handedly defeats four tigers and keeps looking ...
well ... up. You can look for a very new-to-movies Anne Bancroft in
the tiny role of a vestal virgin.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Barabbas'' (1962): Anthony Quinn gives one of his classic
brute/saint performances as the thief who was freed instead of
Christ. The movie imagines what happened to him after the mob
chanted, ``Give us Barabbas.'' Ultimately, he ends up as a
gladiator, being tormented by a truly memorable Jack Palance, who
gives one of his classic demented villain performances as a
gleefully sadistic charioteer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Fleischer recalls in his autobiography that,
among the 9,000 extras filling the Colosseum (actually, an arena in
Verona doubling for the Colosseum), he spotted a stunning
18-year-old and told his cameraman to gets lots of reaction
close-ups of her. As it turned out, Palance noticed her as well and
they moved in together. Her name was Sharon Tate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1964): This should make for
very interesting viewing vis-a-vis ``Gladiator'' since the plots
are oddly similar. Both begin shortly before the death of Emperor
Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness) and both depict a rivalry between
the emperor's son, Commodus (Christopher Plummer) and a fictitious
general (Stephen Boyd) who is, supposedly, the emperor's handpicked
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Anthony Mann, the movie was mostly praised for its
incredibly lavish sets (the reconstruction of the Roman Forum is
rumored to be the largest film set ever built.) Guiness wrote in
his memoirs that he enjoyed working with Mann and was smitten with
Sophia Loren (she plays Plummer's sister) but could never bring
himself to watch more than 20 minutes of the finished film. Of
course, he was never all that fond of ``Star Wars'' either.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Cleopatra'' (1963): Because, like Mount Everest, it's there.
</P>

 &HT;    Beyond breakfast in bed
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the second Sunday
in May as Mother's Day, moms have been royally gifted with elegant
brunches, bunches of flowers and trinkets of all kind.
</P>
<P>
   For one of mom's treats May 14, why not serve her breakfast in
bed? You don't have to search a mall or the Internet for this
hassle-free, old-fashioned gift. In fact, you don't even have to
leave home. Most ingredients can be found in the kitchen. You will
want to add a few neat touches, including the perfect flower, the
right card and mom's favorite drink. And dad might be pressed into
service if the tots are too tiny.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Breakfast in Bed,'' (HarperCollins, $19.95),
author Jesse Ziff Cool writes, ``Serving breakfast in bed is
creating a special day out of one that would otherwise be like any
other.'' On the mouthwatering pages, you can learn how to wow mom
with such indulgences as banana pancakes, a smoked salmon omelet or
fresh berries with creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, however, many moms would be just as happy with a
bagel and cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   To create our breakfast in bed scenario, we combined easy (fruit
and croissant) with elegant (damask and china). For starters, our
brushed metal bed ($399) was made up with a set of Tuck's white
cotton sheets ($119) and topped by Area's plush duvet cover ($110)
done in pastel squares and backed by fluffy pillows ($29-$44). All
available at Innovations furniture store on Monroe Drive in
Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Mom can wear her satinlike, short floral-print nightgown by
Jones New York and matching short robe ($68) on many mornings after
Mother's Day. Available at Rich's.
</P>
<P>
   No breakfast in bed is complete without an ivory breakfast tray
($168) elegantly appointed with a damask place mat ($11) and
matching napkin ($10). Other touches: a metal flower attached to a
votive candleholder ($23) and a real-looking ``faux cup of
cappuccino'' ($33) so mom won't spill any in bed. All from
Lassiter's in Phipps Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to hold the breakfast goodies, a china plate from
Villeroy &AMP; Boch ($16) at Rich's.
</P>
<P>
   P O I N T A N D C L I C K F O R G R E A T G I F T S
</P>
<P>
   If your mom cringes at the thought of crumbs on her sheets, pass
on giving her breakfast in bed. Instead, buy her gift on the
Internet. Click on the following sites and never leave your home or
office:

A CALIFORNIA FAMILY MOVES INTO PAUL RUDOLPH'S 30-LEVEL TOWNHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By BONNIE SCHWARTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They hate Starbucks and the Gap, love flea markets
and a good adventure, buy everything vintage except socks and
underwear, own at least 8,000 books, and have collected 500 chairs
and thousands of other Modernist artifacts. Now they're moving to
New York from the San Francisco Bay Area to take up residence in a
nine-story house that may be Manhattan's most eccentric and
uninhabitable. They're the Boyds _ Michael, 40; Gabrielle, 35; Sam,
9; and Henry, 5 _ and they're as single-minded and iconoclastic as
the dwelling they've just bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be guinea pigs for the experiment of living in this
place,'' Boyd said on Monday, after he and his family took
possession of the $5.5 million Beekman Place triplex designed and
once occupied by the late architect Paul Rudolph, as well as the
six floors below it. Committed to living in a spartan way in the
triplex and moving their copious collection into the lower floors
to create a private library and museum, the Boyds plan to take up
full-time residence in Rudolph's highly personal cubist
architectural work next month, when their children complete school
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The chrome and gray interior of the triplex _ built by Rudolph
in the late 1970s and tweaked up until his death in 1997 _ has at
least 30 discrete levels and gaping multistory cut-throughs, which
kept Rudolph's party guests off balance and the Boyds' younger
child disoriented as he stumbled onto a landing with a transparent
floor while searching for his new bedroom. (``No, honey, your room
is downstairs, not upstairs,'' his mother directed him.)
</P>
<P>
   The house has been both celebrated and decried by architectural
critics as extremely intelligent, deliberately brutal, the most
important living space in New York, vertigo-inspiring and, with its
reflective mirrored surfaces, a kinky progenitor of the '70s disco
aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, said Joseph Holtzman, the editor in chief
of Nest, a magazine about and for those who fetishize the domestic
environment, the triplex is an expressive piece of architecture the
likes of which will not be seen again in Manhattan, given the
stringency of building codes and landmark rulings that have taken
hold since Rudolph planted his aesthetic seeds more than 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a family going into outer space,'' said Boyd, who
with his wife has amassed a major collection of furnishings from
1900 to 1975 (selections were exhibited at the San Francisco Museum
of Art last year). But instead of poking around galaxies, the Boyds
will be probing the inner spaces of Rudolph's sanctum sanctorum,
whose Plexiglas bathroom fixtures and mazelike floor plan explore
the nature of exhibitionism, challenge conventional notions of
domesticity and keep its inhabitants decidedly on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Boyd is the perfect person to take over the Rudolph
house,'' said Holtzman, who is credited by the Boyds as the
matchmaker between themselves and the Rudolph estate. ``He is the
most intelligent collector of Modern design I have ever met. His
collection will make a significant addition to New York's
resources. As far as the house goes, Michael both understands and
respects the architecture, and will preserve it as a rather large
object in his own collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Boyds are fans of Paul Rudolph's earlier works,
including the brutalist Art and Architecture Building at Yale
University, where Rudolph was dean of architecture for seven years
in the '60s, they are at least as interested in his later designs,
including the triplex. The apartment is reflective of a time when
staunch Modernism gave way to a still-rigorous but more expressive
spatial language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudolph is an enigmatic character,'' Boyd said. ``He's an
exact contemporary of Marcel Breuer, Craig Ellwood and Arne
Jacobsen, all of whom did really great early high Modernist work
and then went on to gain a language of their own that was
completely stunted by the arrival of postmodernism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people think of as Modernist today is highly
simplified,'' he explained. ``There are figures like Rudolph,
Joseph Cornell, Frederick Kiesler, Hans Bellmer and Carlo Mollino
who practiced a more quirky, eccentric and frankly sexual brand of
Modernism that isn't associated with the sterile German buildings
many people think of as defining the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boyds and their two young sons are giving up life in an
8,000-square-foot 1960s-era house in the suburb of Piedmont,
Calif., for what Holtzman calls ``a mean house'' that was never
designed with the needs of a couple with young children in mind
(witness the aggressive, spearlike banister edges that greet guests
in the lobby, the lack of railings on most of the steep marble and
metal staircases, the designed-in experiences of vertigo and
disorientation throughout the house).
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we're not your average nuclear family; we're all
a little eccentric, the children even more so than us,'' said Boyd,
who cited her sons' favorite movie stars as Carmen Miranda and
Veronica Lake and who considers the family's aesthetics and social
attitudes more liberal-European than puritanically American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people's idea of cozy domesticity makes us want to reach
for an airsickness bag,'' added her husband, who said the family
decided to leave the Bay Area because they needed a larger home for
their collection and because it had always been their dream to move
to New York and become the custodians of an important Modernist
dwelling. (Their business, providing musical compositions for
television commercials, allows them to live wherever they wish.)
</P>
<P>
   The Beekman Place house, Boyd pointed out, was a better deal
than similarly sized structures back home. ``What we're really
excited about,'' she added, ``is to wake up every morning and be
inspired by this place. How many people get to live in a
Constructivist sculpture?''
</P>
<P>
   Though their live-in sculpture may well be inspiring to adults,
can children really live in it?
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the vertiginous Jacuzzi tub in his bedroom, which
cantilevers dramatically over a several-story drop, Henry, 5,
cried, ``Oh, Mommy, I'm afraid, I want to get out.'' After she
allayed his fears, he reconsidered his options, and said with a
devilish grin, ``I can pour water way down here, over the side.''
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Sam, loved the see-through sink and
stainless-steel floors. He and his brother were thrilled to camp
out on the built-in beds in the living room on Monday night while
their parents made sure that they did not fall off any unprotected
balcony ledges.
</P>
<P>
   The couple plotted out where their prized furnishings by Gerrit
Rietveld and other Dutch Constructivists will reside, in the
ninth-floor master bedroom; the living room, on the seventh floor,
will house pieces from their Danish Modern collection.
</P>
<P>
   While the Boyds initially expected that the house would be sold
to them with all of Rudolph's furnishings and artworks intact, the
estate has not yet been probated because of the existence of two
wills. Most of the architect's personal property had to be removed
but may be reinstated at some later date, Boyd said. ``We're
hopeful that at some point we'll be able to bring the work back
into the house to restore it as closely as possible to Rudolph's
original intention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to clean up and paint the house, but there will be no
renovation, beyond rebuilding one wall in the master bedroom, which
Rudolph took out when he became infirm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the executors of the Rudolph estate, the arrival of the
Boyds was a gift. The house had been on the market for almost three
years while Fred Williams of Sotheby's International Realty fielded
six or eight serious offers. Many of those parties backed out when
they began to understand how complex the space would be to live in
and restore.
</P>
<P>
   The house was about to be sold to a developer who planned to gut
the Rudolph triplex and turn the building into five condominiums
when the Boyds rode in like white knights to preserve the building.
(The proceeds from the building's sale will support the collection
of Rudolph's drawings, models and papers that the architect
bequeathed to the Library of Congress.)
</P>
<P>
   The family is planning eventually to share Rudolph's treasure
through scheduled tours and may open their own collection to the
public, as well. The lower floors of the building, which Rudolph
rented out, will house their collection of minimalist work, as well
as accommodate recreation rooms for the family.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry and Sam jumped up and down on the squishy sunken bed in
the living room, one could feel the unyielding house warm to its
extroverted new residents. ``I have always been impressed with the
dark, voyeuristic aspect of this house,'' Holtzman said. ``I now
see the humorous side to this place. These two kids will turn the
place into a multilevel treehouse. It's actually perfect for their
shenanigans. ''
</P>
<P>
   As the great Modernist Le Corbusier once said, in the tension
between historic preservation and real life, life is always right.

   SIERRA-LEONE-U.N. (Dateline to kum) _ The United Nations has
made an emergency appeal for more troops to aid a peacekeeping

officials and diplomats said Wednesday. The United States, which
has largely shied away from African peacekeeping since a debacle in
Somalia in 1993, is also being asked to help, as a once promising

market in new economy stocks _ both unthinkable only a few years

   Here are reviews of 2 Websites and current magazines:
</P>
<P>
   WEBSITES
</P>
<P>
   Misheard Song Lyrics
</P>
<P>
   www.kissthisguy.com and Mondegreen  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (www.enteract.com/ &UR; ~jessicar/lyrics/)
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate when you get the words to a song wrong? We
do, too. So we consulted a couple of Web sites that catalog
commonly misheard song lyrics and give the right words at the same
time. Great for those bar bets, and good for a chuckle as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is named after the most commonly misheard lyric,
from (beginitalic)Purple Haze(enditalic) by Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then hilarity results. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both sites have huge lists of commonly misheard
songs. Kissthisguy also has people fessing up, telling embarrassing
stories about when their friends made fun of them for singing the
wrong lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mondegreen's favorites is from the Bob Dylan tune,
(beginitalic)Blowin' in the Wind(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``The answer my friends, is blowin' in the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``The ants are my friends, they're blowin'
the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, hilarity results. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   MAGAZINE REVIEWS:
</P>
<P>
   American Heritage
</P>
<P>
   Offers yet another chapter in the most overcovered story of the
presidential season, namely John McCain's temper. Article tries to
gauge the boiling points of former presidents, ranging from Nixon's
rants caught on tape to LBJ's ornery behavior around his aides.
Calvin Coolidge apparently bullied his wife and played practical
jokes on his staff, while John Adams once called George Washington
a ``muttonhead.'' Main piece names most overrated/underrated things
from American culture, from books to movies to obscure things like
French heroes of the American Revolution. Inexplicably, their movie
expert picks (beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)as most
overrated film. In the book department, the author chooses
Melville's (beginitalic)Moby-Dick (enditalic)as the most overrated.
As the most underrated, they pick another tale of the sea, Herman
Wouk's (beginitalic)The Caine Mutiny. (enditalic)They also note
that Humphrey Bogart was ``awesomely perfect'' in the movie
version. Dude!
</P>
<P>
   Archaeology
</P>
<P>
   Purists might go for the story on ``curious urns'' found in the
Amazon (undoubtedly the site of an ancient Sam's Club), but my
favorite was a relatively short article on the archaeology of a pet
cemetery. The lead is really catchy: ``Like Persephone, I walk half
my life among the living and half (the professional half) among the
dead.'' The author spends most of her time on humans, researching
how memorials reveal diversity within ethnic groups. While looking
at the National Military Cemetery at the Presidio in San Francisco,
she stumbled over its pet cemetery. There's also an interesting
article on the vast network of pillboxes, roadblocks and trenches
that awaited a German invasion of Great Britain, which never came.
A sidebar notes that the indefatigable British have converted some
of the old pillboxes into bat roosts, garden sheds and a peacock
house, whatever that is. One couple even painted their pillbox
pink. Blimey!
</P>
<P>
   Harper's
</P>
<P>
   Includes a fascinating piece of journalism this month - a
profile of the U.S. government's favorite arms dealer, a German
named Ernst Werner Glatt, who lives on a sprawling farm at the
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. According to
this well-researched piece, Glatt has been involved in most of the
nation's covert arms deals of the past quarter-century, secretly
funneling weapons to American-backed guerilla forces during the
Cold War. There's an also interesting piece on radicals in the
Pacific Northwest, though the author wastes valuable real estate at
the top of the story describing his mundane plane ride to Portland
and his bus trip to Eugene. The magazine's centerpiece notes that
the Olympic Park in Sydney is built on the site of an old toxic
waste dump, near a contaminated creek, a waste treatment plant and
the ``dioxin capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys&AMP;Indians
</P>
<P>
   Great cover this month. After all, who's more of a cowboy than
Dylan McDermott, the star of (beginitalic)The Practice(enditalic),
a TV show about lawyers in Boston? Oh well. He's still a handsome
diablo, and he's also in a new movie called (beginitalic)Texas
Rangers. (enditalic)And, no, they couldn't resist the ``Marshal
Dylan'' headline. In the real cowboys section, there is an
interesting feature on the Professional Bull Riders circuit, which
has adopted a pro-wrestling approach - only with real bulls.
Instead of wooden stands and a corn pone announcer, PBR shows are
filled with laser shows, rock music and gouts of flame. Bull riding
is one of the fastest growing sports in the U.S., with 1.5 million
viewers each week on TNN. There's also some nice photos from a West
Texas ranch but, alas, no captions. Oh well, I think those are cows
in the background.

`BOBOS IN PARADISE': FROM LSD TO CEO IN A NATION OF BOBOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within the Rousseau-like tableau on the cover of David Brooks'
delectable new book of social criticism there lurks one lone
denizen of the wild. It looks worried, and it should. The
undergrowth has been invaded by meaningful accouterments (laptop,
sport utility vehicle, mountain bicycle, steaming beverage mug) and
the arrivistes who come with them: the bourgeois bohemians Brooks
calls Bobos. As analyzed here with gleeful wit and bull's-eye
accuracy, Bobos are as unnatural as forest creatures get. They are
what happens when ``the babbitt lion can mingle with the beatnik
lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Defying expectations and maybe logic, people seemed to have
combined the countercultural '60s and the achieving '80s into one
social ethos,'' Brooks surmises in a book that merrily explores the
implications of that claim. ``We're by now all familiar with
modern-day executives who have moved from SDS to CEO, from LSD to
IPO. Indeed, sometimes you get the impression the Free Speech
Movement produced more corporate executives than Harvard Business
School.''
</P>
<P>
   But as part of ``an elite that has been raised to oppose
elites,'' these individuals have had to undertake cultural and
ethical contortions that would give a pretzel pause. A thoughtful
as well as an entertaining social critic, Brooks sets out to untie
the knots.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the tension between bourgeois and bohemian values, from
fiery antipathy to peculiar present-day reconciliation (e.g.,
Kerouac, Gandhi and ``Born to be Wild'' in corporate advertising),
``Bobos in Paradise'' acknowledges that it took the information age
to throw the two camps into hopeless confusion. With the
supplanting of inherited money by ``incidental money'' (``the kind
of money you just happen to earn while you are pursuing your
creative vision'') came a whopping inversion.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it was the whiz kids of the meritocracy who made the
rules in corporate life, to the point where a pet cockatoo or a
water gun at the office might be surer signs of status than a
mahogany desk. We have reached the point, Brooks writes, where
``the hedonism of Woodstock mythology has been domesticated and now
serves as a management tool for the Fortune 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the reader regards such developments with horror,
``Bobos in Paradise'' offers a tartly amusing, all too accurate
guide to the new establishment and its self-serving ways. ``Like so
much else in this new cultural wave,'' the author writes of a
fashionably enlightened supermarket, this place ``has taken the
ethos of California in the 1960s and selectively updated it. Gone
are the '60s-era things that were fun and of interest to
teen-agers, like free love, and retained are all the things that
might be of interest to middle-aged hypochondriacs, like whole
grains.''
</P>
<P>
   The author clearly knows whereof he speaks. As is the case with
many of his likely readers, he can locate a Bobo (a grating but
useful moniker) without looking further than the nearest mirror. On
the experience of donning titanium Omnitech Bobo sporting gear, he
acknowledges the obvious (``very few of us are actually
professional sherpas'') and reports this sartorial sensation:
``Here I am in the middle of the forest and I'm wearing the
Starship Enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bobo affectations in home decor: ``The old elite may have
copied the styles of the European aristocrats or the colonial
masters, but Bobos prefer the colonial victims.'' And: ``It is
acceptable to display sacred items in an educated person's home so
long as they are from a religion neither the host nor any of his or
her guests is likely to profess.''
</P>
<P>
   The serious underpinnings of this book concern the compromises
at the heart of Bobo culture. Particularly when it comes to
politics, that essential Bobo slipperiness appears in an
unflattering light. ``Whether you are liberal or conservative, Bobo
politicians adopt your rhetoric and your policy suggestions while
somehow sucking all the radicalism out of them,'' writes the
author, who is a senior editor at the conservative Weekly Standard
magazine. ``The Bobo establishment seems to have no there there. It
never presents a coherent opposition.'' Brooks ends his book in
hopes that his subjects move beyond the narcissism and comfort
levels that are so wickedly captured here and closer to the
political crucible where Bobo attitudes were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobos in Paradise'' sometimes repeats itself, especially when
it comes to the consumer tastes that express the Bobo value system.
Once Brooks has identified the ``never-before-owned hand-me-downs''
that Bobos favor in home furnishings or acknowledged ``that there
is an adventure gap opening up between members of the educated
class and their belongings,'' he need not dwell so heavily on the
particulars. His book also indulges in the occasional glib
formulation. (``If your furniture is distressed, your conscience
needn't be.'')
</P>
<P>
   But he makes up for these lapses with the legitimate insights in
which this book abounds, particularly when it comes to dissecting
the new puritanism that shapes the Bobos' value system. From citing
skimpily dressed joggers for their ``nudity in the service of
achievement'' to noting that we use the word guilt more often about
dietary matters than anything else, he delineates a hard-driving
secular culture that sees pleasure and discipline as inextricably
linked. ``At the tippy top of the leisure status system are those
vacations that involve endless amounts of agony and pain,'' he
notes, going on to wonder why the ultimate Bobo vacation isn't
simply two weeks in wintertime on a Minnesota road crew.
</P>
<P>
   The piece de resistance here is appropriately self-referential:
a section titled ``How to Be an Intellectual Giant,'' which deftly
lays down the rules of gamesmanship for aspiring pundits. Nowhere
in this slender, knowing book does Brooks' insight sound more
enjoyably hard won. He offers pointers for how to pick a specialty
that is likely to be in the news, how to behave on talk shows and
how to convince editors of the instant relevance of a new article.
The ambitious Bobo expert will ``describe how she can work a pop
culture reference into her essay, comparing the Supreme Court to
the creature in the No. 1 box office movie of the moment.'' Her
ideas will sound relevant and be easy to illustrate that way.
</P>
<P>
   The book argues that Bobo culture has rearranged the standards
for success in the world of letters, much as it has changed
everything else: ``The days when all you had to do to become an
intellectual giant was write a literary masterpiece, such as `War
and Peace' or `Being and Nothingness,' are gone.'' In the current
atmosphere, success is likelier to mean high-concept visibility,
presenting a catchy new idea in a lively format and casting light
on what it all means. ``Bobos in Paradise''-style.  &QL;

 &HT;    Let kitchen freedom ring
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Pam Anderson is every bit the contemporary
Everywoman.
</P>
<P>
   She's 42, married to an Episcopal minister and a mother of two
teen-age daughters who are, typically, involved in everything from
sports to the school play.
</P>
<P>
   She works, every day. And she fixes dinner, too, just the way
most of you do _ opening up the refrigerator at 6 p.m. and looking
to see what's there.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson manages dinner, often within 15 minutes, without
relying on boxed mixes or home delivery.
</P>
<P>
   She has done what she thinks every home cook should do: Learn a
handful of solid techniques and put the cookbooks back on the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   That applies even to her newest book, ``How to Cook Without a
Book'' (Broadway, $25).
</P>
<P>
   ``Learn the techniques and you're free of cookbooks,'' she says.
``You've got your `Get Out of Jail Card.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooks may recognize Anderson as the former executive editor of
Cook's Illustrated magazine, the no-ad publication that focuses on
the definitive ways to do everything from making home fries to
baking brownies. She went on to author ``The Perfect Recipe,
Getting It Right Every Time,'' which has more than 100,000 copies
in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two books reflect the two sides of me,'' she says.
``Everyone wants the recipe for the perfect Thanksgiving turkey,
for the perfect lemon meringue pie, for the cheesecake without
cracks _but on the other side, you gotta get dinner on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   As a food writer, Anderson has a room full of cookbooks, which
she uses for research. But she rarely turns to them for daily
living. The most recent time was for a millennium party when she
was looking for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Daily cooking is easy because she has internalized _ make that
memorized _ a bank of quick, reliable techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to free people from the tyranny of recipes,'' she says.
``There may be millions of recipes, but there are only a handful of
cooking techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense she is taking a cue from her grandmother and mother,
who cooked every day but didn't own a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Today's cooks have ample books and ingredients from around the
world, but less time to use them. The pressures of daily life
convinced her ``we didn't need more recipes; we needed to learn to
cook without them.''
</P>
<P>
   She starts each chapter of the book with a little rhyme.
</P>
<P>
   The one for simple tomato sauce _ which takes less time to make
than it does for the pasta to cook _ starts out this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heat fat and garlic, then cook it for two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Add canned tomatoes and simmer for a few.''
</P>
<P>
   The prose may not be memorable but her formulas are. To learn to
make a tomato sauce without a recipe, she advises, always use the
same pot. ``Measure the amount of oil specified, then tilt the pan.
Notice what that amount of oil looks like. Now put away the
measuring cups and spoons because the rest is simple _ a couple of
garlic cloves, a 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes and a little
chopped parsley if you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her book covers everything from hearty soups to desserts, but
the strongest chapters focus on the main course. The chapter on
sautes _''If You've Made One Saute You've Made Them All'' _ can
permanently expand the repertoire of most cooks.
</P>
<P>
   A part of that chapter is a section on making quick pan sauces,
of which she says she's most proud. Recipes for pan sauces usually
call for time-consuming rituals: cooking some shallots for flavor,
then reducing wine, then reducing broth or cream. Often cream or
butter is used in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the sauce is done the meat is cold,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She dispensed with the shallots and cut the quantity of liquids
so they would reduce quickly. And she combined them all rather than
waiting for first the wine and then the broth to boil down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically throw everything in a 1-cup measuring cup,'' she
says. ``At the end I whisk in 1 tablespoon butter, for four people.
It flavors the meat, and it's not too fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some weekday cooks might be tempted to skip the sauce, but as
Anderson says, ``It helps people get through chicken breast
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says that if she had to pick one technique to pass on
to her daughters, who like many vegetarian teens won't eat red
meat, it would be the short-cut technique for pasta with
vegetables. Firm vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, snow peas
and asparagus cook right along with the pasta, saving one dirty
pan. Garlic or onions are cooked in oil in another pan. That's it,
except for the addition of some cheese. Different herbs vary the
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a pound of vegetables and a pound of pasta you
don't need a recipe,''she says and that's the formula she works
with.
</P>
<P>
   She offers variations. If the vegetables are tender ones such as
bell peppers, mushrooms and squash, they get cooked in the oil
instead of with the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the viewpoint of purists _and she has worn that
mantle before _ she says you don't really have to cook pasta in a
gigantic pot of water that takes forever to come to a boil. As an
added bonus, the pasta water becomes more flavorful and thickened
by pasta starch, and she makes use of that by incorporating a
half-cup of the pasta water into the flavorings to make the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The short cuts trim enough time that the family may still be
eating salad when the pasta is done. But sitting in the water for a
couple minutes won't really hurt it either, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Relax and enjoy your salad. After all you're fixing dinner for
the family, not the boss.

 &HT;    Cookbook author's technique is long on shortcuts
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ KPam Anderson, author of ``How to Cook Without a
Book,'' says she takes shortcuts whenever she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely have much more than 30 minutes for weeknight dinner
preparation,'' she says. But her shortcuts are those of a
thoughtful cook.
</P>
<P>
   She cuts the backbone out of a whole chicken and flattens it,
shaving a half-hour from the roasting time. As a bonus, it will be
easier to rub some seasonings under the skin. Although it takes a
bit more than 30 minutes to cook, all but five minutes of that is
roasting time when the cook is free to do something else.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson defies the rules for cooking pasta, using less water,
which can take forever to come to a boil in a big pot. One
serendipitous recipe for orzo was an accident that developed by a
daughter's breakfast-time request for orzo for her school lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson found that when orzo cooks in less water, the pasta
absorbs almost all the liquid and turns out like risotto. It's the
only way she cooks orzo now, and it's a 10-minute dish.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken and the orzo plus a salad make for a fine weekday
meal. You might even serve it to weekend company.
</P>
<P>
   NO-HASSLE ROAST CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 3- to 3 1/2-pound chicken,
</P>
<P>
   backbone removed, rinsed and
</P>
<P>
   patted dry
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil or
</P>
<P>
   softened butter
</P>
<P>
   Open up the bird and flatten it with your hand. Adjust oven rack
to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place the
butterflied chicken on a foil-lined 18-by-12-inch shallow roasting
pan or jellyroll pan. Lift the skin and season under skin with salt
and pepper. Pat skin back in place and drizzle with oil or rub with
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Roast chicken until it is golden brown and its juices run clear,
about 40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes, then cut into 2
breast-and-wing pieces and 2 leg-and-thigh pieces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Variation: For roast chicken with Dijon and fresh bread
crumbs, remove chicken from oven after 25 minutes. Pour off and
reserve pan drippings. Brush chicken with 1/4 cup Dijon mustard,
then sprinkle with 1 cup fresh bread crumbs. Drizzle reserved pan
drippings over bread crumbs. Return chicken to oven and roast until
crumbs are golden brown and juices run clear, 10 to 15 minutes
longer.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE ORZO
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound orzo (1 1/3 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Optional flavorings
</P>
<P>
   Bring 1 quart of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add salt
and the orzo; boil until orzo is tender and has absorbed the
cooking liquid, 8 to 9 minutes. Stir in the oil or butter, cheese,
pepper and optional flavorings.
</P>
<P>
   Optional flavorings:
</P>
<P>
   _ For a less rich-tasting side dish, eliminate the cheese and
add 1 1/2 teaspoons zest and 1/2 teaspoon juice from a lemon, plus
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil and 2 tablespoons toasted
pine nuts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Add 3 canned tomatoes, chopped and drained, 8 Kalamata olives,
pitted and chopped and 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's favorite way of cooking vegetables is a combination
technique called steam/sauteed. The vegetables steam in a little
bit of water that has some oil added to it. By the time the
vegetables are tender the water has evaporated and the vegetables
sizzle in the residual fat, intensifying their flavor. It works
perfectly for everything from asparagus and broccoli florets to
green beans and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Here's her basic recipe. Optional seasonings such as sliced
onion, minced garlic or dried herbs should be cooked along with the
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   STEAM/SAUTEED VEGETABLES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil, vegetable oil, butter or bacon fat
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound prepared vegetables
</P>
<P>
   Ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Bring the water, fat, salt and vegetable to a boil in a large,
deep skillet. Cover and steam over medium high heat until the
vegetables are brightly colored and just tender, depending on size.
Remove the lid and continue to cook until the liquid evaporates, 1
to 2 minutes longer, adding optional fresh herbs or flavorings if
desired. Saute to intensify the flavors, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add
pepper to taste.

   KAYCEE, Wyo. _ The day began as it always does in Mrs.
Wetherbee's third-grade class at Willow Creek Elementary School,
and it proceeded routinely, from the pledge of allegiance through
reading, writing exercises, math, science, geography and phys ed.
</P>
<P>
   If Diamond Forbes seemed to enjoy almost every minute of her
six-hour day, who could blame her? As Mrs. Wetherbee's only pupil,
she had the teacher all to herself, making Willow Creek a fanciful
symbol of the ultimate in American public education, one-on-one
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the class size is an accident of Wyoming's sparse
population, the iMac computer Diamond uses every day for current
events, research and sending e-mail messages to her friends
represents the ultimate in careful planning.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most states, Wyoming has not taken a big bite of
America's booming economy. Faced with sluggish job growth and a
steady exodus of college graduates to other states, state officials
focused on Internet access in the classroom as a critical component
in equalizing educational opportunities and developing job skills.
As a result, Wyoming this academic year became the first state to
wire all its public schools _ even those as small and remote as
Willow Creek, here in central Wyoming. And there are quite a few
others that are just as small: Among Wyoming's 234 elementary
schools, 19 have fewer than 10 students this year. The state
average is about eight students for every computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in Wyoming now has the opportunity to develop to
his or her own potential,'' Gov. Jim Geringer, who began the push
for statewide Internet access in schools more than five years ago,
said in an interview. ``By finding a way to touch every school, the
next great leader from business or government could come from that
one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Wyoming's rugged terrain and the isolation of many
schools, it has been an ambitious and expensive project, $25
million for the first five years. But in financing the connections,
state leaders recognized a desperate need to keep Wyoming children
competitive or watch the state's economy fade and the population
continue to slip, as it has since 1996, to the current level of
479,602, fewest of any state in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature approved for every school not only
Internet access but also a two-way interactive video system that
maximizes teacher skills by allowing, for example, a Russian
language instructor to address students in his own classroom as
well as those at distant locations at the same time. So far, all of
the state's high schools have been connected to the video system,
with the middle and elementary schools to follow.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of technologies, Geringer said, also
demonstrates how businesses seeking to expand or relocate in
Wyoming could take advantage of a skilled but far-flung workforce.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a school that would benefit from the
wonders of telecommunications more than Willow Creek, a one-room,
cinder-block school 22 miles off the nearest interstate along a
winding gravel road that cars share with cows and sheep. The
antelope and llamas apparently know enough to keep their distance.
The school mailing address is Kaycee, a town of 400 that is 20
miles away. The nearest city is Casper, more than 80 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In planning for the academic year, Kathy Wetherbee was expecting
to teach three pupils, Diamond, who is 9, plus two younger
children. But the parents of the other children decided at the last
minute to send them to kindergarten in Kaycee, leaving the iMac to
Diamond, who has found it immensely helpful on her two big projects
this year _ one on the Basque region of Spain, the other on
Scotland. Wednesday, she searched the Internet to see if there had
been any recent sightings of the Loch Ness monster. She found
nothing new, only pictures from the 1930s, which she had seen
before. ``There she is,'' Diamond said, assuring Mrs. Wetherbee
that the monster is female. ``That's why they call her `Nessy.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Diamond, whose mother, Gloria, moved to the area from Casper
last year to marry a local rancher, Skip Forbes, the Internet has
become an invaluable tool. The computer she uses at home is not
linked to a telephone line. ``I learn a lot of card games there,''
she said. But it is clear from her time on the iMac that she has
mastered more than that, navigating the World Wide Web with speed,
dexterity and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As part of each day, Mrs. Wetherbee requires her to consult the
Casper Tribune's Web site to chart daily weather conditions and
read at least one story. Diamond found the weather information
easily and was drawn to a story about the ABC television dispute
with Time Warner that included a photograph of the ABC studio in
Times Square. Mrs. Wetherbee told her that millions of people live
in New York City, compared with fewer than a half-million in all of
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond looked puzzled. ``That doesn't make sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wetherbee, 54, a veteran elementary school teacher who
plans to retire after this year, said she volunteered to work at
Willow Creek this year, attracted by the remote location _ she
earns an extra $55 a month in what the state calls ``isolation
pay'' _ the class size and the living conditions. Adjoining the
classroom is, effectively, a one-bedroom apartment that includes a
small kitchen, living room and bathroom. Grazing cows and deer
sometimes wander past the huge satellite dishes that serve the
computer and Mrs. Wetherbee's television to peek inside her
windows.
</P>
<P>
   She lives at the school during the week and travels to Casper on
weekends to stay with friends, shop and buy food for the week
ahead. After school ends in June, she said she plans to move to
Modesto, Calif., to live with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it has been a gift to be here, and I think it goes both
ways,'' she said of working with Diamond. ``I needed some space
after the typical teaching situation. It was not as much fun
anymore, teaching to test. Everything had become so structured. But
this is a dream. For the first time in my life, I am not managing
children's behavior. I'm truly teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   And Diamond, Mrs. Wetherbee added, has vastly improved her
learning skills this year, especially in reading, which she regards
as her favorite subject ``after recess.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Diamond will have a new teacher at Willow Creek and,
in all likelihood, several classmates, a change that Mrs. Wetherbee
said would enhance Diamond's social skills and improve her
confidence, which is considerable already. Without classmates, she
sees friends and cousins on occasion but spends most of her free
time with her horse, Smokey, and five dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding the cursor across the iMac screen in search of the Loch
Ness monster, Diamond said she would prefer that Mrs. Wetherbee
return in the fall. But even with a new teacher she will still have
her old iMac even if she has to share it.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Diamond doesn't look at it this way, but with the
computer, she has not just been stuck in the little world of a
ranching community,'' Mrs. Wetherbee said. ``The Internet gives her
the opportunity to see a world she doesn't see at home. I think
that's a real blessing.''

   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has unleashed thousands of
purported ``war veterans'' against Zimbabwe's 4,500 white farmers.
He has allied himself with a rabble-rouser who calls himself
``Hitler'' (war vet commander Chenjerai ``Hitler'' Hunzvi). He has
labeled the farmers ``enemies of the people'' and has turned a
blind eye while the occupiers execute white landowners, rape women,
and ignore court orders to disband.
</P>
<P>
   This latest African nightmare, in short, looks like the
handiwork of a Mobutu Sese Seko or an Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76-year-old Mugabe is a character more familiar and more
disappointing than those carnivorous dictators. He does not wreak
havoc out of evil, caprice, or lunacy. He does it out of cynicism.
Mugabe, who liberated his nation from colonial oppression 20 years
ago, is the father of his country. He is what would have happened
if George Washington had turned out to be Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The farm invasions represent pragmatic politics rather than
blood lust. Whites, who comprise less than 1 percent of Zimbabwe's
population of 12 million, own 50 percent of the arable land. Mugabe
always promises land redistribution but never delivers it. He can't
afford to: The white farms produce most of the nation's export
income.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of actually evicting white farmers, Mugabe uses them
as punching bags when he needs to rally popular support.
</P>
<P>
   ``His anti-white venom is totally political,'' says Robert
Rotberg, director of the Program on Intrastate Conflict at
Harvard's Kennedy School and an old acquaintance of Mugabe's.
</P>
<P>
   During the early '90s drought, Mugabe vowed to take white land.
He did the same during a 1997 recession. Today he is encouraging it
in order to win upcoming parliamentary elections. The farm
invasions mobilize Mugabe's rural base. They also intimidate the
rising opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, since
Mugabe's mobs specifically target MDC supporters for rape and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the invasions distract Zimbabweans from the nation's
real problems. Zimbabwe, the ``Jewel of Africa,'' has been ruined
during the last decade of Mugabe's misrule. Unemployment runs 50
percent. Inflation has surged to 60 percent. Mugabe is spending $1
million a day to fight a war in the Congo _ a nation 1,200 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has run out of hard currency to pay for gas and cooking
oil: Motorists wait all night in gas lines. HIV infects one-quarter
of Zimbabweans. No treatment is available. The nation has 500,000
AIDS orphans. Life expectancy has plummeted from 59 to 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not supposed to be this way. Mugabe, the last great
African liberator still in power, was supposed to be Southern
Africa's savior. The son of a carpenter, he was radicalized to
Marxism while studying at South Africa's black Fort Hare
University, whose alumni include Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, Mugabe joined Rhodesia's black resistance and
was almost immediately jailed by the thuggish white government of
Ian Smith. Released in 1975, Mugabe took command of one of
Zimbabwe's two black guerrilla movements. In 1980, Rhodesia's
250,000 whites conceded defeat, negotiated peace, and accepted
democracy. Mugabe was easily elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe was one of the richest nations in Africa, a cradle of
fertile land and mineral deposits. And Mugabe was the smartest of
the African revolutionaries. (He has earned six university degrees.
Mugabe has an icy intelligence. He lacks the charismatic warmth
you'd expect from a populist.) Mugabe soon built primary schools
and health clinics that were the envy of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He was nominally a socialist and a democrat, but it rapidly
became clear those garments were lightly worn. ``Comrade Bob'' was
principally a Mugabist. He cared only for cementing his power.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe quickly mastered brutality as a political tool. ``He has
not hesitated from using the iron hand, and it has always worked
for him,'' says Steve Morrison, who runs the Africa program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after taking power, Mugabe purged his chief rival,
Joshua Nkomo. Then Mugabe dispatched his North-Korean-trained
``Fifth Brigade'' after Nkomo's supporters, who belonged to the
minority Ndebele tribe. The Fifth Brigade slaughtered at least
10,000 Ndebele civilians and probably more like 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter wasn't personal. It was business. It always is
with Mugabe. The bloodshed vanquished the only serious political
opposition to Mugabe, enabling him to establish a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe did not neglect more traditional tools of politics. He
amended the constitution to make a challenge virtually impossible:
The president gets to appoint 20 percent of legislators; only the
ruling party can spend government funds on campaigns; police
officers, soldiers, and civil servants must join the ruling party,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   But the world tolerated, and even lionized, Mugabe during the
'80s. The United States developed a ``grudging respect for his
pragmatism,'' says American University professor Peter Lewis.
Despite occasional threats against landowners, Mugabe supported
white farmers, bankers, and manufacturers. He was also inoculated
against criticism by his vigorous opposition to South African
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The end of apartheid has crippled Mugabe and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe
lost the cachet of being the only harmoniously multiracial African
nation. Capital flows to Zimbabwe dried up, as investors directed
their millions to larger, richer South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Most painfully, Mugabe found himself overshadowed by Nelson
Mandela. Mugabe, who had been the leader of the continent, was not
even the biggest kid in the neighborhood. (Mugabe arguably served
as an anti-role model for Mandela. Mandela could have remained in
power as long as he wanted. But Mugabe's 20-year fiasco surely
convinced Mandela that a longer term would have stifled South
Africa's democracy.)
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has behaved petulantly since South Africa's revival. When
Mandela sought to mediate peace in the Congo in 1998, Mugabe sent
6,000 troops there to back Laurent Kabila against invaders from
Uganda and Rwanda. About 11,000 Zimbabwean troops remain in the
Congo today, and no one, least of all Mugabe, seems to have any
idea how to extract them. The Congo invasion prompted the
International Monetary Fund to cancel Zimbabwe's funding, further
eroding the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has also gotten greedier. Many trace his kleptomania to
the 1992 death of his sensible first wife Sally and his quick
remarriage to his very young, and very avaricious, secretary.
Mugabe has used the Congo adventure for fund raising: Kabila has
paid him off by giving diamond and cadmium concessions to Mugabe
cronies.
</P>
<P>
   And Mugabe is increasingly megalomaniacal in his dotage. He has
enraged the U.K. by searching a British diplomatic shipment
arriving in Zimbabwe. His goons have tortured journalists who
report unfavorably about the Congo war. He is trying to ban e-mail
messages about politics. He has launched an incomprehensible
vendetta against gays, imagining a gay conspiracy that includes
Tony Blair and ``the gay government of the gay United gay
Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimists read this erratic behavior as a sign that Mugabe's end
is near. These are, as one political opponent puts it, ``the last
kicks of a dying horse.'' The MDC, a lively coalition of unions,
church groups, and farmers, believes it can finish Mugabe's reign.
Westerners seem hopeful that the MDC can grab a majority in
parliament and push Mugabe, whose term does not end until 2002,
into early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But Mugabe's canniness has been underestimated as usual.
Reservoirs of goodwill remain toward him, especially in the
rural/peasant majority. He will hang on to power, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   The farm invasions are already having their desired effect. Last
week South Africa _ terrified of anti-white violence surging in its
countryside _ reportedly proposed a settlement to end Zimbabwe's
chaos. According to the Boston Globe, Britain and the United States
will supply millions of dollars for land reform, allowing Mugabe's
government to buy white land rather than seize it. The IMF would
repair relations with Zimbabwe and rescue Zimbabwe's fuel and
electricity companies. South Africa would try to boost investor
confidence in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Mugabe would end the farm occupations and promise
not to cancel the forthcoming elections. Mugabe's deputies are now
negotiating with British officials in London to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He has blackmailed those who can't stand him into guaranteeing
his survival. The deal should provide Mugabe with the cash and
resources to prop up his economy, defuse urban unrest, and win the
elections. Another neat trick from a politician who never runs out
of them.

 &HT;    Coverdell proposes alliance of hemisphere's democracies
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), director of the Peace
Corps in the Bush administration and a former member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, recently outlined a new strategy for
dealing with Latin America. In aconversation with Washington
correspondent Ken Foskett, the senator, who also serves as an
advisor to the presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
described his ``Democratic Doctrine of the Americas.'' Excerpts
from that conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the doctrine for the Americas and why did you feel
the need to develop it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's founded on the platform that democracy or liberty is
fragile and never permanent, and it requires a constant vigil.
</P>
<P>
   In our hemisphere, a large number of the democracies are very
new, so they are even more fragile. And I believe that what was
achieved in the '80s with regards to becoming a democratic
hemisphere _ except for one country, Cuba _ really called on the
'90s to become good stewards of that. It's kind of like a garden
just coming up. You've got to be particularly careful in watching
and protecting.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't think we did that. We sort of accepted the fact
that, well, here are all these new democratic republics and then
kind of went off to do other things.
</P>
<P>
   I use this ``Doctrine of the Americas'' as an idea that I hope
will flourish, where all the countries become observant of anything
that undermines the democratic nature of our hemisphere. That could
be a security threat, like narcotics. It could be the lack of civil
institutions, civil law enforcement or judiciary that leave people
unprotected or leaves human rights violations going unaccounted
for. Or the total breakdown of constitutional law. All of these are
very visible today throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would you rate the Clinton administration's policies
toward Latin America?
</P>
<P>
   A: Poor. I think the United States hasn't historically as been
attentive to its back yard as it should be. Basically, the
narcotics struggle has languished.
</P>
<P>
   I think that trade policy since NAFTA has been nonexistent. So,
for example, you have Mexico signing a trade agreement with the
European Union a couple of weeks ago. I think the Reagan-Bush years
were, conversely, very attentive.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given the evidence of fraud in the Peruvian elections, what
should the United States do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The whole democratic hemisphere _ not just the United States
_ needs to exert pressure and sanctions if there is open flouting
of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   You do have to accept that, right at the moment, these are
assertions. They seem to be fairly well founded, but they are
assertions. I think the hemisphere should make clear that there
will be consequences. It may be sanctions. It may be trade. It may
be assistance and aid. It may be just that being a partner in the
hemisphere has diminished if you have a country that won't adhere
to the basic premises of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   I think the situation in Peru began to diminish itself when
(President Alberto) Fujimori basically overturned the two-term
limit on the presidency. If he had moved on at that point, he would
probably be one of the larger figures in this hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Haiti, the administration ousted a dictator and restored
the elected president to power. You have been critical of U.S.
policy there. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because it has accomplished nothing. It's almost sound bite
foreign policy. We send in thousands of troops, impose the
government order as we see it, and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Two billion dollars has been invested in Haiti. And you can go
to any hearing on (Capitol) Hill, and the common denominator is
that the Haitians are worse off today than they were before we
interceded, as bad as that situation was. There is no government
now.
</P>
<P>
   And if you were going to make the investment you made, you would
want to make sure that it flowered, that it bloomed. And that takes
a real conscious effort of long-term engagement, and you just don't
ever hear the administration ever refer to it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A 30-year embargo against Cuba has failed to bring democracy
to that country. What is the best way, in your view, to bring
democracy to Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is a huge debate up here as to whether (sanctions) have
worked or not. Clearly, Castro is in charge of the government so
somebody might say, ``It hasn't worked.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Castro's influence in the hemisphere has
become very, very limited. And so the embargo and the closing off
of the country could be said to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   The political reality is that the policy, which is greatly
shaped by Cuban-Americans, is not going to change in the short
term. There will be modifications in terms of food-related products
and health-related products and the ability of families to send aid
to their families still in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people forget that in Castro we have an individual who
does consider the United States an adversary, a hostile force. We
have an individual who would send MiGs out to shoot down private
aircraft or would ram a boat of refugees with women and children
and certify that everyone one of them was drowned. This is an
unusually evil and hostile force, and I think that drives a lot of
the policy here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How confident are you that the doctrine you've outlined would
be a part of the foreign policy of a Bush administration?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't say. I was taken with the fact that Robert Zoellick,
who was at the State Department at the time I was director of the
Peace Corps under his father's administration, is a part of (George
W. Bush's) foreign policy team. And he recently gave a speech in
Florida with regard to the lack of attention in the hemisphere. And
if you read the two documents _ and neither one of us talked to the
other about it _ they are extremely alike.
</P>
<P>
   It would be my intention to make the argument to the new
administration that the hemisphere does require an almost command
focus and considerable attention.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ It is nearing 2 a.m. when a cloud of blue
smoke rises from the stage. Bands of turquoise lights flit through
the murk as the music switches abruptly from the normal fare of
Latin salsa to the lugubrious melody of an old Arabic song.
</P>
<P>
   Out slithers a tall broad-shouldered man, his eyes rimmed with
black powder. He does a little shoulder shimmy and teasingly flicks
one hip audience-ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please welcome,'' shouts the emcee from somewhere in the
shadows beyond the spectacle, ``the one and only Mousbah!''
</P>
<P>
   It is belly dancing night in the Amor y Libertad nightclub in
north Beirut. And Mousbah Baalbaki, quite possibly the only male
belly dancer performing regularly in public in the Arab world, is
about to tweak tradition to the delight of his adoring fans and the
discomfort of many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can shake his body and get money,'' said Baalbaki, in
an interview before his show. ``But to me dancing is an art.''
</P>
<P>
   What Baalbaki, who is 28, does is not a transvestite show or a
striptease. It is more like ``Saturday Night Fever'' meets ``The
Thousand and One Nights.'' Sinuous and seductive, dressed one
recent Friday night in a gauzy black caftan over a Bedouin-style
white robe, he undulates on stage with a faraway look in his eyes
and a bodyguard close at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't an artist, he would have been arrested long
ago,'' said Michel Elefteriades, the nightclub owner and Baalbaki's
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a simple explanation for his interest in representing
a male belly dancer in a country that, for all its worldly glitz,
still has a generous streak of religious conservatism and
criminalizes homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking to shock,'' said Elefteriades.
</P>
<P>
   That is not always an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is a paradoxical town, with European designer boutiques
interspersed among the sniper-shattered buildings from the 15-year
civil war and Shiite Muslim militants hobnobbing with urbane
Christians and Sunni Muslims in the halls of power.
</P>
<P>
   But Baalbaki's public gyrations seem a step beyond the pale even
for Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real taboo,'' the dancer confided. ``In our culture,
people look down even on women who dance professionally, so they
look down on me even more. Every weekend I struggle with the
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the men in the Amor y Libertad seemed to squirm
and concentrate resolutely on their drinks when Baalbaki took the
stage. Their dates did not seem discomfited at all. Although
Baalbaki does not like it _ he is there, he explained, to be
watched, not to be a background novelty act _ quite a few young
women lost themselves in their own versions of belly dancing as he
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can dance to any kind of music,'' he said, ``but with an
Arabic song, it comes from my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   And his abs, among other body parts.
</P>
<P>
   There is a long tradition of male teachers of belly dancing in
Arab countries. But men who perform the flirtatious movements, at
least in mixed company, are rare.
</P>
<P>
   And not only rare but bogus, in the view of Fifi Abdo, the
leading lady of Egyptian belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man belly dancing?'' she exclaimed in a telephone interview
from Cairo. ``They can do the folk dances, but it's impossible for
a man to dance real belly dancing. The phrase itself describes the
part from the hips to the waist and a man lacks the energy there
that a woman has. They can perform, but they can't belly dance.''
</P>
<P>
   An Egyptian man who had undergone a sex change operation danced
onstage for a while in Cairo a few years ago, causing a major stir
before he disappeared from public view. One Istanbul nightclub
offers a male belly dancing show.
</P>
<P>
   But whether people are ready for it yet is an unanswered
question.
</P>
<P>
   Baalbaki has not told his parents that he belly dances, much
less that he does it in public. And Elefteriades' own father, who
is a theatrical promoter, has expressed profound reservations about
his son's association with a male belly dancer.
</P>
<P>
   This annoys Elefteriades, who considers himself a warrior in a
larger fight against social conservatism. ``I don't think it makes
sense that men in a lot of countries like Greece dance to their own
music,'' he said, ``while the Arabs only clap their hands while
women dance.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to make Baalbaki a big star _ that is how he put it _
and is preparing a music video for distribution on Arab satellite
stations that shows his client dancing but without the usual makeup
and flamboyant costume. He is weighing the pros and cons of
allowing Baalbaki to accept an invitation to a talk show on a
Lebanese television station.
</P>
<P>
   The world outside Beirut also beckons. ``I think there's a real
interest in Orientalism,'' Elefteriades said. ``There's always a
flavor that's popular and now it's the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Baalbaki was just another club kid dancing his nights away in
Beirut's many bars, discovered him and signed him to a seven-year
contract that prohibits him from free-lance dancing and from
gaining weight.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have formal training, picking up his moves instead
from watching Egyptian movies of the 1940s and 1950s, which always
featured a voluptuous belly dancer as the centerpiece. He can be
mesmerized by his favorite, the late Takiya Karyoka, whose dancing
is still considered to have set the modern standard.
</P>
<P>
   Baalbaki is handling the celebrity of his nascent stardom _ the
squealing young women who haunt his dressing room, for example _
pretty easily. ``All my life, I've enjoyed being a celebrity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the taunts and the hostility _ even a few thrown objects _
that bother him. So he is keeping his day job as the fashion editor
of a glossy Lebanese magazine and tries to maintain a regal
indifference to the occasional insults.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walks, no matter what people say, it doesn't touch
him,'' said Elefteriades in admiration. Then he quoted a line from
the Lebanese-American philosopher and poet Khalil Gibran to explain
what he meant: ``The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nominations are now open for the Symbolic Voter of the 2000
Election. The Soccer Mom, current occupant of this crucial post, is
stepping down to spend more time with her family. She'll be doing
some consulting, joining the boards of a few Internet startups,
giving speeches, and maybe writing a book. Or so she says.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that the media _ who decide such things
_ have used her up. She's still there grinning for the cameras as
she juggles kids, job, and household chores like an act on the old
``Ed Sullivan Show'' _ but there are no cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer Mom's fate would be more poignant if she hadn't been so
brutal in muscling aside her predecessor, the Reagan Democrat. One
day you couldn't book a motel room in Macomb County, Mich., because
of all the reporters there in search of a beefy union guy who was
voting Republican for the first time in his life. The next day they
all decamped for a Toys 'R' Us in the leafier suburbs. Except for a
few appearances together on Larry King, Soccer Mom and Reagan
Democrat had little in common. He was a man; she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   He was lower middle class with fears of sinking; she was closer
to upper middle with hopes of rising. He was an economic liberal
being driven away from the Democrats by social and cultural issues;
she was an economic conservative being driven away from the
Republicans by social and cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wouldn't have killed her to share the Zeitgeist with
him for an election cycle or two. Now he sits on the porch of the
nursing home, rocking frenetically and inveighing to himself about
``that damned woman and her damned errands. Who cares whether
Junior's stupid harp fits into the frigging minivan?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Scammon and Ben Wattenberg probably started this
tradition back in 1970 with their book The Real Majority, in which
they declared that the typical American voter was ``un-young,
un-poor, un-black'' and, specifically, a full-time housewife in
Dayton, Ohio. (Their rhetorical point was that the needs of poor,
black, young people were getting too much attention. Not a problem
anymore!)
</P>
<P>
   The newshounds poured into Dayton in search of Mrs. Typical
American, and found her _ many times, like Princess Anastasia. But
all these ladies were soon dethroned.
</P>
<P>
   This repeated cycle of embrace and rejection may seem cruel, but
a cardinal rule of journalism is: The story has to change. And over
the years the process has served our democracy well. It gives the
press a reason and a theme for beloved but otherwise pointless
stories quoting the views of half a dozen voters out of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it also gives press-bashers and Beltway-phobes an
opportunity to contrast these despised elites with the real
America.
</P>
<P>
   So the chair recognizes Robin Toner of The New York Times. In
Sunday's Times she writes that ``ground zero in the 2000 campaign''
will be ``a 65-year-old woman ... in a Macomb County, Mich. suburb,
with an affection for the Bush family ..., a concern for the
country's values ... and mounting medication bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Not bad, Robin. It's nice to be back in Macomb County. But
we need a name. ``Pill Grannies''? ``Bushois Barbaras''? You work
on that, while I pass along some other nominees, in descending
order of plausibility:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Portfolio Populists.'' More people own stocks than ever
before. Stocks are a bigger part of their nest eggs. And _ possibly
most important _ they can now follow the value of their holdings,
with the click of a button, on the Internet. And many do that,
constantly. (I name no names. You know who I am _ I mean, who you
are.) This has created an unprecedented obsession with the stock
market. When every change in a voter's net worth is thrown in her
face, non-economic issues loom smaller. Even worse, many small
investors may be developing a nightmarish Social Security-like
sense of entitlement. This is our money! If stocks go down, they
will be looking for a politician to blame.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Stem-cell McCainiacs.'' These are people from across the
political spectrum who fell in love with John McCain during the
Republican primaries. Like stem cells, McCain appears to be a
neutral entity with the miraculous ability to become whatever an
individual patient needs. Right-to-life McCainiacs admire his
hard-core anti-abortion voting record; liberal McCainiacs are
convinced he's secretly pro-choice. The McCainiac creed: Love him
for what he says today, or wait for him to apologize for it. But
with McCain out, will McCainiacs be willing to vote for politicians
who openly share their views?
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Middle-Seat Road Warriors.'' Six-figure proletarians of the
New Economy who fly coach and never manage to get an upgrade. Run
ragged by capitalism at its most frenzied, they are for lower taxes
but more regulation (requiring airlines to change the movie more
than once a month, for example). They are basically Republican, but
may vote for Gore in the hope that he will shorten their commute by
getting other people to give up their cars.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Oxymorons.'' Gay Republicans, black Republicans. These are
people who really, really want a capital gains tax cut. What other
explanation could there be? Though few in number, they are
disproportionately influential because every single one has been on
television. Every black Republican is a famous black Republican.
(Many observers believe that Democratic Microsoft employees also
qualify as Oxymorons in this election.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Angry Appliances.'' Threatened by imports, their sources of
power under attack by environmentalists, their very aesthetic
widely mocked as hopelessly 1970s, America's refrigerators, oven
ranges and dishwashers are dismayed, disgusted and, at the moment,
unfortunately, disenfranchised. But they have always been very
plugged in, and if they do get the vote during the next four years,
they could well be the deciding force in the election of 2004.

TALKING TO COMPUTERS IN A LANGUAGE OF LINES AND SPECKS
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
 (With CIR-BARCODES)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The companies that have created bar codes and digital watermarks
to link printed pages to sites on the Internet have their own
secrets about how they work. But much of it involves the idea that
a printed image can contain more than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The bar codes developed by GoCode, for example, look like little
rectangles made up of white specks on black squares and a few black
lines. In fact, those rectangles are a specialized type of symbol
called a two-dimensional bar code. The little specks form patterns
that provide an extra dimension of information than is available in
a traditional bar code, which is made up of straight lines. A bar
code with two white specks in the corner, for example, will send a
different message than one with one speck.
</P>
<P>
   The messages contain more than a URL, or Uniform Resource
Locator, that corresponds to a Web site. They include instructions
that tell the computer to open a Web browser and pull up that site.
``It's not just that it is raw information,'' said George Powell,
president of GoCode Products Corp. ``We pack tags, or protocols,
inside the code.''
</P>
<P>
   The straight lines on the left side of the code are simpler
signals designed to be picked up by the scanners first. ``They are
the piece that says, `Hey, I'm a GoCode and I'm over here,'''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   GoCode has developed a hand-held scanner that essentially takes
a picture of the bar code, deciphers what it says and sends that
information to the computer. GoCode, which is planning to
distribute the scanners free with the help of sponsorships,
estimates that the scanners will cost $100 or less in a retail
store.
</P>
<P>
   Digimarc's technology also uses images to store information but
takes a different approach. Its digital watermarks are designed not
to be perceptible to the human eye. ``It's like a dog whistle for
the Internet,'' said Bruce Davis, Digimarc's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for example, a photograph on a magazine page. Before
the magazine is printed, the watermark is applied to an electronic
version of the photograph by using Digimarc's production software.
When printed, the photograph may look no different at first glance,
but in fact the pixels have been adjusted to contain tiny signals
that can be picked up by a digital camera that includes Digimarc
software. The technology adjusts the luminance of the pixels, which
a trained eye might pick up as a slight variation in an image's
color or shades of light and dark.
</P>
<P>
   Jay McGill, publisher of Popular Mechanics, described the
difference as a slight graininess. ``But to the average consumer,''
he said, ``it will be difficult to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera, however, does detect the adjustments, and the
software decodes them into instructions for the computer, which
immediately pulls up a Web page specific to that watermark. The
marks could be applied to a whole page, to several images on a page
or even to a paragraph of text, Davis said.

ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES SEEN IN MUGABE INTRANSIGENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ A day after Commonwealth member nations condemned
the escalating violence in Zimbabwe this week, President Robert
Mugabe publicly spurned his critics and refused to halt
government-sponsored attacks against white farmers and his
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, South Africa's currency, the rand, dropped three
cents against the US dollar. That might not sound like much, but
the swiftness of the reaction, economic analysts say, indicates how
much Zimbabwe's crisis has rattled its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble comes at a time when southern African countries are
becoming increasingly reliant on each other, developing stronger
trading links and integerated transportation systems. But with the
unrest in Zimbabwe, investors are hedging across the region. Banks
are withholding credit. And companies are shutting down plants.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the rand, southern Africa's strongest and most stable
currency, hit record lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation continues to melt down,'' said Kevin Wakeford,
chief executive of the South African Chamber of Commerce. ``Trading
conditions are abnormal. Credit guarantees, foreign exchange
reserves, risk cover _ all that is absent. It is very difficult for
importers and exporters alike, and it is evident that the situation
is having a serious impact on our currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Already facing its worst economic crisis in at least a decade,
Zimbabwe plunged further into chaos in February as veterans of the
1970s war for independence began invading white-owned commercial
farms, the backbone of the economy. In the past 10 weeks, nearly
1,000 farms have come under violent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers lost their soy crops and have been blocked from
planting winter wheat. When trading opened last week on the annual
tobacco harvest, which accounts for 30 percent of Zimbabwe's annual
exports, barely a third of the normal yield wa on auction.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture represents for about 40 percent of Zimbabwe's total
annual output and is critical to Zimbabwe's foreign exchange
reserves, now too low to cover the debt owed by any one of the
state-owned utility companies. The country can't afford diesel
fuel, and banks, carrying about $158 million in farm debts, risk
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Regional leaders and Western donors offered Mugabe a generous
bailout in recent weeks. Britain promised $57 million and offered
to unfreeze earlier pledges to finance land reform, on condition
that Mugabe end the farm invasions and begin organizing the
upcoming parliamentary elections. South Africa lobbied the
International Monetary Fund to provide about $123 million to prop
up Zimbabwe's bankrupt electricity company, on similar conditions.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Mugabe has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no one ever think that we will call upon the war veterans
to withdraw,'' Mugabe said Wednesday, reacting to the
Commonwealth's expression of ``deep concerns'' over Zimbabwe's
rising instability. Britain responded by slapping its former colony
with an arms embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to keep their doors open, Zimbabwe's bankers warned
Tuesday that the country's arrears on debt payments had risen to
$350 million and that it risks defaulting on its entire $4.5
billion foreign debt. Zimbabwe's stock market, meanwhile, is
trading at a five-month low.
</P>
<P>
   Casting a wary eye northward, South Africa's Standard Chartered
Bank said Zimbabwe's economic decline has triggered profit warnings
from companies with operations in Zimbabwe. In its week bulletin
last week, the bank raised worries about a crisis in foreign
investor confidence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere has this been clearer than in South Africa,'' the bank
warned. ``Despite good fundamentals, sound fiscal policy, and
growth that is expected to accelerate over the coming years, the
rand has been caught up in the `Zimbabwean contagion.' '' Shaken
both by the decline in the euro, Europe's common currency, and
Zimbabwe's woes, the rand slid close to seven to the dollar
Wednesday on currency exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's crisis is particularly worrisome for South Africa,
which counts its northern neighbor as its largest African trading
partner. The two countries have entwined banking and industrial
sectors. Underscoring their concern, senior South African business,
financial, and agriculture leaders flew to Harare this week for
consultations on limiting the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Several South African manufacturers and construction firms have
suspended new investment in Zimbabwe in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political acts and behavior are undermining fundamental
capitalist values like the rule of law and property rights,''
Wakeford said. ``Our greatest fear is an implosion of Zimbabwe's
economy before the elections.''

HOW TO GIVE AWAY $21.8 BILLION

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Before Bill Gates began giving money away, people complained
that he was a miser.
 &HT;    Now that he is giving money away, they complain that: he's doing
it too late, isn't giving enough; that the projects he is financing
are too conservative, too liberal, too big, too small, too safe,
too risky, too conventional, too splashy.
 &HT;    Or they say he's only doing it to avoid taxes, or to expand
Microsoft's markets, or, especially, to improve his image in light
of the government's antitrust suit.
 &HT;    But in January, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation edged past
Britain's Wellcome Trust to become the largest in the world, with
assets of $21.8 billion. Even the greatest philanthropists of the
past did not give away as much in real dollars over their entire
lifetimes as Gates has at the age of 44.
 &HT;    Gates has always said that he will give away most of his fortune
before he dies. He plans to make sure his children are well taken
care of but doesn't want to leave them the burden of tremendous
wealth.
 &HT;    He probably has decades of earning and giving ahead. In
February, Patty Stonesifer, president of the foundation, said that
Gates thought it had reached about the right size for the time
being.
 &HT;    Gates has delegated the running of the foundation to Stonesifer,
a friend and former Microsoft executive, and to his father, William
H. Gates Jr., a 73-year-old retired attorney _ although he and his
wife, Melinda, are actively involved.
 &HT;    The foundation is already having a major impact _ not only on
specific projects in the fields of education and health but also on
other wealthy individuals, on the American conversation about
philanthropy and on public policy.
 &HT;    The aspects of his philanthropical work that Gates seems most
excited about have to do with redressing tremendous inequities in
global health. According to the World Health Organization, less
than 10 percent of the world's medical research financing is
directed at the health problems that afflict 90 percent of its
people.
 &HT;    Pharmaceutical companies don't make drugs for people who can't
afford them. And millions of children in poor countries die every
year from diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines.
The Gates Foundation recently pledged $750 million to help buy and
distribute those medications in developing countries through a new
group called Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
 &HT;    ``We're in this unbelievable era where you could argue, what's
the most amazing thing taking place?'' Gates says, leaning forward
in his chair at his Redmond office one morning in February. ``Is it
software technology stuff and the Internet and new forms of
communication? Or is it the revolution in biology?''
 &HT;    At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in January,
Gates was disappointed to find not everyone as galvanized as he is
by the combination of biotechnological innovation, widespread
social disparities and hugely difficult problems that might be
solved by the intervention of enormous resources and armies of
intelligent people. He sat on a panel that officially inaugurated
the global vaccine alliance with Gro Harlem Brundtland of WHO,
Carol Bellamy of UNICEF, James Wolfensohn of the World Bank,
Joaquim Chissano, the president of Mozambique, and Raymond
Gilmartin of Merck (pharmaceuticals).
 &HT;    It was, Gates said in his office a month later, a colossal bore:
``We're talking about saving three million lives a year here....
but that was one of the least inspirational, least informative
panels I've seen.''
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation is underwriting projects in Ghana, Gambia
and South Africa, focusing on childhood immunization, family
planning, cervical cancer, malaria, the reduction of maternal and
infant mortality and AIDS.
 &HT;    The foundation generally channels grants through existing
organizations, seeking to identify good projects that are already
under way and to find new models and strategies that work. The most
difficult problem, however, for potentially lifesaving
interventions is getting medications and services to the people who
need them.
 &HT;    The foundation's health financing will help improve people's
access to existing and newly developing medical technologies, and
support people who are finding innovative ways to approach public
health problems and promote major social change.
 &HT;    Lynette Denny, for example, is a gynecological oncologist
working with women in impoverished squatter villages and townships
near Cape Town. Most of the women have never seen a gynecologist,
much less had a Pap test. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of
cancer death among women in developing countries, but it can
effectively be prevented by early detection.
 &HT;    Because Pap smears are complicated to administer and expensive
to analyze, Denny's work led her and several colleagues to devise a
simple new screening test for cervical cancer. In early January,
the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study
showing that the new test detects the precursors of cervical cancer
at least as well as the Pap test does. Denny works with the
Alliance for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer, which received a
$50 million grant over five years from the Gates Foundation in
1999.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation has a lean, informal structure. Last year,
when Gates decided to combine two smaller charitable funds into one
and increase the endowment, he chose not to enlarge the foursome in
charge of ultimate decisions _ himself, his wife, his father (CEO),
and Stonesifer (president) _ and not to appoint a board.
 &HT;    Gates set up the first foundation in 1994, the year he married
Melinda. And, by all accounts Melinda has played a significant role
in directing more of her husband's attention to the world outside
Microsoft.
 &HT;    The foundation's senior adviser for global health is William
Foege, a widely revered epidemiologist and former head of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was part of the
international team that eradicated smallpox.
 &HT;    Stonesifer and Gates' father serve as co-chairpersons of the
foundation, and Gates and his wife set the overall direction and
priorities for their giving. The foundation receives more than
3,000 proposals a month, and the senior officers, with some staff
help, select lists of projects and submit them to Melinda and Bill,
who read and talk about the proposals and personally approve every
grant over $1 million.
 &HT;    Bill writes questions and comments all over the lists _
sometimes saying simply yes (to a request for $40 million) or no,
or ``tell me more about respiratory diseases,'' or ``why this
country?'' or ``if this does well what's the next step?'' His
negative response isn't always final: ``When I say no,'' he says
with a grin, ``somebody usually comes back with, `Did you really
mean to say no on this one?'''
 &HT;    Melinda is more closely involved than her husband in the
day-to-day operations of the organization. ``Melinda has a strong
interest in children and early childhood,'' says Stonesifer. ``Bill
is very interested in medical interventions and new tools, in
figuring out what is possible with new scientific technology. And
they are both passionate about how those areas can work together.''
 &HT;    Since foundations are required by law annually to give away 5
percent of their assets, the directors of this $21.8 billion fund
now have to dispense more than $1 billion a year _ not an easy
thing to do well. They insist on careful monitoring and evaluation
to assure that the money is not wasted or mismanaged. They take a
long-term, strategic view of what their grants can do.
 &HT;    So far, though, Gates' domestic U.S. programs have drawn more
critical fire than the work in international health.
 &HT;    Last September the foundation announced that it was pledging $1
billion over 20 years to scholarships for minority students _ for
full-time college programs and graduate study in engineering, math,
science, education or library science, to be administered by the
United Negro College Fund.
 &HT;    In October, the conservative Weekly Standard ran an article
called ``Bill Gates, Minority Leader: A Billion Dollars Is a
Terrible Thing to Waste.'' The argument: that the program should
not be race-based and is an attempt to circumvent recent
anti-affirmative-action rulings in states including Texas,
California and Washington.
 &HT;    Gates looks back with some amusement at his belated realization
that access to information technology might not be the answer to
the world's most serious problems. Microsoft was donating computers
to poor communities in Africa in the mid-'90s. But he says it was
toward the end of 1998 that he realized _ partly through working
with Foege and Gordon Perkin, the foundation's director of global
health, and partly through his own reading _ how little
international attention was being paid to some of the world's most
urgent medical problems and how much of a difference his
large-scale resources could make.
 &HT;    WHO estimates that malaria kills about 2 million people a year,
nearly half of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, infects about
200 million more and poses a risk to 2.3 billion _ more than a
third of the world's population.
 &HT;    Yet since most victims are poor, there has been no financial
incentive to develop a malaria vaccine. According to The Economist,
the amount of money spent on malaria vaccine research worldwide in
1996 was about $60 million. In June 1999 the Gates Foundation set
up a $50 million Malaria Vaccine Initiative.
 &HT;    ``With one grant,'' says Gates, ``we became the biggest private
funder of malaria research.''
 &HT;    The research fund creates what economists call a ``push''
mechanism, providing the means for scientists to conduct studies
that would not otherwise be economically feasible. Through its $750
million gift to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization,

HOW TO GIVE AWAY $21.8 BILLION

 By JEAN STROUSE 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Before Bill Gates began giving money away, people complained
that he was a miser.
 &HT;    Now that he is giving money away, they complain that: he's doing
it too late, isn't giving enough; that the projects he is financing
are too conservative, too liberal, too big, too small, too safe,
too risky, too conventional, too splashy.
 &HT;    Or they say he's only doing it to avoid taxes, or to expand
Microsoft's markets, or, especially, to improve his image in light
of the government's antitrust suit.
 &HT;    But in January, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation edged past
Britain's Wellcome Trust to become the largest in the world, with
assets of $21.8 billion. Even the greatest philanthropists of the
past did not give away as much in real dollars over their entire
lifetimes as Gates has at the age of 44.
 &HT;    Gates has always said that he will give away most of his fortune
before he dies. He plans to make sure his children are well taken
care of but doesn't want to leave them the burden of tremendous
wealth.
 &HT;    He probably has decades of earning and giving ahead. In
February, Patty Stonesifer, president of the foundation, said that
Gates thought it had reached about the right size for the time
being.
 &HT;    Gates has delegated the running of the foundation to Stonesifer,
a friend and former Microsoft executive, and to his father, William
H. Gates Jr., a 73-year-old retired attorney _ although he and his
wife, Melinda, are actively involved.
 &HT;    The foundation is already having a major impact _ not only on
specific projects in the fields of education and health but also on
other wealthy individuals, on the American conversation about
philanthropy and on public policy.
 &HT;    The aspects of his philanthropical work that Gates seems most
excited about have to do with redressing tremendous inequities in
global health. According to the World Health Organization, less
than 10 percent of the world's medical research financing is
directed at the health problems that afflict 90 percent of its
people.
 &HT;    Pharmaceutical companies don't make drugs for people who can't
afford them. And millions of children in poor countries die every
year from diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines.
The Gates Foundation recently pledged $750 million to help buy and
distribute those medications in developing countries through a new
group called Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
 &HT;    ``We're in this unbelievable era where you could argue, what's
the most amazing thing taking place?'' Gates says, leaning forward
in his chair at his Redmond office one morning in February. ``Is it
software technology stuff and the Internet and new forms of
communication? Or is it the revolution in biology?''
 &HT;    At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in January,
Gates was disappointed to find not everyone as galvanized as he is
by the combination of biotechnological innovation, widespread
social disparities and hugely difficult problems that might be
solved by the intervention of enormous resources and armies of
intelligent people. He sat on a panel that officially inaugurated
the global vaccine alliance with Gro Harlem Brundtland of WHO,
Carol Bellamy of UNICEF, James Wolfensohn of the World Bank,
Joaquim Chissano, the president of Mozambique, and Raymond
Gilmartin of Merck (pharmaceuticals).
 &HT;    It was, Gates said in his office a month later, a colossal bore:
``We're talking about saving three million lives a year here....
but that was one of the least inspirational, least informative
panels I've seen.''
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation is underwriting projects in Ghana, Gambia
and South Africa, focusing on childhood immunization, family
planning, cervical cancer, malaria, the reduction of maternal and
infant mortality and AIDS.
 &HT;    The foundation generally channels grants through existing
organizations, seeking to identify good projects that are already
under way and to find new models and strategies that work. The most
difficult problem, however, for potentially lifesaving
interventions is getting medications and services to the people who
need them.
 &HT;    The foundation's health financing will help improve people's
access to existing and newly developing medical technologies, and
support people who are finding innovative ways to approach public
health problems and promote major social change.
 &HT;    Lynette Denny, for example, is a gynecological oncologist
working with women in impoverished squatter villages and townships
near Cape Town. Most of the women have never seen a gynecologist,
much less had a Pap test. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of
cancer death among women in developing countries, but it can
effectively be prevented by early detection.
 &HT;    Because Pap smears are complicated to administer and expensive
to analyze, Denny's work led her and several colleagues to devise a
simple new screening test for cervical cancer. In early January,
the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study
showing that the new test detects the precursors of cervical cancer
at least as well as the Pap test does. Denny works with the
Alliance for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer, which received a
$50 million grant over five years from the Gates Foundation in
1999.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation has a lean, informal structure. Last year,
when Gates decided to combine two smaller charitable funds into one
and increase the endowment, he chose not to enlarge the foursome in
charge of ultimate decisions _ himself, his wife, his father (CEO),
and Stonesifer (president) _ and not to appoint a board.
 &HT;    Gates set up the first foundation in 1994, the year he married
Melinda. And, by all accounts Melinda has played a significant role
in directing more of her husband's attention to the world outside
Microsoft.
 &HT;    The foundation's senior adviser for global health is William
Foege, a widely revered epidemiologist and former head of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was part of the
international team that eradicated smallpox.
 &HT;    Stonesifer and Gates' father serve as co-chairpersons of the
foundation, and Gates and his wife set the overall direction and
priorities for their giving. The foundation receives more than
3,000 proposals a month, and the senior officers, with some staff
help, select lists of projects and submit them to Melinda and Bill,
who read and talk about the proposals and personally approve every
grant over $1 million.
 &HT;    Bill writes questions and comments all over the lists _
sometimes saying simply yes (to a request for $40 million) or no,
or ``tell me more about respiratory diseases,'' or ``why this
country?'' or ``if this does well what's the next step?'' His
negative response isn't always final: ``When I say no,'' he says
with a grin, ``somebody usually comes back with, `Did you really
mean to say no on this one?'''
 &HT;    Melinda is more closely involved than her husband in the
day-to-day operations of the organization. ``Melinda has a strong
interest in children and early childhood,'' says Stonesifer. ``Bill
is very interested in medical interventions and new tools, in
figuring out what is possible with new scientific technology. And
they are both passionate about how those areas can work together.''
 &HT;    Since foundations are required by law annually to give away 5
percent of their assets, the directors of this $21.8 billion fund
now have to dispense more than $1 billion a year _ not an easy
thing to do well. They insist on careful monitoring and evaluation
to assure that the money is not wasted or mismanaged. They take a
long-term, strategic view of what their grants can do.
 &HT;    So far, though, Gates' domestic U.S. programs have drawn more
critical fire than the work in international health.
 &HT;    Last September the foundation announced that it was pledging $1
billion over 20 years to scholarships for minority students _ for
full-time college programs and graduate study in engineering, math,
science, education or library science, to be administered by the
United Negro College Fund.
 &HT;    In October, the conservative Weekly Standard ran an article
called ``Bill Gates, Minority Leader: A Billion Dollars Is a
Terrible Thing to Waste.'' The argument: that the program should
not be race-based and is an attempt to circumvent recent
anti-affirmative-action rulings in states including Texas,
California and Washington.
 &HT;    Gates looks back with some amusement at his belated realization
that access to information technology might not be the answer to
the world's most serious problems. Microsoft was donating computers
to poor communities in Africa in the mid-'90s. But he says it was
toward the end of 1998 that he realized _ partly through working
with Foege and Gordon Perkin, the foundation's director of global
health, and partly through his own reading _ how little
international attention was being paid to some of the world's most
urgent medical problems and how much of a difference his
large-scale resources could make.
 &HT;    WHO estimates that malaria kills about 2 million people a year,
nearly half of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, infects about
200 million more and poses a risk to 2.3 billion _ more than a
third of the world's population.
 &HT;    Yet since most victims are poor, there has been no financial
incentive to develop a malaria vaccine. According to The Economist,
the amount of money spent on malaria vaccine research worldwide in
1996 was about $60 million. In June 1999 the Gates Foundation set
up a $50 million Malaria Vaccine Initiative.
 &HT;    ``With one grant,'' says Gates, ``we became the biggest private
funder of malaria research.''
 &HT;    The research fund creates what economists call a ``push''
mechanism, providing the means for scientists to conduct studies
that would not otherwise be economically feasible. Through its $750
million gift to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization,
it also gives pharmaceutical companies a ``pull'' incentive _
essentially saying, ``If you develop a vaccine, we'll buy and
distribute it.'' Still, scientists think it will take at least 10

therapy that has significantly slowed AIDS in the United States and
Europe, thinks the freedom Gates has to provide substantial
financing more quickly than the National Institutes of Health is
essential.
 &HT;    Wouldn't it be interesting, he reflects, ``if Bill Gates were
remembered in the future more for his philanthropy than for his
work with computers?''

 By JEAN STROUSE 
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Before Bill Gates began giving money away, people complained
that he was a miser.
 &HT;    Now that he is giving money away, they complain that: he's doing
it too late, isn't giving enough; that the projects he is financing
are too conservative, too liberal, too big, too small, too safe,
too risky, too conventional, too splashy.
 &HT;    Or they say he's only doing it to avoid taxes, or to expand
Microsoft's markets, or, especially, to improve his image in light
of the government's antitrust suit.
 &HT;    But in January, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation edged past
Britain's Wellcome Trust to become the largest in the world, with
assets of $21.8 billion. Even the greatest philanthropists of the
past did not give away as much in real dollars over their entire
lifetimes as Gates has at the age of 44.
 &HT;    Gates has always said that he will give away most of his fortune
before he dies. He plans to make sure his children are well taken
care of but doesn't want to leave them the burden of tremendous
wealth.
 &HT;    He probably has decades of earning and giving ahead. In
February, Patty Stonesifer, president of the foundation, said that
Gates thought it had reached about the right size for the time
being.
 &HT;    Gates has delegated the running of the foundation to Stonesifer,
a friend and former Microsoft executive, and to his father, William
H. Gates Jr., a 73-year-old retired attorney _ although he and his
wife, Melinda, are actively involved.
 &HT;    The foundation is already having a major impact _ not only on
specific projects in the fields of education and health but also on
other wealthy individuals, on the American conversation about
philanthropy and on public policy.
 &HT;    The aspects of his philanthropical work that Gates seems most
excited about have to do with redressing tremendous inequities in
global health. According to the World Health Organization, less
than 10 percent of the world's medical research financing is
directed at the health problems that afflict 90 percent of its
people.
 &HT;    Pharmaceutical companies don't make drugs for people who can't
afford them. And millions of children in poor countries die every
year from diseases that could be prevented by existing vaccines.
The Gates Foundation recently pledged $750 million to help buy and
distribute those medications in developing countries through a new
group called Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.
 &HT;    ``We're in this unbelievable era where you could argue, what's
the most amazing thing taking place?'' Gates says, leaning forward
in his chair at his Redmond office one morning in February. ``Is it
software technology stuff and the Internet and new forms of
communication? Or is it the revolution in biology?''
 &HT;    At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, in January,
Gates was disappointed to find not everyone as galvanized as he is
by the combination of biotechnological innovation, widespread
social disparities and hugely difficult problems that might be
solved by the intervention of enormous resources and armies of
intelligent people. He sat on a panel that officially inaugurated
the global vaccine alliance with Gro Harlem Brundtland of WHO,
Carol Bellamy of UNICEF, James Wolfensohn of the World Bank,
Joaquim Chissano, the president of Mozambique, and Raymond
Gilmartin of Merck (pharmaceuticals).
 &HT;    It was, Gates said in his office a month later, a colossal bore:
``We're talking about saving three million lives a year here....
but that was one of the least inspirational, least informative
panels I've seen.''
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation is underwriting projects in Ghana, Gambia
and South Africa, focusing on childhood immunization, family
planning, cervical cancer, malaria, the reduction of maternal and
infant mortality and AIDS.
 &HT;    The foundation generally channels grants through existing
organizations, seeking to identify good projects that are already
under way and to find new models and strategies that work. The most
difficult problem, however, for potentially lifesaving
interventions is getting medications and services to the people who
need them.
 &HT;    The foundation's health financing will help improve people's
access to existing and newly developing medical technologies, and
support people who are finding innovative ways to approach public
health problems and promote major social change.
 &HT;    Lynette Denny, for example, is a gynecological oncologist
working with women in impoverished squatter villages and townships
near Cape Town. Most of the women have never seen a gynecologist,
much less had a Pap test. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of
cancer death among women in developing countries, but it can
effectively be prevented by early detection.
 &HT;    Because Pap smears are complicated to administer and expensive
to analyze, Denny's work led her and several colleagues to devise a
simple new screening test for cervical cancer. In early January,
the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study
showing that the new test detects the precursors of cervical cancer
at least as well as the Pap test does. Denny works with the
Alliance for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer, which received a
$50 million grant over five years from the Gates Foundation in
1999.
 &HT;    The Gates Foundation has a lean, informal structure. Last year,
when Gates decided to combine two smaller charitable funds into one
and increase the endowment, he chose not to enlarge the foursome in
charge of ultimate decisions _ himself, his wife, his father (CEO),
and Stonesifer (president) _ and not to appoint a board.
 &HT;    Gates set up the first foundation in 1994, the year he married
Melinda. And, by all accounts Melinda has played a significant role
in directing more of her husband's attention to the world outside
Microsoft.
 &HT;    The foundation's senior adviser for global health is William
Foege, a widely revered epidemiologist and former head of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was part of the
international team that eradicated smallpox.
 &HT;    Stonesifer and Gates' father serve as co-chairpersons of the
foundation, and Gates and his wife set the overall direction and
priorities for their giving. The foundation receives more than
3,000 proposals a month, and the senior officers, with some staff
help, select lists of projects and submit them to Melinda and Bill,
who read and talk about the proposals and personally approve every
grant over $1 million.
 &HT;    Bill writes questions and comments all over the lists _
sometimes saying simply yes (to a request for $40 million) or no,
or ``tell me more about respiratory diseases,'' or ``why this
country?'' or ``if this does well what's the next step?'' His
negative response isn't always final: ``When I say no,'' he says
with a grin, ``somebody usually comes back with, `Did you really
mean to say no on this one?'''
 &HT;    Melinda is more closely involved than her husband in the
day-to-day operations of the organization. ``Melinda has a strong
interest in children and early childhood,'' says Stonesifer. ``Bill
is very interested in medical interventions and new tools, in
figuring out what is possible with new scientific technology. And
they are both passionate about how those areas can work together.''
 &HT;    Since foundations are required by law annually to give away 5
percent of their assets, the directors of this $21.8 billion fund
now have to dispense more than $1 billion a year _ not an easy
thing to do well. They insist on careful monitoring and evaluation
to assure that the money is not wasted or mismanaged. They take a
long-term, strategic view of what their grants can do.
 &HT;    So far, though, Gates' domestic U.S. programs have drawn more
critical fire than the work in international health.
 &HT;    Last September the foundation announced that it was pledging $1
billion over 20 years to scholarships for minority students _ for
full-time college programs and graduate study in engineering, math,
science, education or library science, to be administered by the
United Negro College Fund.
 &HT;    In October, the conservative Weekly Standard ran an article
called ``Bill Gates, Minority Leader: A Billion Dollars Is a
Terrible Thing to Waste.'' The argument: that the program should
not be race-based and is an attempt to circumvent recent
anti-affirmative-action rulings in states including Texas,
California and Washington.
 &HT;    Gates looks back with some amusement at his belated realization
that access to information technology might not be the answer to
the world's most serious problems. Microsoft was donating computers
to poor communities in Africa in the mid-'90s. But he says it was
toward the end of 1998 that he realized _ partly through working
with Foege and Gordon Perkin, the foundation's director of global
health, and partly through his own reading _ how little
international attention was being paid to some of the world's most
urgent medical problems and how much of a difference his
large-scale resources could make.
 &HT;    WHO estimates that malaria kills about 2 million people a year,
nearly half of them children in sub-Saharan Africa, infects about
200 million more and poses a risk to 2.3 billion _ more than a
third of the world's population.
 &HT;    Yet since most victims are poor, there has been no financial
incentive to develop a malaria vaccine. According to The Economist,
the amount of money spent on malaria vaccine research worldwide in
1996 was about $60 million. In June 1999 the Gates Foundation set
up a $50 million Malaria Vaccine Initiative.
 &HT;    ``With one grant,'' says Gates, ``we became the biggest private
funder of malaria research.''
 &HT;    The research fund creates what economists call a ``push''
mechanism, providing the means for scientists to conduct studies
that would not otherwise be economically feasible. Through its $750
million gift to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization,
it also gives pharmaceutical companies a ``pull'' incentive _
essentially saying, ``If you develop a vaccine, we'll buy and
distribute it.'' Still, scientists think it will take at least 10
years to find a vaccine against the extremely complex malaria
virus.
 &HT;    The foundation is also applying the ``pull'' mechanism to the
less glamorous but no less urgent problem of getting existing,
relatively cheap childhood vaccines against measles, whooping
cough, tetanus, polio and diphtheria to developing countries. The
$750 million fund will buy and distribute those basic drugs, along
with new ones against yellow fever, hepatitis B and Haemophilus
influenza type B.
 &HT;    One of the most ambitious of the Gates-financed projects is the
New York-based International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Founded by an
intense, 43-year-old physician named Seth Berkley, the initiative
identifies promising AIDS vaccine candidates, then brokers deals
with drug manufacturers and developing countries to fast-track the
candidates into clinical trials.
 &HT;    More than 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide,
about 70 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is
expected to kill more people in the coming decade than died in all
the wars of the 20th century. Pharmaceutical companies are not
about to spend enormous amounts of money developing a vaccine that
is needed primarily by people who can't afford it. But if the
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative supplies the research money,
a drug company would have no major costs to recoup. In exchange for
its financing, the initiative expects the company to provide the
vaccine at low cost in developing countries or forfeit the rights
to the technology.
 &HT;    In the fall of 1998, the initiative announced two novel vaccine
approaches for Kenya and South Africa and started preparations for
clinical trials. Early in 1999 the Gates Foundation provided a
five-year, $25 million grant for the effort.
 &HT;    Dr. David Ho, the director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research
Center, an affiliate of Rockefeller University, says, ``Vaccines
are the biggest thing in AIDS research today.''
 &HT;    Ho, who came up with the concept of the triple-combination drug
therapy that has significantly slowed AIDS in the United States and
Europe, thinks the freedom Gates has to provide substantial
financing more quickly than the National Institutes of Health is
essential.
 &HT;    Wouldn't it be interesting, he reflects, ``if Bill Gates were
remembered in the future more for his philanthropy than for his
work with computers?''

ALTAVISTA LAUNCHES SIMPLIFIED SEARCH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AltaVista Co., the Internet search engine developed from Digital
Equipment Corp.'s research labs, launched a new Web site Wednesday
in an effort to fend off rivals chipping away at the company's
market share.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, named Raging Search, is a radically simplified
version of AltaVista's main Web site. That orginal site has
struggled over the years to win over notoriously fickle Web users
by adding a plethora of features, such as stock quotes, weather
reports, e-mail, news, and shopping, in addition to its signature
search service.
</P>
<P>
   While those features drew more people to AltaVista's Web site,
they also distracted from its search engine. As a result, AltaVista
lost some of its core following to newcomers such as Google.com and
Northern Light, whose simpler sites feature only searching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Raging Search is AltaVista's attempt to recapture what it calls
``search enthusiasts,'' such as professional researchers,
librarians and students. Raging Search will operate alongside
AltaVista's main site, which will continue to have a menu of
services and compete with portal companies such as Yahoo! and Lycos
for casual Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on reinforcing the core foundational strength
of AltaVista, which is our search service,'' said Rod Schrock,
chief executive of the Palo Alto, Calif., company. ``For the first
time, we're segmenting the market. Our new, pure Web search site
will be the fastest, most unobstructed path to Web pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com based in
Britian, said AltaVista's move represented the first time a search
engine has launched a completely new site to cater to hard core
users and opinion makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No established search engine has ever gone that route
before,'' Sullivan said. ``Ultimately, this may give them a way to
keep their loyal audience, while allowing them to tinker with their
main site.''
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's search engines respond to 40 million queries a day
worldwide, giving them a 35 percent market share of the total
search queries on the Internet, according to company data.
</P>
<P>
   But when measured by the volume of traffic it garners, AltaVista
captures just 17 percent of Web surfers who visit search sites,
according to Media Metrix. Yahoo! captures a commanding 63.5
percent, while Lycos has 38.5 percent (combined totals exceed 100
percent because people tend to visit more than one site to do a
single search).
</P>
<P>
   Greg Memo, senior vice president at AltaVista, said the
discrepancy lies in the fact that Media Metrix does not count
traffic outside of the United States, where AltaVista gets over
half of its queries.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock said the launch of Raging Search was not scheduled to
coincide with AltaVista's pending initial public stock offering.
The company announced several weeks ago that it has postponed its
IPO until the recent stock market turmoil settles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for the market to come back,'' Schrock said
Wednesday. But he gave no indication of when the company might
proceed with its IPO.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has yet to make a profit since its inception in 1995.
It is jointly owned by CMGI, a venture capital firm in Andover, and
Compaq Computer, which acquired Digital Equipment in 1998.

<P>
   Readers of The Post and Courier, the daily newspaper in
Charleston, S.C., may have noticed something peculiar about their
paper this week. Tiny black marks, no wider or higher than a
five-letter word in a news column, have been appearing throughout
the pages since Monday. There is one under the weather map, another
on the masthead, still more at the top of the business and local
sections.
</P>
<P>
   These little symbols, which at first glance appear to be nothing
more than smudges, provide a direct link between the newspaper and
the Internet. Each mark is a miniature Universal Product Code for a
Web address. When those UPCs, or bar codes, are read by a hand-held
scanner connected to a computer, a Web page pops up on the screen.
The bar code under the weather map, for example, takes readers to
the weather page on the newspaper's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Alan H. Seim, director of Internet operations at The Post and
Courier, considers the bar codes a much-needed solution to a
problem that newspapers and their readers have been facing since
the dawn of the Web: the awkwardness of printing and typing (let
alone remembering) a new Web address.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just beep on this thing and you're there,'' Seim said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny bar codes are more than just a print-based
replacement for long Web addresses. They are one of several new
technologies that create hyperlinks for the physical world,
establishing a direct connection between static objects and the
ever-changing Internet. With these links, magazines, books,
postcards, product packages _ any imaginable artifacts with room
for bar codes _ could become on-ramps to Web pages that offer
related reports, movies, sound clips or online order forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Post and Courier is the first newspaper in the country to
experiment with the miniature-bar-code technology. This month,
Charleston residents who sign up as testers will receive free
hand-held scanners so they can activate the bar codes and jump
straight to the corresponding Web sites. GoCode, the Charleston
company that developed the technology, will also put the codes in
several catalogs in the next few months, and more free hand-held
scanners will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, observant readers of Wired magazine and Popular
Mechanics may spot another version of these offline links. For
them, the mark will not be a smudgelike bar code but a small logo
with an uppercase ``D'' lurking on the lower outside corner of some
pages. The D stands for Digimarc, a company that has developed a
way to embed nearly imperceptible digital watermarks in printed
text and photographs. When held up to a Webcam perched on a
monitor, the watermarks tell the computer to display related Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Digimarc will offer free software that can be
downloaded and integrated with software for the Webcams. By
summer's end, company officials say, most Webcam manufacturers will
have integrated the Digimarc software into their products. The
company, meanwhile, is hoping to have signed contracts with more
than 100 magazines that will use the watermarks.
</P>
<P>
   Bar codes of other shapes and sizes may also dot the pages of
print publications soon. Belo, a media company in Dallas, announced
that it would incorporate bar codes into some of the pages of its
newspapers, which include The Dallas Morning News and The
Providence Journal in Rhode Island. A bar code reader developed by
DigitalConvergence.:Com, a hyperlink company, will be distributed
to read those symbols and translate them into Web pages that appear
on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Belo's 17 television stations are also considering a version of
the technology that uses sounds instead of symbols. To open a Web
page, a television program could emit an audible tone that would
send a signal to a computer that was connected to the television
via audio cables.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have experimented with offline links say that they
have potential to change the way people approach the Web. Until
now, people who see a printed Web address have had to jot it down,
tear out the corresponding page or try to remember the Web site's
top-level domain name so they can search the site later. And once
they remember to visit the sites, they often have to dig through
multiple Web pages to find what they want. According to Internet
analysts, most people give up after three or four clicks.
</P>
<P>
   But with digital watermarks or bar codes, a printed page will
have ``embedded intelligence,'' said Guy Creese, a senior analyst
at the Aberdeen Group, a strategic consulting company. Creese saw a
demonstration of Digimarc's technology a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strikes me as an intriguing way to handle the information
overload problem,'' Creese said. ``It really brings impulse buying
and searching to a new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that increases the possibility of impulse buying is
bound to attract advertisers. Ford Motor Co., for example, is
preparing to include Digimarc's technology in full-page
advertisements in both Wired and Popular Mechanics. At least 10
other advertisers, including Visa and Sony, are also planning to
test the technology.
</P>
<P>
   But before offline linking enters the mainstream, it must clear
a hardware hurdle. Hand-held scanners or Webcams will have to
become as ubiquitous as computers, analysts say. GoCode is trying
to make that happen by giving away scanners that are sponsored by
advertisers and that will come with buttons that take users to the
sponsors' Web sites. DigitalConvergence.:Com has a similar idea.
And Digimarc is hoping that the growing popularity of Webcams will
give it an edge.
</P>
<P>
   But even if people have the right equipment, companies face
another problem: getting people to make the technology part of
their routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is that you have to teach someone to use it,''
said David Cooperstein, a research director at Forrester Research,
after seeing a demonstration of GoCode's technology. People will
have to be shown that the bar code ``is not just a smudge on the
page,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seim, of The Post and Courier, is aware of those issues. But his
newspaper is prepared to take on the challenge in exchange for the
chance to offer a cutting-edge service to its readers. A regional
paper with a daily circulation of 110,000, The Post and Courier has
been trying with mixed success to integrate the newspaper and its
Web site. Most of the stories on the site, Seim said, are
``shovelware,'' digital versions of exactly what appears in the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of the bar codes, the newspaper has more
incentive to include updated news and weather reports on its Web
site. While printed Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, have always
given ambitious readers an invitation to the Web site, the bar
codes provide a much easier way to make the connection, Seim said.
With a scanner in hand, going to the Web becomes part of the
reading experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to keep the readers involved with you and your
site,'' Seim said. ``People might like to find out, for example,
what happened with Elian Gonzalez since the time the page was
printed.''

   Classified advertising is another area of the newspaper that
will take advantage of the technology. Seim is hoping that the
paper's staff members will soon start using software that will
automatically convert new URLs to bar codes during the editorial or
layout process. (He is currently using static bar codes that are
set for specific Web sites.) Once that happens, the classified
advertising section will be specked with the bar codes. A two-line
pitch about a used car could immediately link to the seller's Web
site, complete with photographs, references and details about the
car's maintenance record.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Mechanics is planning to add more timely content to its
Web site to take advantage of the digital watermarks that will
first appear in its August issue. Jay McGill, the magazine's
publisher, said he expected at least three or four feature
articles, as well as nearly a dozen advertisements, to have the
watermarks embedded within them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the magazine has been running a monthly column
about the progress of a NASCAR racing team. By the time the
magazine is published, the columns are out of date because magazine
writers usually work several weeks ahead of publication dates. But
once the column is embedded with an offline link, it can transport
people directly to the Web site of the magazine, which will start
offering weekly updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will change the dynamic of how we edit the
magazine and relationships with our readers,'' McGill said. He
added that when he first saw the technology and observed how fast
Web pages opened after simply holding the magazine up to the
Webcam, ``I just went, Wow, we have to have this.''
</P>
<P>
   McGill added, however, that in addition to the requirement of
Webcams, offline links are burdened with another drawback: people
have to take the magazines to their computers to gain access to the
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts are optimistic that advances in wireless
technology in the next year will make the concept viable. If the
bar codes and watermarks could be scanned and stored by a wireless
device instead of by a scanner or Webcam tethered to the computer,
they would be more useful.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, if the marks could be scanned by a device that
talked to a personal digital assistant with wireless Internet
service, people could gain access to the sites they were reading
about while there were on the subway _ or on the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting this bolted into a PDA makes a lot of sense,'' said
Creese, of the Aberdeen Group.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the technology emerges, the founders of the
companies creating offline links are envisioning broader
applications for their products. Bruce Davis, chief executive and
president of Digimarc, said that he was working toward a day when
digital watermarks would be embedded in books, CDs, bank cards and
direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   T.B. Pickens, the founder of GoCode, has begun distributing
business cards that contain his bar code. By the end of the month,
people who receive his card and scan the code will be able to
import his contact information directly into Outlook, Microsoft's
address book, with one click. Even more personal data, like credit
card numbers and a shipping address, are also embedded in the bar
code for Pickens' use. He unlocks the sensitive data by scanning
his business card and then scanning a house key that features a
sticker with a corresponding bar code. When both are scanned
together, Pickens can fill in online order forms with a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Palm Computing are also testing the prospects of offline
links. The companies are working with a Safeway grocery store in
England that has provided Palm PDA's equipped with built-in
scanners to more than 500 of its customers. When the customers scan
the bar codes on the packages of any products they are running out
of _ whether soup cans or cereal boxes _ the computer adds those
products to digital grocery lists. The system uses the Internet to
send each list to Safeway, where employees collect and package the
products so they can be picked up by the customer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, officials at The Post and Courier say they are
excited to be one of the first publications trying out the
technology, even if it means that their newspaper is specked with
tiny black rectangles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it could be a breakthrough on how to connect the
reader of the printed word to the Internet,'' said Larry Tarleton,
associate publisher of The Post and Courier. ``And a lot of people
are trying to figure that out.''

RACISM, SCHMACISM: OPPOSING INTERMARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Judith Shulevitz write's Slate's ``Culturebox'' column)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it racist for Jews to oppose intermarriage? In his current
New York Observer column, Philip Weiss says it is. Weiss (who is
married to a non-Jew) thinks that the cold shoulder some Jews give
Jews who marry non-Jews is just as bad as the ban against
interracial dating recently rescinded by Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore picked Orthodox Jew Sen. Joseph Lieberman (who would
presumably oppose intermarriage for his own children) to be his
running mate, says Weiss, then Gore would be vulnerable to the same
sort of attack that was made on George W. Bush after he spoke at
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' analogy is flawed in the following four ways:
</P>
<P>
   -- Judaism is, among other things, a religion. The Jewish
objection to intermarriage is (in part) identical to the Catholic,
Moslem, Greek Orthodox, etc., objection to intermarriage. If you
recognize the right of these religions to exist, then you have to
acknowledge the validity of their distress at intermarriage and
their attempts to limit it: Intermarriage disrupts the continuity
of their customs and beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   People who intermarry are less likely to lead an observant life
themselves, and to bring up their children to be religious, than
those who marry within their own faith. Judaism, with its socially
isolating rules about food and the Sabbath, is particularly
susceptible to attrition through intermarriage. Even the most
religious Jews drop their opposition to a so-called ``mixed
marriage'' when the non-Jewish partner converts.
</P>
<P>
   The edict at Bob Jones, on the other hand, was aimed at the
preservation of a race. A white person was not allowed to date a
black person. There was no conversion option. It didn't matter
whether both were Baptists or one was Bahai and one was Hindu.
</P>
<P>
   -- To be fair to Weiss, while Judaism may be a religion, it's
also an ethnicity, though such a broadly defined one that the
notion of a ``Jewish people'' is more of a myth than a reality _
after 2,000 years of Diaspora there are Indian Jews, Chinese Jews,
and Ethiopian Jews. (One thing Judaism clearly isn't is a race.)
Some Jews oppose intermarriage more out of a sense of tribal
loyalty than out of love for their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even that chauvinistic position, though possibly less valid
than the objection to intermarriage on religious grounds, is more
valid than Bob Jones University's ban on interracial dating. Racism
looks outward with horror. Its efforts are directed at preventing
possible infection by the other. Racists frown on what they view as
miscegenation because they hate blacks, Indians, Jews, the Irish,
and so on. Tribalism, by contrast, looks inward with worried
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The primary concern of Jews, as with other ethnic minorities, is
maintaining the survival of their own group, not keeping out
others. The proof of this is the existence and common use of
conversion rituals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, racism and tribalism have the same practical
affect on intermarriage: They put obstacles in its path, and they
impose a penalty on those who do it anyway. The formal distinction
between racism and tribalism may be limited in this regard. But if
you wish to make moral comparisons between the two forms of
discrimination, motivations must be factored in.
</P>
<P>
   -- Some forms of ethnic chauvinism bear larger historical
burdens than others. It would be nice if we lived in a world in
which all formally identical acts of discrimination carried the
same social weight. But we don't. After 400 years of slavery, say,
or the Holocaust, it is more reprehensible to get upset if your
child marries a black or Jewish person (barring a legitimate
religious objection) than it is for black and Jewish parents to
frown upon their children marrying outside their respective groups,
if that's the only reason the parents object.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Frowning'' is an important term here. It's indisputable
that some Jews greet the non-Jewish spouses of fellow Jews with
less than warmth and cordiality. Jews have been known to mutter
behind the backs even of converts. This is deplorable, but there's
a big difference between private acts of chauvinism and
institutional discrimination, which is what was practiced at Bob
Jones before it lifted the ban on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   And yet _ as Weiss points out _ Judaism does countenance formal
discrimination against the intermarried. Jews married to non-Jews
may not be ordained as Conservative or Orthodox rabbis. They can't
hold certain executive positions at Conservative or Orthodox
synagogues. The children of non-Jewish mothers are barred from some
aspects of religious education. (Conservative and Orthodox Judaism
are matrilineal; for complicated reasons having to do with the
conditions of life in medieval Jewish ghettoes, these Jews consider
religious identity to be passed along through the mother, so all
children of Jewish mothers are technically Jewish.)
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note, however, that these rules pertain to
life in the religious, not the social or civic, realm and are part
of a large package of ritual observances required of rabbis and
board members, at least at Conservative and Orthodox synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they're also supposed to keep kosher and observe
the Sabbath _ and marrying outside the faith is at least as
egregious a violation of Jewish law as eating ham or driving on
Saturday. As for the children of non-Jewish mothers, as non-Jews
they are forbidden to enroll in some religious schools because of a
rule that says non-Jews can't have a Bar or Bat Mitzvah, which is
the goal of most secondary Jewish education. In those cases, all
that's required for them to register is to convert.
</P>
<P>
   From a religious perspective, it's illogical for an intermarried
Jew to protest that he or she can't hold this or that position at a
synagogue or seminary or even a religious Jewish summer camp. Two
basic principles of religious life are 1) that there are rules and
2) that they must be followed. These principles also apply in just
about every organized area of secular life: If you don't like one
of the rules, you're allowed to petition to have it changed, but
you're not allowed to break it individually without penalty. A
National League baseball team can't use a designated hitter, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   So to condemn Jewish organizations for not allowing people to
violate a law they don't like is to hold them to a standard we
don't apply to any other institution.

DIGITAL DIARIES OFFER ANGST AND INSPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ALICE KEIM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My first journal, which I kept when I was in third grade, was
white with colored hearts and a tiny brass lock. For several weeks
I wrote about what I did each day and declared love or disdain for
various family members and friends. For a while I even wrote about
each of my stuffed animals and their imaginary adventures.
</P>
<P>
   But before long I began to skip days, and my entries became
shorter. Less than a month after starting, my highlights consisted
of ``Today was a normal day'' or ``Nothing happened today.'' My
journal writing burnout lasted until high school, when I began
writing again, this time recording my moments of anxiety and great
insight in a pastel blue Laura Ashley journal.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric-covered journals I remember are still available, but
children now have software options that perform the same function:
helping them to express their thoughts, emotions, joys and fears in
private.
</P>
<P>
   YOUR NOTEBOOK (WITH HELP FROM AMELIA) _ This is an outlet for
creative young journal writers. Amelia, a fictional 10-year-old
created by Marissa Moss, is imaginative and shows an appreciation
for sarcasm without the usual teen-age bitterness. You enter her
room, where the walls, posters, windows and books are all
interactive. Clicking on the poster of a rocket, for example,
causes the rocket to take off and a parachutist to pass the window.
But beyond a fun start, the bedroom has little to do with the
journal.
</P>
<P>
   The journal writer can choose among fonts, colors, pictures and
designs, either on a blank page or on pages with titles like
``Friends Forever'' or ``Things I Hate.'' Images can be imported
from other programs or from a huge library.
</P>
<P>
   I created a page using the ``Gross Food'' heading, where I
described the horrors of eating eggplant. Then I used the drawing
tools to draw a picture of the dreadful vegetable. With a
microphone, I could have recorded my voice saying ``yuck,'' to be
sounded whenever the mouse ran over my drawing.
</P>
<P>
   I started another page with a blank layout and imported a
scanned photograph and some happy music. There are many creative
corners to explore, and a user with writer's block can click on a
light bulb icon for suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the program ran slowly when creating new pages
and journals and when importing images. The print screen provides
suggestions about binding a printed journal up to 50 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   DIARY MAKER _ This program, from Scholastic, approaches journal
writing as an art. The journal portion seemed primitive compared
with the other programs, but its educational program includes
excerpts from the journals of Anne Frank; Latoya Hunter, a
immigrant teen-ager who grew up in the Bronx; and Zlata Filipovic,
a young girl who wrote about her struggle to survive in Sarajevo
during the Bosian War. Users can hear pages of the diaries read in
English and explore other information about these journal keepers.
All three provide the inspiration and motivation to practice the
art of journal writing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Diary Maker's writing component does not measure
up. It is simple and feels ready for an upgrade. Users can add
backgrounds, sounds and images to their journals, but there are no
drawing tools, and the library of stamps and sounds is limited. The
program provides remarkable inspiration for writing, but its tools
will feel restrictive to today's computer-using writers.
</P>
<P>
   DARIA'S SICK, SAD LIFE PLANNER _ This software, for older
children and young adults, takes a cynical approach. It includes a
calendar, a planner, a journal and other electronic toys. The
program is similar to any organizer product but it has sardonic,
angst-ridden comments from Daria, the MTV cartoon teen-ager,
interjected throughout. The tools are accessible and useful, but I
found the extras, like Daria screen savers and icons,
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   I am a Daria fan, and as I typed daily musings into the journal,
I found my own inner Daria scowling through. It becomes nearly
impossible to write anything overly enthusiastic or optimistic in
this journal.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes an address book, but when you add a buddy,
the somber Daria comments, ``Great, another person who pretends
they like you.'' For a teen-ager predisposed to thinking this way,
the Daria journal offers encouragement _ maybe too much.

  Career styles differ but the goals are the same for `Now and Again'
stars 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Fri., May 5.) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a photo shoot featuring TV performers expected to be the
film stars of tomorrow for a glossy magazine, a photo assistant
squeezes the air out of some oversized beach toys that surround a
figure-eight-shaped pool, while a hotel employee runs a wet mop
around the outside of the pool to no discernible effect. Just a few
minutes ago, Eric Close, who stars on ``Now and Again'' as Michael
Wiseman, a middle-age former insurance salesman reborn as a lean,
dreamy governmental crime-fighting machine, was helping start an
exodus of young, beautiful and fully clothed young actors into that
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he sits calmly (and dryly) in the hotel bar, which sports a
chic '60s retro look, the kind of place George Jetson would come to
drown his sorrows. Close, however, orders nothing stronger than an
iced tea, and explains that the photo shoot is important because it
should help his feature film career, which, he makes clear, is very
important to him.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, Margaret Colin, who has a solid movie
background _ she was on hand to witness the world being saved in
``Independence Day'' _ and currently plays Wiseman's ``widowed''
wife, Lisa, sits in an elegant dining room and makes it clear that
doing a movie over the summer would be OK, but she's not going to
knock herself out worrying about such things.
</P>
<P>
   Opposites attract: Together, the ambitious Close and the more
career-casual Colin form television's most unique couple suffering
through unrequited passion. In the show's set-up, Michael was a
frumpy guy (played by John Goodman) killed by a speeding subway
train at the beginning of the season only to reawaken with his
brain in the body of a much younger and hunkier man. Not a bad deal
_ except that, to perform the secret government work required of
him, he's not supposed to contact his wife ever again. (Obviously,
that rule has been broken at length over the season, but Michael
has never revealed to Lisa his true identity.)
</P>
<P>
   Upon its debut last September, ``Now and Again'' was hailed as a
roundly entertaining genre-buster _ the year's best (and not just
because it was the only) romantic action-adventure comedy. Still,
the hot buzz hasn't quite lasted; as we near the time that the
networks will announce their upcoming fall schedules, ``Now and
Again'' is what is called ``on the bubble,'' meaning it could
either be picked up for a second season _ or that Michael Wiseman
could die a second death. The series offers up its season finale
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the bubble _ that's a new phrase for me!'' says Colin,
laughing. She then offers an argument why the show should return:
``We did better there than CBS has done since 'Beauty and the
Beast,' which was a long time ago. And what else do they have
that's going to do as well in that time slot as we have? It's not
the most flowery way to look at our show, but I heard someone
thinking that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Close blames, with good reason, the Friday time slot _ the show
is designed to appeal to the sort of audience that is likely out on
a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 'The Practice' was languishing on Saturday night, and
when it was moved _ boom. We need a chance to build the show _
we're at a place where we're about ready to pop,'' he says, and
helpfully offers a suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday at 10, right after 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' would be
great,'' he says. ``Right now, they have 'Family Law,' which is a
real serious drama, and since you have all these comedies (earlier
on the schedule), I think it'd be nice to go into a dramedy. I know
Glenn (Gordon Caron, the series' creator) would love to be on
Mondays at 10, too. But I'm not in the executives' office, I've
just got to do my job. Everything about this show makes it a
winner. The only thing it's missing at this point is, it's in a
tough time slot.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor working against ``Now and Again'' is its adventure
quotient results in budget-busting sequences. Close, who previously
starred in the adventure series ``Dark Skies'' and ``The
Magnificent Seven,'' says, ``Somehow, I keep getting on these
huge-budget shows, and if they're not doing the numbers that the
advertisers are looking for, it's hard to justify keeping it on the
air. This show is grabbing the demographic they want _ it's a fun,
young, hip show. The advertisers like the show, and that'll make a
difference in the life of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin jokingly offers a money-saving solution: ``I say, you want
to save some money, do a blackout episode. We'll walk around with
candles and flashlights saying, 'Look, he's flying through the
air!'''
</P>
<P>
   When Close and Colin got the script for the pilot, there was no
way they could guess the series' direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn used to describe the episodes in terms of this musical
or that musical, then he ran out of references,'' Colin recalls.
``It was 'Damn Yankees' a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely curious to know where it was going to go _ I
talked to Glenn, and he assured me that he wasn't going to do your
basic superhero show, that he was going to take it in different
directions and surprise people,'' Close says. ``I think what
happens in the first season is, you get a sense of what people like
and don't like, what they want to see more of and what they want to
see less of.''

   Friday's episode will bring back the Eggman _ the enigmatic
terrorist who opened the series by killing passengers in a Tokyo
subway, only to disappear a couple of episodes later. ``I think
people have been longing to see that, to see Michael go out on
missions, and we're gonna start using his abilities on the job he
was designed for. We're setting the groundwork for where the show's
going to go, but I hope the show never gets married to one
direction. What'll make it exciting and creative is mixing it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin says, ``We'll be put together again in some big
end-of-the-world plight that's worth it for him to risk revealing
himself. But it's like the 'Fugitive' _ he can't really tell who he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Colin buys that the show's premise can't offer flights
of fancy that would allow Michael and Lisa fleeting moments of
passion. ``Glenn's opened up this huge sci-fi ball of wax _ take
romance there. We have to spend more time developing romantic and
sexual tension so that people can root for us. Ninety percent of
the time, when I'm in the same room with the man, I'm yelling at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests cribbing the gizmo from the movie ``Men in Black''
that erases memories: ``How wickedly tickling for them to hook up
and then to remove it from their consciousness,'' Colin suggests.
``Since you've already introduced the sci-fi element, use it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Close observes, ``I think they're doing a
good job of not letting Margaret's character not stagnate in one
place. They're letting her move on and grow _ she definitely
doesn't play the pathetic widow. They can focus stories on her
life, too, and eventually, they'll be able just to weave back and
forth just occasionally to remind the audience of who they are to
each other without overkilling it. But it's a difficult thing to do
_ you don't want to wear that out, the whole relationship between
the two of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin, for her part, thinks more could be done. ``Everything I
suggest, Glenn gives to another character. So I no longer suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a charming, enthusiastic young man with a lot of
playfulness in him,'' she continues, ``but what we have yet to
explore in this show is her seeing someone beyond his years in that
man. He knows what music she likes, but that's not enough to knock
her over. Glenn has to step up and write that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Now and Again.'' &QL; 
What: The Eggman is back in the season finale. &QL; 
The stars: Eric Close, Margaret Colin. &QL; 
Where: CBS. &QL; 
When: 9 tonight.

DEMOCRATS ACCUSE DELAY OF RACKETEERING IN GOP FUND-RAISING EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, congressional
Democrats accused Rep. Tom DeLay, the House Majority Whip, of
engaging in extortion, racketeering and money laundering in his
aggressive fund raising for Republican candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said that the suit was filed in
an effort to stop ``massive illegal conduct'' by DeLay, R-Texas,
who has raised millions of dollars for the Republican party through
a variety of committees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the third attempt in the past year by Democrats
to corral DeLay's fund-raising empire that some critics and
admirers have come to call ``DeLay, Inc.'' Democrats last year
complained to the Justice Department and the Federal Election
Commission about DeLay's tactics, without immediate result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeLay is unfortunately conducting these activities under
the color of his office,'' Kennedy said at a press conference
Wednesday, ``He seeks through the use of systematic extortion to
coerce the contribution of millions of dollars to Republicans and
to intimidate those inclined to support Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply, DeLay declared himself ``saddened and disappointed''
that Democrats would tarnish the dignity of the House ``by
resorting to ugly, unfounded, politically motivated charges for
their own political gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Baron, a spokesman for DeLay, said that the charges
were baseless and DeLay would vigorously contest them, if they are
not quickly dismissed by the court. ``This is a tactic designed to
limit Republican fund raising. That's all this is,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit attempts to apply the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act, known by the acronym RICO, to
DeLay's fund-raising activities through a variety of linked
committees.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is drawn chiefly from news reports over the past
year that detail DeLay's forceful efforts to persuade corporate
lobbyists to donate large sums to a number of political action
committees controlled by DeLay and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Bauer, the Democratic lawyer who drew up the
complaint, said he believed it was the first time that the
racketeering statute had been applied in a political fund-raising
case, although the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch
cited the law in one of its complaints against the Clinton-Gore
re-election committee of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said that the law can be applied against any form of
bribery or extortion by an organized group. He also said that
federal money-laundering laws govern political as well as criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kenneth A. Gross, a former chief of enforcement at the
Federal Election Commission, said the attempt to apply the
racketeering law to political fund raising was creative but legally
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that Mr. DeLay is an aggressive
fund-raiser,'' Gross said, ``but to allege that he's crossed the
line into racketeering as a legal matter is a real stretch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gross speculated that the Democrats were hoping to use the
lawsuit to engage in extensive pre-trial discovery, allowing them
to pore through the records of DeLay's various fund-raising
committees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names several DeLay-related committees as part of a
scheme to extort and launder illegal political funds, but focuses
on the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a group that plans to
spend $25 million on voter turnout and issue advertising in the
fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The group is organized under a provision of the Internal Revenue
Code known as section 527 that allows it to raise and spend
unlimited amounts of money with no disclosure, as long as it does
not advocate the election or defeat of individual candidates. The
Democrats contend that such activities amount to illegal money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Gallant, chairman of the Republican Majority Issues
Committee, said that the lawsuit was a threat to the group's
free-speech rights and an effort by Democratic ``hacks'' to stifle
independent political groups. He said that liberal groups, such as
the Sierra Club, were also taking advantage of the section 527
loophole.

EMBATTLED SRI LANKA TRIES TO BLUNT TAMIL REBEL OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Sri Lankan cabinet took emergency steps
Wednesday night to divert money to the war effort at the northern
tip of this island nation, where government forces are battling
Tamil rebels _ and the rebels are winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a guerrilla group that is
notorious for its suicide bombers, Wednesday lobbed mortar fire
into a strategic military base on Sri Lanka's northern peninsula in
the latest phase of a powerful offensive. They are trying to
reclaim Jaffna, the city at the heart of the Tamil ethnic
minority's culture, which the rebels lost to government forces five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, designated a terrorist outfit by the United States,
have delivered humiliating defeats to the army on their recent
march toward Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   They routed the government on April 22 at the Elephant Pass army
base, which is on a slender spit of land connecting the rest of the
island to the Jaffna Peninsula, and forced as many as 17,000 troops
to retreat to the north.
</P>
<P>
   And they proceeded to overrun the Pallai army base this weekend,
moving another step closer to Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task was to inflict casualties and get back to fight
another day,'' Brig. Palithi Fernando, spokesman for the Sri Lankan
military, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``We're fighting
a defensive battle.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Tigers pounded the Kilali military base on the
coast, just 23 miles east of Jaffna, with sporadic mortar fire, the
brigadier said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing that more than 30,000 government soldiers
could be trapped on the Jaffna peninsula _ at the mercy of the
merciless Tigers _ Sri Lanka's foreign minister, Lakshman
Kadirgamar, came to Delhi on Wednesday to meet with India's prime
minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and said a request to India for
help in evacuating the troops could be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   But after their meeting, India's foreign minister, Jaswant
Singh, ruled out any such military assistance. ``The evacuation of
Sri Lankan troops is not India's responsibility,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Jaffna _ which some military analysts believe could
come within weeks _ would be a tremendous political blow to the
recently re-elected president, Chandrika Kumaratunga. Her party
faces parliamentary elections by August.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga, who was wounded in a December attack by a Tiger
suicide bomber, was first elected president in 1994 on a peace
platform, but began a major military campaign against the rebels in
1995 after talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Her greatest military triumph was the government's recapture in
Dec. 1995 of Jaffna, which had been the Tigers' capital for five
years and the stronghold for the rebels' unofficial mini-state on
the Jaffna Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the rebels advancing, a cabinet meeting led by the
president suspended all non-essential development work for three
months and said it would divert the money saved to the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have been battling since 1983 for a separate
homeland, called Tamil Eelam, for their ethnic group, which they
feel has been mistreated by the majority Sinhalese. More than
60,000 people have died in the conflict. And despite an expensive
government military buildup in recent years, the Tigers appear to
be stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, casualties on both sides have mounted, as
have hardships for civilians living in Sri Lanka's predominantly
Tamil north.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando said 500 government troops have died since the attack
on Elephant Pass. He estimated that 1,000 Tiger rebels have been
killed. And each side has about 1,500 wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the warfront in the north are heavily dependent on
information handed out by the government and the rebels.
Journalists in Sri Lanka said there has been no phone contact with
Jaffna since the rebels blew up a telecommunications tower there in
late March. The government is not allowing reporters into the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agency officials said the plight of the 350,000 people
living in the largely Tamil-controlled Wanni area just south of the
Jaffna peninsula has been deteriorating. There is no electricity to
run the hospitals and generators are running low on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the government has blocked the International
Committee of the Red Cross and Doctors without Borders from
transporting many medicines and supplies to hospitals and clinics
in the area, saying it feared the rebels would use the supplies,
officials of those agencies said.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Trujillo, the head of mission for Doctors without
Borders' French chapter, said the government has not allowed the
relief agency to deliver antibiotics, syringes, IV fluids, gastric
tubes and many other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning people away from the hospitals because we have
nothing to treat them with,'' he said. ``And the situation doesn't
look like it's going to improve. On the contrary, the procedures
are getting more complex. Several authorizations, stamps and
signatures are required before we can send in one antibiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 150-bed hospital in the village of Mallavi, operated by
Doctors without Borders, Holland, had no medicines to treat more
than 2,000 patients in the last two weeks of April. Among those
turned away were 223 who had malaria, 62 asthmatics, 32 psychiatric
patients and 37 with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Geneva convention, we treat those who arrive in
civilian clothes and without arms,'' said Isabel Simpson, head of
mission for Doctors without Borders, Holland. ``We do not have
Tiger cadres in uniform coming to the hospital.''

`I DREAMED OF AFRICA' IS A SNOOZER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may fall asleep at ``I Dreamed of Africa.'' Episodic in the
extreme and indifferently acted, this truth- based account of the
life of Italian environmentalist Kuki Gallmann is astonishingly
bereft of dramatic momentum. Interesting characters might have made
an excusable substitute, or something more than superficial
insights into man's relationship to nature, but it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Director Hugh Hudson fails to muster even the false sense of
passion that tricked so many people into believing that his
Oscar-winning ``Chariots of Fire'' had something to say.
Unfortunately, ``I Dreamed of Africa'' does _ Gallmann's source
autobiography tells of a connection to the harsh, beautiful land
that even profound tragedy cannot sever _ but you'd never know it
from this film, even though Basinger's droning voiceover narration
keeps trying to tell you so.
</P>
<P>
   Set vaguely in the 1970s, film opens with well-off, if husband-
abandoned, young mom Kuki surviving a terrible auto accident on the
road home to Venice. The car's driver, Paolo Gallmann (Swiss actor
Vincent Perez), lost his girlfriend in the tragedy, but soon he and
Kuki are bonding, then married, then off to follow his dream life
in Kenya with her young son Emanuele (Liam Aiken as a child,
Garrett Strommen as a teen-ager) in tow.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallmanns set up a cattle ranch near the Great Rift Valley,
and Kuki spends the rest of the movie adjusting. And adjusting. The
trials she faces over the years, though undoubtedly true, seem pat:
devastating storms, elephants in the vegetable patch, the
occasional lion attack, ivory poachers, loving-but-adventurous
hubby always away on safari, kid develops unhealthy interest in
snakes ...
</P>
<P>
   All the while, we're treated to magnificent photography of
unspoiled land and freeborn animals _ just like you can see every
night on Animal Planet, and probably do right before nodding off.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the film stirs up continuous negative
comparisons to ``Out of Africa,'' which was something of a
tranquilizer itself. But at least that overpraised Oscar-winner had
the words of a real writer, Isak Dinesen, spoken with a perfect
Danish accent by Meryl Streep. Gallmann's alternately obvious and
overpoeticized prose mark her as a diarist by comparison _ and we
can only be thankful that Basinger's flat readings from it weren't
burdened with an accent attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Although another thing you constantly wonder about as
``Dreamed'' loops along is what this American-sounding woman is
doing amidst this community of otherwise thoroughly European
expatriates. As to other ethnic matters, the usual contingent of
helpful African servants uniformly share the usual Hollywood lack
of discernible personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, it's never asked why Paolo gets so upset at the
occasional, subsistence elephant poacher while he spends half the
movie presumably shooting up all the game he can find. For that
matter, isn't it just the weeist bit ironic, if not downright
hypocritical, for cattle ranchers to fancy themselves champions of
wildlife preservation?
</P>
<P>
   At its most successful, ``I Dreamed of Africa'' does depict a
beautiful, senses-filling place that anyone would seriously
consider pulling up stakes and moving to given the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But then, who doesn't love Venice? &QL;

   1. WHO WILL BE THE SOCCER MOM'S SUCCESSOR? by Michael Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations are now open for the Symbolic Voter of the 2000
Election. The Soccer Mom, current occupant of this crucial post, is
stepping down to spend more time with her family. The truth, of
course, is that the media _ who decide such things _ have used her
up. She's still there grinning for the cameras as she juggles kids,
job, and household chores like an act on the old ``Ed Sullivan
Show'' _ but there are no cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer Mom's fate would be more poignant if she hadn't been so
brutal in muscling aside her predecessor, the Reagan Democrat.

   2. ROBERT MUGABE, THE SCHEMING SURVIVOR, by David Plotz.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has unleashed thousands of
purported ``war veterans'' against Zimbabwe's 4,500 white farmers.
He has allied himself with a rabble-rouser who calls himself
``Hitler.'' He has labeled the farmers ``enemies of the people''
and has turned a blind eye while the occupiers execute white
landowners, rape women, and ignore court orders to disband.
</P>
<P>
   This latest African nightmare, in short, looks like the
handiwork of a Mobutu Sese Seko or an Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76-year-old Mugabe is a character more familiar and more
disappointing than those carnivorous dictators. He does not wreak
havoc out of evil, caprice, or lunacy. He does it out of cynicism.
Mugabe, who liberated his nation from colonial oppression 20 years
ago, is the father of his country. He is what would have happened
if George Washington had turned out to be Richard Nixon.

   3. RACISM, SCHMACISM: OPPOSING INTERMARRIAGE, by Judith
Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   Is it racist for Jews to oppose intermarriage? In his current
New York Observer column, Philip Weiss says it is. Weiss (who is
married to a non-Jew) thinks that the cold shoulder some Jews give
Jews who marry non-Jews is just as bad as the ban against
interracial dating recently rescinded by Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore picked Orthodox Jew Sen. Joseph Lieberman (who would
presumably oppose intermarriage for his own children) to be his
running mate, says Weiss, then Gore would be vulnerable to the same
sort of attack that was made on George W. Bush after he spoke at
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' analogy is flawed in several ways.

FRANCHISING: THE AUTHOR AS BRAND NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will the new Robert Ludlum thriller you'll be reading this
summer really be a Robert Ludlum? Well, the book's jacket will have
this wordy irruption: ``Robert Ludlum's `The Hades Factor' by
Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds.'' Will this be pure Ludlum, or
something slightly vitiated? Actually, it will be what is called in
the packaging business ``line extension,'' which is the attempt to
come up with a variation on a known product to expand the
franchise. Is a Ludlum a Ludlum if a Lynds did the writing? No, not
really.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Ludlum is just the latest of the brand-name _ read,
best-selling _ thriller writers to lend their names and
credibility, and more, they say, to novels they do not actually
write themselves. In this new universe, Tom Clancy, who also
collaborates on nonfiction and on CD-ROM games based on the
characters he creates, is the McDonald's of author franchising.
Clive Cussler and Richard Marcinko were among those who followed,
and now Ludlum has joined their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, is any of this misleading? Perhaps not exactly, but
the implication is clear that the Clancys, the Cusslers and the
Ludlums actually did more than scratch in some sentences here and
there.
</P>
<P>
   It is all economics, naturally. Twenty-five years ago publishers
and writers of best-selling novels created a lucrative cycle. The
writer would produce one hardcover best seller a year, and at the
moment of its publication the author's previous hardcover best
seller would be reissued in paperback, the title thus becoming a
cash machine a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Why not double this, some asked? Well, even writers are human.
What flagging author could be expected to write more than one hefty
novel a year? Perhaps only Stephen King, who, it should be noted,
does not collaborate, or tire, apparently. It should also be marked
that Messrs. Clancy, Cussler and Ludlum intend to keep writing, on
their own, the series novels that launched their franchises in the
first place. (For instance, St. Martin's Press, which is publishing
the joint-byline Ludlum trade paperback in June, is also publishing
in hardcover this fall the latest international paranoia thriller
written alone by Ludlum, ``The Prometheus Deception.'')
</P>
<P>
   Since there is nothing literary about the franchise concept,
publishers, writers and their agents do not like to use that word.
Rather, they see Clancy, Cussler and Ludlum as ``producers,''
similar in a sense to movie producers, and there is some truth in
that description.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Robert Gottlieb, Clancy's agent, describes his client's
business this way: Clancy is like Mel Gibson, who has his own
production company and directs and produces things under the banner
of his own name. ``That's what these powerful individuals do.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the author's Op-Center series of novels for the
Putnam/Berkley Group ``are based on original concepts by Clancy''
in the same way he would have a concept for a TV series or a movie.
``He then brings in the people he approves to execute the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Op-Center novels carry the names of Clancy and Steve
Pieczenik on their covers as their ``creators,'' which means that
yet a different, unnamed writer actually wrote the books.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone comes up with a 30- or 40-page treatment for a
paperback original, and it's approved or not,'' Gottlieb said. ``If
it is, Tom continues to oversee it editorially. He's working off a
certain mind-set, and he knows if the book is an extension of his
brand, something that people want to read and enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty much the way they all work. Peter Lampack,
Cussler's agent, said that the author ``will lay out an entire
story line in detail, and the writer will give a draft chapter to
Clive, who will revise it and edit it and return it to the
collobrator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the steady hands on where he wants the second series to
go,'' Lampack said, ``and how he wants it to read to get there.''
Cussler has collaborated on several of his novels for his last
publisher, Pocket Books, with Paul Kemprecos.
</P>
<P>
   Lampack said: ``With Pocket Books, Clive had the right to shut
down any time he wanted if he thought the product was being
diluted. We don't have that right with the new publisher'' _ Putnam
_ ``because we don't need it. His working relationship with
Kemprecos is so good; they are in creative sync.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemprecos said, however, that so far he had not been asked to
move to Putnam with Cussler. Describing their working relationship,
he said: ``He came up with the characters, their physical
description and background, the plot idea. I fleshed out the
characters; I did most of the writing, and then we hashed it out
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the star's name is the most prominent one on the
cover, with the collaborator secondary. ``I'm a writer for hire,''
Kemprecos said, ``although I've written some books on my own. My
payment comes from the publisher but it has to be approved by
Clive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cussler's franchise is built around the character Dirk Pitt,
whom he is taking to Putnam with him. ``I've been doing Dirk Pitt
books for 30 years; maybe I can find another writer down the line
to take him over. It's not the money; it's the fans. I'd like to
retire. I'm toying with the idea of Pitt having a son who shows up.
He's getting a little long in the tooth. When we started out, we
were both 36 years old. Now he's a little over 40, and I'm pushing
70.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludlum's collaborator has written two successful thriller novels
on her own and in fact was compared by some reviewers to Ludlum.
Henry Morrison, Ludlum's agent, said that Ludlum had developed the
basic idea for the novel and that they worked on the plot together.
He does editing and gives her his comments and has approval.
</P>
<P>
   One could ask, does a best-selling author really get artistic
satisfaction working with another writer? Matthew Shear, who heads
several of St. Martin's paperback divisions, does not think much of
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that these writers of big international
thrillers are the type of writers who have too many ideas,'' Shear
said. ``They keep coming up with stories, more than they can
possibly write. They tend to have that kind of mind. That's what
makes them thriller writers, minds that are constantly churning
with story ideas. But it takes too much time; now they can satisfy
their readers.'' And, of course, make bundles of cash for everyone
concerned.

   1. WHO WILL BE THE SOCCER MOM'S SUCCESSOR? by Michael Kinsley.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations are now open for the Symbolic Voter of the 2000
Election. The Soccer Mom, current occupant of this crucial post, is
stepping down to spend more time with her family. The truth, of
course, is that the media _ who decide such things _ have used her
up. She's still there grinning for the cameras as she juggles kids,
job, and household chores like an act on the old ``Ed Sullivan
Show'' _ but there are no cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer Mom's fate would be more poignant if she hadn't been so
brutal in muscling aside her predecessor, the Reagan Democrat.

   2. ROBERT MUGABE, THE SCHEMING SURVIVOR, by David Plotz.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has unleashed thousands of
purported ``war veterans'' against Zimbabwe's 4,500 white farmers.
He has allied himself with a rabble-rouser who calls himself
``Hitler.'' He has labeled the farmers ``enemies of the people''
and has turned a blind eye while the occupiers execute white
landowners, rape women, and ignore court orders to disband.
</P>
<P>
   This latest African nightmare, in short, looks like the
handiwork of a Mobutu Sese Seko or an Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
   But the 76-year-old Mugabe is a character more familiar and more
disappointing than those carnivorous dictators. He does not wreak
havoc out of evil, caprice, or lunacy. He does it out of cynicism.
Mugabe, who liberated his nation from colonial oppression 20 years
ago, is the father of his country. He is what would have happened
if George Washington had turned out to be Richard Nixon.

   3. RACISM, SCHMACISM: OPPOSING INTERMARRIAGE, by Judith
Shulevitz.
</P>
<P>
   Is it racist for Jews to oppose intermarriage? In his current
New York Observer column, Philip Weiss says it is. Weiss (who is
married to a non-Jew) thinks that the cold shoulder some Jews give
Jews who marry non-Jews is just as bad as the ban against
interracial dating recently rescinded by Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   If Al Gore picked Orthodox Jew Sen. Joseph Lieberman (who would
presumably oppose intermarriage for his own children) to be his
running mate, says Weiss, then Gore would be vulnerable to the same
sort of attack that was made on George W. Bush after he spoke at
Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' analogy is flawed in several ways.

<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea _ For U.S. and South Korean soldiers stationed
in the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas, days begin
with a blast of martial music and Communist propaganda blaring from
gigantic loudspeakers that North Korea has erected just across the
heavily fortified border.
</P>
<P>
   The monotonous diatribe, which urges ``one and all to join the
workers' paradise,'' is often broken by jarring explosions that
send the soldiers scrambling to determine whether North Korean
troops or wild animals are invading nearby minefields. More often
than not, the intruders are mule deer. But sometimes they are North
Korean infiltrators who incite deadly gun battles.
</P>
<P>
   This is the front line of the tense demilitarized zone, a
fiercely armed no man's land of barbed wire and big guns, where
well over a million opposing troops are locked in a highly
combustible standoff in a place that President Clinton once called
the ``scariest'' on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders of the two Koreas prepare for their first summit
meeting since their countries went to war 50 years ago, the
soldiers whose sole mission is to defend against a North Korean
attack say the danger of another all-out conflict remains high.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such a heavy concentration of manpower and weapons
located in this relatively small area, there is great potential for
fighting to break out at any time,'' said Lt. Kwon Byung Su of an
elite South Korean front-line unit on border patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A half-million South Korean soldiers guard the border, backed up
by 36,000 U.S. service members and some of the most advanced
military hardware available. Their assignment is widely considered
one of the most difficult military postings, because the hard-line
North Korean government, which has amassed a million troops along
the border, seems determined to reunify the peninsula by force.
</P>
<P>
   The demilitarized zone, a 150-mile-long three-mile-wide stretch
of rolling hills, craggy mountains and farmland, was formed by the
1953 armistice. The village of Panmunjom, which straddles the
demarcation line that runs down the middle of the zone, was
destroyed by tank fire in the war. But it now serves as the site of
truce talks. The northern and southern borders of the zone are
lined with high fences crowned with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Although most clashes in the zone resemble a game of a cat and
mouse and are nothing more than saber rattling, they sometimes turn
deadly. More than 1,000 South Koreans, 50 Americans and numerous
North Koreans have died in skirmishes along the border since the
armistice officially ended the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notorious incident involved the ax killings of
two U. S. soldiers by a gang of North Koreans in 1976 in a dispute
over tree pruning. In a gun battle in 1992, three North Korean
soldiers were killed and two South Korean soldiers were wounded
after the North Koreans had crossed into the southern part of the
demilitarized zone. Last year, a naval skirmish resulted in the
sinking of a North Korean boat and the deaths of at least 20 North
Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the threat posed by North Korea, the United States
recently distributed 14,000 gas masks to dependents of U.S.
soldiers and embassy workers in South Korea. That is because
military intelligence officers have determined that North Korea has
thousands of tons of chemical and biological weapons that the
officers predict could be used in storming the border and taking
Seoul, the South Korean capital, 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Some soldiers said they hoped that the anniversary of the start
of the Korean War, which began on June 25, 1950, would remind the
world that the conflict had not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people don't know very much about the Korean War,
and they take freedom for granted, or they just don't realize the
costs,'' said Phillip McNeal, 21, an Army specialist from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years on the line, Chung Eup, 24, a South Korean
lieutenant, has never encountered a North Korean soldier. But he
said that possibility was always in the back of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's stressful, but we think it's every Korean man's duty
to serve his country here,'' Chung said as he inspected fences for
signs of infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said one of every 100 South Korean soldiers
have had at least one encounter with a North Korean counterpart in
his mandatory service of two years and two months. Many encounters
occur on special patrols beyond the southern boundary. Soldiers
told of tense, almost surreal, encounters with North Korean troops
in grassy fields of the demilitarized zone late at night.
</P>
<P>
   In those situations, the soldiers said the opposing troops often
confronted each other face to face, arms drawn, in a stare down.
Usually the soldiers back away from one another and continue on
their ways. In one case fraught with symbolism, the soldiers
exchanged cigarettes before moving on. Not all such encounters end
so amicably, and there have been numerous casualties in late-night
gunfights that were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Although North Korea has publicly sought to improve its
diplomatic relations in recent months, senior U.S. and South Korean
military officials said Pyongyang had also been busy beefing up its
military, acquiring advanced weaponry and conducting rigorous
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Korea remains the major threat to stability and security
in northeast Asia and is the country most likely to involve the
United States in a large-scale war,'' Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz,
commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea, testified to the
Senate in March.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing that, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry
said that although his agency supported the summit meeting,
scheduled for June 12 to June 14 in Pyongyang, it still considered
North Korea ``a very dangerous and aggressive enemy.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, as North Korea suffered a devastating
recession and severe shortages of food and fuel, its ability to
attack the South with conventional armed forces was widely thought
to have declined. But South Korean and U.S. military officials now
say that despite economic woes and widespread famine, North Korea
has replaced much of its obsolete weaponry, and its troops are well
prepared to go to battle.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Schwartz said that over the last year, North
Korea had done more to arrest a decline in readiness among its
troops and to improve its military capability than in the last five
years combined. The general said North Korea had greatly improved
its ground forces, including the deployment of large numbers of
long-range multiple-rocket launchers and self-propelled guns near
the demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said North Korea had installed anti-tank barriers;
taken new combat positions along major routes between Pyongyang,
its capital, and the border; strengthened its coastal defenses;
procured fighter aircraft; and taken steps to increase its missile
range.
</P>
<P>
   There is some growing concern in the South Korean military that
new draftees have a weakened sense of North Korea as an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have noticed that some younger troops don't have the same
contempt for North Korean troops as past generations,'' said Kwon,
a public affairs officer. ``They know that we are enemies. But they
also realize that we are same people. It's not like we are Iran and
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Myong Won, 22, a recruit who had just finished basic
training and was about to begin his first tour on the front line,
said: ``We will fight to defend ourselves. But we really don't
consider them enemies. Especially with the summit talks, there is
the possibility of reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwon said that with a little ideological training and field
experience, he expected Kim would eventually see things
differently. ``Nothing has changed,'' Kwon said. ``We teach our
soldiers to shoot to kill.''

emergency steps Wednesday night to save money to support the war
effort at the northern tip of this island nation, where government
forces are battling Tamil rebels _ and the rebels are winning. The
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a guerrilla group that is
notorious for its suicide bombers, on Wednesday lobbed mortar fire
into a strategic military base on Sri Lanka's northern peninsula in
the latest phase of a powerful offensive. They are trying to
reclaim Jaffna, the city at the heart of the Tamil ethnic

rimmed with black powder. He does a little shoulder shimmy and
teasingly flicks one hip audience-ward. It is belly dancing night
in the Amor y Libertad nightclub in north Beirut. And Mousbah

used to be,'' a new study has found. Seven years ago, a majority of
Americans believed that too many people were going to college

computer repair; now, 3 out of 4 think the country could never have
too many college graduates. The study shows that 77 percent of
American believe college is more important now than it was a decade

KHANNOUCHI SAYS INJURY WILL BAR HIM FROM TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fighting back tears, new citizen Khalid Khannouchi announced at
an emotional news conference Wednesday that injuries have crushed
his plans to compete in the US Olympic Marathon Trials on Sunday,
meaning he will not be able to run the marathon for the United
States at the Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad,'' said a heartbroken Khannouchi, 28, in a
teleconference call. ``I feel ashamed of myself, but this is
reality. It doesn't look right. People worked very hard to make my
dream come true and my body doesn't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm a citizen I'm so happy with it, but I know it is
going to be tremendous pressure on me,'' he said. ``It's my turn to
keep my promises.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Moroccan-born Khannouchi, who has lived in the
United States since 1993, achieved his longtime dream of becoming
an American citizen in time for the trials. But Wednesday morning,
after a final consultation with his physiotherapist, Khannouchi
finally acknowledged that the rest of his dream, to win a gold
medal for the United States, would have to be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better not to risk anything and think about the future,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi said he will turn his focus to trying for a berth on
the US Olympic 10,000-meter team at the US track trials in July,
despite not having run a track race since 1995, and believes he can
run under 27 minutes. The American record, set by Mark Nenow in
1986, is 27:20:56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say if he's healthy, he's on the 10K team,'' said Mark
Coogan, the 1996 Olympic marathoner who will be seeking to repeat
on Sunday. His closest competition would likely be Bob Kennedy, who
is expected to move up from the 5000 and last year ran 27:38.37 for
the fifth-best US time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Khannouchi would be only an outside medal threat in
Sydney, with Haile Gebrselassie (26:22.75) a heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad for Khalid, because I know how much he wanted to run
in the marathon trials,'' said Coogan. ``It's too bad all the
citizen stuff took so long to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi acknowledged that, had he known he would become a
citizen in time for the trials, he would not have run London, where
he earned $22,500 for his third-place finish on top of an
undisclosed appearance fee likely in the neighborhood of $250,000.
``I feel sorry,'' he said. ``I didn't want to take a chance'' on
saying no to London and then not becoming a citizen by the May 4
deadline, either.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, Khannouchi stumbled on a training run and severely
sprained his left ankle. After 10 days of rest it healed well
enough for the world-record holder (2 hours, 5 minutes and 42
seconds) to finish a respectable third in the London Marathon on
April 18 in 2:08:38, but by then he had also developed what
physiotherapist Gerard Hartmann termed ``a slight niggle'' in his
right hamstring from compensating for the bad ankle. The
combination put more than his Olympic bid in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was adamant'' about running, said Hartmann from Limerick,
Ireland, where he lives. ``I advised Khalid not to. We're
protecting Khalid from doing more damage so he can continue his
career.'' Recovery, he said, should take four-to-six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khannouchi held out some hope for what he called a
miracle (``Maybe something can happen, I don't know''), there seems
little. Under USA Track &AMP; Field rules for the marathon, an athlete
must complete the trials to be eligible for the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not envision any scenario'' under which an exception
would be made, said Danny Grimes, chairman of USA Track &AMP; Field's
long-distance running committee.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the top three finishers in the trials make the
team, but that assumes each has run the Olympic ``A'' standard ,
which last year was tightened to 2:14, since Jan. 1, 1999. Without
Khannouchi in the race, only two Americans _ David Morris of
Missoula, Mont. (2:09:32) and Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn. (2:13:55)
_ have met the standard coming into the race.
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures in the 80s expected, the winner of Sunday's
race in Pittsburgh could well finish in over 2:14. Unless that
winner is either Morris or LeMay, the United States would then be
able to send only one marathoner to Sydney, as happened to the
women when Christine Clark won the Trials in Columbia, S.C., on an
unseasonably warm day in February in 2:33:31, short of the 2:34
``A'' standard. Each country is allowed to send one athlete under
the more-lenient ``B'' standard, but if a ``B'' goes the country
cannot send any ``A'' athletes.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, Morris or LeMay won but the third-place finisher
failed to break 2:14, they would both go and one spot would
theoretically be left open. But because the US rules specify that
athletes can be chosen for the team only in order of finish at the
trials, Khannouchi would be shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance is one in a million, maybe less,'' said Grimes, of
changing the rule. ``It would be completely unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it appears Khannouchi's first chance to compete in a
marathon for the United States will be the 2001 World Championships
in Edmonton. ``That's going to be the goal,'' he said. ``This time
I hope my body won't betray me.''

WHEN IN ROME, ENJOY THE HIGH-TECH SCENERY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL; 
``Gladiator'' is not your grandfather's, well, gladiator movie.
</P>
<P>
   The first film that Hollywood's produced in more that
three-and-a-half decades to focus on ancient Rome's brutal
``circus'' games, the new epic _ which stars ``Insider'' Oscar
nominee Russell Crowe as general-turned-slave Maximus and was
directed by English pictorialist Ridley Scott (``Alien,'' ``Blade
Runner'') _ boasts numerous up-to-the-minute movie qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like, while risky, an irresistible challenge to
try to bring this genre to a new generation of moviegoers ... and,
hopefully, to try to reinvent it as something that is not just
about spectacle or is not silly in any way,'' says DreamWorks
executive Walter Parkes, whose company co-produced the $103 million
picture with Universal Studios. ``We really wanted it to be a
dramatically and emotionally legitimate piece of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly re-written while it was being filmed, ``Gladiator's''
relative modernism is evident from the start. It commences with a
massive, ``Braveheart''-style pitched battle and employs extensive
use of computer generated imagery to fill out its sumptuous visual
plan.
</P>
<P>
   And certain attitudes have been modernized from the genre's
1950s and early '60s heyday. Unlike ``Quo Vadis,'' ``Barabbas,''
``Demetrius and the Gladiators'' and even the B.C.-set high point
of the cycle, Stanley Kubrick's ``Spartacus,'' Christianity is not
presented as ``Gladiator's'' alternative to pagan depravity;
liberal democracy is.
</P>
<P>
   Also, interestingly, the new film's demented, evil emperor
Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is demonized by the desire to sleep with
his sister, not the implied homosexuality that characterized the
'50s and '60s tyrants. And the object of her brother's incestuous
attention, Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, is a capable woman who would
no doubt make a better ruler than he does _ which is a far cry from
the lust-crazed vamps who used to represent Rome's female
aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   That stuff aside, though, ``Gladiator'' delivers the classic
goods: extravagant sets, delectable decadence and mucho man-to-man
struggling to the death. Filmed in England, Morocco and on the
island of Malta in the Mediterranean, shooting involved actually
burning down a stretch of British forest (it was scheduled for
demolition anyway) and restaging the most elaborate of arena
contests, some involving charging chariots and live tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's logistical centerpiece, of course, was rebuilding
parts of ancient Rome and its massive Colosseum as it looked during
the Empire's height, circa 180 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like making worlds as a director,'' Scott explains. ``I
don't mind making contemporary movies, but I love getting into that
whole process of getting a world right. It required all kinds of
preconceptions and visualizations, from costumes to weapons to
fighting choreography, but especially for the Forum and Rome
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a model of the place I decided to do that in, which was
an existing piece of architecture on Malta,'' Scott continues. ``It
had been a military base for the English army against Napoleon in
1803, and it had been constructed in a Romanesque fashion. It was
fantastic and it was derelict _ so we loved it! It was like $10
million of free building work immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with such a start, it would have been economically
prohibitive to physically re-create even scale facades of the
entire Colosseum. It cost $1 million for production designer Arthur
Max's team just to build a third of the circular stadium's first
tier. The other two-thirds of the structure's circumference, as
well as the entirety of its upper two tiers, were meticulously
added in post-production via computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting images look terrific. But are they the most
accurate reproductions of Second Century Rome ever filmed? While he
trumpets the exhaustive research that went into the production,
Scott shrugs off the very notion that such fidelity is even
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Or desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a scholar involved but, you know, there's a limit to
what you want to hear,'' the director says dismissively. ``When you
hear that no women had colorful clothes, they all wore white, you
go, 'Ohh-Kaaay. How do you know?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did all our due diligence,'' adds production designer Max.
``We did our research, we went to all the museums in Italy and
England, we went to Pompeii. We looked at everything there was in
all the books and all the archives ... And then we decided that it
wasn't rich enough or exciting enough for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took a bit of license. We got more inspiration from the
painters of the 18th and 19th century neoclassical traditions; we
liked the way they imagined Rome to be. Once we got rolling, we
kind of left the scholastic and historical behind because we didn't
find it juicy enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but the historical record was certainly too bloody
for the filmmakers' tastes. ``Gladiator'' is undoubtedly the most
explicitly violent movie Hollywood has ever produced in the genre,
if only by dint of being the first one made since the late '60s
relaxation of the censorship code.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, commercial considerations have had their
own effect on how much off-putting, graphic gore producers are
willing to approve, especially in big budget movies that need as
wide an audience pool as possible to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a violent movie,'' Parkes acknowledges. ``But honestly,
what we show pales in comparison to what actually happened in the
arena. In fact, very early on, I had intense conversations with
Ridley about this. I said that, if we preclude the possibility of a
father bringing his 10-year-old son to this movie, that would be a
mistake. There is a classic aspect to this genre, there is a way
that all of us grew up loving 'Spartacus' and these things, and
although we want to make it real and present Rome in a way that
audiences have never seen, it can never be gratuitous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the shooting, you've got to plan,'' Scott explains. ``In a
fight, you've got have the person who's going to deliver the blow
and the person who's going to receive the blow, and you've got to
follow it through. But the decision comes in the editing room. You
look at it and go, now, do I need to see the arm coming off? Do I
need to see blood shoot? I'd rather leave it to the imagination, so
I clip it right on the edge. It's where you cut it that makes it
visceral, so you think you've seen a lot but you can't quite put a
finger on what you've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't mention the word finger to the easily riled Crowe. As far
as he was concerned, ``Gladiator'' came much too close for comfort
to capturing the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hard experience, the most physically demanding
thing I'd ever done,'' says Crowe who, besides having to train like
a lunatic in ancient fighting techniques, was required to lose some
40 pounds he'd put on for his ``Insider'' performance in roughly a
month between productions. ``When I made that [hockey] film
'Mystery, Alaska,' I didn't think I could find a movie where I
could punish myself any more than that. But I was wrong, I managed
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was difficult, man, it was full on. I cracked a bone in
my foot, I fractured my hip, both bicep tendons popped out ... I
still don't have any feeling in the top of a finger 'cause it got
slashed in the very first battle sequence by a sword that was
covered in dirt. Different films just have different requirements,
you know?''
</P>
<P>
   And different emergencies, though few films suffer as tragic a
bit of bad luck as ``Gladiator'' did. Oliver Reed, the
larger-than-life English actor with the legendary appetite for
living died suddenly just before completing his role as Proximo,
Maximus' greedy but secretly noble gladiatorial master.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really sad, because I've known Ollie for 25 years,''
recalls Scott, who managed to complete Reed's performance with a
little computer magic. ``He liked his drinking, but he saved it for
the weekends _ and he popped off in a pub on a Sunday morning. But,
you know, he had a great time and a great life and great work, so
you can't feel too sad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   No sentimentalist Scott. The man's cool response to just about
any challenge not only served him well on the massive ``Gladiator''
shoot, it helped him weather the stormy development of his
currently lensing project: ``Hannibal,'' the long-awaited sequel to
the widely loved, multi-Oscar winning thriller ``The Silence of the
Lambs.'' As Scott tells it, he never expected Jodie Foster to
return as heroic FBI agent Clarice Starling, even though the
actress hedged for months before finally saying no to the part, in
which Clarice may perform some rather alarming acts. (Anthony
Hopkins opted to reprise his indelible performance as charismatic
flesh-eater Hannibal Lecter).
</P>
<P>
   Scott was also amused by the swirl of press speculation over who
would play Starling _ which focused on such dainty unlikelies as
Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett _ while he had his sights set on
fearlessly adventurous Julianne Moore (``Boogie Nights,'' ``The
Lost World'') all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be reading the news and the press would have another
report, and I'd go, 'That's interesting, I didn't know that,'''
Scott says of the ``Hannibal'' buzz. ``It was good, thank you, it
drives the bus. But at the end of the day, I think Julianne was a
good choice; she's one of the best of her generation. And Tony was
always in, providing the script was good. He thought [Thomas
Harris'] book was great fun, as did I; I mean, I managed to read it
in three days toward the end of shooting this film, which must mean
it's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   How that tricky tale turns out on screen remains to be seen. But
early reviews of ``Gladiator'' have been cautiously glowing,
indicating that the genre may be back after a long absence from the
commercial arena.
</P>
<P>
   At least for those involved, it was a demanding spectacle worth
suffering for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience helped me grow,'' Crowe admits. ``It was
an extreme amount of pressure, very long hours, the difficulty of
not having a fully realized narrative before we began ... But, you
see, I took a leap of faith on this film. It's turned out OK, and
what I've learned is that, as long as you're involving yourself
with the right people, a leap of faith is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like one of grandpa's gladiator movies after all. &QL;

BAIN CAPITAL INVESTING $50M IN CAROLINA INTERNET UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bain Capital Inc. is investing $50 million in the
Internet unit of Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co. and gaining a
controlling position in the utility's two-year-old subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Bain Capital will take a 65 percent stake in Interpath
Communications Inc. and will control the company's board. Raleigh,
N.C.-based Carolina Power will invest $50 million and keep a 35
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Interpath is an ``application service provider,'' or ASP, which
essentially rents software and data services to big companies via
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Power said the deal was ``designed to unlock the value
of Interpath,'' which has not been reflected in its stock price.
The utility's shares fell $2.0625 to $33.8125 Wednesday. Investors
had been expecting Interpath to go public or to be sold outright.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Carolina Power separated Interpath's Web
services and its fiber-optic network. The utility keeps the
fiberoptics and plans to merge them with a 3,000-mile
telecommunications network of a company it is acquiring, Florida
Progress Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Carolina Power will retain 50 employees of Interpath and a
10 percent interest in BellSouth's cell phone business.
</P>
<P>
   William Cavanaugh, the utility's chief executive, said in a
prepared statement that ``Both of the agreements announced today
are important steps towards unlocking, maximizing and returning to
shareholders the value of our Interpath subsidiary.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bain Capital, which manages $7 billion and invests mainly in
private companies for its clients, the goal is to increase
Interpath's sales outside its core Southeastern market and to
become a top ASP player.
</P>
<P>
   The field is wide open, said Bill Martorelli, an analyst with
Hurwitz Group in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolving thing,'' Martorelli said. ``They've had some
turmoil. Now they've got a huge cash infusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil included the departure of Interpath's CEO, Chris
Darby, in February. Now chief executive of (at)Stake Inc., an
Internet security company, he declined to be interviewed about
Interpath.
</P>
<P>
   Darby is said to have overseen revenue growth at Interpath to
$78 million, from $3 million, in two years and an increase in
employment to 650. There are now 450 workers, the company said
Wednesday, plus the 50 staying with Carolina Power.
</P>
<P>
   Interpath's interim CEO, Michael Fox, said the company's clients
include Ericsson Telephone and First Union Mortgage.

<P>
   A grand and glorious adventure saga, ``Gladiator'' marks the
triumphant return of the Roman Empire epic, a genre that
``Cleopatra'' killed more than 30 years ago. Now, with
``Gladiator,'' look for the Empire to strike back in a big way.
Director Ridley Scott has delivered a rousing spectacle, full of
jaw-dropping battle scenes and exciting arena action.
</P>
<P>
   An outstanding cast, led by Russell Crowe in a star-making
performance, ground the pageantry with a rich and raw humanity.
Quite simply,``Gladiator'' is the best movie of the year,
kick-starting the summer movie season with a feast for the eyes and
ears.
</P>
<P>
   The film's greatness lies in its execution, not its originality.
The movie borrows from its predecessors, most notably ``Ben-Hur,''
``Spartacus'' and ``The Fall of the Roman Empire.'' (At least
screenwriters David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson had
the good sense to steal from the best.) Source material in hand,
Scott boldly takes the genre's formulas in the 21st century, using
state-of-the-art digital effects to reinvent Rome in all of its
extravagant glory. Much like ``Saving Private Ryan'' resuscitated
the war genre, ``Gladiator'' sweeps the sword-and-sandals epic into
fresh, ferocious territory.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Mann's 1964 epic ``The Fall of the Roman Empire''
provides ``Gladiator'' with its historical point of departure. In
A.D. 180, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his Roman
army are in the forests of Germania, fighting one last battle to
secure the empire's vast boundaries. Led by the celebrated general
Maximus (Crowe), the Romans defeat the barbarians in a savage
engagement, and the weary soldiers begin to dream of returning
home.
</P>
<P>
   The ailing emperor has other plans for Maximus, however. Marcus
loves Maximus more than his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), a
schemer whom he regards unworthy of being emperor. (When Commodus
arrives at the battlefield, just after the Romans have emerged
victorious, he asks his father: ``Have I missed the battle?''
Marcus: ``You missed the war.'') Marcus charges Maximus as
Protector of Rome until the Republic can be again established.
Commodus aims to make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' certainly isn't meant as a history lesson (you
might learn more walking through the Caesars Palace casino), but
there is a depth to the movie that's typically missing from
big-budget fare. When the film shifts into revenge mode,
cinematographer John Mathieson's lyrical, haunting landscapes bring
to mind the work of the great Sergio Leone. And when Maximus' lot
in life goes from general to gladiator, the movie gives us a Rome
that features teeming streets and a partially reconstructed
Colosseum that's packed with computer- generated extras.
</P>
<P>
   This is big, daring, smart filmmaking, full of intrigue and
action, and it's made all the more thrilling by the excellent cast.
Crowe has been great before (``L.A. Confidential,'' ``The
Insider,'' among others), but ``Gladiator'' provides him with a
showcase unlike any film on his resume. He infuses Maximus with an
inescapable intelligence behind the baleful stare, and his work in
the movie's many action scenes is astonishing. Forget about the
other combatants; one senses the tigers are at a disadvantage with
this guy in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' is full of fine acting: Phoenix chews up scenery
with glee as the neurotic would-be emperor, and Connie Nielsen
plays his conflicted sister (and, gulp, love interest) with a
splendid noble bearing. Harris commands every scene he appears in,
and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack three weeks before
production ended, has a grand time playing Proximo, the gladiator
impresario who helps Maximus literally return from the dead. Reed
couldn't have picked a better swan song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' isn't perfect. Its third act takes a little too
long to get going, and the movie probably could have lost 10
minutes and been the better for it. Still, one doesn't quibble
seriously with entertainment this striking. The summer games have
begun in a most impressive fashion. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

 &HT;    Surfing the skies Live TV, Internet access on the horizon for
fliers
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Air travelers of the not-too-distant future could
spend their idle time aloft the same way many spend it at home:
surfing TV channels or Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Two small carriers that began flying this winter, JetBlue and
Legend Airlines, are pioneering real-time broadcast television on
small video screens at every seat.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue and Legend passengers can use armrest controls to peruse
two dozen cable channels, ranging from CNNfn and ESPN to the
Discovery Channel and A&AMP;E. The system is made by Live TV, a
2-year-old venture of Harris Corp., and Sextant In-flight Systems.
It uses DirecTV programming beamed to a special antenna on the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Legend, an all-first-class carrier based in Dallas, provides the
TV for free. JetBlue, a discounter flying out of New York's Kennedy
Airport, will charge $5 following an introductory free period for
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   How soon the concept might spread to the mass market is unclear,
although industry consultant Rich Salter, of Irvine, Calif.,
believes it's a matter of when rather than if.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has reached the point of breaking through, and it will
proliferate over the next several years,'' Salter said.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines offer taped programs and movies but have been
leery of the cost and maintenance issues of adding broadcast TV,
especially at every seat. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines had a pilot
project in 1996 involving DirecTV broadcasts of sports events that
were shown on overhead consoles in one plane. Delta then dropped
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, one of the 10 major U.S. carriers, plans to
field test a more advanced system like JetBlue's later this year.
And carriers are gradually having seatback video screens installed
in larger planes for movies and taped shows anyway, making the
addition of live TV a simpler and cheaper proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If live TV ever takes hold at a major carrier, the others are
going to have to take a very hard look at it,'' predicted Rob
Brookler of the World Airline Entertainment Association, a trade
group for carriers and manufacturers of in-flight entertainment
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, systems for in-flight Internet access may appear on a
mass scale sooner than broadcast TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at satellite TV, but right now we're more
interested in bringing the Internet into the cabin because it's
what our business customers tell us they want,'' said United
Airlines spokesman Matt Triaca.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a traveler with a laptop and an urgent need to log on
can do so via an airphone jack, but the connection can be poor and
a 5-minute session costs close to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Several manufacturers are working on systems to provide cheaper,
better-quality access.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless Services, for instance, will launch a system
dubbed ``ePlane'' later this year. Using ground-to-air or satellite
transmissions to a receiving device on the plane, it would upload
Internet content to an on-board server capable of storing more than
1 million web pages. Passengers with laptops could access the
content, which would be periodically refreshed during flight, and
send or retrieve web-based e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Giant jet-maker Boeing Co. last month announced Connexion, a
joint venture with several partners to develop a new Internet
access system for airliners. The company believes Connexion could
be installed on one-third of the world's jetliners over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it's expected that passengers will have live,
real-time Internet access while in the air, and that video,
satellite TV and Internet systems will all be integrated.
</P>
<P>
   Delta recently announced plans for wireless Internet connections
in its airport gate areas and Crown Room lounges. A spokesman said
the airline also is exploring in-flight Internet access but added
it's too early to predict how soon it will be able to offer the
service.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said Delta also is staying abreast of further
developments in in-flight broadcast TV, but that Internet access is
a higher priority at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some airlines are eager about live TV and others are on the
fence or unconvinced that the benefit of another perk outweighs the
cost,'' said Brookler. That cost stems from installation expenses _
estimated at $1 million or more per plane _ as well as from
maintenance requirements and even added weight, which cuts fuel
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But those obstacles have been eroded in recent years with the
development of smaller, lighter and more reliable electronics. And
as more manufacturers enter the field big airlines will be able to
cut volume discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Brookler said live TV is easier to operate for airlines than
taped content and gives passengers more control over their
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to store, change and maintain a library of
content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the days of reading a pulp novel, chatting with a
seatmate or staring out the window to contemplate the cosmos will
be gone forever as passengers zone out on TV and the Web?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a segment of the public that wants to get
away from all these things, especially when they are traveling,''
said Brookler. ``The option of reading a book or looking out the
window will always be there.''

FAMILIES FACE ACCUSED PAN AM BOMBERS FOR FIRST TIME

<P>
   ZEIST, Netherlands _ Exactly 4,211 days after her daughter,
Sarah, was blown out of the sky along with 258 other people flying
on Pan Am Flight 103, Elizabeth Philipps finally came face to face
with the two men who allegedly planted the bomb that did it.
</P>
<P>
   From her seat in the spectators gallery Wednesday, Philipps, a
former publishing executive who used to live in Massachusetts,
stared through the bulletproof glass that separated her from the
alleged terrorists on the opening day of their trial here.
</P>
<P>
   Just 25 feet away, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin
Khalifa Fhimah waved to their families, who sat across the aisle
from Philipps. The two men took no notice of her.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Susannah Buchanan Philipps was a 20-year-old student at
Syracuse University and one of 23 New Englanders on board Pan Am
Flight 103 when it exploded 31,000 feet above Lockerbie, Scotland,
on Dec. 21, 1988. In addition to the 259 passengers and crew who
perished, 11 Lockerbie residents were killed when debris from the
airliner crashed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Philipps intends to make eye contact with the
suspects, and says she won't give up until she does. They took her
middle child, she said, her sweet, smart, beautiful Sarah, and in
doing so they took a piece of her she can never replace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a certain voodoo thing working, so I'm going to keep
staring at them,'' Philipps said, smiling sadly on a day when
prosecutors called the first of more than 1,000 expected witnesses
in a trial that will last at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other few dozen relatives of victims who attended
Wednesday, Elizabeth Philipps said it is imperative that she bears
witness. She plans to spend the next three weeks here. She is
telephoning back reports to her husband Ervin and elder son Andrew
in Chapel Hill, N.C., where the family moved in 1992, and to her
younger son, Fritz, a doctor at Boston University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your child is murdered, you go to the murder trial,'' she
said. ``There aren't any graduations, no birthdays, no weddings, no
grandchildren. All I have is this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Philipps got choked up but quickly regained her
composure.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, lawyers for the two suspects entered not guilty
pleas on their behalf and formally notified the three Scottish
judges hearing the case that the defense will blame the bombing on
Palestinian terrorists. The defense also formally indicated it
would implicate at least two men who are scheduled to testify for
the prosecution, Mohamed Abo Talb, a convicted terrorist who bombed
a synagogue in Copenhagen, and Parviz Taheri, who appears to be an
Iranian national but about whom no other information was available.
</P>
<P>
   The first witnesses to take the stand were British air-traffic
controllers who charted the path of Pan Am Flight 103 after it
departed London's Heathrow airport on its way to John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York. In a poignant moment, one of them recalled how
he and the pilot of the doomed aircraft wished each other a good
night, the last contact with the airliner before it disappeared
from the radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   More chilling was a video recording of a radar screen, showing
the jet's green image break up into three pieces, and the testimony
of a British Airways pilot who from his jet miles away saw the
fiery fuselage of Pan Am Flight 103 plummet to earth like ``a gas
flare burning off.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most dramatic moment was when the suspects, who
prosecutors allege were Libyan intelligence agents bent on
vengeance against the United States, walked into the courtroom. It
was the first time that any relatives of the victims had seen them
in person.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing shasiyas, traditional Libyan hats that look like pillbox
berets, and shiny abayas, traditional Libyan robes, the two
suspects smiled broadly at their families but betrayed no emotion
when a clerk read the indictment against them.
</P>
<P>
   The reading, which took almost 20 minutes, was a chronology of
the alleged movements of the two suspects as they planted the bomb
in Malta, where they worked for Libyan Arab Airlines. The dry
recitation failed to capture the visceral pain felt by the
relatives of some of the 189 Americans, 44 Britons, and people from
20 other countries who were on board Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the clerk paused briefly and added, ``and did murder
them,'' was there a hint of the human carnage that is at the heart
of the case. Elizabeth Philipps nodded almost imperceptibly.
Sitting next to her, Ann McLaughlin of Jamestown, R.I., whose son
Bernard Joseph was killed, glanced briefly at the suspects. The two
men, who were listening to an Arabic translation of the charges,
were impassive.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the relatives complained that the suspects had been
dressed up to appear meek, almost like Muslim clerics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well staged, them in their religious garb,'' said Maddy
Shapiro of Stamford, Conn., whose 21-year-old daughter Amy was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been dressed up to look like priests,'' said Philipps,
adding in a sarcastic voice, ``They look so pious in their
beautiful robes. How could people who look like that buy the
electronic timers needed to blow up an airplane?''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Philipps said, the sometimes tedious testimony
will be a welcome diversion from the emotions flooding her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this trial to be drenched in procedure, and that can
be a good break at times,'' she said during a recess called when
the system broadcasting translations of the proceedings broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Philipps said she felt no strong emotion, certainly not the rage
she feared, as she stared at the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emotion comes in waves,'' she said. ``I'm almost as angry
at the airline employees who put the unaccompanied luggage carrying
the bomb on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the suspects, she said, ``It's their job to put
bombs on planes. But it's the job of people who work for the
airlines and airport security to make sure that doesn't happen. I
worry about whether we'll ever get the truth about why those people
didn't do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives complained about the choice of United Nations
observers attending the trial. Philipps and other relatives,
including Kathleen and Jack Flynn of Montville, N.J., whose
20-year-old son John Patrick was killed, said too many of the
observers are Arab and African.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way those people are impartial,'' said Jack Flynn,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, Megrahi's 16-year-old daughter Ghada stood
with her 15-year-old brother, Khalid, and said the two Libyan
families are as anxious as the victims' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a kerchief on her head in keeping with Muslim tradition,
she said, ``It hurts, but I know my father is innocent,'' before a
burly Libyan man, who would not identify himself, shepherded them
away.
</P>
<P>
   Philipps said she bore no ill will toward the suspects'
families. ``I'm very sympathetic to the relatives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers will argue that the airliner was downed by
members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, which was led by
Talb, or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Talb's
group was suspected at first, before American and British
prosecutors zeroed in on the Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   But Philipps, as she glared at the men who would not return her
stare, was convinced she was looking at the terrorists who killed
her daughter and 269 other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I know it's a cornerstone of democracy and the
civilized world, I'm having trouble with the doctrine of the
presumption of innocence,'' she said. ``I have no doubt they did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She does have doubts in the convoluted legal process in a
society that affords far more rights and protections to the accused
than the suspects' own country affords its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When the testimony got tedious, or when defense lawyers started
talking about the rights of their clients, Elizabeth Philipps took
out a small, framed photograph of her daughter which she keeps in
her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about you, Sarah,'' she said, almost in a whisper.
``This is all about you.''

<P>
   Anyone concerned about teen-agers in the United States should go
see ``Human Traffic'' and take comfort in the fact that they're
nowhere near as drug-addled and foolish as British youth. Of
course, ``Human Traffic'' isn't geared toward anyone over the age
of 30, so this thin, energetic film won't ever register on the
radar of parents or geezers who didn't come of age in the past
decade. That's no loss, as you probably have to be of a certain age
(and mindset) to appreciate this movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Traffic'' follows five Welsh kids through a weekend of
club-hopping and drug taking. On the surface, you could make an
easy comparison to ``Trainspotting''; just substitute Ecstasy for
heroin as the drug of choice. The movies also share a loose,
episodic style that's heavy on surrealism and dream sequences and
backed by an ear- splitting soundtrack. ``Human Traffic'' is more
modest, though, in both budget and ambition, meaning to be taken as
an ode to friendship and not pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   First-time writer-director Justin Kerrigan introduces (rather
shakily) his five friends in the movie's opening moments. There's
the impish Jip (John Simm), the principal character and narrator,
who'd dealing with impotence _ or, as he puts it, ``a monumental
case of Mr. Floppy.'' Koop (Shaun Parkes) works in a record store,
selling hard-core rap that would ``turn Hare Krishna into a bad
boy.'' He's insecure, though, believing that his flirtatious
girlfriend, Nina (Nicola Reynolds), is cheating on him.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the wispy blond looker LuLu (Lorraine Pilkington)
suffers through a string of loser boyfriends, while harboring a
crush on Jip. And Moff (Danny Dyer), the biggest ``pill monster''
of the group, goes through some rather extreme machinations just to
masturbate, while ``having the best time being off my pickle.''
Pickle, in this case, meaning brain.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of Brit-speak in the movie, which has become a
cult favorite in England. Kerrigan, a native of the film's Cardiff,
Wales setting, makes no apologies about the drugs, but neither does
he shy away from showing their effects as he takes his characters
from euphoria to paranoia in a weekend's time. Mostly, Kerrigan
presents drugs as a rather incidental part of a disaffected youth's
life. The message: How can one endure a dead-end, 40-hour-a-week
McJob without a little help from your friends, chemical and
otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan, a mere 25, gives ``Human Traffic'' plenty of style and
attitude. Plot is incidental; the movie's failing comes with its
characters, which are a rather thinly drawn lot. The fantasy
sequences are rather hit-and-miss, but there's some great energy
here, and some good dialogue, too, as when Moff and another Ecstasy
user pontificate on how the ``Star Wars'' movies are all about
drugs. Whether the filmmaking force is with Kerrigan will be seen
when he makes his second movie. &QL; 
The film: ``Human Traffic'' (R; for pervasive drug content,
language and some strong sexuality). &QL; 
The stars: John Simm, Lorraine Pilkington, Shaun Parkes, Nicola
Reynolds, Danny Dyer. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Written and directed by Justin Kerrigan.
Released by Miramax Films. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 29 minutes. &QL; 
Playing: Laemmle's Sunset 5 in West Hollywood; Laemmle's Playhouse
7 in Pasadena; Landmark's NuWilshire in Santa Monica. &QL;

A CLASSIC COCKTAIL: DERBY DAY CALLS FOR A MINT JULEP
</HEADLINE>
  By ALLISON BALLARD

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   To muddle, or not to muddle? A dash of mint syrup or just
straight bourbon with a sprinkle of powdered sugar?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions facing those getting ready to celebrate
the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday in the most traditional way _
while drinking a mint julep. The problem is that there are almost
as many recipes for the cocktail as there are horses in the race.
That is quite a feat for a drink with only a few ingredients _
bourbon, sugar and mint. There are strong versions not for the
faint of heart, and there are fruity versions to please the
pickiest palates.
</P>
<P>
   The julep is believed to be derived from an Arabic drink called
a julab, made of water and rose petals. When the beverage came to
the Mediterranean, mint became the herb of choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the beverage was first imbibed in
Virginia, according to the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture. But
different regions had different versions. In New England, it was
made with rum. In Louisiana, the choice was brandy. Eventually, the
julep came to be associated only with bourbon. The frosty drink was
served on hot, humid mornings in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Mint juleps were served at Churchill Downs not long after the
first derby in 1875. But it did not become the official drink until
1939. Now, more than 80,000 are served each Derby Day.
</P>
<P>
   There are just a few basic ways to prepare the cocktail. All of
the recipes, though, recommend serving the beverage in the classic
mint julep cup. It is a small, straight-sided vessel of pewter or
silver that turns frosty. Make sure the cups are approved for food,
and not decorative, use. And in a pinch, just use a glass.
</P>
<P>
   All of the recipes suggest packing finely crushed ice into the
cup and pouring Kentucky bourbon on top. The difference comes with
the cocktail's other two ingredients _ the mint and the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Spirited debates have ensued over the use of the muddle, a
small, rounded stick that crushes the herbs, fruits and peels. Some
prefer to muddle because it releases aromatic essences. Others
maintain that muddling makes a julep too bitter, and they object
strenuously to the sight of crushed leaves and stems in the bottom
of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   For a strong mint julep, simply make a drink with straight
bourbon. Sprinkle a little powdered sugar over the top and garnish
with a sprig of mint. Other mint juleps are basically either
muddled or made with a mint syrup. Epicurious.com lists several
recipes. Here is the basic version:
</P>
<P>
   THE MUDDLED MINT JULEP
</P>
<P>
   Crushed ice
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon superfine sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces bourbon
</P>
<P>
   Fill glass with crushed ice. In a small glass, muddle the leaves
from two mint sprigs with sugar and a dash of club soda or water.
Add bourbon, stir and strain into glass. Stir again with a
long-handled spoon until the glass frosts. Serves 1.

JOURNALISTS HONORED FOR SACRIFICES WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reporters and publishers of all colors and continents,
survivors of torture, imprisonment, and assassination attempts by
authoritarian regimes around the world, were honored Wednesday at
Faneuil Hall as heroes of the international struggle for free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The awards by the Vienna-based International Press Institute
were timed to coincide with World Press Freedom Day, and with the
conclusion of a four-day conference in Boston marking the
institute's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Some honorees came in Savile Row suits, some in traditional
African dress. Some could not attend because they were not allowed
to travel, others because attempts on their lives had succeeded.
But certain common traits _ especially uncommon courage _ ran
through all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravery in a democracy is very different from bravery in other
countries,'' said retired Washington Post publisher Katharine
Graham, the only honoree from the United States. ``I am in awe of
journalists from around the world who have suffered'' severe
political repression and physical abuse. ``I do not belong in that
pantheon.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Graham is one of the few US newspeople ever threatened
from the highest levels of government, a distinction she won for
publishing documents that showed the government was lying to the
public about the origins and progress of the Vietnam War, then
giving her editors and reporters strong backing for the Watergate
investigation, which toppled President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most famous threats of that contentious period, US
Attorney General John Mitchell told a Post reporter that ``Katie
Graham is going to get her tit caught in a big fat wringer'' for
pursuing the Watergate case.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Graham said, many of the other journalists honored
Wednesday distinguished themselves in lands where ``horrific
dangers are, alas, almost routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Faraj Sarkuhi, a critic first of the Shah of Iran and later of
the Islamic fundamentalists who succeeded him, was persecuted on
and off for 30 years, culminating in his being kidnapped in the
Tehran airport and tortured for 48 days _ after which he was
charged with spying for a foreign power. His case illustrated the
relationship, cited by many speakers, between press freedom and
freedom generally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like this Jewish thing,'' Sarkuhi said after the
ceremony, referring to the apparent show trials of 13 Iranian Jews,
some of whom are confessing to charges of spying for Israel.
``First they torture you, then they threaten to torture your son,''
he said. ``I confessed also.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cases, like Sarkuhi's, attracted international attention.
Others, like that of Indo-Canadian Times founder Tara Singh Hayer,
who was shot to death in his home in British Columbia in November
1998, received little previous attention.
</P>
<P>
   Some are still in progress: Gao Yu could not accept her award
because she is under house arrest in China; Raul Rivero was denied
an exit visa from Cuba; Nizar Nayyouf is believed near death in a
Syrian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Others have happy outcomes, such as the case of Kemal Kurspahic,
who was editor of the leading newspaper in Bosnia during the
horrific siege of Sarajevo. Operating from a bomb shelter, under
frequent shelling, Kurspahic and his multi-ethnic staff never
missed an edition, despite shortages of electricity, ink, and
newsprint. He now is writing a book on journalism in the Balkan
wars.
</P>
<P>
   Also in observance of World Press Freedom Day, the New
York-based Committee for the Protection of Journalists Wednesday
published its annual listing of the 10 worst offenders among
officials and governments that abuse the media.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front targeted
journalists during the civil war in Sierra Leone, topped the list,
followed by Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Yugoslavia's Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, has fostered a reaction
against reformists in which 16 publications were closed in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the list were: President Nursultan Nazarbayev of
Kazakhstan; President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola; President
Alberto Fujimori of Peru; Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of
Malaysia; President Zine el Abdine Ben Ali of Tunisia; President
Jiang Zemin of China; and President Fidel Castro of Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
   House Democrats filed suit under civil anti-racketeering laws
today against House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), alleging he
oversees an organization that extorts campaign contributions and
evades federal disclosure requirements. Rep. Patrick Kennedy of
Rhode Island, who chairs the Democratic campaign committee, said
DeLay stands atop an unprecedented operation, ``hammering
contributors for money, threatening to punish those who decline and
setting up a shadow party structure outside public view and our
laws.'' Several of DeLay's aides greeted reporters arriving for the
press conference where the suit was announced and handed them
written statements accusing Democrats of ``resorting to ugly,
unfounded, politically motivated charges.''
</P>
<P>
   LIKE THAT SECRET PLAN TO END THE VIETNAM WAR?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore accused George W. Bush today of making a ``smug
assumption'' that he can win the presidency without detailing his
plans for Social Security. ``It is responsible to make the strength
and solvency of Social Security a major national priority. And it
is responsible to tell the American people exactly how you propose
to do it,'' Gore told the New Jersey AFL-CIO. But Gore barely
mentioned the administration's push to open trade with China, an
effort opposed by labor groups. Bush plans to outline next week the
principles by which he would work to protect Social Security. Aides
say he'll not release a detailed plan, though Bush has said he
supports letting retirees invest a portion of their Social Security
benefits in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYING THE CARD CARD
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Card, transportation secretary under President Bush, has
been picked by George W. Bush to head his operations at this
summer's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Two weeks
ago, the candidate reached back into his father's Cabinet and
picked former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to head his vice
presidential selection committee. Said Card, 52, today: ``Governor
Bush and I are the same age, and I am a passionate supporter of
Governor Bush's initiatives and his leadership, and that is
independent of the tremendous and absolute respect I have for his
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   INFLATION IN THE FUND-RAISING BIZ
</P>
<P>
   Raising the bar for political giving, the Democrats are asking
their biggest donors to come up with a half-million dollars each
for the party's barbecue-and-jeans gala set for May 24. Those who
deliver are being promised a sweet political reward: a private
dinner the night before with President Clinton. The Democrats' new
asking price doubles the $250,000 mark that was the standard for
both parties the past few years, including the recent Republican
fund-raising gala with George W. Bush that raised a record $21.3
million. ``They just keep trying to jack up the limits,'' said
Larry Makinson, head of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
private group that studies political money. ``How long until they
have the million-dollar club? This really shows you there is no end
to the appetite for money.''
</P>
<P>
   THAT WAS NO LADY, THAT WAS MY _
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan fired back at Hillary Clinton, accusing her of
acting less than first-ladylike after her scathing attack on his
candidacy. Clinton accused Buchanan last week of ``hateful
rhetoric'' and ruled out sharing an Independence Party ticket this
fall with him. Buchanan told the New York Daily News: ``I don't
think that kind of inflammatory language comports with being a
first lady. I think the first lady ought to always try to be a lady
even if she falls short. She certainly did in this case. It's a bit
arrogant, especially when you consider that Mrs. Clinton herself is
currently under criminal investigation for possible perjury and
obstruction of justice.'' Plus, she's too liberal, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A PLAN B
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton told Ladies' Home Journal in its June issue that
if she loses her Senate race, ``I'll probably be connected with a
foundation or academic institution in some way.'' She added that
she'd remain active on political issues that matter to her: ``I'll
support the same issues: raising the minimum wage, expanding the
earned income tax credit for poor working people, and putting more
teachers into the classroom to lower class size in our public
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   EX-RENO AIDE QUESTIONED GORE'S HONESTY
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the Justice Department's campaign finance
task force told a Senate panel that in a memo to Attorney General
Janet Reno, he had questioned Al Gore's truthfulness in answering
investigators' questions about fund-raising phone calls Gore made
in 1996. Charles LaBella said he had wanted a more aggressive,
independent probe of allegations ranging from technology transfers
to China to Gore's fund-raising calls _ a stance at odds with Reno,
his boss at the time. LaBella told the senators that he didn't
believe Reno was protecting anyone, but that he disagreed with her
refusal to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   NUMERICAL SPARRING IN FISCAL BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is fighting back against Al Gore's accusations
that his fiscal proposals are risky, saying that the growth in the
economy over the past six months means there will be enough money
to accommodate his spending and tax cut proposals comfortably.
Bush's advisers released a new analysis of his budget plans after
Gore asserted that Bush's large tax cut proposal and plan to push
for a portion of Social Security payroll taxes to be put into
private investment accounts would return the nation to the era of
deficits. Using new economic data, Bush's campaign now says that,
excluding Social Security, there will be a federal surplus of $647
billion from 2002 through 2006. That's $61 billion more than they
had previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   GORE TAPS WHITE HOUSE TALENT POOL
</P>
<P>
   Top White House talent employed by the taxpayers is helping Al
Gore write his campaign speeches, work up attacks against George W.
Bush's budget, and develop everything from crime-fighting proposals
to health and education reforms. Gene Sperling, head of President
Clinton's National Economic Council, and Bruce Reed, chief White
House domestic policy adviser, and scores of lower-level aides are
lending their expertise _ legally, the Gore campaign asserts _ on
their own free time.
</P>
<P>
   But good-government watchdogs wince at the overlap. ``These guys
are dropping any pretense of a separation between campaign and
government. The problem here is of perception, and the average
American does not expect his or her taxpayer money to go toward Al
Gore's campaign,'' said Charles Lewis, head of the Center for
Public Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   NRA KEEPING ITS TOP GUN
</P>
<P>
   Charlton Heston will be allowed to run for an unprecedented
third term as president of the National Rifle Association at the
group's annual convention later this month. NRA spokesman Bill
Powers said today that the gun lobby's bylaws are being amended.
Traditionally, NRA officers have been elected twice to one-year
terms. Heston and the NRA have had a high profile since Congress
began considering gun legislation after a rash of school shootings
across the nation. The NRA has vehemently lobbied against any new
restrictions on gun owners' rights. Heston also recently appeared
in a series of political ads that critics say portrayed President
Clinton as a liar during the recent fight over the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNOR BATTLE SET IN CAROLINA . . .
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of winning their parties' nominations in North
Carolina, Republican Richard Vinroot and Democrat Mike Easley
indicated that education will be a key issue as they battle to
succeed popular Gov. Jim Hunt. Both candidates won handily,
avoiding runoffs in crowded fields. Vinroot, an ex-Charlotte mayor,
beat state Rep. Leo Daughtry 45-37 percent. Easley, the state
attorney general, turned back Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker 59-36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND IN INDIANA, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Indiana Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP nomination
to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon. McIntosh
won 72 percent of the vote, beating John Price, a lawyer who toured
the state in a red school bus and drew 28 percent for his travels.
O'Bannon had no opposition. Ex-radio talker Mike Pence defeated a
crowded field to win the GOP nomination for McIntosh's House seat.
Lawyer Robert Rock won the Democratic nomination. Sen. Richard
Lugar (R-Ind.) faced no primary opposition. In the fall, he'll go
up against Democratic lawyer David Johnson, an adviser to O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE HECK, A FEW MORE DELEGATES CAN'T HURT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and Al Gore already have won the necessary number
of delegates, and they've piled on even more. In North Carolina,
Bush drew 79 percent, John McCain 11 percent and Alan Keyes 8
percent. Gore had 70 percent and Bill Bradley 19 percent. In
Indiana, Gore drew 75 percent and Bradley 22 percent. Lyndon
LaRouche had 3 percent. Bush drew 81 percent to McCain's 19
percent. And in Washington, D.C., Gore drew 96 percent of the
Democrats, and Bush beat McCain 75-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S THAT KNOCKING?
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giulilani can knock on the door of New York's Conservative
Party, as he announced he would do, but the party is not ready to
let him in. ``As I've said all along, he cannot be on the party's
ballot if he is also supported by the Liberal Party and if he
supports partial-birth abortion,'' Conservative Party chairman
Michael Long told the Washington Times. Giuliani has enjoyed the
Liberals' support and ballot position during his two terms as New
York City mayor.
</P>
<P>
   LONG ANGER ON LONG ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly Republican Nassau County, on Long Island, stunned
the New York political establishment last November, when an
electorate that was angry over the fiscal crisis, tax increases and
a series of government scandals ended decades of one-party rule in
the county and gave the Democrats a 10-to-9 majority in its
legislative branch for the first time in 80 years. Four months
later, the death of Barbara Johnson left chamber tied 9-to-9.
Tuesday, voters were still plenty angry, as Craig Johnson, 29, won
a special election to succeed his mother. Johnson defeated
Republican Linda Green and Benjamin Zwirn, an ex-Democrat who ran
on the Green Party line.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE ARE THOSE CHARRED BITS OF ZEPPELIN?
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, New York Governor George Pataki said, ``I
would think it's more likely that the Hindenburg would come back
together than I would step down as governor and become senator.''
But now, he is refusing to rule out entering the Senate race if
Rudy Guiliani is forced to drop out because of his prostate cancer.
Pataki stressed, though, that he expected the mayor to remain in
the race, and beyond that, he said, ``I'm not going to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   WALKING THE STRAIGHT AND NARRAL?
</P>
<P>
   An abortion rights group is launching its campaign to elect Al
Gore with an ad focused on the president's power to influence the
issue through the Supreme Court. The ad by the National Abortion
Rights and Reproductive Action League begins today in the
Washington area. ``George W. Bush would nominate Supreme Court
justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade,'' the announcer says. ``He
even supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion.'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer would not comment on the ad's overall
message, saying only that Bush ``will appoint justices to the court
who will strictly interpret the Constitution, and he will seek to
bring people together on areas where there is agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   AND HE'LL HEAR THE ANGELS SINGING
</P>
<P>
   Trailing in the all-important money chase and statewide polls in
the California Senate race, Republican Rep. Tom Campbell still
believes he can beat two-term Democratic incumbent Dianne
Feinstein. His own polling shows a close race this fall, and ``it's
a good year for Republicans, I win,'' he told reporters in
Washington. He said his last poll prior to the primary put him at
42 percent against Feinstein's 48 percent. ``That's really good,''
he said. Campbell's dream scenario? Al Gore selects Feinstein to be
his running mate. ``That is a gift from heaven if it occurs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   IN MONTANA, THE ISSUE: PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST
</P>
<P>
   Brian Schweitzer, a Democratic farmer trying to unseat
Republican Sen. Conrad Burns in Montana, has campaigned hard on the
high price of prescription drugs and the burden it puts on the
uninsured elderly. Schweitzer has taken retirees to Canada to
highlight the lower cost of drugs there, and battled with a drug
industry lobbying coalition called Citizens for Better Medicare.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, now believing
Schweitzer has a chance to help retake the Senate, has produced a
television spot urging voters to ``call the big drug companies and
tell them to get out of the way of Brian Schweitzer's fair prices
drug plan.''

`SPIN THE BOTTLE': CRUELTY OF CHILDHOOD RETURNS TO HAUNT ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Spin the Bottle'' takes place in and around a creaky, isolated
lakefront house somewhere in the wilds of Vermont. Four childhood
friends, now in their late 20s, have been summoned to this lonely
spot by another old acquaintance, a mysterious fellow named Jonah
(Holter Graham), whom none of them have seen in more than a decade
and who suffered hurt and humiliation at their thoughtless young
hands.
</P>
<P>
   You may think you know where this is going, and nothing would
make me happier than to report that Jonah responds to this ``Friday
the 13th''-style setup by dispatching his erstwhile tormenters, one
by one, using the most gruesome cinematic means at his disposal.
But instead Jonah takes his revenge by setting in motion a series
of cat-and-mouse sexual mind games designed to humiliate his
guests, who are in the neighborhood for a wedding, and to expose
their hang-ups and hypocrisies. The movie would have been shorter,
more entertaining and a richer source of insight into human
psychology if he had simply cut them into pieces with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spin the Bottle,'' which was completed in 1997 and is now, for
some reason, playing at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, is certainly
gruesome (though not graphic) but hardly cinematic. The Vermont
wilderness is pretty enough, and the moon looks lonesome shining
through the trees, but the director, Jamie Yerkes, has nothing much
to do besides watch people talk. What they say, thanks to a script
by Amy Sohn, a novelist and former sex columnist for The New York
Press, consists of exchanges like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll believe enough for the both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to ultimate human tranquillity is not paved with the
hands of good girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonah and his pals are meant to be, I guess, a sampling of the
jaded, overprivileged generation now facing the complications of
adulthood. Ted (Mitchell Riggs) is engaged to Bev (Kim Winter),
though he is plagued with doubts about his commitment to monogamy
and his law school career. Alex (Jessica Faller), the ensemble's
designated slut, exploits these doubts by flirting shamelessly with
Ted, while Rachel (Heather Goldenhersh), the one with low
self-esteem, whines about the man who dumped her.
</P>
<P>
   Into this nest of seething insecurity comes Jonah, who we know
to be a dangerous, ambiguous sexual dynamo because he wears a
sheepskin vest with no shirt underneath and has pierced ears and
nose.
</P>
<P>
   The film turns, as you may have surmised, on a midnight game of
spin the bottle, after which Jonah has sex with two visitors. I
won't reveal which ones, because you couldn't possibly care. The
poor actors arch their brows and enunciate their lame witticisms as
if they were performing Noel Coward, or else rage and parry as if
auditioning for an imported-beer commercial loosely based on
``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' Perhaps the characters are
meant to remind you of people you know, but if that's the case,
they are people you would do everything in your power to avoid, on
screen or off.

BUSH NAMES CARD CHIEF OF GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A decade after serving in the administration of
President George Bush, former Massachusetts state legislator Andrew
Card has accepted a prestigious job with the former president's
son, agreeing to head the efforts of Texas Governor George W. Bush
at the Republican National Convention this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Card, 52, served as both deputy chief of staff and
Transportation Secretary under the elder Bush. He is the second
member of the Bush White House to take an important role in the
George W. Bush campaign, following the hiring of former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Card, who encouraged the governor to run for president early
on, said his enthusiasm for Bush was ``earned independently'' of
his support for the elder Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first met George W. Bush in 1979, and I have watched him
grow as a political figure and as a leader in a number of different
sectors,'' Card said in an interview Wednesday. When Bush first
considered a presidential bid, Card said, ``I was one of those who
said I would support him whether he liked it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Card, a native of Holbrook, Mass., will take a 90-day leave of
absence from his job as director of government affairs at General
Motors, beginning next Monday. He plans to spend most of the next
three months in Philadelphia, where the Republican convention will
be held from July 31 to Aug. 3, developing the ``look and feel'' of
the Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   Among his chief concerns, Card said, is creating an image of
``compassionate conservatism,'' the message Bush has put forth
since his campaign began more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of work to be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more daunting a challenge might be helping Bush win in
Card's home state, Card conceded. But, he said, ``I am going to
help everywhere I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcing Card's new position, Bush said in a statement: ``Andy
is a good man who will do a great job at the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Card was a state representative from Massachusetts for eight
years, and also made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 1982
before joining President Bush's administration. At the end of
Bush's term, Card helped with the transition as he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Cheney was hired to help select the vice
presidential nominee for Governor Bush's ticket, despite earlier
concerns the candidate might appear too reliant on his father's
legacy if he surrounded himself with old Bush hands.

TRIAL BEGINS FOR 2 LIBYANS ACCUSED IN PAN AM 103 BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ Nearly 12 years after a jumbo jet blew
up in the skies of Scotland, raining bodies and flaming debris on
the village of Lockerbie, the trial of two Libyans accused of
planting a bomb on the plane got underway Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is unusual in many ways: with 270 victims, it is the
largest mass murder trial in British history, the first time a
patch of Scottish soil has been created overseas to allow such an
event, and the first Scottish murder trial to use judges instead of
a jury.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first time a trial in what is nominally Britain
has attracted the massive attention usually associated with the
American courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many senses, this trial is unique,'' said John P. Grant,
who leads a team of law professors from the University of Glasgow
studying the trial and helping journalists with the vagaries of
Scottish law. ``It may become the longest trial in British history.
It certainly will be the most expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 blew up at about 7:03 p.m.
on Dec. 21, 1988, just after crossing the Solway Firth in Scotland
at 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The trial culminates years of struggle among nations, involving
outrage at the crime; a detective investigation spanning the globe,
the isolation of Libya and United Nations sanctions that Libya has
claimed cost it $33 billion, and years of diplomatic maneuvering
that ultimately allowed the suspects to be brought to trial while
Libya's dictator, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, could still claim that he
never handed them over to Libya's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For all the ballyhoo, the trial got underway quite simply
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under Scottish law, neither prosecution nor defense make opening
statements. So after some preliminary motions had been agreed on,
the indictment had been read and the defense had notified the
prosecution of part of its plans, Judge Ranald Iain Sutherland
looked up and said: ``My Lord Advocate?''
</P>
<P>
   And the lead prosecutor, Colin Boyd, began: ``M'Lord, the first
witness for the Crown is No. 1 on the witness list, Richard James
Dawson.''
</P>
<P>
   After some sound system screeching was fixed _ by a court ruling
that witnesses would be allowed to testify while seated, which
somehow hushed the microphone feedback _ Dawson, a 52-year-old air
traffic controller, began describing the air routes around Heathrow
Airport, from which Pan Am Flight 103 took off shortly before it
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has a list of more than 1,000 witnesses, and the
trial of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa
Fhimah is expected to last a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment lays out a lengthy description of the plot of
which the two are accused. Both are said to have been members of
the Libyan Intelligence Services _ Megrahi the head of security for
Libyan Arab Airlines and Fhimah the airline's station manager in
Malta _ and to have acted in their intelligence roles.
</P>
<P>
   The plot as described stretched from a special forces base in
Libya where bomb timers were said to have been tested to the
offices of front companies named Mebo in Switzerland and Medtours
in Czechoslovakia, and to a Holiday Inn in Malta and Libyan
government offices in Czechoslovakia and Germany. Like the outline
of a Frederick Forsyth novel, it makes sketchy references to
purchases of electronic detonators, travel under false passports
and the carrying out of an unexplained intelligence operation in
Chad, but the core of it is this:
</P>
<P>
   The two men are accused of stealing airline luggage tags at Luqa
Airport in Malta in December 1988, then bringing to Malta a
suitcase and a Toshiba RTSF-16 ``Bombeat'' boom box packed with
plastic explosive and a timer. They bought clothing and an umbrella
in Malta, the prosecution contends, packed them around the bomb,
put them in the suitcase and checked it aboard Air Malta KM180
tagged so that it would go through Frankfurt, London and on to New
York on Pan Am 103.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The list of the dead, part of the indictment, reads like a grim
trip past the headstones of a cemetery. It is alphabetical, so the
name of Brittany Leigh Williams, aged 2 months, of the 516th
Engineer Company Army Post Office, New York, is found between those
of her parents, Bonnie Leigh and Eric Jon, of the same address. All
in all, 259 crew and passenger members and 11 residents of
Lockerbie, two of them aged 10, are on it.
</P>
<P>
   Although it began blandly, Wednesday's trial did have a dramatic
moment in mid-afternoon when Alan John Topp, the last controller to
talk to the pilot, described losing contact with the flight. Its
number had disappeared from his radar screen he was monitoring, he
said, as court television screens showed a tape of the screen he
had been looking at.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost the height readout,'' he testified, explaining the
tape as if he were back at his desk that night. ``That could be a
glitch. Now we've lost everything.
</P>
<P>

   After a court break, he returned to describe how he had
repeatedly tried to radio the plane _ 7 attempts in the next 8

the Pan Am plane, a call to a controller in charge of a lower

   Less dramatic, but possibly more important, was a 14-line
document read out before testimony began. It was the defense's
notice to the prosecution that it planned to blame the crime on a
Syrian-backed Palestinian group.
</P>
<P>
   Under Scottish law, the defense must state at the opening of a
trial if it plans to mount certain defenses. They include insanity,
self-defense, coercion, ``automatism'' _ a notion akin to temporary
insanity _ and ``incrimination'' _ a claim that someone else did it
and you will produce evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   McCourts, the firm defending Megrahi, filed notice that it would
offer an incrimination defense that would blame members of the
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, possibly including two of the
prosecution's witnesses and six other men, ``all present
whereabouts unknown.'' The defense said they were ``all formerly
directors of the Miska Bakery, Malta'' and members of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.

   Before the indictment naming the Libyans was announced in 1991,
much attention had focused on Iranians, Syrians and Palestinians as
suspects, and one theory had been that the Pan Am bombing was
revenge not for the U.S. bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 that
supposedly killed one of Gadhafi's children, but for the shooting
down of an Iranian airliner by the USS
</P>
<P>
   Vincennes in 1988. Under those scenarios, the Iranians were said
to have ``subcontracted'' their revenge, like a Mafia hit, to
Syrians and Palestinians.

   The defense asked few questions Wednesday, but focused on how
long the plane was at 31,000 feet before it exploded, how far the
debris blew and whether the plane was definitely in Scottish
airspace, not English.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish law contains other provisions foreign to Americans.
Normally, serious crimes are tried before 15 jurors, and only 8
votes are needed to convict.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the defense had argued that it could not get a
fair trial with a jury because of advance publicity and anti-Libyan
feeling. The prosecution agreed that it would be unfair to have
Scottish jurors away from home for as much as 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, three judges are hearing the case; a fourth sits on
the bench in case one becomes ill. Two of three are needed to
convict.
</P>
<P>
   Three verdicts are available: guilty, not guilty, or not proven.
A not-proven verdict ``leaves a question mark over the head of the
accused, but it's an acquittal,'' said Jim Murdoch, a former
defense lawyer who now teaches at the University of Glasgow law
school. ``As they're leaving the court, a cloud is over their head
_ but they are leaving the court.''

DISCOVERY POINTS TO FAULTY WIRING AT BIRTH AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF

<P>
   Scientists for the first time have discovered what they believe
may be biological markers in the blood of newborn infants who later
develop autism and mental retardation. The markers consist of
abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals that help construct
the basic architecture of animal brains, researchers said. The
finding supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of
both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of
the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be
replicated in larger studies. But if it proves true, it could open
the door to new opportunities for treating these devastating mental
disorders that affect as many as six out of every 1,000 newborns.
If doctors can screen for autism and mental retardation at birth,
scientists say, affected babies could be given special early
enrichments or drugs designed to help their brains develop more
normally.
</P>
<P>
   The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by
Dr. Karin B. Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., was carried out
by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth
Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington
University Medical Center in Washington. Nelson said in a telephone
interview that the study was in the process of being submitted to a
scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   The new work ``is really exciting,'' said Dr. David Amaral, a
neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis and a
leading expert on neurodevelopmental disorders, who was not
involved in the study. The world of autism research is littered
with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of
attacking the problem at a basic scientific level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this study can be replicated and confirmed, it will be very
important,'' said Dr. Eric Courchesne, an autism expert at the
University of California in San Diego. People have been looking for
triggers, like measles vaccinations, to help explain the onset of
autism symptoms, he said. But this study suggests that the defects
may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas
about the cause of these disorders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could turn out that these brain proteins ``are not
predictive of anything,'' said Dr. Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist and
autism expert at the University of Chicago. ``The work is exciting
and I hope it's correct,'' he said, but the fact that four proteins
are elevated ``does not mean there is one simple pathway'' in the
brain to explain these disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental
retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain
chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said. But this notion
has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the
disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental
retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around
3 years old. There has never been a way to identify the babies who
might have these brain abnormalities and so researchers have not
been able study the problem early in life.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings are the result of a collaboration of
researchers from three scientific disciplines: neurochemistry,
epidemiology and analytical immunochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Neurochemists have identified many brain proteins that help
cells survive, make connections between cells and lay the basis for
learning and memory, Nelson said. The thinking was that some of
these molecules might be involved in autism and mental retardation,
but which ones remained a mystery. ``We chose eight of them,''
Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects
Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley. The program, established
nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in
seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to
help track down causes of birth defects. For example, the program
recently helped show a link between babies born with cleft palates
and mothers who smoked cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples are stored in a warehouse and can be fetched
any time epidemiologists have questions to explore, said Dr. John
Harris, director of the program. In this case, staff members in the
program went to clinics in Northern California and located
teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism,
65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls. All the teen-agers
were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in
the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were sent to Dr. Terry Phillips, an immunochemist at
George Washington University and at the Office of Research Services
at the National Institutes of Health who uses sophisticated new
techniques to fish tiny amounts of proteins out of blood samples.
Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers,
he said. But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in
nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers. None of
the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy
had elevated levels of these proteins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns''
present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop
autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers
said. While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a
gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said. Too
much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in
development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to
be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique
used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that
more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not
normal in regard to these proteins at birth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But researchers who are familiar with the four proteins said the
finding was highly provocative given what was known about them. For
example, Dr. Douglas Brenneman, chief of the section on
developmental and molecular pharmacology at the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, said one
protein, VIP, was akin to a master molecule used for ``putting
brains together.'' It exerts powerful effects on at least a dozen
brain chemicals, including the other three identified in this
study, he said. Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the
mother's immune cells. After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of
the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in
other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin, a digestive hormone that is being given to many
autistic children with the hope that it will alleviate their
behavioral problems, is in the VIP family, Brenneman said. But
there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines
can ever get into the brain, he said. Nearly every controlled
clinical trial of secretin has failed to show that the hormone
works as claimed, Amaral said. On the other hand, there could be
``brain and gut interactions'' that are not yet understood. This
finding about biological markers ``opens the barn door wide open to
look for deeper causes of autism and mental retardation,'' Harris
said. ``Until now, we didn't even know this barn door was there.''

ANTIMISSILE SYSTEM USING LASER PASSES ITS FIRST TEST
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A powerful laser developed by Israel and the United States to
shoot down rockets has passed its first test at the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico, hitting a stationary target, American
military officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   If it is eventually deployed, the system would apparently be the
first antimissile defense of any kind based on lasers. ``To my
knowledge, no nation has ever deployed an antimissile system based
on a laser,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Designed and built by a California contractor, TRW, for Israel
and the United States Army, the laser and its tracking system were
tested last week against stationary targets, said Lt. Gen. John
Costello, commander of the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense
Command.
</P>
<P>
   Costello said the system, the Tactical High Energy Laser, would
probably be tested this month against a moving Katyusha rocket. If
that test is successful, he said, the system will be shipped to
Israel for further testing and deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the first engagement of the Katyusha rocket by a
tactical high energy laser, something that is militarily useful,''
the general said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Defense Ministry said it planned to deploy the
system along its northern border to shoot down guerrilla rockets
after Israel withdraws from Lebanon in the summer. A spokesman for
the ministry, Dan Weinreich, said the weapon was in the final
stages of testing in the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Space and Missile Defense Command, Marco
Morales, said the cost to develop the system through the first
attempted shoot down was $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing this week in Huntsville, Ala., on missile defense,
Costello said developing the system over five years ``could in fact
revolutionize warfare'' by protecting troops from rockets, mortars
and other artillery. But he said using lasers in rain and fog
needed special experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The possible deployment of the laser, though its geographic
range is modest, represents a striking turnaround for an
antimissile technology that was criticized as unworkable in the
Strategic Defense Initiative of the 1980s. Since then, most
American antimissile systems have turned to ``hit-to-kill''
technology. That means that a rocket-propelled vehicle maneuvers
toward an incoming missile to collide with and, therefore, destroy
it. But the U.S. military has also continued long-term research and
development on laser-based systems.
</P>
<P>
   Those include the Israeli-American program for intercepting
short-range missiles, an Air Force program to shoot ballistic
missiles like Iraqi Scuds using a laser on a Boeing 747 jumbo jet
and a joint venture by the Air Force and the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization at the Pentagon to develop lasers that could
be fired from space to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   All those lasers would derive their energy from powerful
chemical reactions and destroy the missiles by heating them to high
temperatures. Although the Israeli-American laser, if successful,
would intercept rockets in the middle or end of their flights, the
others would try to destroy missiles earlier, as their boosters
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology has come a long way since the early `Star Wars'
days in terms of developing lasers that could in the future destroy
a ballistic missile,'' Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, said.
</P>
<P>
   The laser's exact power, range and repetition rate for firing
are classified. But at the briefing in Huntsville, Richard J.
Bradshaw Jr., a project manager at the Space and Missile Defense
Command, said the laser fired fast enough that it was ``capable of
engaging multiple targets coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Costello suggested that the laser would have an initial range of
four miles. ``Frankly,'' he added, ``we've designed it with the
Israelis because of the threat to northern Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At the briefing, Jess Granone, executive director of the Space
and Missile Defense technical center, said smaller, lighter lasers
for missile defense were also being developed based on solid state
components rather than chemicals. ``I'm talking about technology
you could fit on a Humvee,'' Granone said.

   ATLANTA _ The results of Tuesday's primary elections for
governor in North Carolina set up a fall campaign between
candidates with starkly different views, particularly on the
critical issue of education.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee, Attorney General Mike Easley, is likely
to campaign on his plan for a state lottery that would finance a
reduction in class sizes in lower grades. Democrats who defeated
Republican governors in Alabama and South Carolina in 1998 used
their support for the lottery to great effect, and polls show the
idea of a lottery is popular in North Carolina as well.
</P>
<P>
   Easley's Republican opponent, Richard Vinroot, the former mayor
of Charlotte, opposes a lottery for North Carolina, though he would
support a referendum on the issue. As an alternative to a lottery,
Vinroot supports a system of vouchers intended to give parents
greater choice in selecting schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turn-out was low in both primaries. Easley, 50, and
Vinroot, 59, won easily despite spirited challenges from
well-financed opponents. With 97 percent of precincts reporting,
Easley was leading Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker 59 percent to 36 percent.
Vinroot took 45 percent of the vote while his closest competitor,
state Rep. Leo Daughtry, won 37 percent. Candidates must win at
least 40 percent to avoid a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Easley and Vinroot will compete to succeed Gov. Jim Hunt, who
has held the office for four of the last six terms. He was barred
from seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists in North Carolina were struck that the two
victors on Tuesday won without the support of their parties'
grass-roots political machines. In the Democratic race, Wicker was
the clear preference of his party's traditional loyalists,
including organizations of teachers, trial lawyers and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Daughtry, as the former House majority
leader, was supported by dozens of state legislators and their
local political organizations. And some Christian conservatives
groups, including the Christian Coalition, questioned Vinroot's
commitment to the anti-abortion cause.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vinroot now says he opposes abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother, he and his wife
once made small contributions to Planned Parenthood. He says he did
not realize at the time that the group performed abortions at its
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it did not matter much that Easley and Vinroot were
not the favorites of their respective party organizations. Both ran
aggressive television advertising campaigns, and they did not
suffer for making fewer public appearances than their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-style politics may not work as well as it used to,
meaning going county to county and shaking hands with a lot of
people,'' said Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``The new politics of raising
money and paying for your media and looking good on TV worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley, a former prosecutor who is considered a moderate, made
it clear in his victory speech on Tuesday night that he would make
education a centerpiece of his campaign against Vinroot. ``To those
who seek to dismantle public education by risky schemes of
vouchers, let me be clear,'' he said. ``I will fight you every step
of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot, who ran as more of a conservative this year than in his
unsuccessful 1996 gubernatorial primary race, asserted that Easley
``won by promising to spend more of your money.'' Vinroot has taken
a pledge against raising taxes, but Beyle and other political
observers predicted that the state's deepening fiscal problems and
the dynamics of the campaign would force him to move toward the
center and reconsider his position on taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The presidential race is also expected to have a significant
impact on the fall campaign. Republicans are counting on a strong
showing by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, their presumptive nominee,
to pull Vinroot to victory. Bush is heavily favored to win North
Carolina, but the size of a Bush victory could be crucial to
Vinroot's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush is a really strong candidate, if he's winning
at the level of Reagan in '84 or Nixon in '72, Easley can hang it
up,'' said Ted Arrington, the chairman of the political science
department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ``If
George is more like his father or Bob Dole, there's a good chance
that Mike Easley will be our next governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana on Tuesday, Rep. David McIntosh won the Republican
nomination for governor. He will challenge the Democratic
incumbent, Frank O'Bannon.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Taverner sat near the window of his East Side
hotel room, calmly if unsmilingly cooperating as a photographer
tried to frame him in the afternoon light. Tall and thin, with long
blond locks that cascade onto his shoulders and a deep tan acquired
in Greece, where he spends much of his time, the recently knighted
English composer gazed into the lens without decipherable emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look like someone from another century,'' the photographer
remarked between shots. And in a way that's exactly what Taverner
would like to be.
</P>
<P>
   He is, on the one hand, a composer whose serene sacred works
have won him an enormous popular following in recent years. Yet in
his view Western civilization generally, and its music in
particular, have been heading in the wrong direction at least since
the Renaissance, possibly longer. He has been trying to put things
right. It's not that he has rejected the last four centuries of
musical evolution: his work would not be mistaken for anything
other than modern post-atonal music. But since his conversion to
the Russian Orthodox faith 23 years ago, he has sought musical and
philosophical roots in ancient musical traditions ranging from
Byzantine chants to Indian ragas to American Indian music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken me years to really understand what tradition
is,'' he said, ``and to explain it to anyone else is difficult.
People call it different things. In Islam, the Sufis call it `the
eye of the heart.' St. Augustine defined it as `the intellective
organ of the heart.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different way of thinking about writing music. I used
to fret over manuscripts and think, `What am I going to do?' Now
it's a question of going very quiet, emptying my mind of
preconceived ideas and seeing what happens. It's not so much a
question of finding my voice as finding the voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Taverner is to conduct a retrospective of his works at the
Church of St. Ignatius Loyolain Manhattan Thursday night at 8. The
performers include the Tallis Scholars; the Flux Ensemble; the
Juilliard Brass Ensemble; Patricia Rozario, a soprano who has
recorded several of his vocal works; and Paul McCartney, who has
known Taverner since 1970, when the Beatles' Apple Records label
released two albums of his music. Taverner is to narrate ``In the
Month of Athyr,'' a setting of a poem by the Greek poet Constantine
Cavafy. The concert will be broadcast live by WNYC (93.9 FM) as
well as on its Web site, www.wnyc.org.
</P>
<P>
   Taverner's appearances in New York have been rare. He attended
the New York premiere of his popular cello concerto, ``The
Protecting Veil,'' in 1993. But when the Greek Orthodox
Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity presented an
all-Taverner concert last year, the composer said that his doctor
prohibited him from trans-Atlantic travel because of his health.
His presence is not a sign that his health has improved; this time
the invitation came with a ticket for the Concorde, which cut his
travel time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have doesn't get better,'' said the 56-year-old
composer, who is married and has two children. ``It's called Marfan
syndrome, and it attacks the main valve to the heart, it attacks
the eyes, it attacks the mind _ there isn't much it doesn't attack.
And the big danger of Marfan is that you can suffer a rupture at
any time, and you go quickly. So I suppose I live with the thought
of death very much in front of me, and this may well have a bearing
on the way I think generally.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not, however, explain his fascination with religion,
which predates the discovery about 14 years ago that he has the
congenital disease. The interest in religion, he said, began when
he was 12 and heard a broadcast of Stravinsky's ``Canticum Sacrum''
from the Basilica of St. Mark's in Venice. Several of his early
works, like ``The Whale'' (1968), which is about the biblical story
of Jonah, the ``Celtic'' Requiem (1969) and the a cappella ``Nomine
Jesu'' (1970), have sacred underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   But he composed those works in his comparatively secular
mid-20s, a time when he was celebrated as a hot newcomer on the
London compositional scene. He had recently completed studies at
the Royal Academy of Music and had started on a conducting career
that included a performance of Verdi's ``Trovatore'' at Covent
Garden when he was 24. By the early 1970s, though, he had begun
searching for a sense of religious stability. An interest in
Russian and Greek Orthodox icons, which he encountered at an
exhibition of religious art in London, led him to explore the
church's theology, and he formally converted in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   This was not, at first, good for his composing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I joined the Orthodox Church,'' he said, ``the archbishop
asked me to make a setting of the liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clever of him, because first of all, it helped me
get to know the liturgy really well. But it brought me up against a
real compositional crisis because the congregation came up and
said, `You don't know anything about the sacred tone systems' and,
`This is just your own fabricated music.' I began thinking that
maybe they're right, maybe everything I'd done up till then was a
complete waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That brought me headlong into the whole concept of tradition.
I stopped composing, and I listened to Indian music, Persian music,
all music from the Middle East. I listened to American Indian
music. I listened to any music that was based on traditional ideas.
That's when I started to question what on earth happened to this
Western civilization and why the sacred seems to have been pushed
out gradually by the domination of the ego.''
</P>
<P>
   His study of ancient, durable musical forms led him to develop a
style that, it turned out, was perfectly suited to a part of the
new-music world that was taking shape in the mid-1980s. Like the
music of Arvo Part, Giya Kancheli and others of the Eastern
European mystical school, his works tend to be slow-moving and
intense, and in an eclectic, accessible language. Recordings of
works like ``The Protecting Veil'' sold plentifully.
</P>
<P>
   Because he no longer sees a point in writing entirely secular
music, his instrumental works, which include several concertos and
three string quartets, have what he calls a metaphysical subtext.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't important for listeners to know what these subtexts
are,'' he said. ``Only I have to know. I have to have in mind what
the text would be if the work had one. But people can make of it
what they want. When `The Protecting Veil' had its premiere, one
letter that touched me the most was from a young girl who asked if
in that piece I was protecting unfashionable values like truth and
beauty. Well, the protecting veil is associated with a feast in the
Orthodox Church, but if people hear something else, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, his music is vocal or choral, and although the
texts are not always overtly religious _ he has set poetry of
William Blake and Sappho, for example _ his music tends to cast
them in devotional light. That, it turns out, is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the works on the program Thursday night, ``A New
Beginning,'' was commissioned for a performance at the Millennium
Dome in London during the final moments of 1999. The text was
composed by committee and includes a list of wishes for the future
_ ``Respect for the earth, peace in the world, forgiveness of past
wrongs, a new start.'' At first glance, Taverner found it too
platitudinous and vague to set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked: `Who is this addressed to? Couldn't I at least put an
Oh Lord at the end of each one?''' he said. ``Well, they didn't
want to offend atheists, but in the end they agreed that for
musical purposes it might be best. Anyway, by the time it got to
midnight, everyone was so drunk and there was such a ludicrous
party mood that the piece had very little effect. So I regard the
performance here as the world premiere.''
</P>
<P>
   What, a visitor wondered, do those in the Orthodox Church who
disliked his early liturgical setting think of his current work? Do
they think he has learned to write sacred music?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think so,'' he said with a quiet laugh. ``But I'm very
grateful to them for being so miserable and mean. Because of that,
I've found a completely angstless way of writing music. And the
music really does appear to spring from somewhere else. I can't
tell you where _ I just don't know.''

 &HT;    Candidates mixing up a political melting pot
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a sense of how blurred distinctions have become in
the century's first political campaign, consider these items from
the past week or so:
</P>
<P>
   Chatting with reporters aboard Air Force Two, Vice President Al
Gore said his instinct in choosing a running mate was to ``build
consensus'' and reach out to someone different than himself. It
wasn't likely, he cautioned, but he wouldn't even rule out choosing
a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush campaigned in Ohio with four sympathetic
Democrats from the Texas Legislature. Then he met with Democratic
Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who shares some of his views on
privatization, before announcing his Social Security plan. Gore has
attacked this as a ``secret plan'' to wreck the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Gore met Sunday with Sen. John McCain to talk
about campaign finance reform. McCain has publicly blasted Gore on
both Social Security and campaign finance reform, but he gave the
vice president 20 minutes of his time, and he still hasn't arranged
a meeting with Bush. (Gore-McCain? Bush-Kerrey? The ticket
possibilities are endless, once you allow interleague play.)
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no big surprise, all this considered, that in
a poll released last week by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the
Press, Politics and Public Policy, voters knew less about where
Bush and Gore stand on the issues than they did two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   And get this: Lawyers from Kenneth Starr's law firm, Kirk and
Ellis, have contributed more than $32,000 to Hillary Clinton's New
York Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, surely, the time will come when Bush and Gore will begin
to sharpen the edges a little and define themselves, so the voters
can again remember which is from Texas and which is from Tennessee.
The great battle at this point is for the loosely affiliated
middle, and neither party has done much to activate its base,
unless fund-raisers count as pep rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But when the parties nominate two presidential candidates more
like each other than any of the rivals they faced in their own
party's primaries _ boomer sons of politicians, centrist
Southerners _ a degree of fuzziness is inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At their heart, these are not partisan issues,'' Gore said in
Atlanta on Tuesday, in a policy speech on crime. The same could be
said of several core issues in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore proceeded to blast Bush, but even the way the
candidates attack each other avoids making a point of any
fundamental differences.
</P>
<P>
   Gore accuses Bush of not doing enough as governor about crime,
education, or whatever. Bush likes to accuse Gore of copying him:
``Gore Travels to Texas to Embrace Bush's Education Reforms,'' was
the headline on Bush's Web site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to some of the phony line-drawing of recent
campaigns, the ooziness of this one may not be such a bad thing.
The danger is that without partisan differences to define the
debate, the argument will grow increasingly personal.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a certain risk for both candidates that in sounding
so much like the other, voters start hankering for someone who
doesn't. But to judge by Pat Buchanan's lack of headway, that
hasn't happened yet. So far, the voters like what their candidate
is saying _ if they can just remember which one it is.

<P>
   Jonathan Teller resorted to an appeal to the chairman of Bell
Atlantic. Denise Klarquist lost her telephone service entirely.
Bill Hipps sent letters to his local newspaper. For weeks James
Williams couldn't figure out why he was dropped at precisely the
same time every night.
</P>
<P>
   They are strangers to one another, living different lives
thousands of miles apart. Yet they have the same problem: all were
thwarted in their attempts to establish and maintain DSL service in
their homes. All four reached levels of vexation that they did not
know were possible when dealing with their local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting a phone company to fill an order and install DSL
may seem to be a major hurdle. But for these subscribers, getting
their orders filled was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   For them, and for many others, the real nightmare of DSL began
after the installation. That's when customers can experience a
range of problems, from misconfigured software to widespread
service outages.
</P>
<P>
   Demand continues to swell for DSL, or digital subscriber line,
service, a form of high-speed Internet connection that is becoming
as familiar a term to the online world as http. By the end of this
year, said Fritz McCormick, an analyst at the Yankee Group, there
will be 900,000 DSL subscribers in the United States and more than
double that number by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But DSL, as a new technology, is bound to have unexpected
hiccups. Add to that the huge demand for the service, mix in a lot
of competitive fervor on the part of the local phone companies and
dozens of other DSL providers, and you have a recipe for a genuine
mess.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed Internet connections via cable modems, which
currently outsell DSL, have their share of problems, too. But many
of the complaints about cable modems focus on the slowdowns that
occur when the connection is shared by multiple customers.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of DSL is that it delivers fast Web connections to
homes and small businesses over ordinary telephone lines. DSL users
can make or receive calls on the same lines used to connect to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One customer whose patience wore thin is Bill Hipps. ``My take
on the whole situation is probably that the DSL industry is growing
too fast,'' he said, ``and that the technology hasn't been tested
enough with all the volume and variables.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly nine months, Hipps, a software developer in Salt Lake
City, has had DSL service from U S West.net. Half the time he has
had ``really great service,'' he said, and the rest of the time he
has been unable to get a connection. At one point, he said, his
service was down for a month, and none of the dozens of customer
service representatives he spoke with could help.
</P>
<P>
   Hipps had all but given up. When he wanted a reliable
connection, he used his old dial-up connection. It was slow, 56
kilobits per second, but not nearly so fickle.
</P>
<P>
   Hipps likened his predicament to being in an abusive
relationship. ``When I could get on my computer, and things were
working properly, it was great, it was fast,'' he said. ``But you
never knew if that guy was going to come home drunk and slap you
around a little bit. You never knew what to expect when you sat
down to the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the problem lay with a computer at U S
West.net. The problem was fixed, and for now at least, Hipps is a
happy customer. ``I'm kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop,''
he said. ``It won't surprise me if I turn on my computer and it
doesn't work again.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, for every dissatisfied customer around the country,
there are many others who couldn't be happier with DSL. ``The vast
majority of our customers are just thrilled with it,'' said Mike
McLeland, vice president of operations at SBC Advanced Solutions, a
subsidiary of SBC Communications, a regional phone company that
provides DSL service in 13states. McLeland is downright sanguine
about the situation. ``Managing growth is a great problem to
have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SBC has promised to make DSL available to 80 percent of its
telephone customers by the end of 2002 through an accelerated $6
billion effort called Project Pronto. The company already has
201,000 subscribers with service up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Further, McLeland said, SBC is ``well down the path'' in
achieving what he called the ``five 9's'' network: DSL service that
is up and running 99.999 percent of the time. Bell Atlantic said it
currently had its service up about 99.5 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Teller, an Internet consultant in New York City, has trouble
believing those numbers. One day late last month, his service went
down, and no amount of tinkering with his computer's settings could
bring the connection back.
</P>
<P>
   After days of calling customer support in vain, Teller sent a
letter via Federal Express to Bell Atlantic's chairman, Ivan
Seidenberg. He got a phone call from someone on the company's
presidential appeals team, who conferred an elevated status to his
``trouble ticket.'' When he called customer support after that,
Teller said, ``a supervisor would say, `Oh, wow, you have a
presidential appeals ticket.''' But he added, ``They'd be really
impressed, but it wouldn't get me anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen days and countless telephone calls after his service
went out, Teller said, he received a call from a Bell Atlantic
networking expert, perhaps the one remaining person at the company
he had not yet spoken with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung up, then called back a few minutes later and said,
`Try it now,''' Teller recalled. The connection was back. As it
turned out, the company had upgraded some hardware and the settings
on his account needed a simple tweak.
</P>
<P>
   Teller has since switched service providers, to a company called
ACE DSL, but he had some trouble getting Bell Atlantic to process
his request.
</P>
<P>
   When they hear stories like Teller's, Bell Atlantic officials
acknowledge their unhappiness with the current quality of service.
``We are absolutely not satisfied,'' said Myles Mendelsohn, vice
president and general manager of Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions,
the Internet service provider for Bell Atlantic. ``Bell Atlantic is
addressing it as aggressively as they can.'' The company has added
600 people to its maintenance, technical support and sales force
and has ``teams working around the clock to address issues that
impact customers,'' said Joan Rasmussen, a Bell Atlantic
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic appears to have the biggest share of DSL glitches
_ enough, that is, to inspire a lawsuit. Filed in New York state
Supreme Court in February on behalf of seven dissatisfied
customers, the lawsuit accuses the company of deceptive advertising
and breach of warranty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promote their product by saying it's fast, easy to
install and reliable, but it's none of those things,'' said Mark S.
Kaufman, a lawyer in New York who is representing the plaintiffs.
``In fact, it's a beta product. They're basically distributing a
beta product before it's final and ready for mass consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has responded with a motion to dismiss the case,
arguing that customers clicked on an ``I accept'' button during
installation, thereby agreeing to all service terms, including a
disclaimer of any warranty for error-free service.
</P>
<P>
   Enough Bell Atlantic subscribers are in high dudgeon that an
independent noncommercial Web site called Bell Watch 2000 has
sprung up in recent weeks. The site is a repository for both
complaints and praise from Bell Atlantic subscribers; it also
provides tips for visitors to the site that include contact numbers
at Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not our desire to sling mud at Bell Atlantic,'' the site
says. ``We want this great corporation to understand that their
success should mean that new technology should work properly before
it's foisted upon the public.''

MCCAIN WOULD SEEK TO CAP `BIG DIG' APPROPRIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the prospect that Boston's ``Big Dig''
highway renovation project could ultimately cost $20 billion,
Senator John McCain says he is ready to push legislation to bar
Congress from approving another dime for the project.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona Republican who wields enormous power over the
project as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation, cited estimates of the Big Dig's final price
that have spiraled from $2.6 billion in 1985 to $13.6 billion last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that kind of trend continues, we're talking about $20
billion, and that kind of overrun is unbelievable,'' McCain said
during a hearing on the Big Dig's financial crisis. ``I think the
taxpayers deserve a law that says at some point this has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved about $8.5 billion in federal funds for
the project, of which $5 billion has been spent. The remainder of
the cost is paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who blasted federal highway authorities, Big Dig
officials, and private contractors for their ``complete and utter
failure'' in handling numerous aspects of the budget debacle, said
he would consider seeking the spending cap despite assurances from
state officials that Massachusetts will seek no additional federal
aid for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our problem, and we're going to fix it,'' the Big Dig's
new chief, Andrew Natsios, told McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, a senior Democrat on the committee, said
during the hearing that the Massachusetts congressional delegation
also has pledged to request no more federal money for the Big Dig,
the nation's most costly public works project.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry noted that congressional leaders, who have given numerous
signs that they have lost all patience with the venture's
exorbitant cost increases, would likely kill any effort to seek
additional dollars in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect there is a cap already because no one in the US
Congress is going to vote for giving us more money ever again,''
Kerry said. ``Maybe the Massachusetts delegation might, but we are
going to be roundly beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain, during an exchange with US Transportation Secretary
Rodney E. Slater, underscored his intention to consider a law to
prevent additional federal spending on the Big Dig. When Slater
appeared to balk at a cap, saying, ``At the end of the day, we may
do that,'' McCain snapped back, ``At the beginning of the day, we
may do it with an amendment to an appropriations bill.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later left open the possibility that he would settle for
a written agreement, which Slater, Kerry, and Natsios appeared to
favor, rather than a new law.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called the hearing in response to a scathing federal task
force report last month that said former Big Dig officials had
intentionally concealed the cost overruns from federal oversight
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which included 34 recommendations to restore the
project's integrity, prompted Governor Paul Cellucci to fire the
project's former chief, James J. Kerasiotes, and join state
legislative leaders in trying to craft a massive bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the report followed more than two dozen reviews by
federal agencies and the state auditor that were ``routinely
ignored'' before the budget crisis became public.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among McCain's complaints was the failure of Big Dig
officials to require private contractors to pay financial penalties
for any role they may have played in the budget overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some penalty,'' McCain told Matthew Wiley,
project manager for the Big Dig's prime management contractors,
Bechtel and Parsons Brinckerhoff. ``I don't know many places in the
world that would submit or accept this kind of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley defended the joint venture's performance, saying the
contractors properly responded to factors that drove up the Big
Dig's costs, primarily the project's wider scope. ``We have done a
good job of managing that project,'' Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kenneth Mead, the US Transportation Department's
inspector general, criticized the Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff team
for not informing his office of the unexpected cost increases as
Kerasiotes and his staff allegedly withheld them from federal
highway officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that I didn't hear anything from Bechtel
about these costs increases,'' Mead said during the hearing. ``With
600 people, I would assume that some of them must have had a clue
about where some of the costs were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said the contractors expressed concern last year to the
Big Dig's state officials and were told that the overrun was offset
in part by nearly $1 billion in credits from the project's
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general and federal task force later ruled that
Big Dig officials had improperly used the insurance funds as budget
offsets. The insurance funds, which should have been returned to
the federal government, were used to invest in Disney stock, bonds
and other securities, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Kerry, Richard Thomas, senior vice
president of the Big Dig's insurer, American International Group,
said the funds at issue had grown unusually large because the
insurance company has paid claims totaling less than 20 percent of
the premiums the Big Dig has paid.
</P>
<P>
   When the inspector general first criticized the Big Dig's
insurance program, Kerasiotes and a top aide, Patrick Moynihan,
vehemently disputed the findings. McCain cited a letter that
Moynihan sent Mead last year, saying the findings were the product
of ``a backward-looking management technique that is unworkable and
shows a fundamental lack of understanding how a multimillion-dollar
megaproject needs to be managed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said of the letter: ``It's a degree of arrogance I don't
think I've experienced before.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who
serves on the panel, said he also is investigating the Big Dig as
chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works. ``I
urge the secretary of transportation and other members of Congress
to join me in ensuring that no federal funds above the existing
formula are spent on these cost overrurns,'' Smith said.

 UNDATED: the public. '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The greatest source of annoyance is the level of customer
support or, as many companies now label it, customer care.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies and other DSL service providers need hundreds of
customer service representatives to handle the flood of inquiries
and service and repair requests, so they are retraining and hiring
workers. Along with the shortage of trained personnel has come a
lack of efficiency and, some say, a lack of competence.
</P>
<P>
   Some frustrated DSL subscribers have even taken to logging the
number of fruitless hours they spend on the phone with customer
support employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hipps said he had racked up 65 hours, acquainting himself with
every aspect of U S West's customer support hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   James Williams, a police officer in Philadelphia, is all too
familiar with Bell Atlantic's customer support. Williams said he
had encountered three serious problems since he first got his DSL
service three months ago. With each problem, he said, he talked to
a minimum of five people.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Williams became something of a DSL expert. He
tosses around DSL jargon as if he invented it. Terms like DSlam
(digital subscriber line access multiplexer, the equipment that
sends data into a bigger data pipe), CO (central office, the place
where the switching equipment resides) and throughput (transmission
speed) trip off his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, who prefers to do his Web surfing before dawn,
would gladly have traded all that knowledge for a cure for his
strangest problem. At least twice a week at 4:30 ``on the dot,'' he
said, his service went down. ``I took that as my cue to go to
bed,'' he said. Williams was assured that the service was not being
taken down for routine maintenance. The problem has been fixed, but
its cause remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Trying times call for creative measures.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has taken to dispatching technicians to customers'
homes. ``If all the basic things we do can't help us nail it down,
we'll send someone out with a laptop,'' Mendelsohn said. By using
the company's computer instead of the customer's, the technician
can determine whether the problem is with a setting in the
customer's computer or with the DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to have technicians come to the house _ until it
begins to look as though they may never leave.
</P>
<P>
   Klarquist, marketing director for a market research firm in San
Francisco, ordered DSL service from Pacific Bell, which is owned by
SBC, at the end of March. The installer arrived at 4:30 one
afternoon and stayed until 9 p.m. trying to get her service up and
running. ``It worked for about 5 or 10 seconds, then it didn't work
at all,'' she said. That went on all evening. ``Every time
something came up, he said, `Gee, I've never seen that before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Klarquist said she had considered offering him a beer but
thought better of it. ``I thought that would probably really mess
him up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several days passed and she still had no service. She devoted
hours to calling the customer support line. Then she came home one
day to find that all telephone service to her house had been
obliterated, and she was forced to make all calls from her cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, her phone service was restored, and when a
friend stopped by for a visit, she asked him to take a look at her
DSL setup. ``He said, `I think I can figure this out,' and within
20 minutes it was up and running, she recalled. As it turned out, a
Web browser setting needed to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, Klarquist has DSL service, ``but no thanks to
Pacific Bell,'' she said. ``Now every time I see a PacBell Internet
commercial, I feel like drop-kicking my television.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration runs both ways, of course. ``We've seen, as you
can imagine, everything under the sun,'' said Mendelsohn, of Bell
Atlantic. ``People who've moved jacks and plugged into the wrong
line, and customers installing other software. All of that fouls up
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the explosion in demand, SBC, Bell Atlantic and
other companies are moving toward having customers do their own
installations _ the DSL provider simply sends customers the
hardware and software they need to do it themselves. Eighty-five
percent of Bell Atlantic's DSL customers handle their own
installations, and SBC plans to start offering the option by May. U
S West has offered customer installation since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution being considered by Bell Atlantic and others is
remote diagnoses of customers' computer setups. That is, each
support technician, with the customer's permission, is given remote
access to the customer's computer to check settings and other
potential causes of a snag.
</P>
<P>
   And one novel approach to the shortage of customer service
technicians is to let technicians work from home. Telocity, a
broadband provider in Cupertino, Calif., that uses DSL, has hired
100 part-time customer support employees in the Chicago area.
Instead of requiring them to work in large call centers, the
company routes calls to the employees' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provide the computer, two phone lines and a quiet
professional environment,'' said Jim Rohrer, Telocity's customer
care officer. ``No barking dogs and no children in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohrer said he was convinced that this approach would attract a
higher caliber of employee. ``We're getting college-degreed folks
who would never come to work at a call center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the learning curve remains steep, and for some customers, it
is already too late. Earlier this month, Ajit Tharaken, a
programmer in Manhattan, canceled his DSL service from Bell
Atlantic after two months of spotty connections and ordered service
from a competing DSL carrier. ``When I canceled, they did not ask
me for my reasons for canceling,'' Tharaken said. ``I do not think
they care.''

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ Bob Bartels wanted to surprise his
bride-to-be with a honeymoon she'd never forget: a week of sun and
sand on a little-known Caribbean gem where deserted beaches are
lapped by azure waters.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised her, all right, but Wednesday he was wondering if a
contingent of U.S. Marines and a couple of Navy warships might
crash the party.
</P>
<P>
   Married on Sunday in Montgomery, Ala., the couple (botrh
Alabamians, he's from Auburn, she's from Dothan) arrived on Vieques
Monday, just as a showdown between the U.S. government and
protestors camped out on a Navy bombing range appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out when we got to the San Juan airport,'' said
Bartels' bride, Andrea, 28. ``He showed me a newspaper and I said,
'Oh my God, we're going to a war zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the couple found Vieques to be all Bartels promised:
quaint, laid-back, stunningly beautiful and filled with friendly
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just adds a little bit of excitement in addition to the
basic honeymoon,'' Bob Bartels said, as the couple stopped to see a
clump of protestors gathered outside the main gate to the bombing
range. ``We'll keep the newspaper clippings and have a little more
to remember it by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels _ formerly a public relations executive with Fitzgerald
and Co. in Atlanta, and now an employee of the Public Utility
Commission of Texas in Austin _ booked the honeymoon months ago. He
had visited Vieques once, and fell in love with the tiny island,
where horses and cows sometimes graze along the narrow roads that
wind through the hilly countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a hidden treasure,'' he said. ``Let everybody else
go to Jamaica and St. Thomas. We've got the beach to ourselves
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels, 30, had heard about the long-simmering controversy over
the bombing range, and grew a little worried as the wedding drew
near and news reports said the conflict was heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before the wedding, a friend told me he had seen news
about Vieques on CNN,'' he said. ``That got me a little worried, so
I made a few calls and decided it shouldn't be too much of a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he told both sets of parents to keep them from
worrying, he kept the trip a secret from Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept dropping hints about it,'' she said. ``I kept thinking
there might be a hurricane or a problem with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no signs of federal agents or U.S.
Marines, although a couple of giant Navy ships have been patrolling
the waters off Vieques and military helicopters sometimes beat
through the otherwise clear Caribbean sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really won't affect us,'' Bartels said. ``We're still
having a great time. The beaches are still beautiful and the
weather is incredible.''

   Married on Sunday in Montgomery, Ala., the couple (botrh
Alabamians, he's from Auburn, she's from Dothan) arrived on Vieques
Monday, just as a showdown between the U.S. government and
protestors camped out on a Navy bombing range appeared imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out when we got to the San Juan airport,'' said
Bartels' bride, Andrea, 28. ``He showed me a newspaper and I said,
'Oh my God, we're going to a war zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the couple found Vieques to be all Bartels promised:
quaint, laid-back, stunningly beautiful and filled with friendly
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just adds a little bit of excitement in addition to the
basic honeymoon,'' Bob Bartels said, as the couple stopped to see a
clump of protestors gathered outside the main gate to the bombing
range. ``We'll keep the newspaper clippings and have a little more
to remember it by.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels _ formerly a public relations executive with Fitzgerald
and Co. in Atlanta, and now an employee of the Public Utility
Commission of Texas in Austin _ booked the honeymoon months ago. He
had visited Vieques once, and fell in love with the tiny island,
where horses and cows sometimes graze along the narrow roads that
wind through the hilly countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a hidden treasure,'' he said. ``Let everybody else
go to Jamaica and St. Thomas. We've got the beach to ourselves
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartels, 30, had heard about the long-simmering controversy over
the bombing range, and grew a little worried as the wedding drew
near and news reports said the conflict was heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just before the wedding, a friend told me he had seen news
about Vieques on CNN,'' he said. ``That got me a little worried, so
I made a few calls and decided it shouldn't be too much of a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he told both sets of parents to keep them from
worrying, he kept the trip a secret from Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept dropping hints about it,'' she said. ``I kept thinking
there might be a hurricane or a problem with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no signs of federal agents or U.S.
Marines, although a couple of giant Navy ships have been patrolling
the waters off Vieques and military helicopters sometimes beat
through the otherwise clear Caribbean sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really won't affect us,'' Bartels said. ``We're still
having a great time. The beaches are still beautiful and the
weather is incredible.''

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - A nice retired couple like Rocky and
Midge Wahl should have known that being an honest, tax-paying
citizen doesn't give a person the right disregard U.S. foreign
policy. Recently, the Wahls absorbed the full force of the
government's wrath when they brazenly and in complete disregard for
long-standing immigration practices conspired to transport a young
Mexican couple across the international border _ legally. By E.J.

EMC CHIEF HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing demand for data storage devices could make EMC Corp. one
of the world's 10 most highly valued companies by 2010, EMC's chief
executive, Michael Ruettgers said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   EMC announced a two-for-one stock split, its sixth split since
1992. The record date for the new stock split will be May 19 and
the distribution date June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, EMC's shares have more than doubled on
increased sales of the heavy-duty computer disk-drive assemblies
and software it produces for corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Prime customers have been airlines and banks, though EMC has
begun marketing itself as an Internet infrastructure provider as
well. Last week in New York, it rolled out a new line of storage
devices. Wednesday, speaking in Southborough, Mass., after the
company's annual meeting, Ruettgers said the increasing importance
of data for communications and e-commerce applications would
continue to drive up EMC's market valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to agree that (a spot in) the top ten is likely,'' he
said, perhaps by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in EMC fell $2.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading
Wednesday to close at $136.25. That left EMC's market
capitalization _ its number of shares times its price per share _
at $142 billion, the 16th largest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The most highly valued company is General Electric Co., with a
market cap of $514 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers' forecast came as the Hopkinton, Mass. company has
increased its lead over competitors like IBM and Compaq Computer
Corp. in key data-storage market segments. Those companies are
seeking to recapture share, partly by offering equipment at lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   EMC's meeting was held in an empty manufacturing hall acquired
when EMC purchased Data General Corp. for about $1 billion in stock
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting drew about 2,000 shareholders, including many small
investors invited by the company as it tries to broaden its
ownership. Institutions now hold about 75 percent of the company,
down from 80 percent a year ago, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle facing the company, Ruettgers said, will be
to find, hire and train about 6,000 skilled employees EMC plans to
hire this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ruettgers said the company will continue its acquisitions,
buying software companies or companies that provide remote-storage
services. EMC also plans to increase overseas sales to 50 percent
of total revenue by 2003, from 40 percent today, he said.

MCCAIN WOULD SEEK TO CAP `BIG DIG' APPROPRIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the prospect that Boston's ``Big Dig''
highway renovation project could ultimately cost $20 billion,
Senator John McCain says he is ready to push legislation to bar
Congress from approving another dime for the project.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona Republican who wields enormous power over the
project as chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation, cited estimates of the Big Dig's final price
that have spiraled from $2.6 billion in 1985 to $13.6 billion last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that kind of trend continues, we're talking about $20
billion, and that kind of overrun is unbelievable,'' McCain said
during a hearing on the Big Dig's financial crisis. ``I think the
taxpayers deserve a law that says at some point this has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved about $8.5 billion in federal funds for
the project, of which $5 billion has been spent. The remainder of
the cost is paid by the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who blasted federal highway authorities, Big Dig
officials, and private contractors for their ``complete and utter
failure'' in handling numerous aspects of the budget debacle, said
he would consider seeking the spending cap despite assurances from
state officials that Massachusetts will seek no additional federal
aid for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our problem, and we're going to fix it,'' the Big Dig's
new chief, Andrew Natsios, told McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, a senior Democrat on the committee, said
during the hearing that the Massachusetts congressional delegation
also has pledged to request no more federal money for the Big Dig,
the nation's most costly public works project.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry noted that congressional leaders, who have given numerous
signs that they have lost all patience with the venture's
exorbitant cost increases, would likely kill any effort to seek
additional dollars in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect there is a cap already because no one in the US
Congress is going to vote for giving us more money ever again,''
Kerry said. ``Maybe the Massachusetts delegation might, but we are
going to be roundly beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain, during an exchange with US Transportation Secretary
Rodney E. Slater, underscored his intention to consider a law to
prevent additional federal spending on the Big Dig. When Slater
appeared to balk at a cap, saying, ``At the end of the day, we may
do that,'' McCain snapped back, ``At the beginning of the day, we
may do it with an amendment to an appropriations bill.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later left open the possibility that he would settle for
a written agreement, which Slater, Kerry, and Natsios appeared to
favor, rather than a new law.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called the hearing in response to a scathing federal task
force report last month that said former Big Dig officials had
intentionally concealed the cost overruns from federal oversight
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which included 34 recommendations to restore the
project's integrity, prompted Governor Paul Cellucci to fire the
project's former chief, James J. Kerasiotes, and join state
legislative leaders in trying to craft a massive bailout plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the report followed more than two dozen reviews by
federal agencies and the state auditor that were ``routinely
ignored'' before the budget crisis became public.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among McCain's complaints was the failure of Big Dig
officials to require private contractors to pay financial penalties
for any role they may have played in the budget overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some penalty,'' McCain told Matthew Wiley,
project manager for the Big Dig's prime management contractors,
Bechtel and Parsons Brinckerhoff. ``I don't know many places in the
world that would submit or accept this kind of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley defended the joint venture's performance, saying the
contractors properly responded to factors that drove up the Big
Dig's costs, primarily the project's wider scope. ``We have done a
good job of managing that project,'' Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kenneth Mead, the US Transportation Department's
inspector general, criticized the Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff team
for not informing his office of the unexpected cost increases as
Kerasiotes and his staff allegedly withheld them from federal
highway officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that I didn't hear anything from Bechtel
about these costs increases,'' Mead said during the hearing. ``With
600 people, I would assume that some of them must have had a clue
about where some of the costs were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley said the contractors expressed concern last year to the
Big Dig's state officials and were told that the overrun was offset
in part by nearly $1 billion in credits from the project's
insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general and federal task force later ruled that
Big Dig officials had improperly used the insurance funds as budget
offsets. The insurance funds, which should have been returned to
the federal government, were used to invest in Disney stock, bonds
and other securities, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Kerry, Richard Thomas, senior vice
president of the Big Dig's insurer, American International Group,
said the funds at issue had grown unusually large because the
insurance company has paid claims totaling less than 20 percent of
the premiums the Big Dig has paid.
</P>
<P>
   When the inspector general first criticized the Big Dig's
insurance program, Kerasiotes and a top aide, Patrick Moynihan,
vehemently disputed the findings. McCain cited a letter that
Moynihan sent Mead last year, saying the findings were the product
of ``a backward-looking management technique that is unworkable and
shows a fundamental lack of understanding how a multimillion-dollar
megaproject needs to be managed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said of the letter: ``It's a degree of arrogance I don't
think I've experienced before.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who
serves on the panel, said he also is investigating the Big Dig as
chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works. ``I
urge the secretary of transportation and other members of Congress
to join me in ensuring that no federal funds above the existing
formula are spent on these cost overrurns,'' Smith said.

  Ex-Marine finds calm in hobby 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Optional fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take much to recognize someone who has been bitten by
the quilting bug. Hazel Wetts sees such a person in Ollie Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people golf and some people bowl,'' says Wetts,
co-chairwoman of the Quilting in the Valley 2000 show this weekend
at Cal State Northridge. ``Ollie quilts.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he does.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, a 73-year-old former U.S. Marine and the only man in the
175-member Valley Quiltmakers Guild, has completed 20 queen- or
king- sized quilts in three years. The talented and prolific North
Hollywood resident calls the activity an ideal form of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll be sewing at 3 in the afternoon until 3 a.m.
the next morning,'' says Norman. ``I don't care to watch TV. There
ain't much worth watching anyway. I can turn the radio on to some
music and sew all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   One look inside Norman's home and you know he's not lying.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the completed quilts _ big, bright colorful
pieces exemplifying techniques Norman rattles off: ``stack and
whack,'' ``double wedding rings'' and ``square-in-a-square.'' Then,
there are the scraps and pieces _ some kept in an empty pizza box _
that will one day be stitched together with other pieces to become
a quilt. Norman also uses these pieces for informational patches on
the backs of finished works, which describe the quilt's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a quilt, you should always have a record of that
quilt,'' says Norman with a laugh. ``All of mine do.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the full bolts of fabric, crammed onto the
shelves in the tiny room where Norman does his sewing. Norman's
collection comes from quilt shops both existing and defunct. He
gets his materials from anyplace handy. Once he cut a slice off an
old abandoned couch he discovered in a parking lot near Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Norman plans to work at the quilt show this weekend. He'll also
have at least one of his works displayed. He might have had more,
but a ruptured appendix sent him to the hospital for 11 days and an
on-the-mend Norman is still not at full-stitching strength. Once he
has fully recuperated, he'll get to work on making drapes for his
home.
</P>
<P>
   You might say the Tennessee-born and -bred Norman has sewing in
his blood. His mother sewed, and he learned as a child by observing
his two older sisters. When he joined the Marines, a sewing machine
was his ticket to some spare cash, since he could ``cut out a shirt
and sew chevrons on it like nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   But quilting is a relatively new hobby. He started three years
ago after buying his granddaughter a sewing machine and some books
in an effort to try to get her interested in the hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she take to the craft, she turned Norman on to it
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Hey, Gramps, you ought to try it. It's good
therapy,''' recalled Norman. ``It's !ital!very good therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, and if Norman's output is any indication, he is
one of the most calm and sane people alive. Norman is never without
a project under construction or completed. He gives most of his
quilts away, to family members _ including one to his mother who
celebrates her 101st birthday in July _ friends, and even
strangers. Norman says he gave one woman a quilt simply because he
felt she needed one.
</P>
<P>
   Wetts says Norman is one of the guild's less talkative members,
though he is a fixture at their monthly meetings. His productivity
isn't unusual, says Wetts, although most of the guild members tend
to work on slightly smaller projects _ baby blankets and wall
hangings, instead of bedspreads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got talent,'' Wetts says of Norman, ``and we all
appreciate his quilts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Norman appreciates the guild. The quilters have been nothing
but concerned and sympathetic since his hospital stay, and Norman
has developed a particular friendship with the guild's oldest
member, 92-year-old Libby Landerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just one of the most beautiful groups of people I ever
met in my entire life,'' Norman says. &QL;

NEW GADGETS AND SITES: PORTABLE FAX AND COPIER; JEFFERSON'S PAPERS
ONLINE; VIDEO GLASSES; TUPPERWARE ONLINE AND CORBIS ADDS MORE
IMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age when gadgets let e-mail and the Web follow people
virtually everywhere, a portable fax machine and photocopier seems
like a quaint idea. But Dave Faulkner, product manager for Thomson
Multimedia, says business travelers are still addicted to paper. By
his calculations, at least, it's a costly habit. ``Most hotel
chains throughout the U.S. charge quite a bit of money to make
photocopies or send faxes,'' he said. ``It's a premium service.''
</P>
<P>
   The RCA Docuport, made by Thomson, is a way for business
travelers to bring the fax and photocopier along for the trip, and
it adds a scanner for good measure. With a thickness of just 1\
inches when folded and a length of 12 inches, the device should fit
into most briefcases or laptop cases. It contains a rechargeable
battery and also runs from standard wall outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The $299 portable office, however, does have some compromises.
At two and a half pages a minute, it is not the world's fastest
copier, and a maximum resolution of 400 dots per inch does not make
it the sharpest. To avoid in-flight disasters involving leaking ink
or toner cartridges, the Docuport uses special (and more expensive)
thermal imaging paper. But Faulkner says the current generation of
thermal paper is not as glossy as the older type, is substantially
thicker, doesn't curl and will go five years without fading.
</P>
<P>
   PAPERS OF JEFFERSON CAN BE VIEWED ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress is marking its bicentennial in part by
honoring Thomas Jefferson. Congress bought Jefferson's collection
of 6,487 books after the British burned the first Library of
Congress in 1814. (About two-thirds of Jefferson's books went up in
flames during another fire in 1851.)
</P>
<P>
   As one of its Jefferson projects, the Library has posted online
images of all its Jefferson papers, about 83,000 items, at
memory.loc.gov/ammem/mtjhtml/mtjhome.html.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said the library had the largest and most
comprehensive collection of Jefferson's papers. They are divided
into nine groups, including financial statements and drafts of the
Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The legibility of the aging, handwritten documents ``varies
substantially,'' the library notes.
</P>
<P>
   The images can be downloaded, and some have modern text
transcriptions.
</P>
<P>
   NEW VIDEO GAME GLASSES BLINK FOR YOU  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inveterate video game players now crave the kind of hard-edged
realism you can find only by sitting in your parents' basement,
staring at a monitor. Elsa Technologies has tried to introduce
another dimension into the video game experience with the 3-D
Revelator. The glasses use LCD shutters that open and close over
alternating eyes 120 times per second. That creates the mental
effect of seeing the video image from two angles. (If you look at
the 3-D image without using the glasses, it will appear slightly
out of register.)
</P>
<P>
   The 3-D Revelator works only with games that use the DirectX
platform. The glasses also require an nVidia graphics card and a
monitor that refreshes at least 100 times each second. The company
sells two models of the Revelator, a pair with wires that sells for
$55 and a wireless version, useful for when you get dizzy and fall
out of your chair, for $75. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BUYING TUPPERWARE ONLINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you covet a Tupperware Egg-ceptional Server set (``a stylish
server for deviled eggs and more'') but can't bear the thought of
sitting through an actual Tupperware party to buy one? Tupperware
now has a Web buying option. With a new service called
My.Tupperware.com, you can do business with your neighborhood
Tupperware representative while keeping your evenings free.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's new site, 75,000 U.S. sales representatives can
create personal home pages using preformatted designs. Besides
listing Tupperware parties and Tupperware bingos, the personal
pages can include Tupperware testimonials and recipes. If users
click through from the personal home pages to shop on Tupperware's
corporate e-commerce site, the sales representative receives the
usual 20 percent commission on everything they buy.
</P>
<P>
   Tupperware is not giving up on its usual sales method. ``We're
not looking to replace the party with anything else,'' said
Christine Hanneman, the company's vice president for financial
relations and treasury. ``We're looking to enhance it.''  &QR;
</P>
<P>
   CORBIS' ARCHIVE OF IMAGES WILL ADD CHRISTIE'S IMAGES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corbis, the image archive company owned by Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, is adding to its collection yet again. The
company announced Thursday that it planned to put online thousands
of digital images owned by Christie's, the art auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The Christie's images include all the works that have been sold
through the auction house in the last 20 years: more than 500,000
transparencies, ranging from Asian and African art to Old Master
paintings, and from modern and contemporary art to Hollywood
memorabilia. The non-exclusive licensing arrangement between the
two firms will provide Corbis' customers with a selection of those
images via www.corbis.com.
</P>
<P>
   Corbis, based in Seattle, already owns and licenses 65 million
images, including the Bettman Archive. Last June, the company
acquired Sygma, one of the world's largest news photography
agencies. Nonexclusive licensing agreements like the one announced
Thursday with Christie's already exist with the Ansel Adams
Publishing Rights Trust, the National Gallery of London and the
Hermitage in St. Petersburg. To date, Corbis has put some 2.1
million images online, which it sells to publishers and consumers
over the Internet.

NO HITCHCOCK TIRADES AFTER STARS' GAME 3 LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ To even remotely understand Ken Hitchcock,
and most of us are in that remote category, you first have to try
and understand Hitchisms. Take yesterday, as the Stars' coach was
describing the Game 3 loss to the Sharkies from the evening before.
</P>
<P>
   ``In desperate areas, they were a little stronger than we
were,'' he said, calmly, with an emphasis on calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Translation:
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the coach was mostly satisfied with his team's effort
and performance, much more so by the way, than the Game 2 win by
the Stars on Reunion ice.
</P>
<P>
   See there. Hitchcock doesn't just go off on his tirades, and go
off on his team, without what he considers valid reasons. The
definition of ``valid,'' however, has been and will be a continuing
debate between players and head coach.
</P>
<P>
   It is OK for the Stars to lose a game _ that's a game, not the
series _ because the other team got something special going and
deserved to win. The Sharks' ``something special'' on Tuesday night
applied to the feisty Owen Nolan, who raised his right hand and
once again repeated the Playoff Oath of Hockey:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am injured, but I am not hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being ``out for the series'' with various ailments,
Nolan's inspirational play, along with his toughness and his
game-winning goal, kept San Jose alive. The Sharks are down two
games to one as the wait for tomorrow night's Game 4 continues.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason San Jose rescued hope on Tuesday evening was
Steve Shields, who frankly played bigger and better in goal than
his resume indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Stars still have this conference semifinals
series right where they want it, and the only thing which could
change that would be a home-ice loss. The best player, by far, is
still Mike Modano, who also appears to be emerging as the league's
best player in the postseason. The best goalie, by far, is still
Eddie Belfour. And frankly, if there's any lingering negative
attached to the Game 3 loss, it's that the Stars felt jilted by
referees Don Van Massenhoven and Mark Faucette.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the second-period penalty situation for the Stars did
appear a tad fishy. And Mike Ricci's goal, tying the game for San
Jose, did come after Ricci let his hair down on Belfour in the
crease. A two-man advantage for the Sharks was nearly out of time
when Ricci hacked Belfour and then tipped in a shot from the point.
That one steamed the Stars, and Hitchcock still had to do some
tongue biting yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty that set up the five-on-three for the Sharks came on
a well-done ``dive'' by Shields to draw a goalie-interference
whistle against Blake Sloan. Whatever works, huh?
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Stars were whistled for five penalties in the second
period, and wore down physically because kill units were on the ice
so much. In fact, it was almost 10 consecutive minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to get into \Rthe officiating\S because I've got
to have a summer vacation, and I don't want to be paying fines for
what I might say,'' said Hitchcock, who has never been a candidate
for the Lindy Ruff Whine Award among NHL coaches. Because of this,
those of us who thought the Stars were simply outplayed in Game 3
felt obligated to lend an ear.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hitchcock referred to the second-period penalty binge as
a ``bizarre case,'' while also refusing to criticize his team for
undisciplined or retaliation tactics. ``If those had been involved,
which they weren't, you can take a stand on that,'' Hitchcock said.
``But the best way to say it is we played hard in the second
period, they played hard, and we got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had dominated in the first period in all areas, and
had a 1-0 lead after the opening 20 minutes. ``The idea was to come
out and build immediately on that, but there was no opportunity
because we had to kill penalties for the first 10 minutes,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been a first-period scene when Bryan Marchment
performed his speciality _ a cheap-shot hit, this time on Stars
rookie Roman Lyashenko. Marchment drew a penalty, but the power
play for Dallas was nullified as Scott Thornton skated hard at
Marchment after the whistle, and belted him with a high stick. ``I
didn't mind that at all,'' said Hitchcock, who usually does. `'It
was part of the game at that particular moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling over Van Massenhoven and Faucette was amplified
because those two had worked Game 3 in Edmonton, and the Stars,
despite a poor early effort in that one, had many of the same
complaints as Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest. None of this stuff really matters,
particularly since Shields had far more to do with the Sharks'
winning than whistle-happy refs. And even with a loss, if the
referees are all the Stars have to gripe about, then their on-ice
game was basically where it needed to be, and in this series' long
run, that's all that's necessary to move on to the next round.

CARDINAL O'CONNOR SAID NEAR DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, head of the New York
Archdiocese and one of the country's most outspoken Catholic
leaders, is close to dying, his spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know precisely when he will die...but I think it is
clear that he is, in Catholic terms, at the hour of his death,''
said spokesman Joe Zwilling.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who is 80, has weakened steadily since last August,
when he underwent an operation for a brain tumor. He has not
appeared in public since March 5, and even then he only spoke
briefly to his congregation at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and did not
read a sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time in the 16 years that he has led
the Archdiocese, he was unable to watch the Easter Parade from the
cathedral's steps.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said the cardinal's condition worsened Tuesday night.
O'Connor's sister, various other relatives, and fellow clergy have
been sitting with him _ three people at a time _ in his residence
behind St. Patrick's, but Zwilling said he was unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard F. Law flew to New York from Boston Wednesday
to be at his side. The two men have long been friends and
ideological allies. Law's spokesman, John Walsh, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They were made archbishop around the same time, raised to the
role of cardinal at the same time, and share geographical
proximity, similarities in outlook on the church, so they
gravitated to one another. There was a natural chemistry there, and
this relationship grew even closer during this very difficult
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Law has been one of several colleagues rumored to be a possible
successor to O'Connor. Other widely mentioned possibilities include
Bishop Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass. and Auxiliary Bishop
William Murphy of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, nobody outside the Vatican knows _ or talks about _
these things with any certainty. When his predecessor, Cardinal
Terence Cooke died, nobody guessed the replacement would be
O'Connor, who had been a bishop in Scranton, Pa., and, before that,
vicar of the US Armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was appointed to the archdiocese in 1984, and almost
instantly stirred up controversy by expressing Rome's views on
high-profile political issues in a far more outspoken manner than
his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Right away he publicly likened abortion to the Nazi Holocaust,
denounced homosexuality as a sin, and criticized Geraldine Ferraro
_ then a Queens congresswoman running as the Democratic vice
presidential candidate _ for supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   These were not uniformly popular positions to take in this
Archdiocese, which consits of 2.3 million Catholics in much of New
York City, its suburbs, and the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor defied easy categories, however, marching alongside
union workers, campaigning for a raise in the minimum wage, and
taking care _ often anonymously _ of dying patients in AIDS
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after a trip to Jerusalem, he played a major role in
persuading the Vatican to admit, and apologize for, its past record
of anti-Semitism. He became close friends with New York's Jewish
mayor of the time, Edward Koch _ the two even wrote a book
together.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been friendly with the current mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, who is Catholic. But, unlike Cardinal Francis Spellman,
who was called ``The Powerhouse'' when he ran the archdiocese from
1937 to 1967, O'Connor has never sought to play a role in the
city's political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade O'Connor has considerably softened the
confrontational stance of his early days and has been a popular
cardinal, though a less influential one than he may have been in an
earlier time. In Spellman's day, for instance, Irish Catholics
formed a big part of the city's power elite _ and every Cardinal,
since the archdiocese was founded, has been of Irish descent.
However, in recent years, the Irish have faded as a unified ethnic
bloc, and, apart from political considerations, a growing
percentage of the city's Catholics are now Hispanics, who feel
little connection to the man in St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has submitted his resignation to the Vatican for the
past five years, a motion consistently ignored. It was widely
believed the Pope would finally let him go last January, when
O'Connor turned 80 _ the age when Cardinals lose their voting
rights in the Vatican Council _ but he was kept on the job.

JUSTICE AFTER 20 YEARS FOR WOMAN'S MURDERER IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A murderous impulse on a Houston freeway almost 20
years killed a divorced mother of two. On Wednesday, justice caught
up to her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Francis F. Pelkey, 46, remained expressionless as he was
sentenced to 40 years in prison for the Aug. 13, 1980, murder of
Nell Johnson, a 36-year-old hospital inspector whose bizarre
shooting remained unsolved while her children grew up waiting for a
day in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said an emotional Doug Johnson, 28, who was 8 when
his mother died. ``It's a lot easier to breathe now.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Laura, now 31, shared her brother's bittersweet
feelings about Pelkey's sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's finally being held accountable for his
actions,'' she said. ``It helps with some closure, I think. But we
still miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey's sentence will keep him in prison for at least 13 years
before he's eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey, a diesel mechanic with no criminal record, was the prime
suspect in the murder 20 years ago. But the case was thin and he
wasn't charged.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey eventually left Houston. About 16 years ago, he and his
wife and their three children moved to Sacramento, Calif., where he
bought a $130,000 house with a pool and lived a law-abiding,
church-going life.
</P>
<P>
   But that came crashing down in April 1999 when a grand jury
indicted him for murder, following the work of the Harris County
Sheriff's Department ``cold case squad'' and two detectives who
thought Pelkey had gotten away with murder for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran homicide detectives Harry Fikaris and Roger Wedgeworth
were assigned to the special squad in May 1998, when a reduction in
the crime rate allowed more time for fresh looks at old cases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's was one of the first cases they examined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some hope that new DNA evidence could be found, it
wasn't, and the detectives were left with the evidence they had
before _ Pelkey's odd statement to police after Johnson's
bullet-riddled body was found five miles from her car in a wooded
area in north Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   But the detectives found what they needed in the statement and,
because of a change in evidence rules on the admissibility of such
statements, they took the case to prosecutor Steve Baldassano.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony and evidence, the day after Johnson's
body was found, Pelkey called police and told them an intricate
story about an encounter with her.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was on his way to work early on Aug. 13, 1980, when
he stopped to help her fix a flat on Interstate 45. He said he got
back into his van to leave and that his vehicle wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey said he honked his horn to stop Johnson from driving off
and that she gave him a ride to his home so he could get his tools.
He said they returned to his van on the side of the busy freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey claimed he was fixing his van and that Johnson was
sitting inside of it when two armed robbers approached. One of the
robbers, he said, reached inside the van, got Pelkey's own
.22-caliber pistol and shot Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey told police the killers then took his cap and shirt and
that one of them drove off in his van with Johnson's body and his
gun, while the other held him at gunpoint in their truck.
</P>
<P>
   He said the other killer returned, without Johnson, and returned
his cap, shirt and gun to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey contended the robbers then threatened to kill him if he
talked, and they left in their truck.
</P>
<P>
   And just as authorities had 20 years ago, Baldassano and the
detectives thought Pelkey's story was ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   But going over old interviews, Fikaris and Wedgeworth found
there was part of Pelkey's statement that wasn't included in the
official reports.
</P>
<P>
   When police in 1980 had expressed disbelief at Pelkey's story,
he said: ``I'll tell you what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Pelkey's wife, Sharon, shut him up and he talked
no further. Years later, when he was arrested in California, he
refused to talk and so did his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Pelkey declined to talk to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the detectives and Baldassano had what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Pelkey's statement, he admits to going home after the
mysterious robbers left so he could clean his clothes, his van and
his gun.
</P>
<P>
   His description of a gunman matched his own appearance, even
down to the color of the pants he was wearing, something Baldassano
said must have been concocted so Pelkey could cover being seen with
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And no one saw the truck the alleged robbers were driving. The
only vehicles spotted were Pelkey's and Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Throw into the mix two more things _ Pelkey said Johnson was
about to drive off after he fixed her flat. But when her car was
found the hood was up. Baldassano said it was unlikely Johnson was
going to drive off with her hood raised.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey also mentioned honking at Johnson. But Baldassano
wondered how that horn could work since Pelkey had said he was
working on his van's failing battery.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bite mark on Pelkey's left arm that was visible
when he was questioned in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   An expert testified at trial that the bite appeared to be
consistent with a human bite made by someone whose mouth was the
same shape as Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's got to live free for 20 years,'' Fikaris said
Wednesday. ``He got to raise his family, but there's no doubt in my
mind, or Roger's mind, that he absolutely did this.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite arguments by defense attorney Don Rogers that the
state's case was weak and lacked physical evidence, jurors thought
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remained _ why would a married father on his
way to work, who never had been in trouble with the law, kill a
woman for no reason?
</P>
<P>
   Baldassano told jurors no one will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   But he theorized that Pelkey had made a sexual advance on
Johnson in his van.
</P>
<P>
   She fought and bit him, Pelkey got mad, and things spiraled out
of control, said Baldassano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things just got out of control in incremental steps
and he just sort of overreacted,'' Baldassano said. ``I think this
was a crime of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Jim Wallace said the case sends a message
to criminals who think they've gotten away with something.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the saying, ``Justice delayed is justice denied''
doesn't apply in this case because Pelkey was caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has now been achieved for Nell Johnson,'' said
Wallace, who added that criminals who are free should now shudder
when they hear a knock on the door, whether it's the next day or
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgeworth agreed and now he and his partner say this case will
drive them as they dig into more unsolved murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw Nell Johnson's family stand shoulder-to-shoulder and
watch the cuffs be put on (Pelkey),'' Wedgeworth said. ``They had
waited for that and that picture will stay in my mind always.
That's going to motivate me.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The remark would normally provoke little
notice. But coming from Werner G. Seifert, chief executive of
Germany's stock exchange, it was startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why we have to be headquartered in
Frankfurt,'' Seifert mused at a dinner in late January. ``I could
imagine myself living in London. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Seifert announced that he will indeed be moving to
London. In a stunning coup, Deutsche Borse confirmed that it will
merge with the London Stock Exchange and that Seifert will be chief
executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most dramatic step yet toward creating a pan-European
securities market, uniting Europe's two biggest exchanges into a
single corporation that would be nearly twice as big as the next
contender_ the recently announced merger of the Paris, Amsterdam
and Brussels exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In also announcing an alliance with Nasdaq, the new exchange
could become the European anchor for a global system available 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the most remarkable aspect of the deal may be the extent to
which Seifert and his once-sleepy stock exchange are calling the
shots. Even now, the London Stock Exchange is nearly twice as big
as the Frankfurt bourse in terms of stock trading and London's
financial district is by far Europe's biggest center for investment
banking and trading.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a Frankfurt executive might suddenly be in charge
would until very recently have seemed absurd. Frankfurt is city of
bankers more than traders, a quiet burg compared to London with its
thousands of brokers, traders, analysts, dealmakers, information
merchants and back-office workers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Seifert has turned the old order upside-down. Not only will
he be chief executive of the new exchange, to be called iX (short
for international exchanges and pronounced eye-ex''), but London
will give up its own electronic trading system in favor of
Frankfurt's XETRA system.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this new clout stems from Seifert, an iconoclastic
management consultant who is also a passionate jazz musician and
gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   More than any of his counterparts in London or Paris, according
to executives at big financial institutions, Seifert redefined the
basic mission of an exchange and then charged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main difference that has given Deutsche Borse its power
has been the strength of its management,'' said a senior executive
at a large financial institution. ``The other exchange executives
have been slow to make changes, wedded to doing things by consensus
and avoiding conflicts. Seifert has had a clear idea of what he
wanted, and he went after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Seifert merged Frankfurt's market for futures and
options with that of its Swiss competitor to form Eurex. Last year,
Eurex became the world's biggest derivatives market, eclipsing not
only London's LIFFE but also the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert also oversaw the launch of Frankfurt's Neue Markt, a
three-year-old exchange for younger technology companies like those
traded on NASDAQ. Until then, new companies had little chance of
going public in Germany or in most other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many European exchanges have their own ``new markets.''
But none has grown as explosively as Frankfurt's, which now handles
80 percent of such trading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Seifert built up XETRA, the Deutsche
Borse's electronic trading system. . Besides running Germany's own
exchanges, XETRA runs Vienna's stock exchange and is being adapted
for exchanges in Helsinki and Dublin. The Chicago Board of Trade is
launching a collaborative electronic platform with Deutsche Borse
that will be based on XETRA as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business isn't really trading in stocks or bonds,''
Seifert, 50, remarked recently. ``Our fundamental business is
building systems, loading systems and operating systems.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to Deutsche Borse's stake in Eurex,
Deutsche Borse earned 124 million euros ($112 million) last year on
revenues of 643 million euros (about $585 million). London, by
contrast, had profits of $41.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks say Seifert's ambitions have sometimes
angered rivals. When negotiations with the London officials
surfaced several weeks ago, Seifert was demanding that the
shareholders in Deutsche Borse _ which are mainly Germany's big
banks _ get 60 percent of the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of an outright takeover angered many members of the
London exchange and Seifert backpeddled. About one week ago, the
two sides agreed to a 50-50 merger by keeping Deutsche Borse's
clearing and settlement business out of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But all exchanges have been facing a common reality: a mounting
unwillingness among big financial institutions to tolerate the high
costs that arise from trading over fragmented national exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges have negotiated over alliances for years, but the
talks always broke down amid disputes over control and over which
system would be scrapped and which would become a common platform.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert was among the first to become impatient with the
meandering negotiations. With backing from Deutsche Bank, the
biggest shareholder in Deutsche Borse, Seifert shocked other
European exchanges by negotiating a two-way alliance with the
London Stock Exchange two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   News of that alliance outraged many of Seifert's counterparts,
particularly in Paris. In the months that followed, most of the
other exchanges announced their intentions to grudgingly join up
with the Anglo-German plan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But those talks floundered as well, with the players unable to
agree on a common technology much less on a serious merger. Even
London and Frankfurt failed to agree on much beyond ``ground
rules'' for how a combined system could work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the pressure from financial institutions was rising.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a number of the biggest institutions, including
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, began investing in an
alternative electronic exchange called Tradepoint Financial
Network. Based in London, Tradepoint plans to list about 230
European stocks beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
   In another challenge, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter teamed up with
OM Gruppen AB of Sweden, which runs the Swedish stock exchange, to
develop an system called Jiway for trading about 6,000 European and
American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jiway is scheduled to start up in September.
</P>
<P>
   Still stung by what they viewed as Seifert's high-handed and
seemingly secretive attempts to cut his own deal with London,
exchange executives in Paris viewed him more as a rival than as a
potential ally.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several months, the Frankfurt and Paris stock
exchanges competed in proposing mergers with London. The logic was
straightforward: with markets moving toward pan-European trading,
supremacy would go to the exchange with the highest trading volume.
London, despite sluggishness in some areas, had far more volume
than any other European exchange.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of March, executives in London apparently decided
their best bet lay with Seifert. In response, the Paris, Amsterdam
and Brussels exchanges preemptively announced their own plan to
merge and form a single exchange called Euronext.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement in London sets the stage for a new
competition. But industry analysts caution that neither Seifert's
iX nor Euronext will complete their merger for months and it will
take even longer before they move their operations onto the same
trading system.
</P>
<P>
   Because different exchanges measure their trading volumes in
different ways, it is difficult to make direct comparisons. But
measured by the market capitalization of their listed stocks, the
London and Frankfurt stock exchanges have a combined value of about
$4.1 trillion _ nearly double the combined valuation of the
Euronext partners.
</P>
<P>
   If Seifert can truly unite the systems of London and Frankfurt,
the sheer size of the combined entity should give it trading
efficiencies that make it easy to draw business away from his
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert continues to push for new partners. He disclosed
Wednesday that he is already in talks with the Milan and Madrid
stock exchanges. Somewhat disingenously, he also insisted that he
was open to deeper collaboration with Euronext.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are open for all reasonable steps in the future and this
includes constructive discussions with Euronext and any other
exchange as long as it serves our customers,'' Seifert said in
London.
</P>
<P>
   But if the last three years have proven anything, it is that
announcing deals is much easier than actually carrying them off.
Even an Anglophile like Seifert may find it takes some time before
he can make a permanent move to London.

INTEREST RATES MOVE UPWARD AS FED CITES WAGE GAINS
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Interest rates shot higher Wednesday after the
Federal Reserve reported that wages are rising across the country
and investors wondered if that news would make the central bank
more aggressive in its effort to slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The report on economic conditions in Federal Reserve districts
around the country said that ``there were more frequent reports of
intensifying wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in
all districts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed report also said economic growth was moderate to strong
across the country. That assessment was re-enforced by the report
that factory orders jumped a higher-than-expected 2.2 percent in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The new information on inflationary pressures comes after the
report of a surprisingly sharp jump in consumer prices, excluding
food and energy, in March and an increase in total worker
compensation in the first quarter. Together they have increased
speculation that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise its
short-term interest rate target by a half of a percentage point
when policy-makers meet May 16.
</P>
<P>
   William C.J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, noted the rise in inflation in March in a speech
Wednesday and said ``we have to keep especially alert now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Treasury market, the investor concern was reflected in a
jump in the yield on the two-year note, which is sensitive to
expected policy moves by the Federal Reserve. The yield rose to
6.74 percent, from 6.68 percent Tuesday, and is the highest it has
been in five years. The price, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell 5/32, to 99 9/32.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sharp rise in the two-year yield given the fact that
the Treasury announced Wednesday that it will reduce its issuance
of two-year notes as part of its program to cut government
borrowing as the budget surplus grows. Such a cut in issuance
normally sparks buying.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.39 percent,
from 6.30 percent on Tuesday. The price fell 21/32, to 100 26/32.
The yield on the 30-year bond climbed to 6.11 percent from 6.01
percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Until now most forecasters thought the Fed would raise its
interest rate target just a quarter of a point, which would be the
sixth such move since June. That would bring the federal funds
rate, the overnight rate on loans between banks to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh,
said if Fed policy-makers were meeting today, ``knowing what they
know today, they would probably go half a percentage point.''
</P>
<P>
   William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., didn't
want to predict the size of the next Fed move. But he did say that
the current strength of the economy and the new signs of
inflationary pressure will force the Fed to push interest rates
higher than he had thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stake my reputation on predicting the May
move,'' he said. ``But I want to stress that the Fed has a lot more
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he raised his forecast for how high the Fed will have
to push the federal funds rate. Dudley is now predicting that it
will be up to 7 percent by the end of the year, a quarter of a
point higher, and at 7.5 percent in 12 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges on Wednesday
announced plans for a full merger and an alliance with New York's
technology-heavy Nasdaq stock market. The exchanges are hoping to
build a pan-European trading heavyweight and a 24-hour global
market in new-economy stocks _ both unthinkable only a few years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The combined exchange would be Europe's biggest by far and the
world's fourth largest.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement offered the most significant evidence to date
of a sea change in European markets. The shift has been driven by a
clamor among investors for less-expensive trading, a challenge from
Internet-based and electronic trading systems and a perception of
Europe as a single investment arena since the introduction of a
unified currency _ the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The development also showed how far Frankfurt has progressed in
its challenge to London as Europe's prime financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Just six weeks after the exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and
Brussels announced a rival European combination called Euronext,
the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse said their merged
company_ called iX, for International Exchanges _ would have its
administrative headquarters in London and would carve European
markets into two parts. Blue-chip stocks would be listed in London,
while a combined market in high-growth technology stocks linked to
the Nasdaq would be run from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurex market for derivatives _ complex financial contracts
based on stocks, bonds commodities and currencies _ _ would
continue to be run from Germany as part of the combined exchange,
effectively aiming to isolate London's LIFFE futures and options
market, which is not part of the alliances announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the parent of Nasdaq, told a news conference
Wednesday that the opening of a Nasdaq subsidiary in Tokyo next
month would enable investors to connect with both European and U.S.
markets, offering ``a 24-hour clock for the high-growth
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   `'The markets will follow the sun for the biggest companies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq alliance will bring together London's techMARK and
Germany's Neuer Markt as the core of a new high tech exchange.
Nasdaq and iX are to be equal shareholders in that venture, which
will be incorporated in London and operated from Frankfurt. Zarb
indicated that the deal had pre-empted Nasdaq's plans to set up a
separate European trading system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations on a Frankfurt-London tie-up have been
progressing for almost two years since an alliance was first mooted
as the core of a proposed pan-European exchange. That has now
crystallized into the competing iX and Euronext markets. While the
Paris-dominated Euronext market will trade stocks valued at some
$2.2 trillion, iX will group equities with a combined value of $4.3
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, the New York Stock Exchange trades shares
valued at $11.2 trillion, while NASDAQ`S equities are valued at
$6.3 trillion, and Tokyo's are about $4.5 trillion, according to
the International Federation of Stock Exchanges. In Europe, the new
exchange would clearly dominate, particularly since, it said
Wednesday, smaller bourses in Milan and Madrid, also want to join
the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Without those two exchanges, iX said it will control 53 per cent
of all European equity trading, 81 per cent of the market in
high-growth stocks and 56 per cent of the European derivatives
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step to an integrated pan-European market,''
said Don Cruickshank, the newly-appointed chairman of the London
Stock Exchange, who will be chairman of iX. Cruickshank is expected
to hold talks with both LIFFE and Euronext on expanding the
Frankfurt-London axis.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Denton, a spokeswoman for LIFFE said the exchange would
not reject an approach from iX out of hand but felt its own
technology gave it a strong position. ``We do not see ourselves in
terms of being marginalized and left out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Euronext shrugged off the new combination, saying it proved ``we
took the right decision,'' according to Olivier Lefebvre, president
of Brussels Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Seifert, the chief executive of Deutsche Borse AG which
owns the Frankfurt exchange, will be the chairman of iX, ousting
Gavin Casey, chief executive of the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be owned 50-50 by the London and Frankfurt
exchanges, and will eventually use Germany's Xetra technology for
all cash transactions. Participants said the merger will be
completed by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What belongs together finally comes together,'' Seifert said.
``London is the largest cash market in Europe and we bring in the
largest derivatives market worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The management line-up reflects both the national sensitivities
underlying the merger and the increasing muscle of Frankfurt at the
heart of the 11-nation euro-zone, of which Britain is not a member.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 years of history behind it, coupled with its role as
the biggest of Europe's stock markets and its reputation as
Europe's financial capital, London would once have regarded itself
automatically as the senior partner. But Frankfurt's fast-growing
and technologically-advanced exchange earns more as a business than
the London Stock Exchange, boosting its ambitions to displace
London as Europe's financial hub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this transaction a blow to the ambitions of finance center
Germany? The answer is: no,'' said Rolf Breuer, the chairman of
Deutsche Borse, who is also chief executive of Deutsche Bank.
Indeed, some British bankers said the merger represented a German
take-over because of the use of German technology and the
appointment of Mr Seifert as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly bad for London and good for Frankfurt,'' said
a senior investment banker, who spoke in return for anonymity.
``What's most notable is that high growth and new companies will be
listed in Frankfurt. So Frankfurt is going to become the new
economy center of Europe and London will be all old economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the differing ownership structures of the London
and Frankfurt exchanges meant that shareholdings in the merged
company would be heavily weighted towards the big German banks that
dominate the Deutsche Borse. Ownership of the London Stock Exchange
is shared by over 290 members who voted earlier this year to
demutualize, while ownership of the Deutsche Borse is much more
restricted. Seifert said the iX exchange's long-term goal was to go
public with an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the move was inevitable considering the changing
profile of the market-place.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marks, executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe,
Middle East and Africa called the merger and tie-in with the Nasdaq
exchange ``a significant step forward in the creation of a broader,
deeper, more liquid marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The investors have moved on and they want one stock market to
reflect that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the German and British governments welcomed the deal and
the European Union said the merger was unlikely to encounter
regulatory hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The participants made their announcement Wednesday with more
emphasis on grand visions than detail. It remained unclear, for
instance, precisely when and at what cost Germany's Xetra
technology would be rolled out for British investors, or what
savings would accrue to investors. Seifert said the conversion
should be possible some time in the first six months of 2001.
London traders work on the SETS system and `'people are going to
face conversion costs that have not been spelled out,'' said one
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the number of possible layoffs was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's position outside the euro-zone also meant that
London-listed blue-chips, including such giants as BP Amoco and
DaimlerChrysler, would be quoted in both euros and sterling. Some
bankers expressed concerns about the likely costs of clearing and
settlement in the merged market.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Borse owns 50 per cent of the Luxembourg-based
Clearstream settlement system, which is not included in the merger.
Clearstream said Wednesday that it was in talks with CrestCo
Limited of Britain. Both companies will provide settlement services
to the merged exchange, but a Clearstream spokesman said a merger
between them was ``quite a long way down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the impetus for the deal came from the rapid pace of
events beyond the control of traditional bourses, notably the
proliferation of smaller and more nimble electronic trading systems
such as Tradepoint in Britain. Tradepoint, which is supported by
big U.S. and European banks, plans to launch a pan-European trading
system in July and says it will offer investors lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge presented by such organizations emerged anew
Wednesday when Breuer, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, was asked
whether his organization would withdraw from Tradepoint in favor of
iX. His answer was less than a ringing endorsement for the merged
exchanges. ``Both systems have still to show whether they'll
perform,'' he said. `'So let's wait and see.''

Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Luminarias,'' a girlfriend comedy/romance in the vein of
``Waiting to Exhale,'' tries to do for Latinas what that film did
for African-American women. It's not a particularly good movie but
it is an interesting one, in the way that it laces tougher-minded
stuff through soapy and sitcomish standard issue.
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a stage play that star Evelina Fernandez wrote for
L.A.'s Latino Theater Company and directed by her husband, Jose
Luis Valenzuela, the film focuses on four professional women from
East L.A. They have the usual trouble finding good men and, once
located, more difficulty figuring out what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the bad sex jokes, shouting matches and tearful
mutual support these things always indulge in, the story also asks
probing questions about ethnicity and class that give the
lightweight, sometimes awkward dramatics some real ballast. Of
course, these questions are generally solved in simplistic,
dishonest ways _ this is a girlfriend movie, after all _ but it
still beats cliched dialogue and forced eccentricity, of which
there is too much here.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea (Fernandez) is a lawyer whose charming, no-good husband
embarrasses her by kissing a blonde at their anniversary party.
Sofia (Marta DuBois) is a psychiatrist who's not real thrilled with
her Mexican roots and lives on the Westside. Lilly (Angela Moya) is
an artist with self-esteem issues that have led to a weakness for
undocumented non-workers who invariably turn out to have wives
somewhere. Irene (Dyana Ortelli) designs kooky clothes and loves
Latin men, but is edgy since she gave up sex for Lent.
</P>
<P>
   The main storyline involves Andrea's rebound romance with a
Jewish attorney, Joseph, played by Scott Bakula. He's an adversary
in court, but her real problem is that, well, he's white _ and
stirs up decades worth of her own racial anger the deeper she falls
in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   The other women's romantic difficulties get shorter shrift.
Basically, Sofia falls, against all her personal aspirations, for
an immigrant bartender; Lilly develops a nurturing relationship
with a responsible Korean gentleman whose parents don't approve;
and Irene can't wait for Easter. They meet regularly at one
another's homes or offices, or at the title hillside restaurant,
where tequila is consumed in large quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Acting is generally decent, sometimes caricaturish. Actually,
the best performance, both comically and dramatically, comes from
Seidy Lopez, who plays a young mother coping with stuff that makes
the older women look trivially self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela opens the film with a long steadicam shot at a party
that isn't going to have Martin Scorsese or Paul Thomas Anderson
shaking in their boots. But he soon dispenses with unnecessary
cinematic flourishes and lets the women take over. They have a good
rapport: you believe that they've been friends for many years, with
all their instant understanding of one another, their easy,
intimate abrasiveness and their all-embracing forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, it's nice to have a movie that looks at a slice
of life no others bother to. You just wish that ``Luminarias''
would have emphasized its sharper observations better than a
hundred generic friends-and-lovers comedies.

NEW SATELLITE IN ORBIT FOR HURRICANE SEASON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ A $220 million satellite hurtled into Earth orbit
early Wednesday, giving the National Weather Service a new
surveillance tool for the upcoming hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, or
GOES-11, soared from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., at
3:07 a.m. EDT, aboard a commercial Atlas IIA rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Following 90 days of maneuvers to raise its orbital altitude and
for instrument checkouts, the spacecraft is slated to become a
ready backup for one of two similar, but aging sentries that now
monitor tropical and severe storm development over the U.S.
Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane season for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts begins June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency of Wednesday's launch was apparent last Friday when
NASA decided to postpone liftoff of the shuttle Atlantis until May
18 in order to proceed with the GOES-11 launching.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES launch is more than a year behind schedule. The mission
was slowed by problems last May with a rocket engine in an advanced
Delta commercial rocket. The Atlas IIA is powered by a similar
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES-8 weather satellite launched in April 1994 is
monitoring tropical storm development over the Atlantic. Though
functioning, the spacecraft has surpassed its five-year design
life.
</P>
<P>
   The GOES-10 spacecraft launched in April 1997 is monitoring
Pacific storm development.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday's launch, both were backed up by the GOES-9
satellite launched in May 1995. But that spacecraft has lost the
use of its principal Earth-imaging system because of a problem with
the satellite's electronic control system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's vitally important we have a continuity of data or we may
find ourselves impaired in our capability to forecast,'' said
NOAA's William Proenza, southern region director for the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The imagery furnished by the GOES satellite series is a staple
of television weather broadcasts. In addition to monitoring
hurricane development, the GOES spacecraft are used
around-the-clock to warn of tornado and flash flood development.

MARKET PLACE: NASDAQ TAKES ANOTHER STEP TOWARD GLOBAL 24-HOUR
TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GERMANY-BRITAIN-MARKETS) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq stock market took another step toward its
goal of worldwide, round-the-clock trading Wednesday with an
alliance that is sure to intensify the already fierce competition
between the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement that drew dozens of reporters to the Nasdaq's
flashy investor center in Times Square, Nasdaq officials said they
would join with the London and Frankfurt exchanges to build a
European exchange specializing in high-growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens next year, the new market, called Nasdaq iX, will
give European investors the chance to trade high-growth technology
companies based in both Europe and the United States, said Frank
Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, the parent of Nasdaq. ``The markets will follow the sun
for the biggest companies,'' Zarb said in televised comments from
London. ``Our intent will be to interlink with all key financial
pools.''
</P>
<P>
   The market, a 50-50 joint venture of Nasdaq Europe and iX, the
combination announced Wednesday by the London Stock Exchange and
the Deutsche Borse, will be based in London and managed from there
but regulated in Germany, the partners said. It will initially
offer investors the chance to trade the stocks in the Nasdaq 100,
including technology giants like Microsoft and Cisco Systems, as
well as European securities that are now listed on the German Neuer
Markt and the London techMARK.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nasdaq Japan, which Nasdaq has said will be running
by September, the new market is the linchpin of Zarb's plan to
create a 24-hour global stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Nasdaq can meet that goal, and on its timetable, is
unclear. Already, technology problems have forced Nasdaq to ask the
Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to delay its
plans to quote stock prices in decimals rather than fractions. And
the London Stock Exchange, one of Nasdaq's partners in Nasdaq iX,
suffered a fiasco of its own last month when a computer problem
left it closed for most of one of the year's busiest trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zarb said he believed Nasdaq and its partners had the
technical expertise to open the market on schedule.

   The Big Board, meanwhile, has been noticeably mum on its global
expansion plans, although it has discussed joint ventures with
exchanges from Hong Kong to South America. ``We're talking with
everyone,'' said Ray Pellechia, a spokesman for the New York Stock
Exchange, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Weaver, associate professor of finance at Baruch College,
said the Big Board must compete with the Nasdaq's growing web of
alliances, which could eventually enable the Nasdaq to offer
companies around the globe access to a worldwide pool of capital
with a single stock listing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York Stock Exchange is going to have to respond to
this,'' Weaver said. ``As you increase the number of people who
know about a company, your cost of capital goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Atkin, the president and chief executive of Instinet,
which trades stocks listed on more than 40 markets worldwide for
institutional investors, said the Big Board had so far been
successful in persuading leading European and Asian companies to
list their stocks on its exchange, where they are traded in
dollars. In contrast, the stocks on Nasdaq iX will be traded in the
local currencies used by investors, said Andy MacMillan, spokesman
for the NASD. So share prices will be quoted simultaneously in
euros for most European investors and dollars for American
investors, a complex technical hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the NYSE, the issue is do they want to venture into
trading those instruments in local currencies,'' Atkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the publicity, the practical effect of the new
market will initially be limited for American investors, who will
not be able to trade European companies on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. investors are not going to be immediately able to tap
into the Nasdaq iX joint venture right away,'' MacMillan said. It
will take time for companies to meet SEC accounting and disclosure
standards, he said. ``The companies still have some hoops to go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   John Heine, a spokesman for the SEC, said that even when
American investors finally do get the chance to trade on Nasdaq iX,
they should not expect regulators in the United States to protect
them from such things as fraud and violations of insider-trading
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our jurisdiction is limited to the U.S.,'' Heine said. ``If it
occurs in the U.S., it's ours. If it's not in the U.S., it's not
ours.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: MEGAMERGER MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When elephants fight,'' goes the African proverb, ``it is the
grass that suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   When the cable operator Time Warner blacked out the programs
provided by filmmaker and broadcaster ABC-Disney, millions of
viewers were denied what they had come to expect on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of the entertainment was merely an annoyance, but the
shutdown of any major news outlet is a kick in the head to the
public interest. Time should no more have the power to force ABC
News off the screen than ABC should have the power to block
delivery of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper wars are nothing new; the egos of James Gordon Bennett
and William Randolph Hearst in past centuries are legendary. But
now the news has become a casualty of warring entertainment and
information empires, and the conflict has escalated from one
locality to the globe.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, ambitious titans assured us that media mergers
were the wave of the future. We were told that only by
concentrating communications in multinational behemoths could U.S.
companies compete with monopolies in Europe and Asia. Size
guaranteed efficiency and the consumer could look forward to lower
cost and better service.
</P>
<P>
   Baloney. Mere size is no synergy. With all-consuming
conglomeration comes huge investment risk and, as we saw this week,
unbridled arrogance. To those lusting after world communications
domination, the game is not to win customers but to destroy
competitors, leaving the losers to think about the ravages of
giantism: cogito; ergo zero sum.
</P>
<P>
   We are too quick to take for granted federal approval this fall
of the amalgamation of Time Warner with America Online. That would
carry into the future the mistake we make today of marrying the
creation of content to the transmission of signal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a nail-nibbling Federal Communications Commission
solemnly declared that it would rap knuckles at Time Warner because
present rules say that ``no deletion of a local commercial
television station shall occur during a sweeps period,'' when
ratings are used to set advertising rates. Thanks a bunch, FCC;
that ruling means that such ``deletion'' is OK at all other times.
On the same day, the same FCC approved the purchase of broadcaster
CBS by Viacom. Industry insiders expect the same financial
exploitation of a device called ``retransmission consent'' being
used by ABC-Disney. That would provoke the same
superdog-eat-superdog response against ``CBS News With Dan Rather''
by cable powers that shut out ``ABC News With Peter Jennings'' to
millions of people for a day and a half.
</P>
<P>
   What's to stop this trampling of the grasses of the masses by
the elephantine corporate combatants?
</P>
<P>
   Not Congress; ignoring Sen. John McCain's warnings, it has been
rolling over regularly, giving the broadcasting and cable lobbies
all they demand (except when they disagree) lest local stations
support opponents of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Not the regulatory agencies. In approving mergers beyond the
communications world, the Federal Trade Commission seems to have
bought the bill of goods being sold by gurus of globalization that
enormity will be the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives do not suggest that government regulation of more
monopolies and semi-monopolies is the answer; bureaucrats in
Washington have a poor record of running large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of megamergers have been saying that only giants can
compete with giants. But to let the behemoths fight it out until
one becomes a monopoly is just another road to regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is vigorous antitrust prevention and enforcement. Do
trustbusters at Justice have their hands too full with Microsoft to
look hard at the plans of AT&AMP;T and MediaOne or MCI-Worldcom-Sprint?
Then the times require that we hire more trustbusters.
</P>
<P>
   We should say no to more megamergers before they take place _
and before having to begin painful corporate divorce proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   This week's blackout is no jousting between Time Warner's Porky
Pig and Disney's Mickey Mouse for the entertainment dollar.
Concentration of power over what we see in the news _ and even if
we see a competitor's news _ is a danger to democracy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel H. was 3 and Dawn was 4 when their mother took
them and disappeared. Her estranged husband, a New York City
limousine driver, searched obsessively for his children. He posted
rewards, enlisted help from a retired police officer and hired a
private detective, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   As six years passed, he took to driving slowly through
residential neighborhoods, looking for two blond children who
looked like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave up hope,'' the father, Hardaway H., recalled in a
recent interview. ``But it was as if they were dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were in New York City foster care.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the authorities had found the children alone in their
mother's apartment in the Bronx. They were emaciated and had
evidently been abused. But for three more years, through 33 court
hearings, multiple foster placements and the children's complaints
of new abuse, the city's foster care system failed to tell their
father.
</P>
<P>
   The notification that finally reached him in 1994 was part of a
routine effort to free the children for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel H. vs. City of New York, a 1996 federal lawsuit filed by
Mr. H. _ the family surname was withheld under the terms of the
case _ is the first of five similar cases brought by fathers who
contend that their parental rights, and their children's rights to
protection, were trampled by a foster care system biased against
men.
</P>
<P>
   These cases, the most recent filed only two months ago,
underline how hard it can be in practice for fathers to assert
their parental claims.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have not admitted wrongdoing in any of the cases
and will not comment because of pending litigation. But they have
returned children to four of the five fathers so far, and this year
the city paid settlements of $135,000 and $275,000 in two of the
lawsuits. Steeper damages are at stake in the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get policy makers to change what is going
on,'' said Bruce A. Young, the lawyer handling the cases as a kind
of cumulative class action. ``In this day and age, when you could
hop on the Internet or the parent locator service used for child
support, there's no excuse for not notifying the father. It's a
basic human right.''
</P>
<P>
   Young acknowledges that in a nation in which only 5 percent of
single parents raising children are men, fathers who want custody
are still exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   He said that concerns about domestic violence could make the
system suspicious of fathers seeking their children, and that in
ordinary divorce proceedings, many fathers use custody demands to
frighten an ex-wife into accepting a lower financial settlement.
But in foster care cases, he contended, children are hurt when
fathers lose their chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel H.'s lawsuit charges that after he was placed in a foster
home, his signs of emotional trauma brought beatings, not therapy.
Separated from his sister and transferred at the age of 9 to a
group residence where bigger boys routinely abused him, he began
openly longing for his father.
</P>
<P>
   But he says a caseworker at the foster agency, St. Dominic's,
told him, ``Don't think your father is going to come and rescue
you, because your father's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the father was living in Queens with a listed telephone
number all along.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at St. Dominic's, based in Westchester County and the
Bronx, declined to comment. In legal papers, the agency said that
caseworkers had tried and failed to find Mr. H., and that after
concluding that the boy's complaints of abuse were unfounded, they
returned Daniel to the same foster home.
</P>
<P>
   There, the lawsuit contends, the boy experienced a new round of
beatings ``with a sense of helplessness so severe that at times he
considered suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, promoting fatherhood has become a mantra of
public policy, but foster care practices toward fathers are little
changed, Young said. One of the two cases he filed this year
concerns a divorced Navy police officer who had faithfully paid
child support and sued to enforce visitation, yet after a yearlong
search for his son and stepson, discovered that they were in a
Bronx foster home, father listed as ``unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   That father, Luis Abreu _ his son's name is Luis Abreu Jr. _
said that when he complained, a caseworker retorted: ``We go by
what the mother tells us. We don't have to notify the father.''
</P>
<P>
   And though a judge ruled in his favor last July, Abreu is still
struggling to get the children out of foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Another father, David Nieves, was also classified as ``unknown''
and came close to losing his son and daughter for good last year,
he said, despite paying $81.31 a week in court-ordered child
support and visiting them at the home of a maternal aunt. Nieves, a
Federal Express worker, learned 17 months late that the aunt had
legally become the children's foster mother and that the Children's
Aid Society was planning their adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Coltoff, director of Children's Aid, would not discuss
the case, except to stress its happy ending. A petition to
terminate Nieves' parental rights was eventually withdrawn, and the
children now live with him and his fiancee in a blended family of
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Happy endings in these cases are hard won. One was the work of a
young Florida father, Jason Rudy C., who had sought his children
for 18 months when he learned late in 1995 that they were in a
foster home in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. C., then a nurse's aide, immediately drove to New York to
try to reclaim Jason Rudy Jr., 4, and Tatiana, 3. The children had
been taken into custody after their mother's female companion
burned their hands on a stove as punishment _ the fourth report of
abuse over 11 months, records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son jumps up on my lap _ `Let's go home, Daddy,''' recalled
Mr. C., whose last name was withheld under court order to preserve
confidentiality. ``I was just bawling, and he was, too. I was
ecstatic to see them, and heart-wrenching miserable because I
couldn't take them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Case law dictates that if the father is the only available
parent, he is automatically entitled to custody unless the state
proves him unfit. But in practice, lawyers say, once children have
been taken from the mother, Family Court judges and caseworkers are
reluctant to hand them to a father about whom little is known.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the mother may be an admitted drug addict charged with
abuse or neglect, she is typically the system's main source of
information. Unofficially, the burden of proving fitness shifts to
the father.
</P>
<P>
   For the Florida father, that meant a two-year court battle,
while the children moved through three foster homes. Midway, he
filed a habeas corpus petition to try to force their return, and
city lawyers countered with a neglect petition against him. Because
he had been honest about his teen-age drug use, Mr. C. said, he
decided the only way to win was to do whatever the system demanded,
including biweekly drug tests for six months.
</P>
<P>
   So many appearances were required that he moved to New York,
lived on a friend's couch in Queens for a year and scraped by as a
street peddler. The low point, he said, was being arrested and
fined for peddling without a license. The crowning glory was a
24-hour Greyhound bus ride home: ``Two kids, five bags, all of our
belongings.''
</P>
<P>
   Now married and working in his uncle's fence business near
Tampa, he said the $275,000 settlement he received last month would
help cover the cost of the children's psychotherapy, their
education and the family house he is building.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Israel, a 43-year-old city sanitation worker who
received the other recent settlement, bought annuities for his son
Tyrel, now 4.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had filed suit for custody of Tyrel in Family Court in
Brooklyn when Tyrel was a baby, months before the authorities
accused the child's mother of abandoning him in a Bronx homeless
shelter to pursue her drug habit. But Israel said that when learned
that Tyrel was at St. Joseph's, a Brooklyn foster care agency, and
sought custody, ``I ran up against a brick wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Caseworkers observed Israel being patient and nurturing with his
son during a visit on Oct. 4, 1996, records show, but _ apparently
in deference to the wishes of the mother, who claimed he was
violent _ no one told Israel that a hearing on the child would take
place in a Bronx court three days later. When Tyrel was injured,
the agency notified the child's mother, not his father. And further
visits with his son were thwarted by an agency caseworker who told
Israel that in the caseworker's native Africa, men did not raise
children, the lawsuit charged.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda M. Conway, executive director of St. Joseph's, said that
the caseworker had since returned to his homeland. ``The policy and
practice of St. Joseph's is to work with both parents for
reunification as soon as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under recent federal legislation promoting adoption, caseworkers
face increasingly stringent time limits for terminating parental
rights, and foster care agencies are rated by the city on those
benchmarks. At worst, said Peggy Davis, a professor of law at New
York University and a former judge, the pressure adds unintended
incentives to cut absent fathers out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   In depositions, city legal supervisors have been uncertain how
much effort an agency should devote to finding a father. One
supervisor said the legal standard did not require a parent locator
service, which tracks deadbeat parents to collect child support,
and another maintained that publishing a ``John Doe'' notice would
suffice in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are racial and class stereotypes and gender stereotypes
that lead people to feel that this doesn't matter,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Mincy, a senior program officer at the Ford Foundation
who is researching fatherhood issues nationally, agreed. ``The
whole infrastructure of children and family services makes this
unfortunate, but typical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel finally got a chance to demand custody in court in
December 1996, a lawyer for the city objected, asking for further
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how he could not be next in line to get
this child,'' Barry Bondorowsky, Israel's lawyer, protested at the
hearing, noting that the father's home had already passed a
Brooklyn court evaluation. ``He's an upstanding man. He brought up
other children. He wants his child. No one can tell me a single
thing wrong with him except that he can't get along with the
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Bruce M. Kaplan of Bronx Family Court agreed. ``There's
law in this state,'' he declared, ordering the city to give Tyrel
to his father. ``I'm outraged when people trash the applicable
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel now allows Tyrel to spend weekends with his mother, who
has been through drug rehabilitation. She declined to talk about
the case. But during a recent Saturday shopping trip to buy a
school uniform, the child made his feelings clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stay with Mommy,'' he confided as Israel laced
his shoes. ``She keeps screaming at me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you being good?'' Israel asked the boy, who had danced
through the aisles in exuberance, and at one point, stroking the
cornrows that frame Israel's balding head, declared that he wanted
braids, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Tyrel replied. ``That's why I want to be at your house.
I love you, Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Mr. H., who used to hunt for his children from a
limousine, reunion came too late. ``They had no memory of me as a
father,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn, 17, ran to the streets before he could win her back.
Daniel had a mental breakdown soon after returning to his father.
Mr. H., disabled by heart and anxiety disorders, visits him in a
therapeutic foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the lost years, the father recalled times he
came across a wallet in the back seat of his car, and promptly
called telephone information to find the passenger who had lost it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``was two children.''

 &HT;    Ex-commander speaks for the guard
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In Charles Fassinger's corner office near Miami
International Airport, walls are covered with plaques and
certificates chronicling his long career in the military and the
national guard. Fassinger said he was most moved by one that reads,
``To a squadron commander who took more than his share of blame and
less than his share of credit. We remember. We were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Fassinger was the highest-ranking Ohio
National Guard officer at a place called Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anybody in a long, long time, say, 'You dirty
bastard-murderer-killer,' '' Fassinger says.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges the 13 seconds of violence at 12:24 p.m. on May
4, 1970 that sparked outrage across a divided nation. He doesn't
sugarcoat the fact that guardsmen fired more than 60 bullets,
striking 13 people and killing four: He says it was a tragedy for
everyone. But he also believes that for decades the men who opened
fire that day have been unfairly characterized as murderous goons
who leaped from their trucks ready to get them some hippies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt somebody had to talk for the guard. I felt as
commander, that was my job. And I continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's recited the points many times so he's very clear on them:
The idea of guardsmen deliberately opening fire without provocation
``is absolutely crazy.'' There was no conspiracy. Most protestors
were not combative, but some were. The guardsmen were in danger,
and if they weren't, they believed they were. And no one gave an
order to fire.
</P>
<P>
   He knows people feel differently. Alan Canfora, shot in the
hand, recently responded to a reporter's e-mail about Fassinger by
calling him a ``ghoulish bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like me much,'' Fassinger said. ``He's one of those
you can't talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Fassinger got a Christmas card in the mail.
It had been signed ``Allison Krause,'' the name of one of the four
dead students.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, he's received notes from people
complaining about the guard being lousy shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes me just as sick to my stomach: 'You should have
given them better training. They should have got more.' ``
</P>
<P>
   He said he took heat at the 20th anniversary in 1990 when he
said it was wrong that the guard was there at all; he says he meant
it was a tragedy that things escalated to that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did armed anybody, whether police, guard or army, find
themselves in a position where they had to face unarmed civilians,
students or anything else? That circumstance made everybody a
loser. Everyone took that that the Guard shouldn't have been there.
They should have been there. They would be there today if the same
thing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger was there when a grand jury indicted two guardsmen,
then when charges were dismissed. He was there when eight of the 27
guardsmen who fired were criminally charged with violating the
civil rights of the dead and injured, then when a federal judge
threw the case out. He was there when Canfora and another injured
student sued the National Guard, the college and the governor;
Canfora won $15,000 and the other $22,500 in a settlement. By 1978,
the wounded and families of the dead would receive a total of
$675,000 from the state of Ohio and a signed acknowledgment by Gov.
James Rhodes and the 27 guardsmen that the shootings should not
have occurred. Fassinger knows a presidential commission called the
shootings ``unnecessary, unwarranted and inexcusable.'' He says no
one interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger, for years an executive of a suburban Cleveland
welding supply dealership and a board member of the trade group
American Welding Society, was invited in 1991 to come to Miami to
work for the associations. The children were grown and Florida's
sunshine was enticing, so he came, buying the home of former
Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver near Pro Player Stadium in
northern Miami-Dade County. He's now its associate executive
director. He'll be 70 in August and enjoys being able to come to
work in casual slacks and shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after his 16th birthday, in 1946, Fassinger lied about
his age and enlisted in the Ohio National Guard. He saw action in
Korea. And while his National Guard unit was never called, it was
eligible to go to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not have strong personal feelings about Vietnam one way
or the other, frankly,'' Fassinger said. ``The protestors, as a
group, they certainly had a right to protest.''
</P>
<P>
   While many protestors did so peacefully, by the beginning of
May, troublemakers _ Fassinger believes they constituted a tiny
minority of Vietnam opponents _ had trashed the tiny college town
of Kent, Ohio, about 40 miles southeast of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students were breaking windows, building bonfires, threatening
merchants,'' Fassinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger's unit of about 500 guardsmen was pulled from policing
a Teamsters strike in northeast Ohio and sent, along with several
other units, to Kent State. In all, about 700 converged on the
college town. Protestors had burned the ROTC building the night of
May 2. ``I don't know that I anticipated something bad happening,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first few days, he said, the issue was Vietnam. Once troops
arrived, ``It was the guard. 'Guard off campus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of May 3 and the morning of May 4, Fassinger said,
authorities responding to bomb threats had searched dorm rooms and
found weapons; he said that bolsters his contention that guardsmen
who fired feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon of May 4, 2,000 to 3,000 students had gathered
for a noon rally that the university had banned. The guard ordered
them to disperse, then fired tear gas. Guardsmen said they were
greeted by deafening shouts and chants and some said they were
struck by rocks and other objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``When does it go from a crowd to a mob? That was the first time
I ever saw it happen. This was a mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fassinger says, he heard a single shot from the ranks of
the guard. Then a pause. Then more shots.
</P>
<P>
   Guardsmen later said they fired because they heard others fire,
were surrounded on three sides by protestors, and were being
advanced upon. In some news articles, however, guardsmen who didn't
want to be identified were quoted as saying they fired
indiscriminately, then agreed on a version of events that would
justify the shooting; Fassinger says he never heard that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was in the mind of the guys that pulled the
trigger,'' Fassinger said. ``I know what they said. I know what I
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger said no one could have heard an order to fire had one
been given.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't hear anything,'' Fassinger said. ``People were
yelling. They (guardsmen) were wearing gas masks. We literally
reached over and grabbed them by the shoulder and yelled ``cease
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure instinct. By the time I turned around, and we're talking
seconds, it appeared that the students at that point were reacting
to the firing of bullets, were leaving the area, were falling to
the ground and there didn't appear to be any further threat.''
</P>
<P>
   He says guardsmen stopped shooting ``instantaneously. Which
makes this panic thing difficult. If they'd panicked they'd have
kept shooting. Only a few fired all the rounds in their clip. A few
just fired once or twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, Fassinger said, he had the guardsmen line up and
march back down the hill. ``There was no running. No panic.'' He
said he tried to relax the guardsmen, told them to put weapons down
and said, 'You will not fire until specifically told to do so by
me.' `` Officers called for ambulances. Some students wouldn't let
them pass. An armored personnel carrier was needed to get the
ambulance crews in. ``Kids were shouting, 'Murderers. Kill the
guard.' I thought it would go totally out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   By that night, guardsmen knew people had died; ``We had one guy
who'd had a panic attack. One had a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Thursday before all the guardsmen left Kent. Fassinger
was the last to go. He'd been so busy and so exhausted that it was
not until he got home that the immensity of the shootings sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were characterized as murderers, killers, kid
killers, that sort of thing, and that was hard to take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of years allows for a lot of hindsight, spin and
myth-making. Some historians call the incident a turning point in
the nation's commitment to the war in Vietnam, saying most
Americans lost their stomach for the war after learning that
American soldiers had killed their own people. Fassinger doesn't
necessarily agree, noting the war lasted another five years, but
concedes that ``it was another incident that led people to where
they were going.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger believes bloodshed could have been avoided had his
troops been armed with the same equipment today's riot police use:
full body armor, face shields, riot batons, water cannon. ``My guys
and me were there in old army fatigues, World War II gas masks and
an M-1 rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he was bothered when a memorial placed at the campus
didn't mention the guardsmen and they weren't invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guards were victims. The system was a victim. The citizens
were victims. There were lots of victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassinger said he doesn't stay in touch with fellow guardsmen.
And, no, they've never had a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you do that?''

LEGISLATION TO CREATE COMMISSION COULD HELP CHINA TRADE BILL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With supporters of a China trade bill scrambling
for every vote, a Michigan Democrat in the House is planning to
introduce legislation this week that he predicts will rescue the
Clinton administration's top remaining foreign policy goal from
potential defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Sander Levin said Wednesday that he is putting the final touches
on a proposal to establish a commission with powers to review human
rights, labor policies and development of the rule of law in China.
After weeks of test-marketing in Congress, Levin said his proposal
for parallel legislation to the trade bill could recruit enough
fence-sitting Democrats to tip the balance in favor of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would set up a commission consisting of nine members of
each house of Congress, five presidential appointees and a
full-time staff. The body would study China issues and advise both
Congress and the White House on legislation or administrative
steps, including U.S. policy on lending by the World Bank. That
would keep pressure on Beijing to comply with its trade commitments
and improve human rights, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of extending permanent normal trade relations have
dismissed Levin's proposal as a fig leaf, saying the commission
would have no real powers of enforcement. Both the Clinton
administration and the Republican congressional leadership have
kept their distance.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, Republicans and administration officials are now
saying that the Levin proposal attracts more votes for elevating
China trade relations than it loses, especially among uncommitted
Democrats. House vote counters said the Levin commission had helped
recruit at least 15 Democratic yes votes, badly needed ones if the
administration is to reach the minimum 70 Democratic supporters it
claims it must have.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders say they can produce 140 to 150 votes for the
trade bill, but will rely on Democrats to push the total over the
218 necessary to pass the House. The House vote is scheduled for
late May. Approval in the Senate is seen as certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Levin proposal will be responsible for 15 votes
and maybe more,'' said Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who is leading the
effort to round up Democratic votes in the House. ``It gives me
what I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley, who is leading the
administration's lobbying effort on the bill, Wednesday called
Levin's proposal ``an extremely good plan.'' Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, who heads the Ways and Means Committee, also spoke
favorably about the idea at hearings on China trade.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade measure also got a lift Wednesday when House and
Senate negotiators agreed on details of a bill to give African and
Caribbean countries wide-ranging trade benefits aimed at helping
their ailing economies. The House could vote on the compromise as
early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as six House Democrats have suggested that they would
not vote for the China measure until the House first passed the
Africa trade bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration announced plans to beef up
the team the government employs to police compliance with trade
accords, with special emphasis on China. Daley said the
administration would ask for $22 million in extra spending for
trade enforcement and export promotion. Some of that money would
pay for new personnel who would focus specifically on whether China
meets its market-opening obligations after it enters the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Levin designed his proposal to resemble the Helsinki Commission,
a joint commission of Congress and the White House set up in 1976
to monitor human rights in the Soviet bloc. The idea is to give
members of Congress sway over China policy even if it agrees to
sacrifice its annual review of that nation's trading rights, a step
that's necessary if U.S. companies are to benefit fully from
concessions China made in its bid to join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that should be an important part of our
trade policy - a way to shape globalization,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt had his own plan for setting
up an investigation and enforcement body for trade with China with
the authority to mandate sanctions if China failed to live up to
its trade obligations or to international labor standards. But the
Clinton administration firmly rejected any proposal that would have
the power to mandate sanctions, calling that inconsistent with
America's obligations under WTO rules. Gephardt has said he will
vote against the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Levin's proposal is a watered down version of
Gephardt's and does not deserve broad support.
</P>
<P>
   But it has elicited enthusiasm among some Republicans. Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb., who has been working closely with Levin, said he
planned to present it to the House Republican leadership for their
blessing. He said the commission could sway several undecided
Republicans to vote for the China bill.

OUT ON THE STREET, CYBER AND OTHERWISE
</HEADLINE>
   (With METAL-POPLIFE-ART) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brett Vapnek sits at the computer in his Beverly Hills office,
zooming in on a map of the United States filled with clusters of
black dots. Each dot represents a ZIP code inhabited by a youth
volunteer for the Streetwise Concepts and Culture street team, a
fan volunteer network that assembled over the Internet for
grass-roots promotion for new rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can zero in on the broadcast range for K-Rock, click a
button to send an e-mail, and get hundreds of kids to call the
station and request `Spiders' by System of a Down,'' Vapnek, the
company's vice president, explained.
</P>
<P>
   Look outside any new rock show, and chances are there will be a
couple of Streetwise kids toting cardboard boxes full of cassettes
of Slipknot, Papa Roach, Taproot or another band that Streetwise
represents. A slightly more sophisticated version of rap's street
promotion teams, Streetwise sends its volunteers tapes, stickers
and flyers to give to their friends or hand out in the street to
generate excitement about a band.
</P>
<P>
   The street team concept began for David Benveniste when he was
managing System of a Down. Benveniste, whom most people call Beno,
would hang out in Internet chat rooms and give teen-agers his home
phone number. When they called, Beno would play them System of a
Down's demo tape over the phone, then make a copy, wrap it in
Kleenex, and send it to the lucky or confused teen. Eventually, he
insisted that System's record label, Columbia, make him 30,000
advance cassettes; Streetwise began when the album's initial sales
surprised not just Columbia but the band itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start at the bottom and work up,'' Beno said. ``I inject the
streets. There's no price you can put on word of mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Streetwise members, there is another benefit. ``Everybody's
always grateful when I give them free tapes,'' said Julian Trevino,
a college freshman, who was distributing Ultraspank cassettes
outside the San Antonio concert by Slipknot, a band that Trevino,
by the way, discovered when someone gave him a Streetwise cassette
sampler of the band.

 &HT;    State expected to seek death penalty at Al-Amin's murder trial
 &HT;    By Jack Warner and Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state will formally advise Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin
Thursday that it will seek his death in the killing of a Fulton
County sheriff's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin gets his first hearing on the charges at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard refused to confirm in advance that
he will seek the death penalty against the former H. Rap Brown. But
prosecutors in Georgia invariably ask for the death penalty in
cases of suspected cop killers.
</P>
<P>
   David Kinchen, older brother of slain Deputy Ricky Kinchen,
confirmed late Wednesday, after members of the family met with
Howard, that the state will announce it is seeking the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the family concurs with Howard's decision,
David Kinchen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is deeply religious, especially my mother, and while
there are some reservations and we are asking God to forgive us, we
want the death penalty,'' he said, speaking slowly and
deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen, his mother, Erma Kinchen Brooks, two sisters and Ricky
Kinchen's widow, Sharese, spent about an hour talking to Howard at
his office Wednesday. ``More than anything, we want the right
person brought to trial,'' David Kinchen said. ``We were satisfied
pretty much by the facts the district attorney presented that Mr.
Al-Amin shot and killed my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Thomas Robinson is expected to act
for the state today, but Howard's spokesman, Erik Friedly,
indicated that Howard is considering joining the prosecution team
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Little else but the death penalty announcement is expected to
happen at today's hearing before Fulton Superior Court Judge
Stephanie B. Manis. Al-Amin will not enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time Black Panther is accused of killing Kinchen and
wounding Deputy Aldranon English when they tried to serve him with
a bench warrant on minor charges from Cobb County the night of
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, the imam of a West End mosque, was arrested six days
later in White Hall, Ala. He waived extradition, was returned to
Atlanta April 21 and lodged in the Cobb County Jail.

 &UR; c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Four of the ladies of Rylstone, England, who raised more than a
half-million dollars for cancer research by selling the English
version of their nude calendar, were in the United States this week
to preside over the introduction of an 18-month American version
(Workman; $10.95).
</P>
<P>
   The Yorkshirewomen _ all middle-aged members of the Rylstone and
District Women's Institute _ began work on the project after
 &UR; Angela Baker &LR; 's husband,  &UR; John &LR; , died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
(Profits from American sales of the calendar will be split between
the British Leukemia Research Fund and the Leukemia and Lymphoma
Society of the United States.) Their husbands didn't think they'd
really do it; their children were mostly grown. ``We'd got past the
stage of being embarrassed,'' said  &UR; Beryl &LR; 
 &UR; Mumford &LR; . ``It's a waste of time being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lynda Logan &LR; 's photographer husband,  &UR; Terry &LR; , agreed that the
models would wear bathrobes while being posed; he'd set up the
camera then leave the room, whereupon the robes would drop and
Lynda would snap the picture. This unwieldy scheme lasted for three
shots, after which all agreed to drop their clothes and get on with
it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a general level of agreement on standards. ``We knew
we wouldn't have bottoms in,'' said  &UR; Tricia Stewart &LR; , ``but we
didn't mind some nipples showing.'' ( &UR; Rosie O'Donnell &LR; 's producers
apparently didn't agree; the ladies said the nipples had been
airbrushed from pictures shown when they were Rosie's guests last
week.)
</P>
<P>
   The ladies were surrounded by media from day one, which was the
announcement of the project at the sole pub in Rylstone, one of
their sponsors.  &UR; Glenda Jackson &LR;  sent her congratulations the next
day. The phones haven't stopped ringing since then, they say; in
addition to the American calendar, they've signed a movie deal with
a British company linked to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been copycats. ``There have been some
terrible calendars,'' said Stewart, ``mainly men. There have been
fishermen and caravaners and people in mobile homes, and then the
butchers, `putting the beef back in Britain.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmmm,'' said Mumford, ``the cricketers weren't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Speaking of good deeds and clothing, or lack of it:
 &UR; Andrew Grimstad &LR; , secretary of the San Francisco Education Fund and
teacher at James Lick Middle School, hands out free ties to
students to wear to graduation, but he's out of them this year. If
you can contribute a newish tie, send it to  &UR; Andrew Grimstad &LR; , c/o
San Francisco Education Fund, 47 Kearny St., San Francisco, CA

   _ Soprano  &UR; Sylvia McNair &LR;  is touring the country singing music
written by  &UR; John Corigliano &LR;  to go with words of  &UR; Bob Dylan &LR;  songs,
including ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Blowin' in the Wind.''
Corigliano told Rolling Stone that he had never heard the original
songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends of mine found it bewildering, because they were so
used to the other versions. The point is, if a wonderful poem is
reset, it will have validity,'' said the composer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Persuasions' 21st album, ``Frankly A Cappella, The
Persuasions Sing Zappa,'' includes 16 works by the late  &UR; Frank &LR; 
 &UR; Zappa &LR; . In 1969, Zappa signed the group to his label, Straight,
which produced their first album, ``A Cappella.''

   &UR; Lynda Logan &LR; 's photographer husband,  &UR; Terry &LR; , agreed that the

Lynda would snap the picture. This unwieldy scheme lasted for three
shots, after which all agreed to drop their clothes and get on with
it.

   There was a general level of agreement on standards. ``We knew
we wouldn't have bottoms in,'' said  &UR; Tricia Stewart &LR; , ``but we
didn't mind some nipples showing.'' ( &UR; Rosie O'Donnell &LR; 's producers
apparently didn't agree; the ladies said the nipples had been
airbrushed from pictures shown when they were Rosie's guests last
week.)
</P>
<P>
   The ladies were surrounded by media from day one, which was the
announcement of the project at the sole pub in Rylstone, one of

addition to the American calendar, they've signed a movie deal with
a British company linked to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been copycats. ``There have been some
terrible calendars,'' said Stewart, ``mainly men. There have been
fishermen and caravaners and people in mobile homes, and then the
butchers, `putting the beef back in Britain.' ''

A NEW HARD ROCK, JUST WHAT TEEN-AGERS WERE WAITING FOR
</HEADLINE>
   (See also METAL-POPLIFE-TEAMS) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It was a spellbindingly intense and brutal
performance, and the concert hadn't even begun. Slipknot, an
explosive rock nonet from Des Moines, Iowa, was seething in a large
holding room backstage at the Live Oak Civic Center just outside
the city, warming up like a football team psyching itself for a
particularly fierce playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Its members, each masked and wearing orange prison coveralls,
were pacing across the room in different directions. A musician in
a grotesque clown mask menacingly swung a large PVC pipe as he
choked a rag clown doll in his other hand; another, in a gas mask,
squirted bottled water onto a groupie's T-shirt; others brandished
wooden planks, punched walls or dropped to the floor to stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly they met in a huddle, threw their hands to the center,
and let loose a ferocious scream that drowned out the 3,000 fans
chanting ``Slipknot.'' Then, one by one, they emerged onto the
stage, driving the crowd _ wearing shirts pledging allegiance to
other new hard-rock bands like Sevendust, Staind, Papa Roach and
System of a Down _ into a frenzy. Two teen-agers had already been
treated for injuries before Slipknot had even finished thrashing,
banging and raging through its first song about exploding angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels so easy to make a connection with these kids,'' said
Matt McDonough, or Spag, the drummer in Slipknot's opening act, the
face-painting scream-rock group Mudvayne. ``They're wanton.
Slipknot have them so pumped up that you could walk up to a mike
and burp, and they'd go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Murray, the singer in the other opening act, the
electro-metal group Ultraspank, shook his head. ``It was like this
when we toured with Incubus too,'' he said. ``You get the feeling
that something is going on, but you don't know exactly what it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that a new school of hard-edged rock bands
have formed a loose association from years of relentless touring
together. Most are composed of ordinary-looking suburban or
small-town 20-to-30-year-olds playing hard rock that is vaguely
influenced by hip-hop or electronicaand sounds fresh but not
necessarily new. From the best to the most mediocre, the majority
of these acts are selling an impressive 500,000 albums, but none
have crossed the million mark that would make them blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, through touring and the power of promotion on the
Internet, the bands and their audience are reaching the boiling
point at which they bubble into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Since grunge and alternative rock began fading in 1994 with the
suicide of Kurt Cobain, there has been no great resurgence of rock
'n' roll, only isolated successes. But the same year, something new
was rising from the ashes: Korn, a motley quintet of self-professed
white trash from Bakersfield, Calif., put out its first album, a
bottom-heavy, rap-friendly primal scream produced by Ross Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the older and more politically minded Rage Against
the Machine, the denser Tool, and, later, the more watered-down and
nakedly ambitious Limp Bizkit, Korn began attracting not just the
remnants of the alternative rock audience but also heavy metal,
thrash and hard-core fans looking for something new.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1997, Ozzy Osbourne brought his Ozzfest to arenas and
stadiums, providing an inadvertent launching pad for what some are
calling the new rock, new metal or heavy alternative movement. To
wide industry surprise, Ozzfest became the year's second-highest
grossing tour (bested by Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair.) Performing
in Ozzfest, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, Powerman 5000, Machine Head,
Soulfly, Incubus, Coal Chamber, Sevendust, Static-X, Deftones,
Godsmack and System of a Down proved their metal, significantly
expanding (or in some cases, creating) their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ozzfest gave new rock its roots with
performances from elder statesmen, including Osbourne's pioneering
metal band, Black Sabbath; well-known hard-rock bands that formed
in the '80s like Slayer, White Zombie and Pantera, and other
hard-rockers of the late '80s and early '90s that never broke into
the mainstream, including Neurosis, Fear Factory and Type O
Negative. Thanks in part to Ozzfest and similar tours, the teen-age
audiences of the newer bands began working their way backward to
Metallica, Kiss and Black Sabbath while older metal fans began
lining up to get into Static-X, Deftones and Slipknot shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzfest was very important,'' said Serj Tinkian of System of a
Down. ``It put us in front of a lot of kids. We did it twice, and
it's had a huge impact on this band.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike followers in 1994, when Korn emerged, fans who are into
dense, heavy new rock today can dedicate entire CD collections to
the genre because of a seemingly bottomless supply of young bands.
And they are remarkably diverse, ranging from spiritualists to
nihilists, pop to noise. P.O.D. and Project 86 preach positive,
Christian messages; System of a Down incorporates Armenian folk
music; Coal Chamber is practically a gothic-rock band; Incubus
comes from a more sensitive, melodic pop place, and Disturbed and
Slipknot sing about fenced-in people pushed to a breaking point,
the former with driving pop hooks and the latter with an all-out
percussive assault.
</P>
<P>
   Though almost every label now boasts its own new rock phalanx,
for years nobody wanted to sign these acts, many of which have been
laboring since the early '90s. Slipknot, according to its manager,
was rejected by 10 labels before landing on an imprint of
Roadrunner Records run by Robinson of Korn fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy at Sony told us, `If this is the future of music, I
don't want to be alive,''' recalled Joey Jordison, Slipknot's
silver-masked drummer. ``I just thought, `If that's what he thinks,
then we are doing something right.'''
</P>
<P>
   With at least four major rock tours crossing the country in the
summer _ including Ozzfest, Tattoo the Earth (featuring Slipknot),
MTV's Return of the Rock Tour (with P.O.D.), and the Family Values
Tour founded by Korn _ many are expecting hard rock to have a new
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer is going to be huge,'' said Shawn Crahan, who
performs in a clown mask on an elevating percussion platform in
Slipknot. ``Every week our album sales are going up. I always knew
it was going to happen; I just didn't know it would happen this
quickly. But it's refreshing because it lets me know that I'm not
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new groups promote their music the way hip-hop acts
do, using street teams of fans who work free, dispensing cassettes
and stickers at schools and outside concerts. But, in another
parallel to hip-hop, fans are often fair-weather, passionately
embracing a band and then dumping it for something fresher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korn and Limp Bizkit are over,'' said Dustin Lux, 15, who
attended the Slipknot concert here. ``They fell off. Slipknot is
the future of music.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the music business once shunned this music like
yesterday's disco, today's metal bands have developed organically,
and the industry is embracing it again. And not just for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not you're a fan personally of this music, there's
no way you can deny that it is regrouping kids and creating a sense
of community and dialogue among them,'' said John Rubeli, the scout
who signed P.O.D. and Project 86 to Atlantic Records. ``Being
around these bands and out at these shows, it's the most honest,
real environment musically you're going to find.''

 &HT;    Educator's death shakes community
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alonzo A. Crim was an outsider who brought calm and
academic focus to Atlanta's public schools during the 15 years that
followed the tumultuous desegregation agreement of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As the city's first African-American school superintendent, he
set out to settle the political waters. Over the years, his focus
turned on educating the city's children, especially its poorest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this city yet knows what an impact Dr. Crim had
on the school system per se in resolving the racial difficulties
that desegregation had imposed,'' said Ozell Sutton, a U.S. Justice
Department official in Atlanta who worked with Crim to implement
the desegregation settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Crim, 71, was killed in a three-car accident early Wednesday,
about three blocks from the high school named for him after he
retired as superintendent in 1988. The flags at Crim High School
and at Atlanta's other 96 schools flew at half-staff out of respect
for the courtly, Harvard-educated Chicago native who guided the
system through difficult years.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Crim was driving in the wrong direction in a
reversible lane about 12:20 a.m. when he swerved to avoid hitting a
car, then collided with another. He died about an hour later at
Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Fortier, 25, swerved to avoid hitting Crim, police said, but
Crim's black and white 1985 Mercedes Benz sideswiped her 1997 Ford
Taurus. Fortier's arms and legs were injured, but she was able to
get out of her vehicle and attempted to give Crim mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation after his car collided into a 1999 Volkswagen Passat
driven by Francis Treadway. Neither Treadway nor Fortier was
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Crim's death hit many Atlantans hard.
</P>
<P>
   Friends recalled how active he had remained in the cause of
education. In the days before he died, he was teaching Georgia
State University graduate students, helping find a facility for a
summer mentoring program and serving on the board of Cities in
Schools, an alternative program for would-be dropouts that he
helped start in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him well said Crim was still grieving the loss of
Gwendolyn, his wife of 50 years, who died just two months ago. One
Hundred Black Men of Atlanta, a service organization in which Crim
was active, called a news conference to express their sadness and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us the confidence to know that we can make a
difference in the life of a child,'' said Terrell Slayton,
Georgia's assistant secretary of state and a 100 Black Men member.
``And to that, I say. 'Thank you, Lonzo Crim.'''

MAJOR INDEXES DECLINE BY MORE THAN 2 PERCENT ON RATE ANXIETIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices skidded Wednesday as investors absorbed
more troubling data on the rapid growth of the economy and braced
for more such disappointment Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The major market gauges fell more than 2 percent. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost ground for the fifth time in six sessions,
falling 250.99 points, or 2.34 percent, to 10,480.13. The Nasdaq
composite dropped 78.14 points, or 2.06 percent, to 3,707.31, while
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was off 31.19 points, or 2.16
percent, to 1,415.10.
</P>
<P>
   The worrisome evidence of economic strength showed up in a
government report that factory orders in March were higher than
expected, in a Federal Reserve survey showing ``intensifying wage
pressures'' and in comments by a top central bank official, William
McDonough, on economic imbalances and strains. Productivity figures
are to be released Thursday, and a crucial report on the labor
market is due Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such data is seen as increasing the amount by which the Fed, at
a meeting on May 16, is likely to raise interest rates, for the
sixth time since last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous anxiety around the rate hike,'' said John
Peluso, a senior trader at Lehman Brothers. ``The market is more
and more perceiving a 50-basis-point rise coming down the pike.''
Almost nobody expects the Fed to leave rates alone, and those still
expecting a rise limited to 25 points, or one-quarter percentage
point, are now a clear minority.
</P>
<P>
   Another drag on the market Wednesday was a downgrading of
Wal-Mart and other retail shares by Goldman, Sachs, which said that
the national shopping spree was winding down as retailers faced
cost pressures. Wal-Mart, the biggest chain, sagged 4 3/16, to 53
7/16, and Sears, Roebuck fell 2|, to 36 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed should misjudge the needed credit restraint, others
said, the economy could move quickly from too much growth to too
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy's extremely leveraged to the wealth effect,'' said
Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corp.
``If we see the stock market slow down, we think consumer spending
dries up pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   And stock values have shriveled, with the Nasdaq composite and
the Dow industrials each down 8.9 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   While a few food and beverage stocks resisted the latest
downturn _ Coca-Cola rose 2\, to 48{, the only Dow component to
gain as much as a point _ drugs and other so-called defensive
stocks mostly succumbed to moderate selling pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Technology was hit hard, with Novell down 6 15/16, to 10|, after
reporting poor earnings; Hewlett-Packard down 5 9/16, to 132{;
Cisco Systems down 1 15/16, to 66 1/16; and AT&AMP;T, downgraded by
PaineWebber, slumping for a second day. AT&AMP;T fell 2 3/16, to 39},
while its newly marketed wireless unit fell 13/16, to 31 7/16,
after reaching 36 on Monday. Microsoft, however, edged up 11/16, to
70 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, skidding 5 5/16, to 88 1/16, suffered from a
Lehman Brothers recommendation to switch from it to Ford, which
lost 7/16, to 52 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, object of a bid late Tuesday by Unilever, jumped 10
11/16, to 61\. Disney fell 1\, to 41\, but reported
better-than-expected earnings for its second quarter after the
close of normal trading.

   More than 80,000 workers went on strike, disrupting
construction, printing, freight hauling, maritime transport, hotels
and restaurants, and sparking hoarding of consumer goods by people
fearing an extended walkout. The strike was called after members of
Norway's main umbrella trade union turned down wage and benefit
offers negotiated by their leaders with the employers' association.
No new talks are set.

DERBY PICK IS ASSIGNED POST NO. 16 IN FIELD OF 20 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A full field of 20 horses was entered Thursday
in the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday, with Fusaichi Pegasus
starting from the 16th stall in the outside auxiliary gate and
ranked as the 9-5 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should keep him out of trouble,'' said Neil Drysdale, who
trains the star for the Japanese venture capitalist Fusai
Sekiguchi. ``The other spots give you a long time to stand in the
gate. So, why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   The second choice, The Deputy, trained by Jenine Sahadi, will
start from the 11th slot at 4-1. D. Wayne Lukas, who has won the
Derby four times, selected three positions near the outside: No. 13
for Commendable, No. 17 for Exchange Rate and No. 18 for High
Yield, winner of the Fountain of Youth Stakes and the Blue Grass
and the third choice for the Derby at 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Outside post positions were favored for several of the most
highly rated horses in the Derby as part of an evolving strategy
for the mile-and-a-quarter race, since maximum fields of 20 tend to
create traffic jams near the rail that often determine the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the inside or rail position has produced the most
winners, 12 in all; the outside slots, the fewest. But even with
two starting gates in use, 14 horses starting in the main gate and
six in the auxiliary, trainers tend now to favor the less cluttered
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the last five runnings of the Derby have been won by
horses who started in the auxiliary gate. Last year, Charismatic
broke from the 16th slot and Menifee, who finished second, started
from No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we won it,'' Lukas said, ``we had to agonize over
the draw. But we found that, more important than where you start,
is which horses start next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Irwin, one of the owners of The Deputy, agreed. He
reported that once Fusaichi Pegasus had drawn the 16th spot, the
people directing strategy for The Deputy changed their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about taking No. 17,'' Irwin said, ``but instead of
getting next to a keg of dynamite. we decided to go inside of him
and took No. 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher, making his first appearance as a trainer in the
Derby, entered all four of his candidates and spread his post
positions this way: No. 6 for the undefeated speed horse Trippi,
No. 10 for More Than Ready, No. 14 for Graeme Hall and No. 15 for
Impeachment. He, too, admitted that some strategy had prompted his
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``More Than Ready won't have to stand in the gate too long,'' he
said, ``and Graeme Hall has extra space because he's at the end of
the main gate and there's more room between that spot and the
auxiliary gate.''
</P>
<P>
   The draw was conducted in two tiers: First, an order of
selection was established by lot. Then, according to the order of
selection, post positions were chosen. The first pick went to Bob
Baffert, who has won the Derby twice in the last three years but
who has become a kind of lonesome man this year. He selected the
No. 8 stall in the center of the pack for his horse, Captain Steve,
who was made the fifth choice at early odds of 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher, with his team of four starters, is a former assistant
to Lukas, who saddled five horses in the 1996 Derby and who won
with Charismatic last year. When Lukas was asked if he had any
advice for his onetime pupil, he replied with a straight face: ``I
told him it was a big job, and he should scratch three.''
</P>
<P>
   The full field meant there was no room for Unshaded, who won the
Lexington Stakes but was never nominated for the Kentucky Derby,
His trainer, Carl Nafzger, has been training the colt at Churchill
Downs in case the owner, James Tafel, was willing to put up the
supplemental fee of $150,000 to enter his horse, and if the field
fell short of the maximum of 20 horses, all of whom would get
preference. But when Ronton was confirmed as a starter, Unshaded
was blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate who dropped out of the Derby was Harlan
Traveler, third in the Lexington and third in the Swale. The
decision was left to the colt's trainer, Ray Lawrence Jr., who
decided Wednesday morning that Harlan Traveler simply didn't have
enough seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm behind the 8-ball with him,'' Lawrence acknowledged. ``I
just don't have enough into him. This race is plenty tough if
you've got all your ducks lined up. But when you're trying to play
catch-up, it's just about impossible. I look at this race and I see
five or six horses I know we can't beat right now, so what are we
running for?''
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Traveler's defection opened a slot for Curule, a second
runner for the Godolphin stable from the Middle East, who will join
China Visit among the 20 starters. Curule has raced only four
times, all four in Dubai, with one victory. But the trainer, Saeed
bin Suroor, who saddled Worldly Manner in the Derby (seventh last
year), expressed satisfaction with both colts' workouts.
</P>
<P>
   China Visit held his final workout Wednesday morning, going five
furlongs in 1:01 2/5. Curule arrived Tuesday, cantered this morning
and will gallop up to the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders are a continuing part of the strategy of Sheik
Mohammed al-Maktoum of Dubai to extend his racing empire
internationally.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The rider on China Visit will be Frankie Dettori, while the
jockey on Curule will be Marlon St. Julien. According to the
Churchill Downs records, St. Julien will be the first
African-American rider in the Derby since Henry King in 1921. St.
Julien comes from Louisiana, made his reputation at Texas tracks
and recently has had two smashing seasons at Keeneland. In the
early years of the Kentucky Derby, black jockeys predominated,
winning 15 of the first 28 runnings. And 13 of the 15 horses in the
inaugural Derby in 1875 were ridden by black jockeys.

COMMENTARY: A FOOL'S ERRAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Conover and I met Michael Farmer during basic training at
Fort Dix, N.J., in the mid-1960s. Conover and I were friends from
Montclair. Farmer was a kid from Atlantic City, a 17-year-old who
mumbled so badly you could never be sure what he was saying. He was
big and good-looking, but the first impression was that he wasn't
too swift.
</P>
<P>
   One night Farmer came over to our barracks _ uninvited _ while
Conover and I, who were a couple of years older and light years
cooler, were sitting on the floor, spit-shining our combat boots.
Very tentatively and very politely, Farmer asked if he could join
us.
</P>
<P>
   I told him to get lost. Farmer must not have understood because
he promptly sat down, took off his boots and, over the next few
minutes, proved to my satisfaction that he was as dumb as he
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   First he told us he had joined the Army. Conover grinned and
rolled his eyes. Then Farmer said he was in love with a girl in
Atlantic City and planned to marry her. I shook my head. This was
not a person worth spending time with. As a draftee, all I wanted
was for my hair to grow back and to be reunited with that gleaming
symbol of freedom and the good life, my Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   But Conover liked Farmer and told him to come back the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mumbles,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   But Conover said, ``Ah, he's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   So Farmer came back, night after night, to smoke cigarettes,
listen to Motown music, mumble about his girlfriend and polish
boots. To my chagrin, I started to like him, though I still needed
a translator to understand him. For the longest time I thought his
girlfriend's name was Merlin. It was Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and Conover became very close. Eventually both of them
were sent to Vietnam. I got lucky and was sent to Korea, which was
no walk in the park. But it wasn't Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the war on Conover and Farmer was strange. When
Farmer came back, he seemed more sure of himself, more open and
fun-loving, less insecure. He and Marilyn were married.
</P>
<P>
   Conover, the most happy-go-lucky guy I had ever known, was a
wreck. He was nervous. Jumpy. Some nights he would drink like a
fiend. The cheerful optimism that had once defined his personality
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't really talk about Vietnam. All I ever heard him say
was, ``Didn't know I could get so scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the unthinkable happened. Farmer, who had enlisted for four
years and was still in the service, got orders to go back to
Vietnam. We told him not to go. Call your congressman, we said.
Fight this thing. But Farmer didn't know how.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to guess what happened. Farmer's second tour
lasted only a few months. I was in the back of my father's
upholstery shop one afternoon when Conover walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmer didn't make it,'' he said. And then he started crying.
</P>
<P>
   A year passed. I got a job with a newspaper. Conover got
married. Other buddies got killed in the war, which began to look
like it might go on forever. My sister's boyfriend got shot.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't realize it, but Conover's struggle was winding down. He
wouldn't make it, either. I never got the story straight. All I
know is that he got his hands on a gun, and one night he waited in
a car outside his house for his wife to come home. When she showed
up he shot her dead. Then he killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, which I
cannot think about without thinking of Farmer and Conover. Neither
had a clue about the politics or the history or the egos that
sucked them up like dust from a carpet and consigned them to their
pointless fate. Vietnam was a fool's errand, and the young and the
ignorant went to their doom by the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   When David Brinkley, appalled by the carnage, asked Lyndon
Johnson why he didn't just pull out of Vietnam, thus saving many
lives, Johnson replied, ``I'm not going to be the first American
president to lose a war.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago I visited the Vietnam Memorial in
Washington. I found Farmer's name, and then, not thinking, looked
for Conover's. Of course, it wasn't there. But his short life and
that of his wife, whose name I don't know, were wasted by Vietnam
just a surely as the lives of those 58,000 other Americans listed
on that bitter wall.

THE WINTRY MUSIC OF T.S. ELIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7)  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ T.S. Eliot's ``Family Reunion'' has risen greatly in
critical esteem since it flopped like unleavened dough in the West
End 60-odd years ago. Many now regard the poet's story of the
English lord impelled by updated Furies to atone for his wife's
dark death as the nearest to a theatrical masterpiece Eliot ever
wrote. Even the more skeptical would probably agree that the play
is interesting as an experimental attempt to restore verse to
British drama, or at least as an indirect insight into its author's
own awful marriage.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will doubtless make up their own minds when the
Royal Shakespeare Company's revival of the play opens at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an influential essay published in 1950 shows how close ``The
Family Reunion'' came to joining the bric-a-brac of history in the
theatrical junkyard. According to this, the play lacks dramatic
development. Its overabrupt conclusion comes ``after an
interminable amount of preparation.'' The mix of the mythic and
modern is awkward. The author tries to update ``The Oresteia,''
suggesting that the House of Monchensey is a British House of
Atreus poisoned to its roots by sins both recent and long ago, but
fails either to stick closely to Aeschylus or to venture far enough
away from him _ and so remains marooned in an artistic no man's
land.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, an attempt to transform the aunts and uncles in Lord
Monchensey's drawing room into a Greek chorus is woefully
unsuccessful. The Furies pursuing this troubled aristocrat are a
disaster, since in practice they look like uninvited guests from a
fancy dress ball or a swarming football team or a Disney cartoon or
half-visible shrubbery outside the window. And it's hard for the
audience to sympathize with a hero who renounces his mother, his
house and his heritage for the spiritual life, when he is plainly
an ``insufferable prig.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should we still listen to this contemptuous and possibly
contemptible diatribe? Well, because the critic with the long sword
was T.S. Eliot himself. He believed he had learned much about
stagecraft from the failure of ``The Family Reunion.'' Others might
say he had lost his nerve, had begun to prove it by writing the
fascinating but far less ambitious ``Cocktail Party'' and was about
to destroy the credibility of a renaissance of poetic drama in
Britain with a flimsy comedy called ``The Confidential Clerk.''
Subtler or slyer critics might add that ``The Family Reunion'' was
too close to the psychological bone for the self-effacing Eliot's
liking.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Monchensey returns to his ancestral home at least as
dejected as Eliot himself was in 1936, when he began to write ``The
Family Reunion.'' He has, he believes, been as guilty of
wife-murder as Orestes was of matricide. He has killed Lady
Monchensey by pushing her off an ocean liner. This naturally shocks
his family, who assume he is hallucinating, but the death itself is
a relief to all. The poor woman was a bitter if fragile neurotic,
jealous of her husband's friends and relations: ``A restless,
shivering painted shadow'' who wanted to bring Harry ``down to her
own level.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she was very like Vivien Haigh-Wood, the
Englishwoman the 27-year-old Eliot dismayed his parents by marrying
in 1915. To the virginal young American newly arrived in Britain
she seemed glamorous and exciting, but beneath her surface vivacity
she was deeply troubled. To read Peter Ackroyd's biography of the
poet, ``T.S. Eliot,'' is like reading doctors' notes. Vivien
variously suffered from neuralgia, menstrual cramps, fainting fits,
malnutrition, ``catarrh of the intestines,'' septic influenza,
paralysis, hysteria, manic depression, panic attacks, paranoia and
obsessional behavior, meaning she constantly washed her hands. She
made Eliot as unhappy as he clearly made her.
</P>
<P>
   Tranquilizing drugs, mainly morphine and ether, seem to have
harmed rather than helped. Vivien became a possessive wife who
enjoyed embarrassing Eliot before his friends and encouraged him to
reject many of them. Conrad Aiken had a dinner with the two of them
at which, looking like a ``shivering, shuddering'' scarecrow, she
traded hate-filled tirades with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   When Edith Sitwell met her by chance in the street, Vivien
responded to her greeting with, ``No, no, you have mistaken me
again for that terrible woman who is so like me and is always
getting me into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Virginia Woolf she kept hornets under her bed and then
accused her of having an affair with Eliot. She was rumored to
carry a knife in her handbag.
</P>
<P>
   It could not go on indefinitely, and it didn't. Vivien never
accepted that Eliot had left her, but he did just that when he took
a professorship at Harvard for the year 1932-33, asked his lawyers
to send her a Deed of Separation while he was in America and
refused to have anything to do with her after his return.
</P>
<P>
   There is little clear information about her later activities,
though it is known that she saw her husband's play ``Murder in the
Cathedral'' seven times in 1936 and was committed to a London
mental hospital in 1938. When Eliot heard she had died there in
1947, he buried his head in his hands, crying: ``Oh, God! Oh,
God!''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot said that the character in ``The Family Reunion'' most
like him was Harry's Uncle Charles, a genial Mayfair
man-about-town; but that is surely disingenuous or self-deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   There is doubtless substance in the skeptical portrait of the
poet, and the more sympathetic one of Vivien, that Michael Hastings
painted in his 1984 play and 1994 screenplay ``Tom and Viv.'' What
must it have been like to be married to such a man?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and '30s Eliot was more like the ``insufferable
prig'' himself, a remote, intellectually disdainful figure, who was
consumed with guilt at the antipathy he felt for his impossible
wife and who found a grim consolation for his misery in religion.
Eliot did not ``push'' Vivien into any sea, but then neither did
Harry, not literally. Harry probably watched as his wife went over
the rails, Eliot as she went off them.

GORE SAYS BUSH HAS `SECRET PLAN' TO PRIVATIZE SOCIAL SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Democratic presidential contender Al Gore
Wednesday accused George W. Bush and his advisers of hatching ``a
secret plan'' to privatize Social Security that would ruin the
retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president used an address before a New Jersey labor
group to underscore his differences with his Republican rival over
how to deal with Social Security's long-term solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, the tax-funded retirement and disability plan
established in the 1930s, is emerging as a key issue in this year's
presidential battle, with both sides staking out unambiguously
distinct positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to extend the life of Social Security, by pumping
more money into the system from the projected federal budget
surplus and savings from a reduced national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has embraced the concept of letting people invest in the
markets a portion of the payroll taxes now earmarked for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In his address Wednesday at this seaside gambling resort, Gore
was most critical of the Texas governor's intentions to keep all
but a general outline of his proposal out of public view before the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just smiles and goes on with the smug assumption that there
is no need to share with you the details of what he wants to do,''
Gore told members of the state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly referred to Bush's Social Security proposal as
his ``secret plan'' _ evoking memories of Richard Nixon promising
voters during his 1968 presidential campaign that he had a ``secret
plan'' to end the war in Vietnam. Nixon won the election but lost
the war in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also touched on other issues, including his
support of legislation opposed by labor unions that would ease
trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged he differed with labor leaders on the China
bill, but said he believed it would increase American jobs. While
some in the audience said they disagreed with Gore on trade, they
were still supporting him, citing his other pro-labor stands and
their dislike of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president revamped his speech to stress Social Security
after news stories appeared this week reporting that Bush advisers
say the governor intends to step up his support of private
retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides have said, however, that the governor won't provide
details of how such a complicated plan would work until after the
November election. Bush has said he could better bring Democrats
and Republicans together on the issue after he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reuters News Service Wednesday, Bush said,
``the fundamental issue is to convince both Republicans and
Democrats that now is the time to reform the system, that there's a
need for reform and that I am the president who will be willing to
spend the capital to get something done.'' He said that if elected
he would make private Social Security accounts one of his top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore attacked such privatization plans as too risky, saying they
could destroy Social Security by allowing people to withdraw money
needed to pay benefits. With Bush's proposed large tax cut
siphoning off most of the surplus, Gore argued, there would not be
enough federal funds to make up any shortfalls in the retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Social Security may be 65 years old this year, we're not
ready to retire it, no matter what George W. Bush and his advisers
say,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Karen Hughes attacked Gore's opposition
to private Social Security funds, saying that the vice president
has not been opposed to investing his own money in the markets.
Citing his financial disclosure forms, the campaign said that Gore
owns between $250,000 and $500,000 in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Aaron, a Social Security expert at the Brookings
Institution who opposes Social Security privatization, said Bush is
being politically smart by not revealing details of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in Bush's shoes I would do just what he was doing.
If I were in Gore's shoes I wouldn't let him get away with it,''
Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a detailed plan would raise numerous questions,
such as who would bear the most risk if the markets did not perform
as expected and how high administrative costs would be.
</P>
<P>
   The Brookings expert said the risk for Bush if he remains vague
is that Gore likely will continue doing what he did before the
labor group _ citing the various plans proposed by Bush's advisers
as examples of the governor's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron said Gore's strategy will be, ``You won't tell the
American public what your plan is. I'll tell the American public
what your plan is and it isn't very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of those Bush advisers whom Gore singled out for
favoring Social Security privatization, Lawrence Lindsey, told
reporters this week that major changes must be made to the system
to ensure its long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kind of strengthening of the Social Security system must
be done, and Vice President Gore maintaining that the present
system is fine and if it ain't broke, don't fix it _ I really don't
know what planet he is on,'' Lindsey said.

LONDON: went off them.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Creative cause and effect are always hard to pin down, but
nobody could claim that ``The Family Reunion'' is the work of a
contented man. The Furies are eventually revealed as the Eumenides,
or kindly ones, as they are in Aeschylus' ``Oresteia.'' But they
still require Harry to live a life of ascetic self-sacrifice. The
play's verse is as bleak as that of ``Burnt Norton,'' which Eliot
wrote in 1935 and eventually integrated into his book of poems
``Four Quartets.'' You can feel the dread in phrases like ``the
sobbing in the chimney, the evil in the dark closet''; ``the wind's
talk in the dry holly-tree''; ``the unspoken voice of sorrow in the
ancient bedroom at 3 o'clock in the morning.'' You can also hear
the poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot was not the only major writer who tried to help the
English theater recover its long-lost poetic prowess _ Shelley and
Browning had similar hopes _ but with him it became an obsession.
Again and again he argued that ``the human soul, in intense
emotion, strives to express itself in verse.'' Again and again he
debated ways of making colloquial dialogue and contemporary
conflict as poetic as they had been in the Jacobean era. As late as
1950 he was declaring that there were emotional and spiritual
aspects to life, ``which prose drama was wholly inadequate to
express.''
</P>
<P>
   But if we discount ``The Rock,'' a pageant about the building of
a church, Eliot's first serious attempt at verse drama was, by his
own admission, a ``dead end.'' ``Murder in the Cathedral'' remains
a memorable account of the martyrdom of Thomas a Becket; but it was
designed for special performance in Canterbury Cathedral and aimed
at those serious people who, as Eliot said, go to festivals and
``expect to have to put up with poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted was to bring depth to the drawing rooms where
successful West End plays were invariably set and ask audiences to
listen to poetry ``from people dressed like ourselves, living in
houses and apartments like ours, and using telephones and motor
cars and radio sets.''
</P>
<P>
   With this aim in mind, he endlessly revised ``The Family
Reunion.'' According to Michael Redgrave, who played Harry after
Eliot rejected John Gielgud as ``not religious enough to understand
the character's motivation,'' the author sat uneasily aloof at
rehearsals but was always ready to adjust the text. He must, then,
have been shaken by the reviews that followed the play's opening in
March 1939. Virtually all the London critics found the play
literary, slow and abstruse, and they were hardly more sympathetic
when it received its first major revival in 1955, even though Peter
Brook was the director and Paul Scofield played Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Family Reunion'' fared no better in postwar Manhattan,
where it was staged first at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1947, then
on Broadway in 1958. Reviewing the second production in The New
York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised Lillian Gish for endowing the
wisest of Harry's aunts with spiritual strength but thought the
play ``a wordy drama about uninteresting people engaged in a
struggle that they are not eager to explain.'' The irony is that
well before this revival Eliot had come to agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   A bolder dramatist might have reacted to criticism by drawing on
his unique strengths and increasing his poetry's intensity. Eliot
did the opposite. ``The Cocktail Party,'' which appeared in 1949,
also involves a spiritual loner who rejects the humdrum world for
the religious life. She is far more sympathetic, humbler and warmer
than Harry, perhaps partly because Eliot had himself been thawed by
a second, much happier marriage. But the language has lost much of
its originality. In his own words, he had put the verse on such ``a
very thin diet'' that it was ``an open question whether there is
any poetry in the play at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His last two plays, which appeared in 1953 and 1958, not only
confirm that view but justify those who felt that, far from
transforming the West End, he had let the West End transform him.
He had chosen to tailor three-piece dramas in conventional gray
flannel. ``The Confidential Clerk,'' a comedy about a young man
with a religious vocation, was dismissed by one critic as ``a
repertory of West End gestures,'' and ``The Elder Statesman,'' in
which a politician confronts his past sins, was damned by another,
with a sneering reference to the father of drawing-room drama. It
was, wrote Kenneth Tynan, ``Pinero on stilts.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival in London of John Osborne's ``Look Back in Anger''
in 1956 and the kitchen-sink drama that followed did even more
damage to Eliot's crusade. Christopher Fry, Ronald Duncan and
others who had helped him pioneer a poetic revival in Britain also
fell victim to the vogue for social realism. Yet that, in turn,
came to seem imaginatively limiting, and in 1979 Michael Elliott
staged a production of ``The Family Reunion'' in London that was
surprisingly well received. Reviewers who no longer demanded
consistency of style or tone seemed exhilarated by the
inventiveness of Eliot's language and chilled by Furies transmuted
into towering ghosts in white cowls.
</P>
<P>
   That was, as it happened, also the first time I had seen ``The
Family Reunion'' onstage, and I recall wishing to dig Eliot up and
give his skeleton a shaking. How could he have been so intimidated
by the conventional drama of his day? Yes, Harry is a bit of a
prig, but to a critic half-deadened by endless insular plays about
the British class system, Eliot's insistence that the man has a
soul to discover seemed infinitely refreshing. And, yes, some of
the verse was flat, but much of it resonated with that strange
wintry music that made him perhaps the greatest of 20th-century
poets. It was as if Eliot were telling the dramatists of his day
and mine that there were possibilities, spiritual and verbal, they
had never even contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will, as I say, make up their own minds about Adrian
Noble's revival at BAM. (It is being accompanied by ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream'' and Schiller's ``Don Carlos.'') But most of the
British critics now find the play's oddities more than digestible.
``The RSC has struck gold,'' declared John Gross in The Sunday
Telegraph, adding that even when ``The Family Reunion'' becomes
elusive or off-putting, it is ``curiously compelling _ you succumb
to its spell.''
</P>
<P>
   John Peter in The Sunday Times wrote, ``A tense, gaunt,
uncluttered production of Eliot's greatest play.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after his death, Eliot the
dramatist-who-might-have-been has gained posthumous recognition.
Ours is an era that no longer winces at choruses on the patterned
carpet or Furies behind the leather armchair or echoes of the
``Four Quartets'' beside the drinks cupboard. We don't shrink from
stylized language, whether it has been written by Aeschylus,
Shakespeare, Synge, Beckett or Pinter. We tend to think that the
argument about the need for a poetic drama misses the point by
confusing poetry with verse.
</P>
<P>
   Prose can be poetic, and poetry prosaic. Given the right
director and actors, can't ``The Oresteia,'' ``The Family
Reunion,'' ``Waiting for Godot,'' ``The Homecoming'' and ``American
Buffalo'' achieve the kind of elusive magic that Eliot had in mind?
Why not?

CLINTON GOES TO CLASSROOMS TO PROMOTE EDUCATION PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWENSBORO, Ky. _ President Clinton visited an elementary school
here on Wednesday to read ``Charlotte's Web'' with fourth-graders
and promote his latest plan to help states turn around failing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Audubon Elementary, was Clinton's first stop on a
two-day tour of public schools in Kentucky, Iowa, Minnesota and
Ohio. The trip is meant to draw attention to his proposals to hold
failing schools more accountable, increase school construction,
open more charter schools and improve teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   With only eight months left in the White House, Clinton is eager
to emphasize what he thinks of as his legacy in education, one of
his pet issues in more than two decades of public service.
</P>
<P>
   He is also hoping to draw attention to Vice President Al Gore's
education proposals while at least indirectly criticizing those of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's battle against Bush is expected to be fierce in all four
states that Clinton is visiting on this trip _ Bush recently ran an
advertisement attacking the Clinton administration's education
policies in Kentucky and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's school tour also comes at a time when his
administration is wrangling with the Republicans in Congress over a
major education law that Congress must reauthorize this year.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, governs how
more than $15 billion in annual federal aid to public schools is
spent. The Republicans want the money to be distributed to the
states in block grants and let them direct it toward any
educational programs, including private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration would distribute the money in grants
targeted to programs that it wants schools to embrace, like
mentoring for teachers and summer school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to excellence for all our children is not to take
money away from our schools through vouchers,'' Clinton said in a
speech to several hundred students, parents and teachers, ``but to
combine the money with high standards, accountability and the tools
teachers, children and parents need to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians have held up Kentucky as a model for education
reform, because a court ruling here in 1989 led to the most
comprehensive overhaul of public education the nation had ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   A court order required the state to sharply increase aid to poor
school districts, which used the money to reduce class size,
improve curriculums, increase preschool programs and create a
statewide testing system.
</P>
<P>
   Audubon Elementary School, with 450 students, most of them from
families classified as poor, used to have some of the lowest test
scores in the state. But it now ranks 18th in the state, with 70
percent of its students performing above average on reading tests.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton saluted the school's turnaround and
announced that he would send teams from the Department of Education
into other states to make sure they are ``meeting their
responsibilities on low-performing schools.'' He also announced
that the Education Department would begin publishing annual reports
listing the nation's lowest performing schools and the strategies
being used to improve them.

CARDINAL O'CONNOR, NEW YORK'S ARCHBISHOP, IS NEAR DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of New York, who underwent surgery for a brain tumor last August,
was near death Wednesday, after his health sharply declined in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on the steps of the cardinal's Madison
Avenue residence Wednesday, Joseph Zwilling, the spokesman for the
archdiocese, said ``the cardinal is at the hour of his death.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the cardinal's grave condition spread quickly through
the city and the archdiocese as speculation over his possible
successor as archbishop once again intensified. This week, the name
of Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., flew to the top
of a list of candidates that has included William F. Murphy, an
auxiliary bishop of Boston; Edwin O'Brien, who heads the
archdiocese for the military services; Henry J. Mansell, the bishop
of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Justin F. Rigali, the archbishop of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of an archbishop, however, is a secret process
that rests in the hands of the Vatican, and appointments often come
as a surprise to those in the church who though they were in the
know.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, spiritual leader of 2.4 million Catholics in the New
York area, has waged a largely private battle through brain surgery
followed by radiation, disappearing from public view over the last
10 weeks as his illness, which he declined to call cancer, claimed
the last of his vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said Wednesday that the cardinal ``is not communicating
at this point.'' The spokesman declined to say whether O'Connor,
whose wry humor had guests chuckling through a fund-raiser on his
80th birthday in January, had been administered last rites
Wednesday, technically known as ``the sacrament of the sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know precisely when he will die,'' Zwilling said,
``but I think it is clear that he is, in Catholic terms, at the
hour of his death.'' He was referring to the ``Hail Mary,'' a
prayer in which Catholics implore the Virgin Mary to ``pray for us
at the hour of our death.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwilling said the cardinal was not in any pain, and that his
sister and other family members were at his side, as were the
priests who live with him and a few close friends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Catholic Center's 22-story tower on First Avenue _ the
central nervous system of a vast diocese that spans Manhattan, the
Bronx and Staten Island, along with seven counties north of the
city _ a somber mood prevailed. Employees, who had long taken to
beginning meetings with prayers for the Cardinal's health, realized
his condition had worsened when a cabinet session planned for
Tuesday morning was canceled without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Walsh, who had served as the cardinal's
secretary for more than two years, said his colleagues at the
Catholic Center considered the Cardinal's downturn as ``sad, but
expected.'' After watching O'Connor, who once was not expected to
survive much beyond his birthday, struggle these many weeks, those
closest to him felt relieved that he would no longer suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh noted that O'Connor's column had not appeared in Catholic
Week, the newspaper of the archdiocese and a favorite platform of
the cardinal, for six weeks. Even those Catholics and other New
Yorkers who do not attend church knew that he had not attended mass
at St. Patrick's for 10 weeks, and was forced to skip Easter mass
because of his weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Though reporters had gathered outside the cardinal's residence
for word of his condition, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, tourists
strolled through the aisle and offered their prayers as on any
normal day, apparently unaware that the cardinal was nearing the
end of his life around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roman Catholic Church of Our Savior at 38th Street and
Park Avenue, several worshipers arrived in the late afternoon to
say prayers for the cardinal, as word spread of his deteriorating
condition. ``He unified a lot of people in Manhattan, as far as
attending mass and bringing people together,'' said Susan
Hagelthorn, who said she nevertheless left the church because she
did not ``appreciate his disdain for homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his surgery, O'Connor, who had served in the military for
26 years before coming to New York, appeared intermittently in his
offices on the top floor of the Catholic Center, frequently work
from home instead. A long-time insomniac, the Cardinal would
frequently read or work through the night, leaving the resulting
assignments piled outside the doors of the priests and bishops who
lived with him.
</P>
<P>
   But over the months, maintaining a normal life became
increasingly difficult. O'Connor's usually trim figure grew bloated
from the steroids he was prescribed for his illness, and in
November, he was forced back into the hospital, weak and
dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   At his 80th birthday party, the cardinal joked about being the
first archbishop of New York not to die in office, and said he
could pretend, but would not, enjoy seeing another take his place.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with Church tradition, Pope John Paul II had received
O'Connor's resignation five years earlier, but had put off naming a
successor at the time. Most thought he would do so this January.
Allowing O'Connor, who is considered a favorite of the pope, to
remain beyond his 80th birthday in such a key post was considered
wildly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks following O'Connor's 80th birthday spun into
months, however, church watchers realized the Pope would do his
best to allow the Cardinal to end his days while still in office,
as a reflection of his affection and esteem for the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, O'Connor's friends and family kept a round the clock
vigil, with only two or three at a time standing by the Cardinal in
his spare bedroom. Saying he wanted to respect the cardinal's
privacy, Zwilling would not say whether prayers were going on for
the cardinal in his residence.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh noted that ``sacraments for the sick,'' as the last rites
are now called, were given to O'Connor when he was admitted to
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centers for surgery last August,
and may have been periodically administered in the months since
then. Zwilling declined to say whether the sacraments had been
given again to O'Connor as he now approaches death.

ON TV, A LOSS OF INDEPENDENTS

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For more than two decades, Robert Greenwald, a
prolific television producer, has owned the films he made, which
gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning shows as ``The
Burning Bed'' and ``A Woman of Independent Means.'' But now
Greenwald, and every other producer of films and series, is under
powerful pressure to yield to the networks and allow them to own
more and more of their shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money,'' Greenwald said. ``We all get paid
well. It's about the fact that a show you own is your viewpoint,
your vision. All that is dissipated when you're a hired hand. You
can have the most brilliant people in the world running networks,
but it's almost a scientific impossibility for bureaucracies to be
inventive and edgy. They cannot. It's their nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Until five years ago, federal regulations prevented broadcast
networks from creating and owning shows, which left the job to
independent production companies and studios like Warner Brothers,
Fox, Sony and Universal. The thinking was that the networks were so
powerful they could lock out projects by independent producers. But
in 1995 the Federal Communications Commission lifted the
20-year-old restriction, freeing the networks to aggressively seek
financial stakes in and ownership of films, dramatic series and
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what does this mean to viewers? Is the
television landscape, already littered with derivative shows, even
more compromised if independent producers are unable to get
provocative programs on the air? Or are the complaints just a
Hollywood shell game _ one group of rich people getting richer at
the expense of another group of rich people? Put another way, was
television better 10 years ago than it is today?
</P>
<P>
   The clearest proof of where the television networks are heading
will be evident in New York during the week of May 15. That is when
the networks, in their lavish annual presentations to advertisers,
will announce their fall schedules. Most of the new comedy and
dramatic series will be owned entirely by the networks, or made in
partnership with producers. Inevitably _ and despite the denials of
network executives _ some shows will be selected simply because
they are home-grown. Cynics may recall that in recent years NBC
green-lighted such in-house shows as ``Union Square,'' ``Conrad
Bloom'' and ``The Mike O'Malley Show.'' Each of them died without a
trace, and one can only wonder what shows failed to make it to the
air because of the decision to put on those three.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of independent producers is a reflection not only of
increased network ownership of shows but, far more important, of
the ascendancy of conglomerates like Disney and Viacom, General
Electric and News Corp., who own the networks. The result is that
network executives have also lost considerable independence,
further hampering creative programming.
</P>
<P>
   Two or more decades ago, television was presided over by figures
like Grant Tinker, Fred Silverman and Brandon Tartikoff, who held
top jobs at NBC, and Barry Diller, a onetime ABC programming
executive and the former chairman of Fox. Whatever their flaws,
these men were more independent than their counterparts today. At
Disney-owned ABC, for example, Lloyd Braun and Stuart Bloomberg,
the two talented executives who run the entertainment division,
work under the formidable shadow of Michael Eisner, the chairman of
the Walt Disney Co. and a former ABC executive himself. The fact
that Eisner weighs in on program decisions is an open secret _ and
doing so is his prerogative. (Not long ago, he went so far as to
personally call Peter Berg, the creator of ``Wonderland,'' to give
him script advice. The show failed anyway.) Rupert Murdoch, the
chairman of News Corp., and executives at General Electric and Time
Warner are less intrusive than Eisner, but their voices are heard
at Fox and NBC and WB.
</P>
<P>
   As corporate owners study the bottom line, the mood is bleak.
The days are over when a show is allowed to struggle and find an
audience, as NBC did with ``Seinfeld'' in 1990. This month, ABC
canceled ``Wonderland,'' a drama set in a mental hospital, after
only two shows, and NBC dropped the DreamWorks police comedy,
``Battery Park,'' after just four outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no free lunch anymore,'' said Tom Werner, who with his
partners, Marcy Carsey and Caryn Mandabach, created ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``Roseanne'' and other gold mines. The four pilots his
company is now producing are being done in partnership with
networks, partly out of necessity, he said. Making 22 episodes of a
series can lead to a deficit as high as $15 million before the show
is sold to syndication. Partners are needed to defray the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, CBS and NBC have their own in-house production units
and seek out (or demand) partnerships with producers as well. Fox
and ABC rely heavily _ although not exclusively _ on shows produced
by 20th Century Fox and Disney. Is there any question that networks
favor their own shows? It is a subtle issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, it's a factor that gets in the way,'' said
Amy Lippman, the co-creator of Fox's ``Party of Five.'' ``When
networks have material that comes from a studio they own, it can't
help but weigh in the decision about what gets on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said that ``Party of Five,'' admittedly in its sixth
year, was shifted out of its choice Wednesday night time slot to
make room for a Fox-produced comedy, ``Get Real.'' ``Party'' is
produced by Columbia-TriStar. ```Party of Five' suffered,'' said
Lippman, whose show went off the air this season.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Levitan, the creator of NBC's ``Just Shoot Me,'' told a
similar story about ``Will and Grace,'' which is produced in part
by NBC Studios. ``NBC smelled a hit in `Will and Grace,''' he said,
``and poured all their resources and advertising into that show,
giving it a great time period, the `Just Shoot Me' time period,''
meaning Tuesday night at 9. ``It's just that they're favoring their
own show. It's not like they're doing something wrong. It's not
like, `How dare they do that?''' (The fact that ``Shoot Me'' is in
its fifth year surely figured in the decision.)
</P>
<P>
   Another writer-producer, Marshall Herskovitz, said that he and
his partner, Edward Zwick, the creators of ``Thirtysomething,''
went out of their way to make a deal with Disney knowing it would
give them a leg up with their series ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a deal with Disney knowing they would be the main
supplier of ABC,'' Herskovitz said. ``What we felt was, at best,
there was a statistical advantage in being with an in-house
production company. By that I mean that, at some odd moment, when a
decision is to be made about a show, and all the factors are equal,
it would be of some benefit for a network to favor its own show.''
(ABC recently renewed ``Once and Again'' for another season.)
</P>
<P>
   How this affects creative quality is difficult to assess.
Network executives are hardly hacks. Aware that audiences are
shrinking in favor of cable and the Internet, they are plainly
struggling to come up with shows that are intelligent (NBC's ``West
Wing''), funny (Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle''), adult (ABC's
``Once and Again'') and even a bit risky (NBC's ``Will and
Grace''). And they insist that the demise of the independent
producer _ and the rise of producing partnerships _ has not altered
the creative landscape.

 LOS ANGELES: creative landscape.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that a producer is affiliated with a studio or a
network doesn't mean that half of their brain died,'' said Braun of
ABC. ``Producers are better served by being with a network or a
studio because the business is so economically challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun denied that ABC goes out of its way to select Disney
properties. ``Certainly we'll be as aggressive as possible in
building up our studios,'' he said. ``But our mantra is to develop
and put the best possible shows on the air, regardless of the
source.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television,
dismissed the notion that series and films have been diminished.
``You think the creative aesthetic of David Kelley has changed one
iota because he's under the Fox banner? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   An unfair example, perhaps. Hugely successful creator-producers
like Kelley (``The Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'') and Steven Bochco
(``N.Y.P.D. Blue''), whose companies are now aligned with studios,
are given creative carte blanche. Most independent producers are
under seige.
</P>
<P>
   Television was once dominated by powerhouse producers like
Norman Lear, Aaron Spelling, Witt-Thomas-Harris, Carsey-Werner,
Lorimar and others. By all accounts, some of the shows they made _
``Soap,'' ``All in the Family,'' ``Benson,'' ``Maude,'' ``Golden
Girls'' _ would probably not pass muster today. The lead characters
would not fit snugly into the prized youth market: they are too
old, too ethnic, too female. ``Try doing a show today like `Golden
Girls,' about three older women,'' said one top network executive.
``Good luck!''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those producers, like Carsey-Werner-Mandabach and
Spelling, still work in television, but their number has dwindled.
When this reporter called Michael Jaffe, a well-known producer, and
said he was doing an article about independent television
producers, Jaffe replied, with some hyperbole: ``You're doing a
short story. There are only two of us left.'' Jaffe said there were
probably only 10 producers making films for television, in contrast
to 30 or 40 in the 80's.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of powerful producers has entered the field _
Basic Entertainment (formerly Brillstein-Grey), Regency Television
and the Robert Greenblatt-David Janollari studio, among them.
Artists Television Group, a newcomer, has made 12 pilots for the
new season. All of which suggests that, despite the changes wrought
by the F.C.C. decision, there is money to be made, creative work to
be found.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, producers are turning to the flourishing cable
networks, where, as Variety reported last week, wealthy corporate
parents like Time Warner and Viacom are willing to pay the costs of
series and films. (A one-hour series on basic cable can cost about
$1.3 million an episode, only slightly less than the $1.5 million
price of a broadcast show; a two-hour cable film can cost $7
million to $10 million.) &QL;

   ``We embraced the new world,'' said Jaffe, whose company made
more than a half-dozen films for cable last year. ``The
partnerships are somewhat complicated because it's all new
business. We're paving the landscape as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television,
the producer of Fox's successful sitcom ``Malcolm in the Middle,''
whether or not studios own series and films is not the issue. ``The
audience doesn't know, doesn't care about vertical integration,''
Berman said. The issue, she said, is a straightforward one. Without
better programming, the viewers won't be there. ``They'll just flip
the channel.''

<P>
   A United Nations attempt to take charge of security in the West
African country of Sierra Leone has exploded in violence, with
rebels killing seven peacekeepers, all Kenyans, and taking hostage
at least 49 other peacekeepers and civilians, U.N. officials said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels of the Revolutionary United Front, who made a grisly name
for themselves by chopping limbs off thousands of civilians during
an eight-year civil war that ended last year, detained members of
the U.N. mission after a series of confrontations in central and
north-eastern parts of the country on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The violence _ the worst for U.N. peacekeepers since 10 Belgians
were killed in Rwanda in 1994 _ is by far the most serious
breakdown of a chronically troubled peace agreement brokered last
year by the United Nations between the government of Sierra Leone
and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' leader, Foday Sankoh, who became a government
minister after last year's peace deal, has consistently refused to
honor his promises to pacify his forces and allow U.N.s
peacekeepers to move freely in rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping troops responded on Wednesday to the rebel attack
by surrounding Sankoh's house in the capital, Freetown. A U.S.
official in Freetown said by telephone he had received a statement
from Sankoh, saying that if hostages were being held by the
Revolutionary United Front, they should be released. Sankoh also
called for dialogue and free movement about the country for U.N.
forces.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokesman in New York said that the rebel leader's house
was surrounded because ``the U.N. wants to make sure it can remain
in contact with Mr. Sankoh at this time of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't formally been arrested for anything. However it
would be dishonest to say he can just pack up and leave,'' said the
spokesman, Farhan Haq.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council demanded the release of the captured
troops and said Sankoh should order his followers to stop the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it had no plans to rescue the
peacekeepers who have been taken hostage, but a senior State
Department official said the United States is ``looking into the
availability'' of using C-140 cargo aircraft to fly Jordanian,
Bangladeshi and Indian troops into Sierra Leone. The officials
said, however, that these troops are not yet ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan called the attacks ``outrageous and criminal,'' and a
``flagrant violation'' of the July peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington an administration official said on Wednesday that
the United States was looking at ways to see if Mr. Sankoh could be
charged with war crimes. The peace deal Sankoh negotiated last year
exempted him and his forces from prosecution for possible war
crimes committed during the civil war. But the State Department has
said it has credible information that atrocities have been
committed by Sonkoh's forces since the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations made an urgent appeal Tuesday night for more
troops to reinforce the 8,500 peacekeepers, mostly Nigerians,
Kenyans and Indians, who have been deployed there. Members of the
Security Council were asked to transport, presumably in an
emergency airlift, 3,000 more peacekeepers to Sierra Leone from
Jordan, Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations authorized 11,000 troops for the mission in
Sierra Leone, but their deployment has been delayed because of
lagging troop contributions from member nations.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalities of the detainees were not immediately
released. In one of the areas where the attacks occurred, Kailahun,
the troops are mostly Indian; in the other area of attacks, the
troops are mostly Kenyan.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokeswoman said the number of dead was based on
preliminary reports and could change.
</P>
<P>
   The worse single attack on U.N. peacekeepers was the death of 24
Pakistani troops in 1993 in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The killings and detentions provoked strong condemnations from
the Security Council, Annan and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Sierra Leone is unacceptable to the United
Nations and should be unacceptable to all the member states,'' said
Richard C. Holbrooke, the American representative to the United
Nations, who was in Brussels and on his way with other Security
Council members to assess another shaky African truce, in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in Sierra Leone seems likely to raise more questions
about the United Nations' plan to send a force of about 5,500 to
Congo, made up of monitors, peacekeeping troops and a large support
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Influential members of Congress have been objecting to paying
the American share of the Congo operation, even though no U.S.
troops are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't turn away from crises like these,'' Holbrooke said,
referring both to Sierra Leone and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said on Wednesday that the violence in Sierra Leone could
discourage Western countries from taking part in further
peacekeeping operations on the continent. He pointed out that
countries were reluctant to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda
after casualties in Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after Sierra Leone, I think there's going to be very
little encouragement for any of them to get involved in operations
in Africa,'' said Annan.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing sense at the United Nations that Sankoh will
have to be declared a war criminal sooner or later, although in the
absence of an international criminal court _ a body the United
States opposes _ there is no mechanism for capturing or trying him,
even though he may now be under effective house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as if Foday Sankoh is trying to derail the peace
process,'' Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley, the Indian officer who
commands the U.N. force in Sierra Leone, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on U.N. peacekeepers occurred on Monday and Tuesday
in two north-central towns, Makeni and Magburaka, and in Kailahun
in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say that 21 of the captives, including three
military observers policing a much-violated cease-fire, were taken
in the Makeni-Magburaka area. Another 28 captives in Kailahun
include two U.N. civilian employees and four members of a
helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
   One of the peacekeepers' major tasks is to get the rebels,
Sankoh's troops and others, to give up their weapons so that the
country can hold a national election in 2001. There were reports
Tuesday that at least one attack from Sankoh's Revolutionary United
Front followed the defection of some of his soldiers to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   When peacekeepers refused to turn them over, they came under
attack.

ALBRIGHT REBUKES DIPLOMATS FOR SECURITY SLIPS
</HEADLINE>
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a fierce speech transmitted around the world,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Wednesday told U.S. diplomats
that protecting the nation's secrets was at the core of their
mission and warned that enemies abounded even in a post-cold-war
world.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who said she was furious over both the disappearance
of a laptop computer packed with classified information and other
recent security lapses at the State Department, summoned more than
800 staff members to the department's auditorium to hear her
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was broadcast live on the department's internal
television network and beamed by satellite to U.S.missions in
dozens of countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how skilled you are as a diplomat, how brilliant
you may be at meetings, or how creative you are as an
administrator,'' Albright said in stern tones reminiscent of her
days as a Georgetown University professor, ``if you are not
professional about security, you are a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have seen reports indicating that I am furious about
these incidents,'' she said. ``Well, I am, and I hope you are,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the first time a secretary had held a
department-wide meeting on security. It came as Albright's aides
were exploring new measures to protect classified materials and
guard against espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Albright was embarrassed by the laptop incident,
which she learned about through newspaper articles more than two
months after the computer was reported missing to State Department
security officers by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's disappearance, which is being investigated by the
FBI, was just a month after federal agents found an electronic
listening device in a department conference room. A Russian
diplomat was expelled after the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers have criticized the breaches. Albright is
scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Select Committee on
Intelligence. The chairman of the House Committee on International
Relations, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., has invited her to a panel
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who last week announced an overhaul of department
security, transferred two officials from Intelligence and Research
and stripped that office of its ability to police itself,
complained Wednesday that she had met resistance from a diplomatic
culture that played down the importance of security.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats privately acknowledged that they were
occasionally cavalier about security. Many said their public
profiles required a steady stream of foreign visitors and contacts,
unlike many of their colleagues at the Pentagon or the intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat said the department in recent years had ordered a
halt to nightly office-by-office security checks by Marines _ a
training maneuver for Marines bound for overseas posts _ because
they turned up so many violations, creating a morass of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares about security within the department,'' said the
diplomat, who has served three decades at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   An interagency group that includes members of the FBI, the CIA
and the Secret Service is preparing recommendations to improve the
department's security. Among the options being considered are
closing off two entrances and streets adjacent to the department's
headquarters, increasing camera surveillance throughout the
facility and limiting the number of electronic building passes,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the end of the Cold War, Albright said, the threats to
U.S. interests are more varied and less predictable than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spy novelists may be having trouble thinking up plots,'' she
said. ``But our nation still has enemies.''

PASSING THE 'SWAN LAKE' TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By IRIS FANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the turn of the millennium, American Ballet
Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ``Swan
Lake.'' Mounting a classic as big as this one, with a price tag to
match, involved every resource the company could muster. Work days
turned into nights for Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic
director and ballet master, the dancers and coaching staff and the
technical crews, not to mention the efforts of the development
office, which raised $1.4 million to assure the splendor of the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The production will have its New York premiere at the
Metropolitan Opera House on May 19. ``Swan Lake'' is expected to be
the blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which
opens with a gala performance tomorrow night and runs through July
1.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie describes ``Swan Lake'' as the quintessential ballet,
the one that defines the standards of the company, tests its
dancers and ennobles the spirit of the viewer. ``It rings so true
of human nature, of man's inconsistency, of the victimizing of
women, so full of big truths,'' he says. ``The key point is about
not being able to marry one's ideals to one's realities.''
</P>
<P>
   These issues came to life on stage in St. Petersburg in 1895
when Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov created the choreography for the
``Swan Lake'' that has come down to us, joined to Tchaikovsky's
glorious score (the first, butchered staging of the score was in
1877). McKenzie has based his production on theirs, but combined
his own ideas with the familiar story about the Prince who falls in
love with a Swan Queen in the power of the wicked sorcerer von
Rothbart.
</P>
<P>
   Late one March afternoon, McKenzie stood watching a rehearsal of
the prologue he has added to ``Swan Lake'' while two two-man teams
double cast as von Rothbart refined a fancy twisting of the body
around an arm. In rethinking the scenario, McKenzie needed to
introduce up front his notion of presenting the evil sorcerer as a
split personality, with two dancers trading places as the character
throughout the ballet. It was not hard to picture the moment of
theatrical magic he intends with von Rothbart's transformation from
devil to suave courtier. Off in a corner, three of the principal
dancers cast as the Swan Queen at different performances _ Paloma
Herrera, Julie Kent and Susan Jaffe _ waited for the cue to walk
unknowingly into von Rothbart's trap.
</P>
<P>
   A prologue that explains the Swan Queen's enchantment in a
long-ago and faraway era before the familiar story unfolds is
another of the innovations McKenzie has brought to this ``Swan
Lake.'' Still another is condensing the ballet into two acts,
posing a challenge for the set and costume designer, Zack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' takes place in four distinct locales, requiring
the shifting of backdrops and platforms from the palace garden, to
the lakeside, to the palace ballroom and back to a different
perspective of the lake. Brown solved the problem of only one
intermission by using a traveling curtain, with silhouetted trees,
to bring in the lakeside clearing, plus a transparent back wall for
the palace and a ballroom platform that breaks in half for the
final act. Before the ballet's premiere at the Kennedy Center in
Washington last month, Ballet Theater's technical crew spent a week
in one of the theaters on the campus of the State University of New
York in Purchase to devise the intricate backstage choreography for
the rapid set changes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barbara Matera's costume shop on the fifth floor
above the company's studios at 890 Broadway was buzzing with 85
workers constructing the more than 300 costumes required for the
multiple casting of roles. In one corner, three women did nothing
but hand beading and embroidery. Another worker bent over the
colored ribbon she was threading into fabric for the vests to be
worn by the Neapolitan dancers for about three minutes of stage
time. Forty-four swan tutus had to be hand pleated of tulle to look
like feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Horowitz, Ballet Theater's wardrobe supervisor for the
last 19 years, planned a strategy as complicated as a military
maneuver for the quick costume changes. The women of the corps de
ballet will have only a few minutes to shed their Act I peasant
costumes for tutus. During Act III, the corps members, dressed in
court costumes, must melt off the stage a few at a time to climb
back into tutus and point shoes. Horowitz had already measured the
dancers' feet for 140 pairs of leather boots that complement the
court and peasant costumes and sent the men's measurements to
Portland, Ore., and the women's to Russia, where the boots were
made.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who have seen a production of ``Swan Lake'' _ its
viewers since 1895 must number in the millions because the work is
a staple of repertories the world over _ retain, above all else,
the image of the Swan Queen, with her quivering arms, long, arched
neck and demeanor of doom. Behind her, sister swan maidens dance in
perfect symmetry to complete the moonlit vision that has remained
in collective memory.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie can be forgiven for having a viewpoint that differs
from the shared opinion that the ballet belongs to the Swan Queen.
The fate of Prince Siegfried has been his to ponder since 1980,
when he made his debut in the role, a year after he joined Ballet
Theater as a dancer. He believes the focus of the ballet is the
Prince. ``In my mind, the Swan's story is done,'' McKenzie says,
ending a 12-hour day at the studio by talking about his work on the
ballet. ``The story happens to Siegfried, not the Swan. He can't
marry his ideal to reality. That is the tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In radically shortening Act IV, McKenzie brings the story to a
quick conclusion. ``Prince Siegfried's rite of passage is that he
realizes he owes it to her to join her in death,'' he says. ``Her
rite of passage is that she realizes she can forgive him for his
betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   A full-length production of ``Swan Lake,'' choreographed after
Petipa and Ivanov by David Blair of the Royal Ballet, has been in
the ABT repertory since 1967, briefly replaced by Mikhail
Baryshnikov's production in 1988. However, Baryshnikov took the
rights to his ballet with him when he left the company in 1989.
Ballet Theater reverted to Blair's ballet in 1993 when McKenzie
first staged ``Swan Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie was a teen-age ballet student in Washington when he saw
excerpts from ``Swan Lake'' on a Bolshoi Ballet program. A year
later he attended a Ballet Theater performance and saw his first
full-length ``Swan Lake.'' In subsequent years, the company became
an annual visitor to Washington at the Kennedy Center. McKenzie
went regularly to the performances. ``I grew up seeing all those
wonderful casts,'' he says. ``I was obviously very thrilled when my
time came to do the ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake'' has been a constant in the company's history since
1940, when the Act II lakeside scene was presented in its opening
season. Lucia Chase, a founder of Ballet Theater, its director with
Oliver Smith from 1945 to 1980 and its financial fairy godmother,
had dreamed of a full-length ``Swan Lake'' to replace the one-act
version. But there wasn't enough money or dancers until 1967, when
an enlarged company presented Blair's complete version. With its
premiere, the first of the evening-length classics that ABT would
produce, ``Ballet Theatre acquired the confident assurance that it
could rank itself among the half-dozen major ballet companies of
the world,'' according to Charles Payne in his detailed history,
``American Ballet Theatre,'' published by Knopf in 1977.

 By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he saw a camera obscura on the roof of a private
museum in Kyoto in 1995, Charles Schwartz knew he had to have one.
A photograph collector, dealer and photographer himself, he shares
the field's growing interest in ancient devices and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew it would be an ambitious undertaking, not for the
faint of heart or pocketbook. But he had the will _ and the means,
as a former partner in a family dairy business _ to make it happen.
So now, poking through the roof of his staid apartment building on
the Upper East Side is a jaunty turret that holds the telescopic
lens and mirror of what surely is the only camera obscura of its
size in Manhattan, and one of the very few private devices of its
kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A camera obscura (the name literally means ``dark chamber'') is
a viewing apparatus used by scientists and artists for centuries.
Schwartz's, built especially for photographic purposes, took three
years and the combined efforts of a structural engineer, an
architect and an optics specialist to complete. Also required were
the services of expediters who shepherded the project through the
labyrinthine processes of the city's building department, its
Landmarks Commission and local preservation organizations to gain
permission to build it atop a roof in a landmarked section of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Like any proper camera obscura, Schwartz's is a room _ call it
the camera's body _ that can be darkened, with a lensed opening
(housed in the turret) to the out of doors. Built atop the
three-story penthouse where Schwartz lives with his wife, the
artist Nancy Drozd, the architect-designed room is used as a
workplace and storage area for Schwartz's collection of
photographs. When he wants it to function as a camera, he pushes a
button to close the blackout blinds, and several others to activate
the imaging devices in the turret. ``Imagine, while I'm working the
camera, I'm actually sitting inside of it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The turret, the business end of the camera, is fitted with an
optical glass viewer, an 8-inch lens and a 12-inch mirror, like a
periscope's, that corrects the reversal of view made by the lens.
When activated, the turret brings in a 15-degree slice of the
outdoors. Its plane of sharp focus moves from infinity _ say, the
stars _ down to 400 feet, at which it can pick out a piece of Fifth
Avenue and Central Park. What it sees as it swivels about is
conveyed indoors to the white Formica top of a round table 42
inches in diameter (which functions like the back of a camera).
</P>
<P>
   Any part of the view can be brought into sharp focus and, by
placing a piece of photographic paper on the table, developed as a
photograph. Different results, and better color control, can be
obtained by photographing what's on the table with another camera
containing film, in effect taking a picture of a picture.
</P>
<P>
   Birds and planes streaking across a huge red sun, the pocked
face of the moon, silhouetted tops of buildings, intricate patterns
of trees and branches, pedestrians and views of Central Park are
some of the subjects with which Schwartz has been experimenting. He
uses the camera's compression of distances _ thanks to its 12{-foot
focal length, things far away seem almost as close as those in
medium range _ to create novel effects. What has eluded him so far,
he says, is photographing the split-second green flash that occurs
at a particular angle of the sun's setting, mostly in the clear
atmosphere of a winter's day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's energizing to kind of invent camera obscura
photography,'' he says. ``It's about light _ the camera can catch
reflections from the rising sun in the windows of buildings on the
West Side _ and it's about compression. In the camera's eye, for
instance, the Dakota appears to be right behind Belvedere Castle,
although in reality they're almost a half-mile apart. I see things
you can't see with your naked eye or a normal camera lens.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge posed by the device, however, is how to measure
light. A conventional light meter reads direct light whereas the
light inside a camera obscura is reflected light. By trial and
error, Schwartz had to recalibrate his meter to reconcile inside
light with outside light.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how or when the camera obscura _ the
forerunner of the modern photographic camera _ came into being, but
everyone agrees that it is an ancient device. It arose from the
discovery _ perhaps by the Chinese in the fifth century B.C. that a
pinhole in a darkened room can project an outside view upside down
on an opposite wall. Roger Bacon, the 13th-century optical
scientist and philosopher, used the device to obtain a safe direct
image of the sun. The first diagram of a camera obscura appeared in
a 15th-century manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci, although he did not
claim its invention.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of a lens, possibly in the 16th century,
created a much brighter image so that the camera obscura became an
aid to astronomy. Shortly thereafter artists began using it to
facilitate drawing, with the subject posed outside and the
reflected image traced on a piece of drawing paper. Eminent
painters like Vermeer (1632-75) in the 17th century and Giovanni
Antonio Canale, known as Canaletto (1697-1768), and Sir Joshua
Reynolds (1723-1792) in the 18th century were thought to have
worked with it.
</P>
<P>
   As improved optics gradually brought the camera obscura down to
comfortable carrying size for artists and other professionals (even
spies), larger ones were still built for public entertainment. In
the mid-19th century there was even one in Central Park. Today, the
camera obscura, used mainly for panoramic viewing rather than
photography, is more popular overseas, where a number exist, mostly
in Great Britain but also in Spain, Germany, South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Switzerland and Hungary. There are
several in the United States, including a recent one at the
Children's Museum in Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   To build his own dream machine, Schwartz faced a number of
challenges. To begin with, there was the basic question of whether
the city's complex zoning code would allow for another room on the
roof of his penthouse. A feasibility consultant, Lisa Westheimer,
ascertained that it would. Then Matthys Levy, a consulting
engineer, was asked to determine whether the room was structurally
feasible. Yes, said Levy, if its weight was kept to a minimum. The
board of the co-op building (with Schwartz as its president)
accepted his proposal, with the agreement that he would pay
additional maintenance for the room he was adding.
</P>
<P>
   At Levy's recommendation, Gajinder Singh, an architect who
designed university campuses as an associate of Edward Larrabee
Barnes, was chosen to plan the structure, the smallest project he
had ever undertaken. With these ducks in a row, Schwartz tackled
the biggest obstacle _ how to connect with someone who could make
the working part of the camera itself. ``You don't find that sort
of thing in the Yellow Pages,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking questions and visiting camera obscura sites in England
and the United States, he finally came up with the name of George
Keene, a specialist in optics and spacecraft design who had worked
for Kodak and helped build orbiting satellites for NASA. Keene had
already made a camera obscura for himself that he uses for
celestial photography, and was willing to try his hand at another
one. Much of the work was done in his machine shop in Los Angeles,
with the lens, mirror and window custom-made by an optical grinder.
</P>
<P>
   He worked hand-in-glove with Singh, the architect. From his
point of view, Keene said, the special problems of the project were
space limitations and the need to tailor it to his customer's
photographic interests. ``The most difficult part was the concept,
inventing it and designing it and fitting it in with Charles'
special needs. After the basic design I had to make an extra
shuttering device, for instance.'' A particularly expensive item
was the camera's special viewing window, a 14-by-18-inch piece of
optical glass a half-inch thick, that took months to polish and had
to be shipped in a large, costly wooden crate, although Keene
hand-carried the lens and the big flat mirror on the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said his challenge was ``to create a pleasant office that
converts to something very different, a camera.'' The roof of
Schwartz's building was cluttered with ventilation pipes from
apartments below, two air-conditioning condenser units and a large
skylight over fire stairs. The skylight had to be removed, with an
equivalent area for glass and ventilation provided on the floor
beneath, the pipes rerouted and the condenser units relocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no previous drawings, so we had to keep inventing
as we went along,'' Singh said. ``An important consideration was
that the structure had to be very light so the roof would bear it.
We decided to face the room with copper instead of masonry, which
at first gave us trouble with the Landmarks Commission. They
suggested stucco; no good for New York weather. But there was
already copper on neighboring buildings, and we finally convinced
them it would blend in very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire project was finished last May, and Schwartz has since
found that being possessed by a camera obscura, while thrilling, is
not an easy life. ``I spend 60 hours a week trying to make the best
use of its uniqueness,'' he said. And would he say how much the
whole venture cost? ``Let's put it this way: I could have had a
couple of Ferraris.''

U.S. PLANS CLOSER STUDY OF BIOTECH FOODS AND WILL GUIDE LABELING
</HEADLINE>
  By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to ease consumer fears about genetically engineered
foods, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Wednesday that
it would tighten its review of the products and develop guidelines
for companies wanting to label them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's announcement is part of a broader plan by the
Clinton administration that includes increased financing of studies
on the potential risks of genetically engineered plants and a
review of environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Department of Agriculture will also take
steps that could lead to a system in which genetically engineered
crops are kept separate from those that have not been altered. Now,
the crops are commonly harvested together, which has caused some
foreign importers to reject American crops.
</P>
<P>
   The measures were announced after the food and drug agency held
hearings on the growing concerns of consumers. Jane E. Henney, the
Food and Drug Administration commissioner, emphasized on Wednesday
that ``FDA's scientific review continues to show that all
bioengineered foods sold in the United States today are as safe as
their non-bioengineered counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the agency said it would strengthen its policies
and would write guidelines for companies that want to label foods
that contain genetically engineered ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups said shoppers in American supermarkets were
not likely to see much change. Most processed foods include
genetically engineered ingredients, but that is not disclosed in
labels.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Halloran, director of the Consumer Policy Institute at the
Consumers Union, said she feared that few food companies would
label their foods because of the expense of meeting the government
guidelines. ``This will make very little difference for
consumers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Halloran noted that the food and drug agency had recently
received thousands of letters from consumers asking that the agency
require labels on all genetically engineered foods. ``The FDA is
ignoring the public on this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen its policy, the food and drug agency also said on
Wednesday that it would propose that biotechnology companies be
required to talk to regulators about the safety of their new
genetically engineered products at least 120 days before they are
sold. That discussion is now voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest food companies had asked the administration
for the change to help calm consumer fears. The agency will publish
its proposal in the next few months and ask for public comment.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that regulators are also monitoring environmental
risk, the Clinton administration said it planned to begin a
six-month review of its current regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department said that it planned to increase the
$1.7 million it spends on researching the crops.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department also said it would work with farmers
and industry to create systems for keeping genetically engineered
crops separate from their conventional cousins. Already, the
department is helping to create reliable tests for determining
whether a truckload of grain includes genetically engineered
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obviously a market out there that wants non-GMO
food,'' said an agricultural official, using the shorthand
expression for genetically modified organism. ``We want to find a
way for farmers to meet that need.

GUNMAKERS, BETTING ON A BUSH VICTORY, END SETTLEMENT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Pa., Ohio, La., Calif., Fla.)  By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with lawsuits by 31 cities and counties, the nation's gun
companies have broken off settlement negotiations, deciding to take
their chances that state judges will prove sympathetic or that
victory in November will go to the apparent Republican presidential
nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This defiance by the gun industry dashes the hopes of the White
House and state and local governments that a recent deal with Smith
&AMP; Wesson to change some of its marketing and manufacturing
practices might lead other major gun companies to fall in line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people on both sides of the litigation say, the gun
companies, believing that the November elections will be crucial to
their future, are holding off any further settlement talks at least
until they see whether Bush wins the presidency and the Republicans
maintain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, the companies hope that Bush, who as governor of
Texas has been a staunch defender of the industry and of gun
owners, will help dampen the growing public sentiment for
additional gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, their hope is that Bush as president would help
push through Congress a bill outlawing municipal suits against
them. As governor, Bush got just such a law through the state
Legislature with the help of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Even if those hopes are unrealized, the companies calculate,
Bush would at least stop the kind of pressure the Clinton
administration has put on them through Andrew Cuomo, the secretary
of housing and urban development, to settle the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Although the suits vary from city to city, they generally accuse
the industry of failing to incorporate enough safety features in
handguns and of distributing them in ways that make it easy for
criminals and juveniles to buy them. The suits collectively seek
millions of dollars to reimburse the municipalities for their costs
related to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the industry's trade organization, said he believed
that as president Bush would work to pass a law protecting gun
makers from such municipal suits, ``based on his actions as
governor of Texas,'' where he signed not only similar legislation
but also a tort-reform measure curbing lawsuits against
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Delfay said, the gun companies are encouraged by
the names being mentioned for the Republican vice-presidential
nomination, particularly Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who
recently signed into law a measure prohibiting cities in his state
from suing the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is looking toward the election as a watershed
event on this issue,'' Delfay said. ``If Bush wins, we could be
going in a whole new direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Januzzo, vice president and general counsel of one gun
maker, Glock Inc., acknowledged that settlement negotiations had
come to a halt and that the industry was hoping for sympathy from a
Bush administration. Januzzo said that the negotiations had
``degenerated into terrorism'' with escalating demands by the
plaintiffs and that he no longer trusted their lawyers or Cuomo. He
said the industry viewed Bush as ``anti-lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this can happen to us,'' Januzzo said, ``who's next? If the
lawyers are successful with the gun industry, you can be sure they
will be out there claiming they have done more than anyone to
change society since the Supreme Court in civil rights days.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry describes the suits, and the negotiations that
resulted from them, as an effort by its opponents to win through
the courts the kind of controls they could not get enacted in state
legislatures or Congress. The companies maintain that a federal law
not only barring future suits but also voiding those already filed
would withstand challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp has been noncommittal about whether he would back
the kind of legislation the gun makers are seeking. Scott
McClellan, a Bush spokesman, declined to rule out the possibility,
saying simply, ``He has not addressed that at the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a reflection of their more aggressive posture, seven of
the largest handgun makers sued 16 of their municipal adversaries
last week, and added New York state and Connecticut. The suit,
filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, asks that the defendants
be forced to abandon new policies favorable to Smith &AMP; Wesson in
handgun purchases for their police.
</P>
<P>
   The companies contend that those policies, a result of the
recent deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson, brokered by Cuomo, are an illegal
effort to regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One big risk in the gun makers' November strategy, of course, is
that Bush could lose. In that case, the industry's best hope would
lie in favorable treatment by judges. So far, in the six cases in
which the courts have ruled on the industry's requests for summary
dismissal, judges have thrown out three, involving Bridgeport,
Conn., Cincinnati and Miami. In the other three cases, involving
Atlanta, Cleveland and New Orleans, the suits have been allowed to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   One senior gun industry executive said a factor behind the
companies' election-related strategy was that the NRA ``has been
telling everyone not to do anything till November, that this
administration is history, so don't deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who has met privately with a number of firearms industry
executives in an effort to bring more of them into the Smith &AMP;
Wesson settlement, said the gun makers had been telling him as well
that they were counting on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are waiting to see who wins in November,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Short of enacting federal legislation, a Bush administration and
a Republican-controlled Congress could achieve the same ends
through other means. One way would be to tie federal block grants
to cities for law enforcement to a condition that any city
accepting the money not sue the gun companies. Federal
law-enforcement aid to cities and states has typically been through
block grants, often with conditions attached. The Clinton
administration, for example, has prided itself on providing money
for the hiring of 100,000 police officers, who, under the program,
were required to be assigned to community policing.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuits are now moving through the courts, and many of
the cities believe they will hit pay dirt in the discovery process,
finding material that will weaken the gun companies' position in
the same way that documents about nicotine addiction helped force
tobacco companies to settle lawsuits with various states. Two of
the cases, in Cleveland and Atlanta, have just moved into the
discovery phase, in which the two sides can examine previously
confidential material relevant to the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that has never been investigated by
Congress, whose executives have never been put under oath,'' said
David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School who is an
adviser to many of the cities. ``I think they have a lot to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Some small gun companies say they are already feeling enormous
financial pressure from having to defend themselves against the
suits.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a California handgun company estimated that he was
paying $50,000 to $100,000 a month in lawyer fees. ``We are a small
company,'' the executive said. ``We're going to go broke.''
</P>
<P>
   But aside from Smith &AMP; Wesson, the larger companies appear to
have decided to try to wait it out, at least until November.
Januzzo, of Glock, said he thought the firearms manufacturers could
persuade the courts to dismiss about half to two thirds of the
suits before trial, making the costs manageable.

KHANNOUCHI'S EXIT LEAVES BLAME FOR ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His legs overruling his heart a day after he became
an American citizen, Khalid Khannouchi announced Wednesday that he
was too injured to compete in the Olympic marathon trials on Sunday
in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few smart decisions made in an immigration
case that has included bad advice from lawyers, miscalculation by
his agent-wife, grandstanding by politicians and abandonment of the
runner by the shoe company he endorses.
</P>
<P>
   Ankle and hamstring injuries aggravated at the London Marathon
on April 16 threatened the longevity of Khannouchi's career, his
trainer, Gerard Hartmann, said Wednesday. It should never have come
to this. If his pursuit of citizenship had been conducted as
professionally as his racing, Khannouchi would not have had to run
the London Marathon, his American dream would not have become an
athletic nightmare and American chances for a marathon gold medal
at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, would not have
been reduced to zero.
</P>
<P>
   At least, after a day, the Moroccan-born Khannouchi was enough
of an American not to let outside pressures force him to run a race
that would have been dangerous for his career, one that involves a
classic immigrant story of working his way from dishwasher to
world-record holder in six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very sorry,'' Khannouchi said, tears welling in his
eyes at a Manhattan news conference, a day after being sworn in as
a U.S. citizen. ``I feel bad for the people that really worked hard
on the case. I'm looking toward the case realistically. I don't
want to be pushed and make some bad mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough bad mistakes have already been made. The first was not
listening to Craig Masback, the CEO of track and field's national
governing body, who told the Khannouchis in the fall of 1998 that
legislative pursuit of citizenship would be fruitless. In recent
memory, not a single athlete has ever received expedited
citizenship through a private bill in Congress. Why would
Khannouchi be any different, Masback advised.
</P>
<P>
   Masback recommended the use of a naturalization provision,
normally used by the military, that grants citizenship to spouses
of American citizens working abroad for American companies. The
French soccer player David Regis had used this provision to become
a U.S. citizen for the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sandra Khannouchi, Khalid's agent and wife, listened to
lawyers who suggested they pursue expedited citizenship with the
New York congressional help of Rep. Sue Kelly and Sen. Charles E.
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad advice,'' Sandra Khannouchi, who lives with her
husband in Ossining, N.Y., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The matter devolved into a political fight between Schumer's
office and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Schumer's
office blamed the INS for temporarily freezing Khannouchi's case
when the agent who interviewed him was charged with bribery in
another case. The INS charged that Schumer was handling the case
for political gain, and that, even if the case had not been frozen,
Khannouchi would not have been eligible through conventional means
to apply for citizenship until September 2000, weeks before the
Oct. 1 Olympic marathon and too late to have competed in the
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Khannouchi said she was hesitant to ask anyone for a job
overseas, not wanting special treatment for her husband. But having
an international job for a year or so would have been far more
legitimate than the flimsy job she took in Madrid, Spain, in March
with a San Diego-based company called Elite Racing. That move was
desperately calculated to gain citizenship for Khalid Khannouchi.
</P>
<P>
   New Balance, the shoe company that Khannouchi endorses, declined
to provide a job for Sandra Khannouchi, saying that the spousal
immigration provision seemed a contrivance and a loophole. In fact,
it is not a loophole, and it need not be a contrivance. If New
Balance objected to a job, fine. But the company should have at
least pointed Khannouchi toward helpful legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel it was appropriate for us to step in and get
involved,'' said James Tompkins, the president of New Balance.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Khannouchi is the company's most accomplished and
visible runner. Instead, New Balance engaged in the hypocrisy of
hosting Wednesday's news conference at one of its stores, wanting
publicity without responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi is not without fault. He did not tell his
Houston-based lawyer, Harry Gee, that he was running the London
Marathon. He ran with a prior ankle injury. ``It's certainly
contradictory, running in London and the desire to run in the
Olympic trials,'' Gee said.
</P>
<P>
   Gee got involved in March after reading of the case in a
magazine. Two months later, Khannouchi has his citizenship but no
chance to run in the Olympic marathon, a missed opportunity for
which many must accept blame.

A LIVE WIRE TO THE BRAIN: HOOKING UP `HAMLET' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
(EDS: Michael Almereyda is the director of `Hamlet,' which opens
May 12.) 
 By MICHAEL ALMEREYDA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken
off,'' Emily Dickinson once said, ``I know that is poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll get back to this, in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   We were in the lobby of a Midtown bank at 3 a.m., filming that
scene _ you know the one _ in which the ghost of Hamlet's father
(Sam Shepard) appears on a surveillance monitor, prompting Hamlet's
spooked pals to dash to the elevator to check it out. After the
second take, one of the producers turned to me and said, ``This
reminds me of `Scooby-Doo.''' I didn't feel insulted. It wasn't the
first or last time I had to face the implicit question: What are we
doing here? Why ``Hamlet'' _ again _ here and now?
</P>
<P>
   The answer leads back to Emily Dickinson by way of Orson Welles,
who conjured a version of ``Macbeth'' in 1948, shooting for 21 days
on an RKO sound stage cluttered with fantastic, soggy-looking
papier-mache sets. Welles described his film as ``a rough charcoal
sketch'' of the play, and this remark, alongside the finished
picture, provoked in me a sharp suspicion that you don't need
lavish production values to make a Shakespeare movie that's
accessible and alive. Shakespeare's language, after all, is lavish
enough. The meaning and emotion are all embedded there, line for
line, word for word. In the last 400 years, who more than
Shakespeare has been so directly responsible for transmitting the
particular electrical charge that Emily Dickinson described _ the
recognition of sudden and contrary meanings colliding in your
brain, a certain top-of-your-head-being-taken-off feeling?
Dickinson herself felt the ceiling lift when reading Shakespeare.
After first taking in a volume of his plays, she was prompted to
ask: ``Why is any other book needed?''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I was visited by an elemental desire to film
Shakespeare. It was, as Emily would have it, practically a physical
impulse _ like wanting to go swimming in the ocean, or running out
into a storm at night. Then again, maybe it wasn't so purely
hedonistic. I had some hope that my reflexes as a filmmaker would
be tested, battered and bettered. That I'd be swept along into
deeper Shakespearean currents.
</P>
<P>
   I was hovering over various possibilities, relatively obscure
plays _ and I was resisting ``Hamlet.'' It seemed too familiar, too
obvious, and it's been filmed at least 43 times. Better to leave it
to high school productions, spoofs and skits and ``The Lion King.''
As T.S. Eliot noted years back, ``Hamlet'' is like the Mona Lisa,
something so overexposed you can hardly stand to look at it.
</P>
<P>
   But masterpieces are definably masterpieces because they have a
way of manifesting themselves in our everyday lives. The play, and
the character, seemed to be chasing me around New York. I passed
high school kids quoting ``Hamlet'' on the street. I was informed
of the existence of a ``Hamlet'' porno film. And I found myself
thinking back to my first impressions of the play, remembering its
adolescence-primed impact and meaning for me _ the rampant
parallels between the melancholy Dane and my many doomed and
damaged heroes and imaginary friends: James Agee, Holden Caulfield,
James Dean, Egon Schiele, Robert Johnson, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Jean
Vigo.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by the fact that no film of ``Hamlet'' features a
truly young man. In dozens of versions (including two silent films
with women in the title role) none of the actors were under 30, and
the most definitive, conspicuous modern incarnations _ Olivier,
Richard Burton, Kevin Kline, Mel Gibson _ were all at least 40 when
they tackled the part. (Kenneth Branagh, at 35, seemed hardly any
younger, despite his trim platinum haircut and the enthusiastic
swashbuckling moves unleashed for the climactic duel.) Why not
entrust the role to an actor in his 20s? The character takes on a
different cast when seen more clearly as an abandoned son, a
defiant brat, a narcissist, a poet/filmmaker/perpetual grad student
_ a radiantly promising young man who doesn't quite know who he is.
(The play's famously simple first line is, ``Who's there?'')
</P>
<P>
   And I was heartened by the Polish scholar Jan Kott's
passionately lucid 1964 book, ``Shakespeare Our Contemporary.''
``The genius of `Hamlet,''' Kott wrote, ``consists in the fact that
the play can serve as a mirror. An ideal `Hamlet' would be one most
true to Shakespeare and most modern at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the story's familiarity, it seemed altogether natural to
locate a new ``Hamlet'' in the immediate present, to translate the
Danish kingdom into a multimedia corporation, and to watch the
story unfold in penthouse hotel rooms, sky-level office corridors,
a coffee shop, an airplane, the Guggenheim Museum. The chief thing
was to balance respect for the play with respect for contemporary
reality _ to see how thoroughly Shakespeare can speak to the
present moment, how they can speak to each other.
</P>
<P>
   When I showed Ethan Hawke a six-page treatment and explained my
intention _ to shoot fast and cheap in New York, to film in super
16 millimeter, to make everything as urgent and intimate as
possible, to keep all spoken dialogue as written by Shakespeare but
set within and energized by a contemporary context _ Ethan got it
immediately. He trusted me, and he was ready, with a breathtaking
absence of Hamlet-like equivocation, to leap in. ``You know,'' he
said during our first discussion, in a bar, over midafternoon
glasses of beer, ``we don't have to go to Yale to do this.'' Then
again, given 400 years of tradition, we knew we could never prepare
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan worked with an actor who had previously played Hamlet on
stage (a gifted man too modest and ambitious to want himself
credited as a coach), and we met at least once a week, reading and
talking through the play, most often in Ethan's study, where he
tended to pace around the pool table that dominated the room.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan's contributions were essential. Fortified by Harold
Goddard's excellent critical study, ``The Meaning of Shakespeare''
(unfortunately out of print), he made a case for Hamlet as someone
whose hesitation to kill Claudius is justified, contrary to the
questionable imperatives of revenge or the bloodlust of an
impatient audience. Hamlet doesn't need to kill Claudius, Ethan
insisted, once he's made the man face his own guilt. ``There's
nothing in the body of Shakespeare's work that suggests he thinks
murder is a good thing,'' he said. The level of vulnerability Ethan
brought to the role, the quality of imploding self-doubt, is
tempered by this conclusion, as is our entire treatment of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, Ethan passed me a video cued to a clip of the
Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, whose concept of ``inter-being''
felt like a perfect ramp leading up to Hamlet's most famous
soliloquy. I tossed it into the mix _ the one modern pre-recorded
voice, I'd like to think, that Shakespeare wouldn't consider an
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this I was watching every version of ``Hamlet''
available in New York, scheduling systematic visits to the Museum
of Modern Art, the Museum of Television and Radio and the Library
for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. (This is a curiously
claustrophobic activity. You plug yourself into headphones and a
monitor mounted within a tight Formica cubicle, surrounded almost
exclusively by middle-aged men studying old Broadway musicals.)

 &HT;    Coaches: Short season is costing state's kids
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA, Ga. _ When it comes to track and field in Georgia, the
state isn't short on talent. But to many coaches, it's short on
time.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' state championship track meet gets under way today in
Albany, the final chapter in a season that high school coaches and
college recruiters say ends too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of coaches would like to see the state track meet be the
second and third week (of May) instead of the first and second,''
Brookwood coach Tomy Sitton said. ``You pick up the better part of
the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches and recruiters contend that the way Georgia's track
season is scheduled isn't conducive to fully developing a talent
base that some say compares favorably with any other state in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia is one of the top five states in track,'' South
Carolina head track coach Curtis Frye said. ``It has as good (as)
or better athletes than anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But few Georgia names are among the national lists of track and
field's elite high school performers, who mostly hail from
California and Texas. On the latest DyeStat high school track Web
site rankings, only two girls and two girls relay teams from
Georgia have cracked the top 10 nationally in the 24 events posted.
Three boys and one boys relay team are in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the results in sprints, jumps and hurdles and
compare (Georgia kids) with kids in other parts of the country,
you'll see that in Georgia, the performances are somewhat behind,''
Georgia Tech women's track coach Alan Drosky said. ``That doesn't
mean these kids aren't as good _ there are a lot of talented kids.
... They just don't develop in high school to the level of other
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple answer is, have the season be longer. Move state
meets back a little later.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls track teams began practicing Jan. 31, with their first
meets on Feb. 21. Since teams have to schedule 10 meets, excluding
region and state meets, most are done during March, one of
Georgia's coolest and rainiest months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a flip of a coin if its going to be 20 degrees or
60 degrees some days,'' Sitton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track is definitely a warm-weather sport,'' Pope coach Bill
Sheskey said. ``It hurts to run hurdles when it's cold outside. You
can't pole vault in cold weather. You're slower, you don't jump as
high. The effects are pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent Georgia track field honor roll, most of the
state's top outdoor performances have come in the latter part of
the season. Of the 15 events posted on the Georgia track and field
honor roll, 11 of the top girls' performances came after April 1 _
and three were posted on March 28. Nine of the top boys'
performances came in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, we get some good weather the last two weeks and the
kids are finally starting to perform,'' Southwest DeKalb coach
Napoleon Cobb said. ``But in a week or two, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cobb would like to see the track season extended two more
weeks, Sitton and Westminster boys coach Joe Tribble feel an extra
week in May would suffice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, seven to 10 days, that could make a difference,''
Tribble said. ``You'd have better weather and better training
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Change isn't likely to happen anytime soon. Georgia High School
Association executive director Tommy Guillebeau said no one has
proven to his satisfaction that an extended season would lead to
improved performances or more scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider a move, Guillebeau said, ``Why? Is it
going to make a real difference? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Our info shows that some schools will be dismissing
in the middle of May next year. We try to get everything we can
while school's still in session.''
</P>
<P>
   Including spring football, which some coaches blame for the
shortened season in spring sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same in North Carolina, Florida, here,'' Frye said.
``They've got to get enough time in before school lets out for
football. They cut the (track) season short.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillebeau said spring football has no impact on other spring
sports. The GHSA allows two weeks for spring football and this
year, it is scheduled from May 1-12. The boys' state meet is May
12-13 in Jefferson this season. No matter the reason, most coaches
would like to see a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my real regrets during my career is that the kids in
Georgia's season is so short,'' Cobb said. ``Rarely are our kids
able to post the best times. They don't reach their peak. They
don't get a chance.''

 UNDATED: Broadway musicals.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, I rummaged through books of critical theory but, more
to the point, I never stopped reading the play, which carries the
best advice for any director: ``Suit the action to the word, the
word to the action.'' This is so smart and simple it's almost
stupefying.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay came together quickly and even easily _ a process
of channeling and distillation. (Typing Shakespeare straight into
your computer is a thrilling act of ventriloquism that I can
recommend to any writer.) My main job, anticipating work behind the
camera, was to imagine a parallel visual language that might hold a
candle to Shakespeare's poetry. There was no wish to illustrate the
text, but to focus it, building a visual structure to accommodate
Shakespeare's imagery and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   From what I can tell, global corporate power is as smoothly
treacherous and absolute as anything going in a well-oiled feudal
kingdom, and the notion of an omnipresent Denmark Corp. provided an
easy vehicle for Claudius' smiling villainy. But this was a key
opening a wider door. It's more meaningful to explore how
Shakespeare's massive interlocking themes _ innocence and
corruption, identity and fate, love and death, the division between
action and thought _ might be heightened, even clarified, when
colliding with the spectacle of contemporary media-saturated
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, after all, has Hamlet caught in the wheels of his
own hyperactive mind, enthralled by ``words words words.'' The film
admits that images currently keep pace with words, or outstrip
them, creating a kind of overwhelming alternate reality. So nearly
every scene in the script features a photograph, a TV monitor, an
electronic recording device of some kind. The play-within-the-play
becomes Hamlet's homemade video projection. Polonius (Bill Murray)
eavesdrops on his daughter (Julia Stiles) by taping a microphone to
her shirt. (This was Ethan's inspiration, courtesy of Linda Tripp.)
And while nature, in the dialogue, is continually invoked, the
characters in the film are never exposed to a real landscape until
they arrive, en masse, at Ophelia's funeral _ the graveyard being
the only respite from the city's hard surfaces, mirrors, screens
and signs.
</P>
<P>
   In reviews published since the movie's premiere, in late January
at the Sundance Film Festival, the only criticism that's rattled me
are the strangely bitter complaints about ``product placement'' _
carping fueled by the cynical assumption that billboards and logos
on display in the film were promotional throwaways by which the
producers lined their pockets. The undignified, all but
unbelievable truth is that we paid for the privilege of parading
certain logos and insignias across the screen. There was, after
all, an intended point. ``Denmark is a prison,'' Hamlet declares
early on, and if you consider this in terms of contemporary
consumer culture, the bars of the cage are defined by advertising,
by all the hectic distractions, brand names, announcements and ads
that crowd our waking hours. And when, in this independent film,
the ghost of Hamlet's father vanishes into a Pepsi machine, or
Hamlet finds himself questioning the nature of existence in the
``Action'' aisles of a Blockbuster video store, or Shakespeare's
lines are overwhelmed by the roar of a plane passing overhead _
it's meant as something more than casual irony. It's another way to
touch the core of Hamlet's anguish, to recognize the frailty of
spiritual values in a material world, and to get a whiff of
something rotten in Denmark on the threshold of our
self-congratulatory new century.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the film contains some dazzling contradictions.
The fact that this ``Hamlet,'' skidding into being on a perilously
low budget, happens to feature a notably high-profile cast _
prominent actors all working for scale _ is further testament to
Shakespeare's supernatural status as the great leveler, unifier of
mighty opposites.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the actors were my first choices for the roles.
Sam Shepard, preparing the ghost's big speech, confided that he'd
never worked so hard on a part, never felt so challenged. (I can
report, in turn, that I never saw the ghost played with such an
electrifying sense of reality.) Bill Murray, showing up for the
script reading, disingenuously volunteered that nobody had ever
asked him to play Shakespeare before. (He then confessed he'd taken
workshops, years earlier, with the magical scholar and voice coach
Kristin Linklater, and he handled the language with such eccentric
agility that I'm hoping he tackles a heftier Shakespearean role
down the road.) It also emerged that Murray, in the course of an
action-packed career, had never taken on a film in which he was
obliged to die. Whereas Ethan Hawke had always resisted roles
requiring his character to kill someone. And here we all were _ all
the actors in the film doing miraculous work, coerced by
Shakespeare into facing an extended part of themselves, a new kind
of reality.
</P>
<P>
   It's a truism that every movie is made three times: in the
writing, in the shooting, and in the editing, each process
generating new contingencies and surprises. And so, many of our
best and worst ideas fell by the wayside _ sacrificed for the sake
of clarity and momentum and to dodge mistakes, making this latest
``Hamlet'' the most condensed straight film adaptation in English.
Entire scenes were dropped, Shakespeare's text was further trimmed
and torn, and the result is, inevitably, an attempt at ``Hamlet'' _
not so much a sketch but a collage, a patchwork of intuitions,
images and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's there?'' The famous stark first line was finally cut,
with great reluctance. But we never stopped asking ourselves the
question. Shakespeare's most inexhaustible play _ an echo chamber,
a bottomless well, a hall of mirrors, an untamable beast _ keeps
throwing back infinite answers.

BURT LANCASTER'S BRAWNY MELANCHOLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 7)  
 By RICK MARIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many ways, Burt Lancaster is the antithesis of the modern
leading man. Today's young actors build themselves the bodies of
athletes. He was an athlete who built himself into an actor. They
come from the schools of soft knocks (Harvard, Yale). He graduated
from De Witt Clinton High School, in New York City's Hell's
Kitchen. They went to the circus. He was in the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster was both of his time _ a golden-age Movie Star _ and
way ahead of it. As an independent producer, he helped sabotage the
studio system that made him, at one time, the highest-paid actor in
the world. And yet, when he died, in 1994, at the age of 80, there
was no funeral or memorial service. That was his choice. But there
wasn't much in the way of public epitaph, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' Kramer looks up into the
sky and says with even more than his usual brio: ``There's
something in the air. I can feel it!'' To which Jerry snidely
retorts, ``You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?'' The man
who inspired such awe and trembling had become a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after his last appearance on the screen, attention is
being paid. Kate Buford's new biography, ``Burt Lancaster: An
American Life'' (Knopf), wants to reclaim relevancy for its
protagonist in all kinds of ways: as actor, indie producer,
possible bisexual. More straightforward proof of Lancaster's
lifetime achievement, as they say on the awards shows, is on view
at the Walter Reade Theater through May 18, in the Film Society of
Lincoln Center's retrospective, ``American Dreamer: Burt
Lancaster.'' Both the biography and filmography are overdue
tributes to what Vincent Canby once called `` Lancaster's
remarkable _ though not often remarked about _ career.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Lancaster's remarkable body and equally energetic mind
did him the disservice of lasting too long. His cap-toothed
charisma and immaculate diction seemed square once mumbling method
men like James Dean and Marlon Brando changed the game. After his
years as a prime specimen of hunkus Americanus _ Pauline Kael's
cutting coinage _ the movies didn't quite know what to do with him,
nor he with them. The nadir on this score may have been his
unfortunate foray into the disaster genre, ``Airport'' (1970),
justifiably spoofed in ``Airplane!''
</P>
<P>
   But he had an impressively long run, documented in the Film
Society's series, from his debut in ``The Killers'' (1946) and the
even more noir follow-up, ``Criss Cross'' (1947), the swashbuckling
of ``The Crimson Pirate'' (1952), ``From Here to Eternity'' (1953),
the Indians-and-cowboy reversal ``Apache'' (1954) and the double
whammy of ``Sweet Smell of Success'' and ``Gunfight at OK Corral''
(both 1957), then ``Elmer Gantry'' (1960), which won him his first
and only Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s and '70s _ Lancaster's middle period _ were less
sure-footed. The cerebral ``Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962) gave way
to ill-advised experiments with facial hair and neckwear. A bid for
so-called international stardom was bracketed by two pictures
directed by Luchino Visconti, ``The Leopard'' (1963) and ``The
Conversation Piece'' (1974). Out of these years came many would-be
classics and one true one, ``The Swimmer'' (1968), an underrated
adaptation of John Cheever's short story of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Late Lancaster started with ``Atlantic City'' (1980) and peaked
with ``Local Hero'' (1983). These lion-in-winter years are how many
younger moviegoers first got a load of him: a big, white-haired,
wild-eyed geezer or, as Buford more kindly suggests, ``like a
famous uncle who was once a great athlete.'' But as Buford so
extensively demonstrates, he was much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth of five children, Burton Stephen Lancaster was born
in 1913. His father worked at the post office, sang Irish songs and
took the kids to the zoo and Coney Island. His mother went from
black-Irish beauty to 250-pound terror. They lived on the second
floor of a narrow brownstone in East Harlem. After high school,
young Burt joined the circus with his gym buddy and lifelong crony,
Nick Cravat. Lancaster was good, not great, on the horizontal bar,
carneys later recalled. A marriage in 1935 to a female acrobat also
ended in 1935. World War II beckoned, and the USO. When the war
ended, he went West and made ``The Killers,'' Richard Siodmak's
hard-boiled elaboration on Ernest Hemingway's story about a
washed-up boxer with a price on his head.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Picture met with really great reception and seems pretty close
to what we dreamed about,'' the producer, Mark Hellinger, cabled
him after the first press screening. ``I'm afraid you're destined
to be a big star, you poor guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture was also the ideal Lancaster showpiece. It played to his
two sides: explosive physicality and melancholy. Three sides if you
count mixing it up with Ava Gardner. (Jackie Bone, Lancaster's
companion for many years, once described watching him on a golf
course, in repose, and thinking, ``there is one unhappy man.'') In
``Criss Cross'' he was again a good guy doomed to a bad end, if a
little too commanding and charismatic a presence to convincingly
play a loser. As Lancaster strides through an early scene in the
movie, the bartender mistakes him for a G-man liquor inspector, a
``checker.'' Disappointed, a female barfly gives Lancaster a
surprised once-over, purring, ``Swell looking, nicely built man
like that, a checker!''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 build would remain nice, lovingly preserved and on
display for many years to come. Hard to believe the lean, and very
mean, warrior hero of ``Apache'' was being played by a 40-year-old
man. In the new Technicolor print at Lincoln Center, the contrast
between his greasepaint Indian skin and blazing blue eyes almost
looks like a special effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burt Lancaster is 52,'' Cheever wrote in a letter when ``The
Swimmer'' went into production in 1967. ``Lithe, comely and
somewhat disfigured by surgical incisions and he looks both young
and old, masterful and tearful.'' Lancaster could barely swim when
he took the part of Ned Merrill, a Connecticut suburbanite with an
unspoken secret who swims home through his neighbors' pools as the
weather _ and neighbors _ get colder and darker. But he trained
scrupulously (as he had for ``Jim Thorpe: All-American''), hiring
the coach of the UCLA men's water polo team because he didn't want
to ``insult'' real smimmers in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   He never tried to disown the action-man stuff but was always
eager to play against type, on the screen and off. By 1947, he
already had his own production company, Norma Productions (named
after his second wife). Work with the producer Harold Hecht led to
a new entity, Hecht-Lancaster. Their partnership contributed to the
seismic power shift from the studios to the actors or, more
accurately, their agents. Lancaster's agent was the godfather
himself, MCA's Lew Wasserman. With Wasserman advising and wetting
his beak, Hecht and Lancaster made serious, sometimes political
films in black and white while living large in offices decorated
with El Grecos and adjustable waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Their big-screen version of Paddy Chayefsky's television drama
``Marty'' swept the 1956 Oscars _ the same year Lancaster starred
in ``Trapeze,'' a sentimental ode to the big top co-starring Tony
Curtis. The two movies might as well have been made on different
planets.
</P>
<P>
   These two stars had worked together before: Curtis had an
uncredited bit part as a gigolo in ``Criss Cross.'' But the
collaboration people remember is ``Sweet Smell of Success,''
produced by Hecht-Hill-Lancaster. (James Hill, a writer, producer
and world-class hanger-on, made the company a troika.) Too
gimlet-eyed for moviegoers and many critics when it came out,
``Sweet Smell'' ruthlessly unmasked the unholy alliance between
journalism and publicity at a time when people did not speak of
such things. We're still in that time, come to think of it.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characters are J.J. Hunsecker, an all-powerful
columnist modeled on Walter Winchell, and Sidney Falco, the
ambitious press agent in the great man's thrall. Lancaster is in
full cerebral mode as Hunsecker, physically almost inert, while
Curtis dances around him. In many of the most famous scenes, he is
sitting down, staring up through glasses smeared with vaseline to
further fog the windows to a darkened soul. Based on a novella by
Ernest Lehmann, a former press agent who had been one of Winchell's
gofers, the screenplay was taken to the next level of crackling
cynicism by Clifford Odets. Odets, in full ``Barton Fink'' mode,
was on his last legs career-wise but still able to dash off on-set
rewrites like Falco's ``the cat's in the bag and the bag's in the
river.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every line in the movie seems memorable, either because
of the words or their delivery. Hunsecker's exultation, ``I love
this dirty town.'' Falco announcing, ``From now on the best of
everything is good enough for me,'' and, to his naive secretary:
``This is life. Get used to it.'' Originally, the partners had
thought of Orson Welles for Hunsecker until Lancaster said, ``What
about me?'' It wasn't a stretch. He had already become a maniacal
control freak, with a reputation as ``one of the rudest individuals
in Hollywood,'' Look magazine reported in 1953. He womanized _ and
manized, if we are to believe the rumors. His mean streak could
reduce huge stars to tears. He supposedly made his friend and
fellow ex-acrobat Kirk Douglas cry by making fun of the lifts in
his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mackendrick, imported from England to direct ``Sweet
Smell,'' bore the brunt of Lancaster's rages. One choice incident
that Mackendrick relates in Buford's book:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been drinking a little. Burt started shouting at me _ and
he's scary. Then he came at me across the room with that
coiled-spring animal energy, like a panther, and vaulted over a
sofa in one of the most graceful movements I've ever seen, [as if)
to attack me. I stood up and said, `No, Burt,' and he stopped. That
took every atom of performance possible. The reason I had the
strength was that just as he came across the sofa I thought, `He's
beautiful!'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a turning point. ```Sweet Smell of Success' destroyed us
all,'' Mackendrick said near the end of his life. Lancaster was
never quite that beautiful or powerful again, even though he had
yet to turn down the unprecedented offer of $1 million for
``Ben-Hur'' and was still three years away from his Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Malle got a taste of Bad Burt two decades later when he
cast him as the broken-down old gangster in ``Atlantic City.'' But
this time, Burt was in no position to be hurdling furniture. In
1980, Lancaster was 63, and his big, broad style could not have
been more out of style. Early requests by Malle to tone down line
readings drew tantrums. ``OK, we'll do it the way the little
froggie wants it, and then we'll do it the way it should be done,''
Lancaster railed on the set one day, in front of the director. To
his credit, he realized Malle was right, modulated his performance
and was nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   How sad that the Buford biography has to play the sex card to
validate Lancaster's currency _ as if bisexuality makes him modern.
The naked rear-view still from ``The Swimmer'' seems like a fairly
obvious and cheesy plea for publicity. You want current?. Watch the
movies. There is no sadder statement about suburbia than ``The
Swimmer,'' no inmate in HBO's ``Oz'' as complex as the Birdman, and
no villain more hep than J.J. Hunsecker.

JUSTICE AFTER 20 YEARS FOR WOMAN'S MURDERER IN HOUSTON

   HOUSTON _ A murderous impulse on a Houston freeway almost 20
years ago killed a divorced mother of two. On Wednesday, justice
caught up with her killer.
</P>
<P>
   Francis F. Pelkey, 46, remained expressionless as he was
sentenced to 40 years in prison for the Aug. 13, 1980, murder of
Nell Johnson, a 36-year-old hospital inspector whose bizarre
shooting remained unsolved while her children grew up waiting for a
day in court.

his mother died. ``It's a lot easier to breathe now.''

<P>
   His sister, Laura, now 31, shared her brother's bittersweet
feelings about Pelkey's sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's finally being held accountable for his
actions,'' she said. ``It helps with some closure, I think. But we
still miss her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey's sentence will keep him in prison for at least 13 years
before he's eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey, a diesel mechanic with no criminal record, was the prime
suspect in the murder 20 years ago. But the case was thin and he
wasn't charged.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey eventually left Houston. About 16 years ago, he and his
wife and their three children moved to Sacramento, Calif., where he
bought a $130,000 house with a pool and lived a law-abiding,
church-going life.
</P>
<P>
   But that came crashing down in April 1999 when a grand jury
indicted him for murder, following the work of the Harris County
Sheriff's Department ``cold case squad'' and two detectives who
thought Pelkey had gotten away with murder for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran homicide detectives Harry Fikaris and Roger Wedgeworth
were assigned to the special squad in May 1998, when a reduction in
the crime rate allowed more time for fresh looks at old cases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's was one of the first cases they examined.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some hope that new DNA evidence could be found, it
wasn't, and the detectives were left with the evidence they had
before _ Pelkey's odd statement to police after Johnson's
bullet-riddled body was found five miles from her car in a wooded
area in north Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   But the detectives found what they needed in the statement and,
because of a change in evidence rules on the admissibility of such
statements, they took the case to prosecutor Steve Baldassano.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony and evidence, the day after Johnson's
body was found, Pelkey called police and told them an intricate
story about an encounter with her.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was on his way to work early on Aug. 13, 1980, when
he stopped to help her fix a flat on Interstate 45. He said he got
back into his van to leave and that his vehicle wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey said he honked his horn to stop Johnson from driving off
and that she gave him a ride to his home so he could get his tools.
He said they returned to his van on the side of the busy freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey claimed he was fixing his van and that Johnson was
sitting inside of it when two armed robbers approached. One of the
robbers, he said, reached inside the van, got Pelkey's own
.22-caliber pistol and shot Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey told police the killers then took his cap and shirt and
that one of them drove off in his van with Johnson's body and his
gun, while the other held him at gunpoint in their truck.
</P>
<P>
   He said the other killer returned, without Johnson, and returned
his cap, shirt and gun to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey contended the robbers then threatened to kill him if he
talked, and they left in their truck.
</P>
<P>
   And just as authorities had 20 years ago, Baldassano and the
detectives thought Pelkey's story was ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   But going over old interviews, Fikaris and Wedgeworth found
there was part of Pelkey's statement that wasn't included in the
official reports.
</P>
<P>
   When police in 1980 had expressed disbelief at Pelkey's story,
he said: ``I'll tell you what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Pelkey's wife, Sharon, shut him up and he talked
no further. Years later, when he was arrested in California, he
refused to talk and so did his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Pelkey declined to talk to the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the detectives and Baldassano had what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Pelkey's statement, he admits to going home after the
mysterious robbers left so he could clean his clothes, his van and
his gun.
</P>
<P>
   His description of a gunman matched his own appearance, even
down to the color of the pants he was wearing, something Baldassano
said must have been concocted so Pelkey could cover being seen with
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   And no one saw the truck the alleged robbers were driving. The
only vehicles spotted were Pelkey's and Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Throw into the mix two more things _ Pelkey said Johnson was
about to drive off after he fixed her flat. But when her car was
found the hood was up. Baldassano said it was unlikely Johnson was
going to drive off with her hood raised.
</P>
<P>
   Pelkey also mentioned honking at Johnson. But Baldassano
wondered how that horn could work since Pelkey had said he was
working on his van's failing battery.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bite mark on Pelkey's left arm that was visible
when he was questioned in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   An expert testified at trial that the bite appeared to be
consistent with a human bite made by someone whose mouth was the
same shape as Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's got to live free for 20 years,'' Fikaris said
Wednesday. ``He got to raise his family, but there's no doubt in my
mind, or Roger's mind, that he absolutely did this.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite arguments by defense attorney Don Rogers that the
state's case was weak and lacked physical evidence, jurors thought
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the question remained _ why would a married father on his
way to work, who never had been in trouble with the law, kill a
woman for no reason?
</P>
<P>
   Baldassano told jurors no one will ever know.
</P>
<P>
   But he theorized that Pelkey had made a sexual advance on
Johnson in his van.
</P>
<P>
   She fought and bit him, Pelkey got mad, and things spiraled out
of control, said Baldassano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things just got out of control in incremental steps
and he just sort of overreacted,'' Baldassano said. ``I think this
was a crime of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Jim Wallace said the case sends a message
to criminals who think they've gotten away with something.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the saying, ``Justice delayed is justice denied''
doesn't apply in this case because Pelkey was caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice has now been achieved for Nell Johnson,'' said
Wallace, who added that criminals who are free should now shudder
when they hear a knock on the door, whether it's the next day or
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wedgeworth agreed and now he and his partner say this case will
drive them as they dig into more unsolved murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw Nell Johnson's family stand shoulder-to-shoulder and
watch the cuffs be put on (Pelkey),'' Wedgeworth said. ``They had
waited for that and that picture will stay in my mind always.
That's going to motivate me.'' &QL;

 BOSTON HOSPITAL CITED FOR FAILURE TO REPORT DEATH IN GENE THERAPY
EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Researchers at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center here
failed to report the death of a patient in gene therapy experiments
and might have contributed to the growth of cancer in another
patient, whose condition was also reported improperly,
investigators for the Food and Drug Administration have said.
</P>
<P>
   Their accusation were made in April in a letter to the hospital
and the chief researcher in the experiment, Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner,
and was recently posted on the agency's Web site. The experiment
has been stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes as scientists, hospitals and companies sponsoring
gene therapy experiments have been working to assure the public of
the safety of the experiments after the death of a patient in a
gene experiment at the University of Pennsylvania last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cumming, president of the Vascular Genetics Inc. of Durham,
N.C., the company sponsoring the experiment at St. Elizabeth's,
acknowledged Wednesday that there had been some ``problems'' in the
gene therapy experiment. Cumming said the company would do
everything it could to satisfy the FDA in correcting the problems.
He said he was ``very optimistic'' that positive results would be
presented to the agency this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cumming said he would not dispute the agency's findings and said
that his company had hired two outside groups to audit and monitor
all the experiments it had begun around the country, including the
one at St. Elizabeth's. The groups were hired after the company
learned that the federal agency was writing a warning letter, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Hagopian, a spokeswoman for the St. Elizabeth's, said the
hospital took the warning letter very seriously, and added: ``We
are focusing all our resources on producing a thorough and
thoughtful response to the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's public relations office said that Isner would not
be available for comment at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in the experiment were reported on Tuesday in The
Washington Post and The Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiment at St. Elizabeth's, which was jointly
sponsored by Tufts University, a gene that makes a substance called
VEGF (for vascular endothelial growth factor) was injected directly
into the hearts of patients with blocked heart vessels. Researchers
hoped the gene would start making the growth factor, which is the
body's natural substance to make blood vessels grow.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors for the federal agency said they found a number of
violations of the rules of the experiment in a routine check in
March. One patient in the experiment died two months after
receiving the experimental therapy, but the researchers failed to
report the death to the agency. The agency is investigating to
determine if the treatment was the cause of the death.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a patient was included in the study although he
should have been kept out under the rules of the experiment. The
patient was a heavy smoker and a small mass had appeared in one
lung, the agency said. Because the experimental therapy used a
chemical designed to increase the growth of blood vessels, the
agency said, it was possible that it increased the supply of blood
to the growing tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's warning letter noted that the St. Elizabeth's
researchers saw the mass when it was less than a centimeter in July
1999, then again in August when it was two centimeters in diameter,
but went ahead with the treatment on Sept. 21, 1999. Two months
later, the agency said, the patient was hospitalized with chest
pain, and the mass was found to have grown to five centimeters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence in the patient's records or the experiment
records that either the patient or his doctor was notified of the
growth of the mass, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital and the researchers have 15 days to tell the agency
how they will correct the problems in the experiment. The FDA has
the authority to ban the researchers from future work using federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   This and three other experiments carried on by Isner were
stopped when the agency first began its inspection in February and
have not resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Isner is a founder of the company leading the trials and is a
major stockholder in it.

KEY MICROSOFT EXECUTIVE FINDS HIS `OTHER LIFE' MORE ALLURING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan P. Myhrvold, the chief technology officer of Microsoft
Corp., announced his departure on Wednesday, joining a wave of
executives and senior engineers who have left the company in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold's exit, however, is not a big surprise. He had been on
a leave of absence since last July, and many industry analysts had
predicted it would become permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure,'' Myhrvold said on Wednesday. ``But, of course,
there is always the possibility that when a guy takes a year off
he'll find that other life more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   For Myhrvold, 40, the other life has included digging for
dinosaurs in eastern Montana as part of a five-year expedition he
helped finance.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold joined Microsoft in 1986 and has held many positions,
but was always a close adviser to Bill Gates, the chairman,
suggesting new ideas and new directions for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold brought to that task a wide-ranging intellect and
breadth of interests. He did post-doctoral research in cosmology at
Cambridge University under the physicist Stephen Hawking. He has
written articles for Nature, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair on
everything from paleontology to the pleasures of owning a private
jet. He is an accomplished chef, having studied at French cooking
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Myhrvold founded Microsoft Research, a unit that now
has a worldwide staff of 500 researchers. Critics say Microsoft has
little to show for its investment so far, but the company says work
from the research group can be found inside its operating systems,
database, Internet media and electronic-book software.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming chief technology officer in 1996, Myhrvold was
the group executive in charge of Microsoft's online and new media
efforts. But Microsoft eventually pulled back from trying to be a
media company as it failed to make any real progress against
America Online. In early 1999, after a management reorganization,
Myhrvold was no longer a member of the executive team that reported
directly to Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold has founded a company called Intellectual Ventures and
has invested in an Internet company and a couple of biotechnology
start-ups. He will continue as a part-time adviser to Gates, who
said Myhrvold's contributions over the years had been ``critical''
to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Myhrvold's departure, Microsoft announced on
Wednesday that Rick Rashid has been named senior vice president for
Microsoft Research. Rashid joined Microsoft in 1991 from Carnegie
Mellon University and has been largely responsible for building the
research group up to its current size.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ling, a former researcher at IBM's Watson Labs, who came to
Microsoft in 1992, was named vice president for research.

TURN DOWN TURNOVER COSTS BY GIVING EMPLOYEES MORE OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How ya gonna keep 'em on the farm?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe by letting them work a different field.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that complain mightily about high staff turnover rates
may have their own human resource policies to blame. They make it
too difficult for employees to explore job opportunities within the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations have rules designed to prevent managers from
one division or department from raiding talented employees from
another operating unit. They don't let managers solicit
applications from someone else's domain.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, these rules also say employees can't apply to other
units without alerting their current managers.
</P>
<P>
   Such rules are reasonable in that they lessen the chance of
nasty turf battles and blindsided staffing disruptions. But there's
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The real effect sometimes is that excellent employees choose to
look outside the company for new opportunities rather than travel
the time-consuming and politically dangerous route to an in-house
job change.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, some employees stay in jobs they've outgrown or don't
like because they fear the political repercussions of internal
change. They lose out on new challenges, plus the possibility of a
better raise than they'd get by staying put. The company loses,
too, when a good job candidate gives up.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the worst cases, current managers are allowed to veto or
hold up job transfers for months on the grounds that their
operations would be hurt by the departure. What happens then?
All-around disgruntlement.
</P>
<P>
   With staff turnover consistently ranking as a top corporate
human resource problem, it's time to demolish barriers to in-house
transfers. The very rules designed to reduce staff disruption may
be causing more disruption than they prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the U.S. workplace is becoming a ``free agent''
economy. Workers today, especially younger, techno-savvy workers,
are changing jobs _ and will change jobs _ far more frequently than
the World War II or baby boom generations. They leave when they're
unchallenged or bored in their current work assignments.
</P>
<P>
   If providing an interesting and variable career path to a good
worker isn't enough reason to facilitate interdepartmental
transfers, then maybe money talks. It costs companies a lot more to
hire and train people from outside than it does to accommodate
in-house changes.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, the typical U.S. corporate worker
received a 4 percent annual raise. The surer way to a bigger raise
was to change jobs, but reluctance to lose tenure and benefits kept
many workers from testing the job market. In-house transfers let
workers retain tenure and prospect for better pay or opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing: Because companies usually have to pay more to
lure new hires on board than they pay to current workers in the
same positions, that pay disparity breeds morale problems with
existing staff.
</P>
<P>
   When employees can test their marketability through in-house
transfers, they sample the free-agent action without abandoning
their employer _ and that's profitable for all concerned.

STRONGER RESPONSE BY MINORITIES HELPS IMPROVE CENSUS REPLY RATE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Helped by a surprisingly strong response from
Hispanics and other minorities, the Census Bureau has halted a long
slide in response rates and received answers from nearly two-thirds
of the households that got a census form in the mail this year.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary figures from the agency show that despite widespread
complaints about its questionnaires, especially the long form
received by a sixth of all households, 65.9 percent of all
households replied as of April 30. Census officials estimate that
the final response rate may be as high as 67 percent, compared with
a mail-back rate of 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Though small, the improvement over 1990 represents the reversal
of a three-decade decline in the proportion of American households
that have returned the questionnaire. In 1970, 83 percent of
households receiving the forms responded; in 1980, 75 percent did
so. And the improvement occurs as other indices of civic
engagement, like voting and volunteer work, have been in steep
declines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of this mobilization to get people to fill out
their forms was about how you help your communities,'' Kenneth
Prewitt, the census director, said. ``That's a positive sign when
you get people to take responsibility for their communities. It's a
foundation to try to do something about the cynicism and
indifference that we all complain about.''
</P>
<P>
   The new figures provide powerful evidence of the effectiveness
of a vigorous advertising campaign the agency mounted to persuade a
jaded and skeptical public to fill out the forms. The campaign has
aimed heavily at minority groups and focused heavily on the
advantages of increasing census tallies, which are used to steer
many federal programs to local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Polling data indicate that households that were heavily exposed
to the bureau's marketing effort were much more likely to send back
the form, even though these same households were more prone to
consider the questions an invasion of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As has always been the case, neighborhoods and states whose
residents tended to be overwhelmingly white still had a higher
response rate than those areas with more members of minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   But census data show that areas where the majority of households
are black held their own and that census tracts where Hispanic
residents are the majority or where no ethnic or racial group is
more than 50 percent sharply improved their performance over 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, census bureau figures indicate that the biggest declines
in participation occurred in areas whose residents were largely
white or Asian American.
</P>
<P>
   For example, California, a state where racial and ethnic
minorities make up nearly half of the population, posted the
biggest growth in the response rate, rising to 68 percent this
year, compared to 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Idaho _ which have relatively
few minorities _ all saw sharp declines in the number of households
that returned census questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``To oversimply things, in terms of response rates, whites
performed slightly less well than they did in 1990; Hispanics and
blacks out-performed their 1990 experience,'' said Steve Jost, the
Census Bureau's associate director for communications.
</P>
<P>
   The high rates of response is a welcome relief to census
officials, whose original projections anticipated a response rate
of 61 percent. The 5 percentage points of higher response will save
the bureau millions of dollars in labor costs because it will need
fewer census takers to visit the homes of residents who did not
mail back their forms. Census takers have already begun making
those visits.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials cautioned that the results were based on a
compilation of the mail that the bureau has received back. Those
forms have not yet been read to determine if they were fully
completed. Any household that did not complete its form will still
be visited by a census taker.
</P>
<P>
   The performance should quiet some of the bureau's critics, who
have expressed concerns about its ability to carry out the census.
But it will do little if anything to quell the debate about the use
of statistical sampling methods to correct for a potential
undercount.
</P>
<P>
   Information on response rates among states comes from publicly
available data listed on the Census Bureau's World Wide Web site
(www.census.gov). Data on the response from different ethnic and
racial groups come from bureau's internal analysis of returns from
the country's more than 61,000 census tracts _ neighborhoods each
containing roughly 4,000 residents _ that was provided to The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials emphasized that some figures were
preliminary and subject to change, though they added that they
doubted that any changes would alter the overall conclusions very
much.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the improvement is due to the determined effort to
increase the response rate in California. Early in the planning
process, census officials estimated that 58 percent of the
households in the state that received a form would mail it back.
But state officials mounted a major campaign that included
appropriating $24 million to raise the response rate.
</P>
<P>
   By April 4 _ the latest date for detailed figures _ the response
rate for California was 68 percent, more than 1.4 million
households than original estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just delighted,'' said Linda Gage, the state's official
demographer. ``Only 12 states had better mail response rates than
we did and only Massachusetts, which is much smaller, exceed our
improvement in mail response rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials did not offer any theories for the
racial and ethnic differences in response rates. But a polling
company in Menlo Park, Calif., that was hired by a number of
foundations to assess the bureau's outreach efforts has produced
data indicating that the bureau's marketing and advertising
campaign resonated much more strongly among minorities than it did
with whites.
</P>
<P>
   The polling company, InterSurvey, found that 31 percent of the
black and 33 percent of the Hispanic households it surveyed said
they had ``high levels'' of exposure to the bureau's campaign,
compared with 16 percent of white households.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Noting their success at reversing a major trend, census
officials have grumbled that the White House has failed to express
appreciation for their achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, in a slightly veiled reference to the White
House as well as congressional leaders, Prewitt said that
``national leaders'' had missed the opportunity to use the census
to engage the public in a discussion of its rights and
responsibilities and to trumpet a government program that had
accomplished what it set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan, who is the ranking
Democrat on the House Subcommittee on the Census, said that
President Clinton ought to extend more credit to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole administration should be proud of the good work that
the Census Bureau has done,'' Maloney said. ``They should say so,
and I hope they will.''

   Major Market Gauges Drop On Interest Rates Concerns
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices fell after the government reported that factory
orders in March were higher than expected and a Federal Reserve
survey showed intensifying wage pressures. Both reports increased
anxiety about the Fed's May 16 meeting, at which it is expected to
raise interest rates for the sixth time since June. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 250.99 points, or 2.3 percent, to
10,480.13. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 78.14 points, or 2.1
percent, to 3,707.31, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
was off 31.19 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,415.10. The yield on the
two-year note rose to 6.74 percent and is the highest it has been
in 5 years. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.11
percent.

   Nathan Myhrvold, the chief technology officer of Microsoft,
announced that he will leave the software company. He had been on a
leave of absence from Microsoft since last July, and many analysts
predicted it would become permanent. ``I wasn't sure,'' he said.
``But, of course, there is always the possibility that when a guy
takes a year off he'll find that other life more attractive.''

<P>
   The 31-year-old daughter of Rupert Murdoch, Elisabeth Murdoch,
is quitting the company her father controls, British Sky
Broadcasting, at the end of June to start a media venture of her
own in London. Her departure may signal the end of a rivalry
between her and her two brothers, Lachlan and James, to succeed
their father as chairman of News Corp., which owns 40 percent of
BSkyB, which is Europe's No. 2 pay television concern.

share, from adjusted earnings of $97 million, or 5 cents a share,
in the period a year earlier. Excluding Go.com, Disney earned 18
cents a share; analysts had expected 14 cents. Still, its shares
fell $1.25, to $41.25. Revenue rose 14 percent to $6.2 billion.

FEAR AND JOKING ON THE LATE-NIGHT CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By PETER MARKS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, even the professionals have to avert their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could barely watch it,'' Vance DeGeneres, a veteran comedy
writer and performer on Comedy Central's ``Daily Show,'' said of
the incident on ``Late Show with David Letterman.'' ``It was almost
like watching those films where they're clubbing the baby seal to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``it'' was, perhaps, the most uncomfortable moment of
political humor of the television season. After weeks of goading by
Letterman, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to appear by
satellite on his show, an encounter that was, by most assessments,
a disaster for the Republican presidential candidate. Bush,
hampered by the split-second time delay and projecting an air of
being led on a forced march, offered one lame quip after another,
including a pun about Letterman's recent heart operation so
strained that it left the host staring, mortified, into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was instructive not only about how truly dangerous a
tete-a-tete with a witty talk-show host can be, but also about how
much clout television comedy wields in the shaping of political
perceptions. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press, roughly one in 10 Americans said they
routinely gleaned information about the presidential race from
late-night talk shows like the ones presided over by Letterman and
Jay Leno; nearly as many said that they regularly obtained
political news from other shows, like ``Saturday Night Live'' and
``Politically Incorrect,'' ``The Daily Show'' and ``Mad TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of viewers admitting that they get their politics
from television comedy may not be overwhelming. But considering
that the 1996 presidential election was decided by a mere eight
percentage points, what each and every consumer of comedy on
television takes away from the experience can be highly
significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to believe that,'' said Dick Blasucci, the executive
producer of ``Mad TV,'' Fox's Saturday night comedy show. ``Look:
what killed Dan Quayle was the beating up by Jay Leno and others.
I'm not saying they were taking sides, but I do think that kind of
stuff leaves an impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a serious impact on real events is, of course, the last
thing on the minds of most of the writers and performers of
political satire on television. ``I just want the politicians and
the people who watch our show to know that this is a place where
the buck honestly stops,'' said Bill Maher, the no-nonsense host of
``Politically Incorrect,'' ABC's free-wheeling after-hours
talkfest. Still, as the Bush appearance on ``Letterman''
illustrates, political comedy relies ever more intensively on the
willing (and in some instances unwitting) participation of actual
officeholders and officeseekers.
</P>
<P>
   That is attributable, at least in part, to the blurring of the
line between politics and entertainment, a boundary that has been
fading since the psychedelic days of ``Rowan and Martin's
Laugh-In,'' on which, in 1968, a dour politician by the name of
Richard M. Nixon, in a startling cameo, uttered the show's stock
phrase, ``Sock it to me?'' into the camera. If self-mockery once
seemed a bit of an indignity for politicians, nowadays they jump at
the chance to make 'em laugh. Members of Congress appear as
panelists along with country singers, rappers and actors on
``Politically Incorrect.'' Former presidential candidates _ even
former presidents _ show up at benefits as agreeable sidekicks to
their ``Saturday Night Live'' impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span has gotten into the act, broadcasting an annual evening
of stand-up comedy from Washington, in which reporters like Walter
Shapiro of USA Today and lawmakers like Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut perform their 10 minutes of shtick. And in what may
just be the slyest marriage of politics and comedy on television,
``The Daily Show,'' the satirical four-nights-a-week news and talk
show with the comedian Jon Stewart as host, has hired the former
Sen. Bob Dole as a commentator. ( Dole declined an interview
request.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show,'' with its deadpan reports from a comic corral
of field correspondents and sidelong glances at the day's
headlines, has developed a reputation for offering some of the
shrewdest political foolery on the small screen. ``We had a blast
working with them,'' said Todd Harris, who served as press
secretary for the New Hampshire primary campaign of Sen. John
McCain, to which ``The Daily Show'' attached one of its performers,
Steve Carell, for a mock news piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the piece came out, we had a tape of it on board the
Straight Talk Express,'' Harris said, ``and every couple of weeks
or so Senator McCain stopped everything and said, `Let's watch the
``Comedy Central'' tape!'''
</P>
<P>
   The segment followed Carell's exploits as he tried vainly to get
a seat on McCain's bus, a conceit that was inherently funny: McCain
had become instantly legendary for the generous access he provided
to the press. ``So there was a very humorous irony there,'' Harris
said, ``but there was also a deeper irony in the fact that we were
a serious presidential campaign, allowing them to partake of this
irony.''

 UNDATED: this irony.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was just the sort of piece that ``The Daily Show,'' and its
ongoing ``Indecision 2000'' election coverage, revels in. For the
past 16 months, the program's anchor desk has been manned by
Stewart. (Before that, it was the perch of Craig Kilborn, whose
talk show now follows Letterman's on CBS.) Stewart, along with
Madeleine Smithberg, the executive producer, oversees a staff of 60
writers, producers and technicians who work out of the show's
headquarters on a desolate midtown Manhattan side street a block
from the West Side Highway. The 30-minute program is a kind of
comic cocktail of reality and parody. ``We are a fake news
organization,'' Stewart said, ``but we feel the ups and downs that
real news organizations feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart sets a benign tone with political guests. There is a
compassionate quality to his interviews that reflects a higher
level of affection for politics than that displayed in the cranky
irreverence of Letterman or the jokey, disconnected chatter of
Leno. ``I believe if these people come on our show, they should
have the respect they're owed by virtue of the office they're in,''
Stewart said. ``I want them to feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, in fact, has gained a following in political circles
for its hipness and sense of fun. ``He is so fast, if he were a
shortstop, he would pick up everything,'' Rep. Dennis Kucinich,
D-Ohio, said of Stewart. ``And he realizes that he is prospecting
in very rich territory.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Politically Incorrect,'' Maher's style is decidedly less
ingratiating: he puts everyone on the hot seat. ``Not that I insult
the movie stars, but my show lives on the premise that I never pull
a punch,'' he said. As a result, he says, some potential political
guests remain leery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle was booked on our show recently and then pulled
out,'' Maher said, adding that he was told that ``something I
said'' about the former vice president had upset his handlers and
that ``they wanted me to apologize.'' Maher declined.
</P>
<P>
   He is aware, though, that his blunt style has power. Asked, for
instance, if he had invited Bush on his show, Maher laughed at the
improbability of such an appearance. ``I've been so hard on him,''
he said. (He added that he was not a fan of Vice President Al Gore,
either.)
</P>
<P>
   It may be just as well that Bush steers clear of the program,
given his performance on ``Letterman,'' a show that has become a
kind of political proving ground. Gerard Mulligan, a longtime staff
writer, said that Letterman ``discovered inadvertently'' just how
gravely candidates respond to his comic denunciations. For weeks,
he complained on the air about Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal to
appear on the show after announcing her campaign for the Senate
seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `The road to the Senate goes through this chair,' a
spur-of-the-moment thing,'' Mulligan recalled. Soon enough, Clinton
was seated opposite Letterman and submitting to a pop civics test
about New York, in which the host quizzed her on the name of the
state tree and bird.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how important a sense of humor on camera has
become to political discourse that candidates feel real pressure to
perform. As Clinton all but said to Letterman, her appearance on
his show was as obligatory a part of her race as a whistle-stop
tour of the Western tier. The tacit and attractive acknowledgment
to voters in such a booking is that a candidate is serious about
running but not so serious about themselves. ``You have to prove
you're a good sport,'' Mulligan said.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a political personality able to give as good as he
gets was what appealed to ``Daily Show'' honchos about signing on
Dole, who has been called on for commentary on the program's
expanded, hourlong coverage of pivotal campaign events. On the
campaign trail, Dole's barbs sometimes came across as a little too
sharp, but they are welcomed by Stewart and company. His hiring
brings the phenomenon full circle: the politician as television
entertainer about the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory on Dole,'' Smithberg said, ``is that he's like the
lawyer who is secretly a musician. Law is the job. And there are
these other muscles he always wanted to flex.''

FEDERAL REGULATORS APPROVE VIACOM'S MERGER DEAL WITH CBS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill., Md., Texas) By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials Wednesday approved the largest
broadcast merger in history _ Viacom Inc.'s $30 billion acquisition
of CBS _ just a day after two other media giants resolved a dispute
that was, in large part, a byproduct of consolidation in the
broadcasting and cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Federal Communications Commission to approve
a merger that will give Viacom control of 35 percent of the
broadcasting market represents the high-water mark of a Clinton
administration policy of promoting consolidation in a number of
industries as a way of encouraging competition. It was immediately
hailed by top executives of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman and chief executive of Viacom,
said that the acquisition would be completed on Thursday morning
and that CBS' ticker symbol would never again be trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really worked perfectly,'' an ebullient Redstone said
in an interview Wednesday afternoon. ``We basically got everything
we had wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's policy of permitting consolidation in the
telecommunications industry will be on display again later this
month, when the FCC is expected to approve a staff recommendation
to permit AT&AMP;T to complete its acquisition of MediaOne, giving it
control of more than a third of the cable industry. Many experts
expect that the Justice Department, which is reviewing that deal
for antitrust issues, will also approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is rooted in the notion that a few corporate
behemoths battling over control of the market can be both more
efficient and more competitive than any regulation and control from
bureaucrats in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think big is per se bad,'' said Joel I. Klein, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's
antitrust division. ``We analyze mergers in terms of relevant
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But such mergers do not always come without a price. The policy
helped both the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent company, and Time
Warner grow into formidable broadcasting and distribution companies
in recent years. But this week, some 3.5 million customers of Time
Warner cable television lost their ABC signal for almost two days
as the two companies wrangled over retransmission agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation has created bottlenecks that have made it
easier for one company to block the access of another. Moreover,
government officials and industry analysts say negotiations between
Time Warner and ABC had grown more strained following Time Warner's
announcement that it intended to merge with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after approving the merger of Viacom and CBS, the FCC
ruled that Time Warner had violated a regulation that prohibits a
company from removing a network's signal during the sweeps rating
month and said it would consider what penalty to impose. The fine
will be symbolic, as the agency can only penalize the company
$7,500 for each violation each day.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say the larger lesson from this week's
events is that further consolidation of the cable and broadcast
industries will lead to similar disputes and blackouts, as the
survivors struggle to control both the content and distribution of
what appears on television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of dominant players in telecommunications and
other industries dwindle, some regulators are also beginning to
question how much further the government should go in approving
large pending deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite often the best consumer competition comes from big
companies fiercely competing against each other,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ``But in some
sectors of the economy, we are running out of big companies.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky declined to discuss his agency's review of the proposed
merger of America Online with Time Warner. But other government
officials said Wednesday that Time Warner's decision to remove ABC
this week from its cable systems had undermined the companies'
repeated pronouncements when the merger was announced that they
would never attempt to shut out others from using their enormous
Internet and cable backbone.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In approving Viacom's acquisition of CBS, the regulators gave
the companies a year to come into compliance with a rule that
prohibits a television network from having an ownership interest in
a second network. Viacom holds an interest in the fledgling UPN,
and some experts predict that the agency may relax the dual network
rule over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom will also have a year to meet the national television
ownership cap, which prohibits a company from controlling more than
35 percent of the broadcast market. The combined reach of CBS and
Viacom is now more than 41 percent. As part of the regulatory
order, the companies will have six months to sell some radio and
television stations in the Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore,
Sacramento and Dallas-Fort Worth areas.
</P>
<P>
   But those divestitures are relatively small pieces of the deal,
which involves the transfer of 38 television stations and more than
160 radio stations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, regulators during the Clinton years have
signed off on big mergers, many of which would have been
unimaginable a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In merger law, the Clinton administration has a great deal in
common with the Reagan and Bush years,'' said John Shepard Wiley
Jr., a law professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``The analysis has become bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in the 1960s, the Justice Department successfully
blocked one deal that would have resulted in a grocery store merger
that would have resulted in a company controlling 7.5 percent of
the industry.

UNORTHODOX MOVE BY DRYSDALE PUTS FAVORITE OUTSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ An unorthodox choice by trainer Neil Drysdale
means Kentucky Derby favorite Fusaichi Pegasus will break from post
position 16 in Saturday's 20-horse race.
</P>
<P>
   A blind draw gave Fusaichi Pegasus' braintrust the 12th pick in
the ``draft'' Churchill Downs has instituted in recent years to
make the post-selection process more telegenic. When it came time
to decide, posts 1, 2, 11, 12 and 16-20 were available. Most
horsemen would have gone with 11 or 12 _ neither far inside, at the
risk of being boxed in, nor far outside, in danger of losing
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale hung the placard in Fusaichi Pegasus' owner's colors on
No.16.
</P>
<P>
   Derby horses enter the gate two at a time _ post 1 and 11, then
2 and 12, and so on. Drysdale said he hoped to avoid having
Fusaichi Pegasus wait for too many horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out in the clear and hopefully can stay out of trouble,''
explained Drysdale, the newly elected Racing Hall of Famer known
for offbeat approaches. ``He's a good gate horse, but I didn't want
him to be standing in the gate for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision allowed Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy's
connections, choosing 15th, to slip into a comfortable post 11.
They considered that a lucky break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he (Drysdale) is telling us is that he's concerned about
it (Fusaichi Pegasus' behavior), even though he's said all week he
isn't,'' said Jeff Siegel, the Southern California handicapper who
is a part-owner of The Deputy. ``One reason we chose the 11 hole is
that we didn't want to be next to his antics.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill morning-line maker Mike Battaglia pegged Fusaichi
Pegasus as a 9-5 favorite, with The Deputy next at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   As offbeat as Drysdale's selection was, post 16 has produced
winners Thunder Gulch (1995) and Charismatic (1999). Three of the
past five Derby winners came from the auxiliary starting gate _
posts 15 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve landed the first pick in a blind draw and trainer
Bob Baffert chose post 8. War Chant, Drysdale's other Derby horse,
went second, and jockey Jerry Bailey chose post 9.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Grass Stakes winner High Yield (post 18) will start

AN OYSTER BAR THAT GOES BACK 125,000 YEARS 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) A team of scientists has discovered the earliest
example of an oyster bar: a fossil reef on Africa's Red Coast where
early man dined on clams, crabs, oysters and scallops.
</P>
<P>
   The unearthing of small stone blades and hand-sized stones with
sharpened edges pushes back to roughly 125,000 years ago the first
documentation of ancestral humans adapting to a marine environment
and a new food source. The earliest example of shellfish
consumption had been thought to be 10,000 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important discovery because it is the oldest
documentation in the world of marine resources and a major new
adaptive strategy,'' said Richard T. Buffler, a University of Texas
professor of geological sciences and senior research scientist at
the UT Institute for Geophysics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also points up the importance of coastal environments as
previously overlooked study sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, reported in this week's journal Nature, suggests
that early humans were essentially forced out of their native
habitat in the interior of Africa because a change in climate dried
up the lakes and rivers they relied on for food, said Buffler.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that man may have eventually left Africa along
the Red Sea rather than going up the Nile River valley, as is
traditionally assumed.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it supports the ``out of Africa'' theory _ the view
accepted by most scientists _ that humans evolved from a common
ancestor in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. A competing theory
is that modern humans evolved semi-independently in Africa, Europe
and Asia 100,000 to 40,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The once-submerged barrier reef in which the tools were
embedded, about seven miles long and 15 to 40 feet above current
sea level, was located near the village of Abdur, Eritrea, on the
Gulf of Zula in northeast Africa. The team found evidence of the
tools during an unrelated 1997 African trip, then came back two
years later to do the research.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found fossils of large land mammals such as
elephants, rhinos and hippos. The ancient humans may have trapped
the animals against the sea and butchered them there, the
scientists speculated.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists found no evidence of who made the tools likely
used to remove shellfish from boulders and to crack or pry open
shells.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the stone tools was estimated by radioactive dating
of fossil corals found closest to them. Though some isolated
specimens of hand axes have been found on other marine terraces in
Eritrea and the Egyptian coast, none had been found embedded in
rock, allowing it to be dated.
</P>
<P>
   Buffler said the team is soliciting funds for a hoped-for
research trip back to the site next winter. Such a team would
include archaeologists and paleontologists as well as geologists.
</P>
<P>
   Berhane Negassi Ghebretensae, a University of Texas graduate
student from Eritrea, also participated in the project.

SAMMY GLICK'S LONG RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Budd Schulberg dreamed up Sammy Glick _ the
ultimate Hollywood wheeler-dealer, ``a little ferret of a kid,
sharp and quick'' _ back in the 1930s, he meant his novel, ``What
Makes Sammy Run?,'' to be seen in part as a cautionary tale. Back
then, Sammy Glick was the villain of the piece, the awful example
of what might happen if you let individualism and free enterprise
run away with you. Yes, Sammy was a product of his environment
(``in the midst of a war that was selfish, ruthless and cruel,
Sammy was proving himself the fittest, the fiercest and the
fastest'') and perhaps readers did pity him, a bit. But they
definitely did not want to be him.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the 1970s did Schulberg notice the beginnings of a
``180-degree turn in our national attitude toward Sammy.'' By 1989,
when he wrote an afterword to a new paperback edition of the novel,
the author noted that Sammy's rap was being heard much differently
by the young faces he saw in the college classes he addressed.
``The book I had written as an angry expose of Sammy Glick was
becoming a character reference,'' Schulberg wrote. He remembered
one student telling him how much he admired Sammy Glick's ruthless
rise to the top. ``He put out his hand, the hand that would soon be
knifing friends and colleagues in the back,'' Schulberg wrote. ``As
I took it hesitantly, I asked myself, What have I done?''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Schulberg said, the 11 years between writing that
afterword and today have been even more disheartening. Back then,
the young Sammy Glicks he encountered would acknowledge that, yes,
of course, they understood the irony of admiring a character as
despicable as Sammy. ``But today, I don't think they'd even be
aware of it,'' Schulberg said in a recent interview. ``This new
generation has absolutely no consideration of such matters. It's
another world. They appear to feel that any kind of moral brakes on
what you do seem old-fashioned or out of date or even nonexistent.
I don't think they even think about it. I don't think they even
worry about it. I think, in a sense, they see themselves as super
Sammys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Glick is merely the most vivid and persistent example of
what has become over the last 75 years one of the stock characters
in American popular culture _ the Hollywood wheeler-dealer. The
history of this character extends back to the earliest days of the
movie business right through Sammy and up to the current, digital
era. Though not as ubiquitous as such other stock types as the
rugged loner, the wacky dame or the wronged man seeking vengeance,
like them, this feral Hollywood character keeps popping up through
the decades, wearing different hats to reflect different moral
attitudes but always recognizably the same: ruthless, power-hungry,
egomaniacal and hedonistic.
</P>
<P>
   But while America's attitude toward its other stock types has
remained fairly consistent, its relationship to this Hollywood
figure has gone through a transformation over the years, telling us
something not only about America's moral fluctuation but also about
the way Hollywood views itself. It can hardly be coincidence that
the Hollywood wheeler-dealer has become, in many versions, almost
endearingly amoral at just the moment when Hollywood itself has
become more corporate-minded than at any time in its history. To
corporate nine-to-fivers in their fluorescent cubicles who came
West with dreams of wild parties and wide-open-town millions, this
figure takes on a romantic tinge _ Sammy Glick, cunning operator,
betrayer extraordinaire, the quickest rat in the maze. If only!
</P>
<P>
   ``The dramatic transformation of Sammy Glick from the anti-hero
of the '40s to the role-model hero for the yuppies of the '80s is a
painful reminder of the moral breakdown we are suffering, without
even seeming to realize that suffering is involved,'' Schulberg
wrote in his 1989 afterword.

 UNDATED: 1989 afterword.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The myth did not begin with Sammy Glick, of course. In the
beginning, the public image of the movie mogul was that of a recent
immigrant, probably Jewish, with the scent of the Lower East Side
clinging to him and a background in the garment industry and the
burgeoning world of the nickelodeons. As Robert Sklar, author of
``Movie-Made America,'' describes it, many ``regarded the rise of
the storefront-theater managers to fabulous wealth and power with a
mixture of awe and amusement.'' Their contempt was revealed in the
name they created to describe the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The term `movie mogul' came into use around 1915, nicely
describing the immigrant producers in the eyes of the public _ part
splendid emperors, part barbarian invaders,'' Sklar wrote. ``Their
foreignness, their alleged ignorance, were the subjects of a
thousand jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the silent era, the older generation was drifting
away and a younger breed of moguls _ slicker, more assimilated _
was taking their place. It was in this context that the archetype
of the Hollywood wheeler-dealer was born.
</P>
<P>
   Initially a tragic figure (Monroe Stahr in F. Scott Fitzgerald's
``The Last Tycoon''), he became almost a benevolent despot (the
carping studio chiefs in ``Sullivan's Travels,'' Adolphe Menjou in
``A Star in Born'') before mutating into the villainous Sammy Glick
and then into scoundrels of a marginally more sympathetic stripe,
whose duplicity was mitigated by their passion for moviemaking
(Kirk Douglas in the 1952 movie ``The Bad and the Beautiful'').
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his editor at Collier's magazine in 1939,
Fitzgerald described why he created Monroe Stahr, a fictional
version of Irving Thalberg, the legendary MGM producer of the late
'20s and early '30s. ``Thalberg has always fascinated me,''
Fitzgerald wrote. ``His peculiar charm, his extraordinary good
looks, his bountiful success, the tragic end of his great
adventure. I have chosen him for my hero (this has been in my mind
for three years) because he is one of the half-dozen men I have
known who were built on the grand scale.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Monroe Stahr's aspirations _ to greatness, to power, to
artistic purity _ that made his fall so tragic. But of those three
aspirations, the only one that could be applied to Sammy Glick was
an aspiration, indeed a lust, for power. What the two men have in
common, though, is a complete lack of the kind of credentials that
might be required to achieve success in mainstream society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though Stahr's education was founded on nothing more than a
night school course in stenography, he had a long time ago run
ahead through trackless wastes of perception into fields where very
few men were able to follow him,'' Fitzgerald wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Glick's education was founded on even less than this; his
gift was for bluff and betrayal. He fashioned himself a
screenwriter but could hardly write his name. He stole other
people's ideas, without a backward glance.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s and 1980s, he had evolved into a more satiric, even
absurd figure (Ron Silver in the 1982 movie ``Best Friends,''
wearing a mask of laid-backness to smooth out his essential
monomania; Michael Lerner in the Coen Brothers' 1991 film ``Barton
Fink,'' Steve Martin as the ersatz Joel Silver action-flick
producer in Lawrence Kasdan's 1991 movie ``Grand Canyon'').
</P>
<P>
   Only in the 1990s did he reach his full flowering as a kind of
paranoid sadist, albeit an attractive one (Tim Robbins in the 1992
movie ``The Player,'' Kevin Spacey in the 1994 film ``Swimming With
Sharks'').
</P>
<P>
   When Fox's short-lived television series ``Action!,'' bombed out
last year, its self-consciously profane and gleefully malevolent
portrait of the Hollywood producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) was
deemed too insider and too nasty for mass tastes. In a review of
the series in The New York Times, Caryn James described Mohr's
character as ``a producer who understands that his grand success
exists in direct proportion to his ruthlessness. He seems to come
by his savage attitude naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Hollywood wheeler-dealer archetype had finally gone
too far? Don't bet on it. He's still out there, hiding in the
bushes, just as savage and seductive as always.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new Internet sites dedicated to games and streaming
video for the 12-to-24-year-old set, www.thethreshhold.com, has a
regular animated series called ``The Producer'' that puts a kind of
sophomoric, ``South Park'' spin on the Hollywood sub-genre. It's
antihero is Lester Spaxman, president of the fictional Spaxmedia.
``So driven by his vision and passion to make spectacular films,
Lester is constantly blind to those he plows over on his path to
success,'' says the on-line character description. ``Lester lives
according to a twisted set of morals, specifically tailored for
survival in Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   A computer game called ``Hollywood Mogul'' promises players a
chance to ``go inside the dream factory and run your own movie
studio.'' You become studio head, are responsible for the release
of 100 feature films. If you win, you get immense wealth and an
Academy Award. ``All you need to immerse yourself in the simulated
world of Hollywood Mogul is a love for movies,'' says promotional
materials for the game. ``Of course, it doesn't hurt if you're
capable of being completely power-hungry and ruthless as you wield
an obscene amount of power over other people's lives (which is
always fun).''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood wheeler-dealer has also played another cultural
role: capitalism's nadir, the example of what can happen when
ruthlessness and self-interest are carried too far. Two recent
biographies of modern-day moguls (``The Operator: David Geffen
Builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood'' by Tom King and ``The
Keys to the Kingdom: How Michael Eisner Lost His Grip'' by Kim
Masters) are finger-wagging examples. Tsk, tsk, those awful moguls.
They lie! They cheat! They think only of themselves! But they hang
out with really cool famous people.
</P>
<P>
   When the director Bruce Beresford (the 1989 movie ``Driving
Daisy,'' among many others) decided to stage a version of
``Rigoletto'' for the Los Angeles Opera this season, he and his
creative crew began noodling around ideas for something that
wouldn't be just another version of Verdi's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that there was nothing quite so much like a ducal
court in medieval Italy as the world of a major Hollywood mogul,''
Beresford said.
</P>
<P>
   In the production that was presented last month at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, the Duke of Mantua became Duke Mantua, a
Hollywood big shot with a sprawling estate in Bel-Air. Rigoletto
was transformed from a conniving fool into a conniving agent. And
the members of the ducal court were yes-men and hangers-on for the
hedonistic, self-absorbed Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really eerie, it fit so perfectly,'' Beresford said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hollywood really more ruthless and predatory than any other
lucrative business? No, although it likes to think that it is.
``Hollywood is a jungle and the smaller animals have to run for
their lives,'' Schulberg wrote in 1941. Many of the hustlers trying
to break into the movie game would puff with pride at such a
description of the world in which they live. After all, if I'm
surviving, I must be a big animal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hollywood has become a more comfortable nest for this
American archetype because of the history and composition of the
place, its mixture of glamour and otherness. It reflects America,
but it's not really a part of it. Hollywood is seen as a place that
rewards ruthlessness and betrayal, where glib patter goes farther
than solid credentials.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine simply walking into a Wall Street
investment bank or a Seattle high-tech company without any training
or track record and somehow weaseling your way to the top. But any
slob can do it in Hollywood, or so the myth goes. It's an illusion
that still draws them to Southern California by the Titanic-load.
</P>
<P>
   Nebbishes from any walk of life _ convinced that, given half a
chance, they could act or write or hustle as competently as anyone
_ are free to fantasize about playing out their own Sammy Glick
melodrama. All they have to do is brush up on the local lingo, buy
a lot of black clothes and jettison their moral compass, just for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message of Hollywood wheeler-dealer stereotype. The
only difference between mogul and you is that they are willing to
do what it takes. That's why they're in the back of the limousine
with their cleavage pets and you're stuck in tunnel traffic.

<P>
   In some eyes, it's the ultimate capitalist fantasy. No rules,
not even basic decency, except as a ruse. It's capitalism turned
topsy-turvy, wrenched of any boundaries, regulatory or moral, like
some Southern California version of Moscow after the collapse of
the Soviet Union. And even those who don't embrace the macho code
of get-'em-before-they-get-you, who despise people like that, can
still indulge in the fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   NBC broadcast a two-part adaptation of ``What Makes Sammy Run?''
back in 1960. Not long after, Steve Lawrence starred in a Broadway
musical version. But thus far, there has never been a movie
adaptation of the book that, to most people, speaks most directly
to the heart of this mythical Hollywood of back-stabbing hustlers
and unalloyed selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been on the front burner and the back burner many times
over the years,'' Schulberg said. ``At the moment, it's somewhere
in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, which currently controls the rights to the
novel, is in talks with someone _ Schulberg said he can't say who
it is _ to finally make a Sammy Glick movie. ``They're trying to
make a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, however, it is only by happenstance that this
wheeler-dealer figure has come to be associated with Hollywood.
Schulberg, who was the son of a prominent Hollywood producer and
grew up in that world, said he never intended to suggest that the
rules in Hollywood were any different than those on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it's been unfair to Hollywood,'' Schulberg said. ``I
never meant to suggest that it was a purely Hollywood syndrome.
Sammy Glicks can and do operate in the stock market, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Why then, do we persist in having this Hollywood type emerge,
again and again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Hollywood has always been kind of a magnet in terms
of being sexier and in the public eye,'' he said. ``It's always
easier to hang this type of attitude on a Hollywood wheeler-dealer
than on some wheeler-dealer who is just wheeling and dealing in
some more ordinary job. Here, he's with the stars. It's just
sexier.''
</P>
<P>
   The strange irony, though, is that just as the Hollywood
wheeler-dealer archetype has mutated into this dark hero of
hedonistic free-enterprise, the real-life Hollywood executives are
moving inexorably toward buttoned-down corporate America _ not that
refined boardrooms don't have their own forms of cold-blooded
ruthlessness, where proper pedigree is less important than raw
business talent. Sammy Glicks still exist in Hollywood. But as the
movie studios are being swallowed by larger corporate entities,
becoming little more than departments within divisions of
mega-media empires, the real executives tend more toward business
school models than Sammy's school of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   This shift may account for part of the durability of the
stereotype _ to many who came to Los Angeles hoping for the
free-wheeling capitalism of the Glick myth only to find a corporate
world of marketing meetings and company canteens, the Hollywood
wheeler-dealer becomes a kind of romantic figure, a gleefully dark
self-image, embraced all the more fervently. Undoubtedly, that is
one reason that the archetype is kept alive in movies and
television series and related entertainment vehicles. It's the Hyde
that so many Jekylls search for in their midnight dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I suppose that Hollywood is becoming more corporate, I am
sure it is,'' Beresford said. ``But there are still a lot of Sammy
Glicks out there. You know there are. I meet them every day.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lymphoma rolls benignly off the tongue. Lymphoma
doesn't sound like a death sentence when you say it.
</P>
<P>
   So that's how Andres Galarraga referred to his illness.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't cancer that chased him out of baseball in 1999, it
wasn't cancer that left him too weak to stand, it wasn't cancer
that made him ache for the days when the scariest thing he faced
was another man's 97 mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   It was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, not cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Semantics became Galarraga's survival mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my doctors said to me, `You have cancer,' I told my
family `I have lymphoma,''' the Atlanta Braves first baseman said.
``The word `cancer' was too scary. So I never used it. Always it
was lymphoma. That didn't sound like such a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a harrowing thing to be 37 years old and have a
wife, three daughters and a kind of cancer in his lower back that
the American Cancer Society estimates will kill roughly 26,000
people in this country this year.
</P>
<P>
   After being diagnosed with the disease in February of 1999,
Galarraga spent six months undergoing cyclic chemotherapy and
radiation treatments and another six months retrieving all the
strength that the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had fleeced.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Galarraga, long known as The Cat, feels more like
The Cat Burglar stealing a second, sumptuous life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a second opportunity,'' Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Most players Galarraga's age are out of baseball, victims of
nothing more traumatic than the natural aging process. That the
6-foot-3 infielder turned back Father Time and mutant cell growth
on his spine, too, is the nearest thing to a miracle that has been
spotted in Georgia since the Virgin Mary sightings in Conyers the
13th of every month ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who averaged 41 home runs and 129 RBI in the four
seasons prior to being sidelined by cancer, hit a National
league-leading 10 home runs in April. He entered the Braves' game
Wednesday against the Dodgers batting .291 with 24 RBI in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's comeback has been the perfect antidote for teammate
John Rocker's coarseness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Venezuela native is a color print to Rocker's
negative. Rocker you're bound to remember because of his mouth;
Galarraga because of his heart. For sure, it's a few sizes too
large for his Braves jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there's a cerebral _ as opposed to celestial _
explanation for Galarraga's amazing start, Atlanta Braves manager
Bobby Cox tapped his chest and said, ``It's all right here.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand: Galarraga was a decorated warrior before he waged
the fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer didn't change him. It had more of an effect on his
teammates, who no longer take Galarraga's swing or the smile he
wears like a tattoo for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see him smiling day in and day out tells the whole
story,'' said Braves outfielder Brian Jordan. ``He has a great
personality and it rubs off on people in this room. Having him
back, it's like an angel's around.''
</P>
<P>
   The first few days of spring training, Galarraga said, his
teammates treated him as though he were as delicate as an angel's
wings. The way they tiptoed around him you would have thought they
were afraid of disturbing the Fates, lest they reconsider their
handling of Galarraga's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was watching him carefully and trying to
walk softly around him,'' Jordan said, ``because nobody really knew
what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one day, Galarraga told his teammates, ``Look. Just
treat me like a normal player, not a little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, they did. Galarraga made it a lot easier, of course,
batting .381 for the spring, spraying to all fields everybody's
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   His own fears were long gone by then. At first, when he had to
go in for his routine three-month checkups, Galarraga admitted, ``I
felt a little nervous. I'd be waiting to hear something positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he just trusts the news is good. His faith helped Galarraga
get his groove back. So did his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous anymore. I'm not afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga then lowered his voice as though he were going to
reveal a secret. But what he said was written all over his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying life and the game more,'' he said. ``Mentally I
feel stronger than ever. In all ways I just feel better than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The cancer has evacuated his body. The last CT scan Galarraga
took, three weeks ago, showed no traces of it. That's not to say
the cancer didn't leave behind a few reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga can't bear to smell his wife Eneyda's perfume because
it triggers memories of his chemotherapy and radiation sessions and
makes him nauseated all over again.
</P>
<P>
   For much the same reason, the area around Galarraga's locker
cubicle is a cologne-free zone. And the player hopes never again to
wake up and smell the coffee; that aroma is slightly sickening to
him now.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer treatments also left Galarraga hypersensitive to loud
noises. But it was worth any headache to hear Turner Field erupt
for him on Opening Day when he made a sparkling defensive play,
then hit the home run that delivered the victory to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game was unbelievable,'' Galarraga said. ``It was
like a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   On it goes, a season that could be mistaken for a Frank Capra
script. Everywhere he goes, including Monday in his first at-bat at
Dodger Stadium, Galarraga gets ovations ``that make you feel like
something special.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head as he said that, his body language clearly
communicating his bafflement.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Galarraga hasn't been paying attention to his
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flat-out amazing the way he's performing,'' said Braves
pitcher Terry Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you forget all about Rocker, and for that,
all of baseball ought to join in the chorus. &QL;

`THE ORESTEIA,' BEARER OF MANY AGENDAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By CELIA WREN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murder. Adultery. Courtroom drama. A fugitive's hair-raising
flight from implacable justice.
</P>
<P>
   With super-heated elements like these to work with, it is no
wonder that modern playwrights keep rewriting ``The Oresteia,'' the
fifth-century B.C. dramatic trilogy by Aeschylus about a family
ensnared in guilt and violence. T.S. Eliot did it in his 1930s
verse play ``The Family Reunion,'' which the Royal Shakespeare
Company begins performing on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music. Eugene O'Neill did it in his brooding ``Mourning Becomes
Electra.'' David Rabe did it in his Vietnam drama, ``The Orphan.''
And in the first months of 2000, a crop of contemporary theater
folk have been essaying the same task, spinning off audacious
adaptations that link Aeschylus to the sociopolitical anxieties of
the age.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, left-wing-elite-bashing _
all of these agendas, it turns out, can fit comfortably into the
three plays that make up ``The Oresteia'': ``Agamemnon,'' ``The
Libation Bearers'' and ``The Eumenides.'' The trilogy can even make
pointed comments about geopolitics, or channel a wacky gay sendup
like Aaron Mack Schloff's ``Agamemnon vs. Liberace.'' It can refer
to world history or theater history. And, like a fine whiskey, it
still appeals to connoisseurs in its original, undiluted form.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Greek classics are always in style and always
relevant. But ``The Oresteia'' occupies a privileged position in
the Western canon, in part because it is the only surviving example
of an ancient Greek tragic trilogy. Factor in the work's profound
themes _ guilt, the legacy of violence, the role of law, the burden
of individual conscience _ and it is easy to understand why the
three plays are considered by many to be at the summit of dramatic
literature in the West. And like most classics, of course, the
themes lend themselves to productions that take the material in
diverse directions, as can be seen already this year.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Clarence Brown Theater Company in Knoxville,
Tenn., mounted ``The Millennium Project,'' a group-developed
variation on ``The Oresteia'' that will travel to a festival in
Bratislava, Slovakia, in June.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Sledgehammer Theater in San Diego presented a
premiere of Kelly Stuart's ``Furious Blood,'' a savage comedy that
tackled the ancient text from a feminist standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agamemnon vs. Liberace'' was presented at the Here Arts Center
in New York in March, the same month that Mark Jackson's
class-conscious ``Messenger No. 1'' made its debut in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other companies have been hewing more closely
to Aeschylus' original, which was itself a treatment of
pre-existing material: the dark, mythological stories that, by
Aeschylus' day, had already figured in the works of Homer and the
sixth-century B.C. poet Stesichorus.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a production of ``The Oresteia'' by the Royal National
Theater of London, using a translation by Ted Hughes, Britain's
late poet laureate, visited the Du Maurier World Stage festival in
Toronto. In New York, the Pearl Theater Company is preenting a new
translation by the classics scholar Peter Meineck in a production
that opened last month and runs through May 28.
</P>
<P>
   These artists are riding a wave of interest, across the theater
world, in staging Greek classics. It is a development that has been
particularly visible in high-profile revivals like last year's
``Electra'' on Broadway. This popularity has been attributed by
critics to a variety of factors, including the plays' openness to
nontraditional casting, the major roles they offer to actresses,
and the appeal of stark themes at a time of end-of-the-millennium
angst.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary fears may find deep echoes in ``The Oresteia''
because it is, arguably, about civilization itself. During
Aeschylus' lifetime, Athenians instituted an early form of
democracy and reformed their courts, a campaign of liberalization
that the playwright alluded to in ``The Eumenides.'' The trilogy
tells the story of the House of Atreus, a dysfunctional family with
a nasty episode of cannibalism in its closet. At the start of ``The
Oresteia,'' Queen Clytemnestra of Argos murders her husband,
retaliating against his callous sacrifice of their daughter
Iphigenia at the beginning of the Trojan war. Her son, Orestes,
subsequently kills his mother with the encouragement of his
fanatical sister Electra, only to find himself pursued by a set of
creepy avenging goddesses known as the Furies. In ``The
Eumenides,'' the goddess Athena placates these minor deities and
clears Orestes' name, while more or less inventing trial by jury.
</P>
<P>
   So you can argue that the trilogy describes a movement away from
barbarism toward a more modern concept of civilization, lawyers and
all. ``People are into `The Oresteia' because it's about the
evolution into democracy of some pre-democratic phase of justice,''
said Dr. Helene Foley, a professor of Greek and Latin at Barnard
College.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the trilogy invites playwrights and directors to reflect
broadly on humanity's collective experience. The challenge is one
the American theater began to respond to in the 1960s, resulting in
seminal productions like the Guthrie Theater's ``House of Atreus''
(adapted by John Lewin), a Minneapolis production that visited New
York in 1968; Andre Serban's highly stylized ``Agamemnon'' at the
New York Shakespeare Festival in 1977; and Charles L. Mee Jr.'s
``Agamemnon'' (produced in 1994 by the Actors' Gang in Los
Angeles), which put chorus-like speeches into the mouths of writers
like Homer and Hesiod.

 UNDATED: Homer and Hesiod.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number of this season's adaptations have opted for the
sociopolitical approach. For example, in ``Messenger No. 1,'' which
he directed at the Exit Stage Left theater in San Francisco, Mark
Jackson deliberately upended the ostensibly optimistic
sociopolitical message of ``The Oresteia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trial-by-jury system of justice was designed to replace
blood-based justice,'' he said during a recent interview, ``why
hasn't violence decreased?'' Jackson, who believes that ``the
justice system is flawed and designed by the upper classes,'' used
his play to drive home his point. His comedy explores the
frustrations that beset Argos' working-class messengers, while
spoiled aristocrats like Orestes reap the benefits of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Other adaptors have focused on the battle of the sexes rather
than class conflict. Aeschylus' narrative represents a prime target
for feminists because it repeatedly pits men against women
(Agamemnon-Iphigenia; Clytemnestra-Agamemnon; Orestes-Clytemnestra;
the Furies-Orestes), and because the denouement of ``The
Eumenides'' seems to affirm male power at the expense of female
authority figures (the Furies). Emphasizing this archetypal rift,
some artists have turned ``The Oresteia'' into a biting critique of
the patriarchy _ as the renowned French troupe Theatre du Soleil
did in ``Les Atrides'' (which visited the Brooklyn Academy of Music
in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Les Atrides,'' Kelly Stuart's ``Furious Blood'' makes
feminist hay by incorporating scenes that depict the sacrifice of
Iphigenia _ episodes portrayed in Euripides' ``Iphigenia at Aulis''
but not in ``The Oresteia'' itself. The addition of this material
tends to make Clytemnestra a more sympathetic character. An
audience that watches Agamemnon condemn his teen-age daughter to
the knife for the sake of military expediency (to placate the gods
so that his army can sail for Troy), is more likely to understand
when his outraged wife hacks him to death.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, for her part, chose to retell the entire House of Atreus
story from Clytemnestra's point of view, turning the queen's
hostile daughter Electra, for example, into a shrill version of,
Stuart said, ``Dr. Laura, or one of those women who make a career
out of anti-feminism.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Furious Blood'' builds to its climax, its feminist message
becomes blunter. In the concluding scene, the frustrated Furies
hurl bloody tampons at Apollo, who finally appeals to the audience
for some anti-P.C. support. ``Tell me the truth, do you like hot
babes?'' he demands, comparing a glamorous Athena to the Furies.
``Or those ugly, bloodthirsty, oozing old bags?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millennium Project,'' developed cooperatively by master's
degree students at the University of Tennessee under the director
Henryk Baranowski, took a similarly feminist tack. According to Amy
Russell, who is credited on the final script as the adaptor, one
aim of the production was to deepen Clytemnestra's character and to
``correct'' the way Aeschylus ``demonized'' the feminine.
</P>
<P>
   But the project also included some specifically contemporary
twists. Orestes and Electra are rebellious adolescents who dress as
Goth music groupies, and the Furies threaten the earth with a
devastating plague that sounds a lot like acid rain. Russell said
that she and her collaborators were inspired to link ``The
Oresteia'' to ``science, technology, destruction of the
environment, the apocalyptic flavor of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the topicality of ``The Oresteia'' can be hazardous,
as the British director Katie Mitchell found when she directed Ted
Hughes' translation for the Royal National Theater. The production,
now on an international tour, uses modern dress and deliberate
anachronisms that seem to refer to the turmoil in the Balkans:
Agamemnon is dressed much like a Bosnian warlord, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Some reviewers found such touches gimmicky and distracting when
the production opened in December. But Mitchell defended her
intention: to orient the contemporary viewer. ``We decided we'd try
to find the simplest modern equivalent to every moment in the
play,'' she said, ``so that someone who knew nothing about Greek
drama or the story could understand at once what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   On some level, though, she does think that this ``Oresteia''
responds to current events, including developments in the former
Yugoslavia. ``A lot of us feel morally thrown,'' she said, ``and
don't know how to find our bearings morally and politically. To
some extent the production was working that through.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to the critics, she acknowledged that the staging was
too ambitious to be perfect, adding in her defense that the ``The
Oresteia'' is ``an extraordinary, impossible mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the same image Shepard Sobel used when he described the
Pearl Theater Company's longtime goal of staging ``The Oresteia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the 15 years that we've been doing theater, we've been
preparing ourselves,'' he said enthusiastically, ``knowing it was
the top of the mountain in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his decision to schedule the work for the spring
of 2000, Sobel thinks he was subconsciously responding to recent
world crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two or three years have seen what seems to be an
explosion of barbarian impulses,'' he said. ``Race wars and ethnic
wars, and the most horrid kind of violence _ neighbors against each
other in the Balkans, in the Bronx, all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   At times like these, Shepard said, staging ``The Oresteia'' _ in
which a cycle of violence is deliberately stopped _ is almost a
public service. ``I believe that if we could do `The Oresteia' well
enough, and get enough people to come see it, it would make a
difference to this horrid blood vengeance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meineck, the translator, agreed that ``The Oresteia'' resonates
with the zeitgeist. But he pointed primarily to a shared
cosmopolitan outlook as the bond between the present time and that
of Aeschylus. ``New York now is the Athens that was,'' said
Meineck, who is the producing artistic director of the Aquila
Theater Company. But in any case, he cautioned, Aeschylus'
masterpiece transcends topicality and scholarly footnotes _ it is
also a gripping horror story. Experiencing a production, he said,
is ``like watching `The Omen' films.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this season's prevalence of ``Oresteias'' a confluence of
ancient Greek omens or a theatrical response to global and social
rifts at the turn of the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   John Chioles, the author of ``Aeschylus: Mythic Theater,
Political Voice,'' a book about performing ``The Oresteia,'' goes
further: ``It might well be redundant to say that this work is
always timely. It is more than that. It may well be the history of
the race of humans.''

JABS FLY IN PRESIDENTIAL RING OVER SOCIAL SECURITY'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an sharp exchange that gave the presidential
campaign the intensity of a day in late October, Vice President Al
Gore accused Gov. George W. Bush on Wednesday of devising a
``secret plan'' that could bankrupt the Social Security system.
Hours later, Bush tartly questioned the vice president's honesty
and predicted that Gore's attacking style would soon backfire.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a theme he has repeated often in recent days, Gore used
a speech to union officials in New Jersey to assert that Bush, the
likely Republican nominee, was quietly developing a ``risky'' plan
to allow individual investment accounts in Social Security that
would jeopardize millions of taxpayers' savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does the Bush plan propose to deal with the bankruptcy of
Social Security that his privatization scheme would cause?'' Gore
told a gathering of AFL-CIO officials in Atlantic City, N.J. ``He
doesn't even bother to provide an answer. He just smiles and goes
on with the smug assumption that there's no need to share with you
the details of what he wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's cascade of attacks, Bush spent much of a
plane flight Wednesday afternoon from Austin, Texas, to Palm
Springs, Calif., telling reporters that the vice president had
flatly misrepresented his record on a host of issues ranging from
the Texas budget to his positions on China and Russia to his
crime-fighting policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone running for the highest office of the land should
stick to the facts,'' Bush said. ``I think it is a pattern to say
things, to stretch the truth. He's the man who said he invented the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Gore's aggressive campaigning might work as well
against him as it did against former Sen. Bill Bradley during the
Democratic primaries, Bush said he planned to respond faster and
more forcefully than Bradley did. ``It's not going to work here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, rather than being aggrieved by his opponent's attacks,
Bush seemed somewhat amused by the constant salvos from the vice
president, suggesting that Gore's strategy was self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, it's going to have a corrosive effect on his
campaign if he's not telling the truth,'' Bush said of Gore during
the 78-minute airborne news conference. ``The fact that he relies
on facts _ says things that are not factual _ are going to
undermine his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The more outrageous he gets, the more outrageous
allegations he makes against me, the more skeptical people will
become.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides disagree. Privately, they contend that the slashing
strategy they employed during the primaries will work again in the
general election, provided they avoid the appearance of attacking
Bush personally. They have done that, they argue, by focusing on
issues like Social Security, tax cuts, health care and gun-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primaries showed that voters believe that vigorously
debating your opponent on issues is considered fair play,'' said
one adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his Atlantic City speech to discuss his own
proposal for keeping the Social Security system solvent. Under that
plan, he would use the system's surplus to pay down the national
debt, which in turn would reduce the federal government's interest
payments. Those savings would then be put back into the Social
Security trust fund, keeping the system solvent for an additional
13 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will devote all interest from debt reduction to shore up
social security,'' Gore said. ``I think it is wrong to cut
benefits, raise the retirement age or risk your retirement savings
in a game of stock market roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   But that description amounted to one brief passage in a
35-minute speech that was devoted mainly to attacking Bush on a
variety of fronts, particularly Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal floated by Bush's aides in recent days,
taxpayers would be allowed to invest a small part of their Social
Security payroll taxes in the stocks or bond. Bush's aides argue
that such a plan would help taxpayers take advantage of the stock
market's historic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore asserted Wednesday that the plan would make the system
vulnerable to huge market fluctuations that could hurt millions of
retirees. And as he has repeatedly done in recent days, he
suggested that Bush was charting a course that was ``reckless'' and
``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Social Security is more than a government program,'' he
said. ``It is a solemn compact between the generations.'' Bush, he
added, ``Seems to believe differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore asserted that Bush had ``left the door wide open'' to
raising the retirement age for Social Security as a means of
bolstering the system. That approach, he argued, would be harmful
to people who do strenuous manual labor and physically cannot
postpone retirement. And he accused Bush of wanting to cut Social
Security spending to pay for a tax cut that Gore argues would favor
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the waitress who's carrying a heavy tray, what
about the longshoreman, what about the steel worker and the auto
workers?'' he asked. ``When they get to the current retirement age,
they don't want to be told that in order to finance some risky tax
scheme for the wealthy, they are going to have to keep on working
until they are 70 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides acknowledge that he has not ruled out raising the
retirement age. But they note that he has not formulated a detailed
plan yet, only the general principles for one. Those include not
increasing Social Security taxes, not cutting benefits and setting
aside the Social Security surplus in a ``lockbox'' to make sure it
is used only on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's lack of a detailed plan that caused Gore to accuse
the Texas governor of devising a ``secret plan'' Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to spring it on you after the election,'' Gore said.
``Well, I think he may be underestimating the capacity of the
American people to figure out for ourselves what the details of his
secret plan would mean for each and every American.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore's barbs were meant to rattle Bush, they failed.
Indeed, what was extraordinary about Wednesday's exchange was the
almost delighted mood that Bush brought to his end of it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on his way to California for several days of
campaigning, including a fund-raiser in Palm Springs on Wednesday
night for the Republican Party that was expected to bring in about
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight, Bush revealed a few more glimmers than usual of
his obvious distaste for what he seems to see as Gore's desperation
to be president. Usually, Bush does a more thorough job of pulling
his punches when he is asked what he thinks about Gore as a person.
</P>
<P>
   After a reporter told Bush that Gore, whose first grandchild was
born on the Fourth of July, sometimes says to Hispanic audiences
that he hopes his second grandchild will be born on Cinco de Mayo,
Bush muttered, ``Totally pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, talking about his own desire for the
presidency, Bush said: ``I'm willing to work for it. What I'm not
willing to do is sell my soul to become the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gore would do that, Bush arched an eyebrow and said,
``That's for you all to figure out.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bush did not used the word ``lied,'' and when reporters did, he
corrected them, coyly repeating again and again that he was simply
setting the record straight and expressing his ``disappointment''
in Gore's behavior. But he did use the words disappointment or
disappointed at least half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president said I've never submitted a budget as
governor of Texas'' said Bush, reciting the comments by Gore that
he deemed untruthful. ``He talked about recidivism rates that were
totally inaccurate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I called China and Russia enemies'' Bush added. ``Have
I ever referred to China and Russia as enemies?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shook his head and veered toward what he clearly intended
to be a kind of emotional and moral high ground. ``I just am
disappointed and I think Americans will be disappointed when they
find out the truth,'' he said.

   According to YankeeNets officials, Rowe would have been fired if
he had not resigned. Officials spent the last several days trying
to persuade Rowe to continue working with the organization in a new
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   With the firing of Coach Don Casey last week, General Manager
John Nash is the only remaining member of the Nets' basketball
operations triumvirate. The club's first priority is to hire a
director of basketball operations, who will then decide on Nash's
future and lead the search for a new head coach. The director may
also serve as the Nets' president if he has a strong background in
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank Michael Rowe for his dedication and loyalty to
the Nets organization,'' said Harvey Schiller, the chairman and
chief executive officer of YankeeNets. ``We are fortunate to be
able to harness Michael's experience with the Nets and his
expertise with arena management to help us with one of our most
important goals: to build a new arena for the Nets and Devils in
Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller will assist Lewis Katz, the chairman of the Nets'
operating board, in the search for new front-office personnel. In
the meantime, Finn Wentworth, the president of YankeeNets, has been
designated as the Nets' acting president.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking over the Nets' presidency, Rowe had distinguished
himself in arena management as an executive with the Meadowlands
Sports Complex. But while the Nets' enjoyed off-the-court successes
in the front office during his tenure as president, he struggled
with the basketball side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Ray Chambers two and a half years ago,'' Rowe
said, referring to the Nets' philanthropic and civic-minded owner,
``he told me one of the main reasons he was purchasing the team was
to build a new arena for the Nets in Newark. I am happy to join him
in making that dream come true.'' &QL;

BRINGING A HERO'S WELCOME TO ANY CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 7) 
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When in the course of human events, musicians feel impelled to
declare to the world and to themselves the highest ideals of which
the individual and humanity are capable, the composer to whom they
are most apt to turn is Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, at the ceremony at which Wagner laid the foundation stone
for his Festspielhaus at Bayreuth in 1872, what he presented was
not his own Music of the Future but Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In
1955, 10 years after suffering a direct hit in an Allied air raid,
the rebuilt Vienna State Opera opened with ``Fidelio.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vienna Philharmonic and the chorus of the Vienna Singverein
under the baton of Simon Rattle strike a self-consciously epochal
note with their live broadcast on Austrian radio of a concert from
the quarry in Mauthausen, the concentration camp where, by the tens
of thousands, victims of the Nazis were enslaved and worked to
death. The musicians are playing for Mauthausen survivors, their
families and the public: ``a declaration of humanity on a site of
horror,'' says Clemens Hellsberg, the orchestra's president; a
gesture of ``remembrance, repentance and homage,'' in Sir Simon's
words.
</P>
<P>
   They are playing the Ninth Symphony, perpetuating a pattern that
shows no sign of fading. When Kurt Masur and the New York
Philharmonic rang in the millennium last year, the choice of the
Ninth was not so much obvious as inevitable. It was equally so when
Leonard Bernstein celebrated the reunification of Germany at the
Berlin Wall in 1989. On that occasion, by Bernstein's wish, the
clarion call ``Freude'' (``joy'') in the choral finale was replaced
by ``Freiheit'' (``freedom''), perhaps a less daring liberty than
it seems. Bernstein dreamed of revisiting the score on Mount Scopus
once peace had come to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' ``liberte,
egalite, fraternite'': like many another artist, not to mention
ordinary citizens of every stripe, Beethoven felt the fire in the
ringing catchwords of revolution. But he alone, by virtually
universal consent, found the means to make music play out the
passions those revolutionary ideals enshrine. The Ninth Symphony's
``Ode to Joy,'' cresting in a vision of a universal brotherhood and
a benign father beyond the stars, is one cardinal example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fidelio'' is another, on many counts: for Leonore's courage in
her quest for Florestan, her husband, who languishes in the
clutches of a tyrant; for Florestan's moral majesty at the brink of
despair; for the heartbreaking nobility of the chorus of others
also unjustly imprisoned, breathing free in the sun for a stolen
hour.
</P>
<P>
   But Beethoven could make his music convey such ``stories'' of
struggle and triumph even in the absence of text or an overt
program, notably in his Symphony No. 3 (the ``Eroica,'' or
``Heroic''). Scott Burnham's book ``Beethoven Hero,'' published in
1995, examines in illuminating detail precisely this phenomenon and
its consequences for the reception of Beethoven's music.
</P>
<P>
   By Burnham's count, the ``heroic'' style dominates in only two
of the composer's nine symphonies, two of his 32 piano sonatas, one
of his five piano concertos and several of his overtures. Yet its
powerful halo effect has raised Beethoven's music _ indeed, his
very name _ to the level of symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes him the perfect figurehead for a series of six free
concerts by the Orion String Quartet, presented by the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center at Alice Tully Hall beginning on
May 12. Under the title Beethoven 2000, the series includes all 16
of the composer's string quartets. As Beethoven the keyboard
virtuoso often did at charity fund-raisers in Vienna, the players
are waiving their fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played all the quartets before but never as a cycle,''
said Steven Tenenbom, the Orion violist. ``We've been working
toward this all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Described by the society as a gift to New York, Beethoven 2000
honors six nonprofit organizations in the five boroughs that in
various ways devote their resources to engaging children with the
arts. At each concert, one honoree is showcased in a short film
clip or video and receives up to 200 tickets to use for
fund-raising, incentives or whatever purpose it thinks best. Funds
from grants by Credit Lyonnais and other sponsors will be
distributed to institutions as well, but recognition, not dollars,
is the heart of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome gesture, certainly, but where, exactly, is the
connection? ``Beethoven came first,'' said Timothy Eddy, the Orion
cellist. As quartet in residence with the Chamber Music Society, he
and his colleagues took their dream project to Jacqueline Taylor,
the society's executive director, and David Shifrin, the artistic
director, who at once began thinking of added dimensions that would
lift the cycle above obligatory chamber music routine.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the project, Taylor offered her own rationale:
``All around us great organizations are doing their part to give
meaningful opportunities to young people to experience life's
brighter side through the remarkable world of the arts in all of
its forms. Without their work, our work would not be possible, and
our city would not be the extraordinary place that it is. We wanted
to take the time to say `thank you' to a few of these special
organizations, invite them into our home and salute them for their
achievements in the best way we know how _ with music.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbom elaborated on the specific choice of composer:
``Beethoven reaches to express the struggle between man and the
universe, between man and his own soul. He's universal, and he's
visceral. That's a good choice for this kind of project. The
organizations we're celebrating are changing lives out there,
saving lives.''

MARTINEZ SUSPENDED FOR 5 GAMES FOR HIT BATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Rule sidebar)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez, who was dogged early in his
career with the reputation of being a headhunter, is appealing the
five-game suspension he was given by Major League Baseball
Wednesday for hitting Roberto Alomar of the Cleveland Indians with
a pitch during the eighth inning of Boston's 2-1 win Sunday over
the Indians in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy, who hit Jose Offerman of the Red
Sox with a pitch in the top of the eighth inning, was fined an
undisclosed amount but received no suspension from Frank Robinson,
the vice president of on-field operations for Major League
Baseball. Last week, in the aftermath of a brawl between the
Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox, Robinson handed out 16
suspensions, totaling 82 games, and nine fines
</P>
<P>
   With the appeal pending, Martinez will make his next scheduled
start, Saturday afternoon in Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. A likely scenario -- Jimy Williams' involuntary smile
seemed to confirm as much when asked about it -- is that Martinez
will drop his appeal after pitching Saturday, accept the
suspension, and pitch again May 12 in Baltimore. In essence, the
suspension would not cause him to miss a start, but push it back a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez would not comment on the suspension Wednesday. He spoke
briefly with Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette in the clubhouse
about two hours before the night's game, shortly before the
suspension was announced publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Pedro is doing the right thing, appealing the
suspension,'' Duquette said. ``We'll have to see how the appeal
comes out. We hope the length of suspension is diminished by going
through the appeal process.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Duquette, Martinez was suspended because he hit
Alomar after both managers and pitchers had been warned after Nagy
hit Offerman in the top of the eighth. But Duquette suggested that
the umpires should have ejected Nagy, rather than issuing a
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was doing his job,'' Duquette said. ``The team's
position on the issue is that the umpires must do a better job of
administering rule 8.02 (d) more effectively, by throwing out the
first pitcher who illegally hits an opposing batter, who in this
case was Charles Nagy . ... It's clear Nagy was throwing at
Offerman. Obviously, that's why Nagy was fined.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy hit Offerman leading off the eighth after an incident in
the previous inning, when Martinez knocked down Einar Diaz of the
Indians with a head-high fastball. The Indians maintain that
Martinez was deliberately throwing at Diaz because he already had
two doubles in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was clearly pitching inside to Einar Diaz,'' Duquette
said. ``He had pulled two balls into the left-field corner. so he
pitched inside with the purpose of getting him out. Their response
was to hit our player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpires must take control of the situation so that the
unwritten rule within baseball (of retaliating when a player is hit
by a pitch) isn't adhered to by players.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was on the West Coast and did not answer repeated
telephone calls. But Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett was critical
of the decision by the former Hall of Fame outfielder, who this
year was placed in charge of on-field disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to have their opinion on the way baseball
should be played,'' Everett said. ``To me, just let it be played.
The person who wrote this decision, he played in times where if you
hit a player, we're going to hit your player. Now he's making an
example just because of the stink that came out this year about the
inside part of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Nagy) hit (Offerman) on purpose, so Nagy has to get
suspended, too. So you know that's garbage. They're just trying to
make an example.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is the second of his career for Martinez, who was
given an eight-game suspension in 1996 by National League president
Leonard Coleman after charging the mound when Mike Williams of the
Philadelphia Phillies threw two pitches behind him. Williams, who
was suspended six games, said he was retaliating for Martinez
hitting Gregg Jefferies in the elbow in a pitch. Jefferies is in
Boston with the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Martinez's first year as a starting pitcher for the
Montreal Expos, he hit six batters in his first five starts. In his
23 starts that season, there were 12 ejections and three fights,
including the game in which he had a perfect game for 7 1/3 innings
in Cincinnati, then hit Reggie Sanders with a pitch, apparently
provoking Sanders to charge the mound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Martinez was warned three times by umpires, but there
has been no other disciplinary action against the Sox pitcher. Last
September, he was angrily attacked verbally by then-Baltimore
manager Ray Miller after he hit Brady Anderson of the Orioles with
a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Two Sox players, outfielder Darren Lewis and pitcher Rheal
Cormier, were suspended three games apiece after an April 23 brawl
in which benches cleared twice. Lewis charged Indians pitcher Jaret
Wright after being hit by a pitch, and Cormier hit Jim Thome of the
Indians with a pitch. Wright was suspended five games.
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Williams was measured in his reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what I say, I don't know if there's a right way
to do this,'' he said. ``There's always going to be a controversial
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be the last one, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Martinez's past reputation might have
factored into Robinson's decision, Williams said: ``I would like in
my mind not to think it comes into play, but I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams could not recall an occasion in which players were
suspended after batters were hit by pitches without a fight
ensuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this going to set a precedent, something like this, when
there's no fight?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(sidebar) &QL; 
THE RULE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rule 8.02 (d) _ Intentionally pitch at the batter:
</P>
<P>
   If, in the umpire's judgment, such a violation occurs, the
umpire may elect either to:
</P>
<P>
   1. Expel the pitcher, or the manager and the pitcher, from the
game, or
</P>
<P>
   2. May warn the pitcher and the manager of both teams that
another such pitch will result in the immediate expulsion of that
pitcher (or a replacement) and the manager.
</P>
<P>
   After the rule, there is this from the Case Book of the Official
Playing Rules Committee:
</P>
<P>
   To pitch at a batter's head is unsportsmanlike and highly
dangerous. It should be _ and is _ condemned by everybody. Umpires
should act without hesitation in enforcement of this rule.

THOMPSON FEELS NO PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Rangers pitcher Justin Thompson threw for
15 minutes in the bullpen before yesterday's game without any pain
in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson will throw lightly today and then have a full-speed
session in the bullpen tomorrow. That will determine if he's ready
to return to the minors on a medical rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went fine,'' Thompson said. ``I threw all my
pitches. I was a little tentative but ... it was a positive step. I
feel better than yesterday when I didn't know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has made three starts on rehab, but his progress came
to a halt Sunday when he felt pain in the shoulder throwing in the
bullpen. \Nsubheds:Helling delayed one day Rick Helling has been
pushed back one day in the rotation to allow a left-hander _
probably Doug Davis _ to start against the Oakland Athletics on
Sunday. Helling, who normally pitches on four days' rest, will
pitch Monday against the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to neutralize some of Oakland's hitters,''
manager Johnny Oates said. ``Seattle has a more balanced lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-handers Darren Oliver and Kenny Rogers are scheduled to
pitch the first two games of the series against the Athletics, who
have a lineup dominated by left-handed hitters. Davis or Matt
Perisho, who is also being considered for the start, would replace
Mark Clark in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the leading candidate because he has made four starts
at Triple-A Oklahoma.  &QL; 
Reviewing Helling
</P>
<P>
   A few statistics on Rick Helling after Tuesday's 8-1 victory
against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Helling has thrown 681 pitches in his six starts, an average of
113.5 per game. Both numbers, going into last night's games, are
the second-highest in the American League, behind Baltimore's Mike
Mussina, who has thrown 693 pitches in six starts. Kenny Rogers has
thrown 660 pitches, fifth-most in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Helling led the American League by allowing 41 home
runs. He has allowed just two in six starts this year, covering
381/3 innings. Only two pitchers _ Oakland's Omar Olivares and Gil
Heredia _ have allowed less per innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Helling has allowed a .234 slugging percentage, third-lowest in
the league, and a .299 on-base percentage, ninth-lowest in the
league.  &QL; 
Sele sighting
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are likely to face former teammate Aaron Sele on
Wednesday during their three-game series against the Seattle
Mariners. Sele is scheduled to pitch Friday for the Mariners, which
would put him in line to start on Wednesday against the Rangers.
Sele pitched the past two seasons for the Rangers before signing
with the Mariners in the off-season.  &QL; 
Rodriguez bashing
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez went into last night's game with 10 home
runs, tied for second in the American League. He said he doesn't
think the proliferation of home runs has anything to do with the
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters are getting stronger, bigger,'' Rodriguez said. ``I
think the ball is the same, you still need to hit it in the perfect
spot to make it go. The hitters are just working harder, more
weight and doing more exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez set a career-high with 35 home runs last year and
wants to go beyond that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always put it in my mind to have better numbers than the
year before,'' Rodriguez said.  &QL; 
Minor-league news
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed former major-league infielder Scott
Livingstone to a minor-league contract and assigned him to Triple-A
Oklahoma. He has a career major-league average of .281 in 673
games, mainly with the Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres. He has
played third base regularly in the major leagues and gives the
Rangers depth behind Mike Lamb and Tom Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa pitcher Joaquin Benoit, one of the Rangers' top
minor-league prospects, has been put on the disabled list because
of shoulder stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Sierra was 0-for-4 in his first game with the Oklahoma
RedHawks.

`CAPTAIN REWRITE' ON DRAGGING THE PAST INTO THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Guare's play ``Gardenia'' begins in 1875 with
Joshua Hickman sitting on the beach at Nantucket and reading from
Walt Whitman's poem ``On the Beach at Night Alone'': ``A vast
similitude interlocks all.''
</P>
<P>
   That quotation about the interconnectedness of humanity is the
central theme of the 1982 ``Gardenia'' and of the untitled cycle of
plays of which it is a part. Whitman's line, though unspoken, was
also at the heart of ``Six Degrees of Separation,'' Guare's 1990
play about the idea that ``everybody on this planet is separated by
only six other people.'' In the world of Guare, a vast similitude
interlocks all.
</P>
<P>
   After years of revising that earlier cycle, he has reordered it
into two plays under the collective title ``Lydie Breeze'' now in
previews, the production opens on May 15 at the New York Theater
Workshop. Tickets are being sold only to both plays, which can be
seen on consecutive nights or the same weekend day. They are titled
``Lydie Breeze, Part 1: Bulfinch's Mythology'' (formerly
``Gardenia'') and ``Lydie Breeze, Part 2: The Sacredness of the
Next Task.''
</P>
<P>
   The cycle, moving from the Civil War to the beginning of the
20th century, deals with American idealism and its decline through
history. ``It's about what happens to our dreams,'' Guare said
recently, ``what happens to the best part of ourselves and how we
manage to adapt to a world that's constantly changing.'' In the
plays, the characters are trying to invent a utopia in this case a
variation of Brook Farm.
</P>
<P>
   One common misconception about Guare is that plays like ``The
House of Blue Leaves'' and ``Bosoms and Neglect'' are
autobiographical but that ``Lydie Breeze'' is largely historical.
Yet all his plays are personal, deriving from his own life and that
of his family, both in the present and the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Guares immigrated to the United States from Ireland in the
1840s during the potato famine. On the maternal side of Guare's
family, the Gradys, also Irish, had come over earlier in the
century. His great-grandfather, who fought in the Civil War, was
named Joshua Hickman, and there are also Lydies and Breezes in his
genealogy. Since these relatives lived before his time, he has had
to reimagine them, while remaining as true as he can to the real
people behind the fictionalized characters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any chronicles of his family had been written, he
laughed and said: ``Written? They weren't even oral. Nobody spoke
to each other.'' From overheard conversations, memories and
intimations, he has created his own chronicle, sometimes merging
relatives. On one level, the plays deal with ``violence and
betrayal, things that happened in my family,'' he said. ``My
parents were very detached from their families and very pained by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he loved 19th-century novels, in particular those
by Balzac, George Eliot and Wilkie Collins, and his objective was
to write a dramatic equivalent, a richly textured narrative. That
approach, he said, ``made the family history accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, ``Lydie Breeze'' is an attempt ``to drag that past into
the present, and to make some sense of those dark parts of your
life that you're not responsible for _ the inflicted shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the revised cycle was supposed to be the cornerstone
of the Guare season at the Signature Theater, but when the
production proved to be too expensive, Guare rushed a new play,
``Lake Hollywood,'' into production in its stead. ``Lake
Hollywood'' has since been rewritten and was staged in February at
the Guthrie Theater Lab in Minneapolis. That play, too, had an
earlier existence, as a one-act play that Guare wrote 40 years ago
and expanded much later.
</P>
<P>
   After Elizabeth Marvel played Blanche in ``A Streetcar Named
Desire'' at the New York Theater Workshop last year, the artistic
director, James C. Nicola, invited her to look through manuscripts
and choose another project. She chose the ``Lydie Breeze'' plays
and, following a reading in January, Nicola decided to go ahead
with a production. Marvel portrays the title character. At the
playwright's request, the director is Itamar Kubovy, who staged
``Lake Hollywood'' at the Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   The major change, Guare said, was that, in contrast to the
original version, the plays are being performed in chronological
order with the same cast and at a single theater.
</P>
<P>
   His revisions include excerpted passages from ``Women and
Water,'' a third play in the cycle that was presented in 1985 at
the Arena Stage in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Guare is, he admitted, a compulsive rewriter. Thirty years ago,
when ``The House of Blue Leaves'' opened at the Truck and Warehouse
Theater (the predecessor of the New York Theater Workshop, on East
Fourth Street in the East Village), he was presented with a shirt
that read ``Captain Rewrite.'' When he is not redoing his own work,
he is sometimes called in to doctor musicals. This season, he did
some brushwork on the book for the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching a rehearsal of ``Lydie Breeze'' and hearing that line,
``a vast similitude interlocks all,'' he began thinking about its
application to his life and his work. ``We ricochet around,'' he
said, ``and we don't realize the connections until later.'' He
remembered that his father believed strongly in ``this connective
tissue.'' One day, his father ``broke all rules'' and passed on to
his son the secret Masonic handshake as if it were a legacy. In
times of urgency, he suggested, that secret could unlock doors.
</P>
<P>
   In Guare's family, his uncle Billy Grady occupied a lofty
position, though he was, by his nephew's estimation, ``a monstrous
man.'' For many years he was a casting director for MGM, credited
with discovering James Stewart and other stars and also for his
talent report on Fred Astaire (``balding, can't act, can't sing,
can dance a little''). Uncle Billy, who was the model for the
Hollywood director in ``The House of Blue Leaves,'' always held out
the illusion that he would discover some member of the Guare
family.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he was discovered, Guare said, ``I can tell you
exactly.'' After graduating from the Yale School of Drama, he was
offered a job as an intern at Universal Studios in Hollywood.
Pleased that his nephew had not come to him asking for work, Uncle
Billy offered him a better position as a trainee at MGM.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in California, Guare visited his Aunt Louise, a
member of the Guare side of the family, in San Francisco. He told
her he was planning to accept Uncle Billy's offer. She said:
``Didn't you want to be a playwright? Isn't that why you went to
Yale?'' He explained that he did, but that he was desperately in
need of money and after working for a time in Hollywood he would
return to New York to write plays. Aunt Louise said she had planned
to leave him something in her will: ``But I'll make a deal with
you. If you give up that job at MGM, and go back to New York and
become a playwright, I'll give you the money now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified,'' Guare said. ``She had taken away all my
excuses.'' Accepting the challenge, he returned to New York. His
first week, he walked down Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village and
noticed that the Caffe Cino was presenting the early work of
Lanford Wilson and other writers. He realized that ``something new
was happening in the theater.'' He lived off his aunt's beneficence
for three years, and was even able to finance a trip to Europe.
During this time he wrote several plays, including his
breakthrough, ``The House of Blue Leaves'' _ and he became a
playwright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who discovered me?'' he asked. ``It was my Aunt Louise.'' In
her honor, one of his two pet pugs is named Louise and the leading
character in ``Six Degrees'' is named Louisa.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to write many more plays, the musical ``Two Gentlemen
of Verona'' and several films, including ``Atlantic City.''

WORTHAM STILL WANTED EVEN WITH BOWDEN IN FOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys still want to sign former Tennessee
Titans starting middle linebacker and Fort Worth native Barron
Wortham, although it is being viewed as gravy with yesterday's
signing of Joe Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good shape without \Rsigning Wortham\S in terms of
competition at the linebacker position,'' Cowboys director of
player personnel Stephen Jones said. ``We want Wortham because of
what he brings to the table as far as having played with Joe
Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as just needing to go find another linebacker, we
don't need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will get plenty of help from Bowden, whose best friend in
the NFL is Wortham, in convincing the former Everman High School
star to sign with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was negotiating last night with Wortham's agent, Scott
Casterline, in hopes of getting a deal done as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I leave here, I'm going to call Barron and say, `Get in
here!' '' Bowden said. ``I left some money for him. Hey, I wouldn't
take food out of his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   If Wortham follows Bowden, he would become the third
Titan-turned-Cowboy this off-season. Tight end Jackie Harris is the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always wanting to improve our football team,'' Jones
said. ``But if things go the way they ought to go with our veteran
players, if we don't have any surprises injury-wise, then we're
starting to look like a team that is getting pretty set ... in the
sense of the 88 or so players we have to evaluate between now and
the end of training camp.''  &QL; 
Morgan adjusting
</P>
<P>
   The odds on Beau Morgan's making the Cowboys' 53-man roster are
long, especially after the Carrollton native was moved from
tailback to safety this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, it's really hard for anyone who has
been a running back to backpedal and turn. It's an unnatural
position,'' Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer said. ``But
Beau has really done well. I've been impressed.''  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Erik Williams underwent an elbow examination
yesterday by Dr. James Andrews. ``It may need surgery,'' owner
Jerry Jones said, ``but it shouldn't impact Erik for the year.''
Finding ``loose bodies'' in the elbow joint of a veteran NFL
offensive lineman is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Center Mark Stepnoski, who played four seasons (1995-98) in
Houston and Tennessee, was credited by Jerry Jones for giving the
Cowboys a ``really impressive'' character reference on Joe Bowden
in helping the team make its decision to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback James Brayboy, a rookie free agent from South
Carolina State, was waived yesterday to make room on the roster for
Bowden.

NEW YORK:``Atlantic City.''

<P>
   Along with revising ``Lydie Breeze,'' he has been working on the
book for a Broadway musical version of the movie ``Sweet Smell of
Success'' (with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Craig
Carnelia).
</P>
<P>
   His new play, ``Chaucer in Rome,'' is scheduled for Lincoln
Center Theater next season. It takes place at the American Academy
in Rome (which is headed by his wife, Adele Chatfield-Taylor). In
keeping with his favorite themes, the play is, he said, ``about an
artist who is no longer able to work in the way he wanted to
work.'' It was inspired by the story of the painter Chuck Close,
who was paralyzed by a stroke and had to ``reinvent himself and
created a new vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Guare is also involved in a new film project, based on the lives
of Sara and Gerald Murphy, the models for the characters in
``Tender Is the Night.'' Rereading the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel,
he said, he realized that it was ``about people who create an oasis
for other people to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, he makes voluminous notes in pocket-size notebooks _
106 so far _ about events in his life and ideas for plays. He works
every day, writing his plays in longhand and then transferring them
to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, in talking about his writing, Guare said:
``Everything deals with what you're afraid of: same old fears. They
find new names, new costumes.'' What was he afraid of today? He
paused and then, the perpetual Captain Rewrite, answered, ``Not
finishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Guare's plays, even those that deal with physical and
emotional mayhem, there is a current of affirmation. Now 62, he
continues to greet the day with anticipation rather than
apprehension. ``When I was a kid,'' he said, ``I had such enormous
dreams _ to be a writer, to marry someone wonderful, to live in New
York, to work in the theater _ and reality has outdone my dreams on
every level.'' He added, ``The theater's my utopia.'' And he hasn't
even had to use the secret handshake.

BOWDEN SIGNING SHORES UP COWBOYS' WEAK LINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Since the start of the off-season, the Cowboys have
made moves to upgrade areas of their team where they lost players
or anticipated losing players _ save for linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to Pro Bowl linebacker Dexter Coakley, it was
very evident at last weekend's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, Coakley and the Cowboys are singing a
different tune.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of former Tennessee Titans linebacker Joe Bowden to
a two-year deal yesterday immediately turned a weakness into a
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the weak link,'' Coakley said of the linebacking
corps, where the Cowboys are gambling that the undersized Dat
Nguyen can make up for the free-agent loss of Randall Godfrey
(Tennessee) in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were also void of experienced alternatives for
Nguyen or strong-side linebacker Darrin Hambrick, who won the job
by default last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely an upgrade,'' Coakley said. ``It puts us
right back to being one of the dominant groups in the defensive
scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not announced, but a source said the
eight-year veteran signed a contract that counts less than $700,000
against next year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys remain in negotiations with former Everman High
School star Barron Wortham, who also played linebacker for the
Titans last year, in an attempt to further bolster the position. A
deal could be done today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to have Joe Bowden join our team,'' Cowboys
owner Jerry Jones said. ``We are looking at anything we can to
improve at linebacker, and Joe Bowden makes us a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Wortham signs or not, the Cowboys are happy with what
Bowden does for their defense. The 5-foot-11, 235-pounder will
start out at strong-side linebacker, where he will compete with
Hambrick for the starting role.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bowden, who recorded 81 tackles in 16 starts at
strong-side linebacker during Tennessee's run to the Super Bowl
last season, can also play middle linebacker. Wortham is being
recruited to provide some insurance in case Nguyen doesn't pan out
in the middle. But Bowden is an option there as well.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the competition at training camp will be
intense.
</P>
<P>
   And while Nguyen and Hambrick said they understand the concept
of how quality competition makes the Cowboys a better football
team, they say they don't plan on losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition makes me a better player,'' Nguyen said. ``I've
had to prove myself all my life. It motivates me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick, who won the job last season because Quentin Coryatt
was sidelined by injuries, said he can't help but feel threatened
by Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have a good attitude about it,'' Hambrick said.
``I just want a chance to compete for my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones readily describes Bowden as a proven winner and an impact
player, and is equally excited about the type of leadership he will
bring to the defense. However, he says that the former Oklahoma
star wasn't promised a starting job and will have to compete with
Hambrick.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who starts, Jones is just pleased that the linebacker
depth will be better than it has been in several years.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden was initially leaning toward going back to Tennessee, but
became miffed when the Titans wouldn't give him a deal similar to
the five-year, $25 million contract they gave Godfrey. He also
turned down a one-year deal worth $1.3 million to stay in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesquite native said when he found out the Cowboys were
interested, he instructed his agent to get a deal done to bring him
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that I have been a playing all these years and never
had the opportunity to come home,'' Bowden said. ``I'm excited. I'm
happy to be here. My mother still lives in Mesquite, and I got
family all over Dallas. This is really home.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the additions of Joey Galloway at receiver, Ryan
McNeil at cornerback and Jackie Harris at tight end, the Cowboys
believe they've hit a home run at linebacker.

MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS REALLY NO MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Owen Nolan's mystery ailments have created
quite a stir regarding the NHL's lenient injury-disclosure policy.
Traditionally, there isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to protect your players,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   So, the San Jose Sharks can and did officially give Nolan
``flu-like symptoms'' when he missed Game 2. Even though everyone
knows, or thinks they know, that Nolan's sore left shoulder and/or
sore left foot kept him out.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton used the same ``flu-like symptoms'' line to keep Todd
Marchant's concussion under wraps as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   `` I guess you'd like us all to tell the truth,'' Hitchcock
said. ``I can tell you flu-like symptoms usually go back to
concussions, you learn that stuff. Upper body extremities usually
means one of the shoulders is usually done. Strep throat is usually
a groin pull or a hip flexor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although teams are technically not supposed to pass along
fraudulent information to the media, during the playoffs, no one
wants to reveal who's hurting where. But would professional hockey
players intentionally target an opposing player's injured body
part?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' Nolan said. ``If we knew someone had a bad
shoulder over there, they'd get hit every shift. You're not trying
to injure someone, but you want them to know they're going to get
hit, maybe they get rushed and make an error.''  &QL; 
Intact line
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan made a quick recovery in Game 3, scoring the
game-winning goal and playing 23 minutes, 11 seconds on 26 shifts,
including time on the power play and penalty kill.
</P>
<P>
   His return prompted Sharks coach Darryl Sutter to reunite the
team's most dangerous regular-season scoring line of winger Nolan,
winger Jeff Friesen and center Vincent Damphousse for the first
time in the playoffs. Damphousse set up Nolan's goal with a
terrific lead centering pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it worked,'' Friesen said. ``We had a lot of
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter had used big Dave Lowry against the Blues to battle
defensemen Chris Pronger and Al MacInnis, as well as in the first
two games against the Stars. But Sutter has changed his thinking to
speed over brawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the lines will stay like that,'' Nolan said.  &QL; 
Honorable Sharks
</P>
<P>
   Two Sharks were selected as finalists for the NHL's annual
awards. Defenseman Brad Stuart is a finalist, along with New
Jersey's Scott Gomez and New York Rangers' Michael York, for the
Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the league's top rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks center Mike Ricci is a finalist, along with Michal
Handzus of St. Louis and Detroit's Steve Yzerman, for the Frank J.
Selke Trophy, awarded to the most outstanding defensive forward.
Stars winger Jere Lehtinen won the award the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor,'' Ricci said, ``but I have other things to
worry about right now.''  &QL; 
Shark as seer
</P>
<P>
   A series prediction from Owen Nolan: ``It's going to be a
physical series, I think it's going to go six or seven games. The
team that wants it the most, works the hardest, is going to win
it.''  &QL; 
A better view
</P>
<P>
   Sharks coach Darryl Sutter finally got to see his team play with
a lead after going more than seven periods without scoring against
the Stars. He acknowledged the Stars are a different team when they
have to play from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we scored the two goals they were taking a few more
chances, probably getting some more shots, and conversely, with
those chances then maybe we got more odd-man situations than the
last two games total,'' he said.

UNILEVER SEEMS READY TO LIFT BESTFOODS BID

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Bestfoods rejected an $18.4 billion takeover outright on
Tuesday, Unilever seemed poised to sweeten its offer on Wednesday
for the company, which makes Hellmann's mayonnaise and Thomas'
English muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Two executives close to the situation said they expected
Unilever to raise its cash bid of $66 a share by the end of the
week. Unilever first bid a range of $61 to $64. A stock analyst in
New York said a price of $70 was possible, given the target
company's solid business and the eagerness of Unilever, which makes
household products as well as packaged foods, to expand in the food
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to favor a deal as they sent the stock of
Bestfoods up $10 11/16 on Wednesday, to $61 1/4, in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods' chief executive, meanwhile, insisted that his company
had no desire for such a merger. And his board unanimously rejected
the offer, saying it did not think there was an opportunity for a
sale of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a ship that's going down the river right now that is
doing very well, thank you,'' said Charles R. Shoemate, who has
held the position of chief executive for the last 10 years. ``And
we're going to keep doing what we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Unilever annual meeting in London, the company's
co-chairmen, Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, repeated their
position that Bestfoods had until the end of Thursday to respond to
the offer. Executives with knowledge of the takeover attempt said
Unilever was lining up a $20 billion loan to finance the
transaction, suggesting it expected to prevail. The loan is being
syndicated by four banks: ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, Warburg Dillon
Read, and Goldman, Sachs. Goldman, Sachs is advising Unilever in
the takeover effort. Bestfoods' bankers are Merrill Lynch and
Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts speculated that a higher offer could be used to
coax friendly talks because it would be costly and time-consuming
for Unilever to attempt a hostile takeover given that there are
anti-takeover provisions in place at Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, which is based in London and Amsterdam, has been on an
acquisition binge even though it announced plans in February to
shed more than 1,000 local and regional brands and to cut 25,000
jobs to focus on its best-performing businesses. Just three weeks
ago, it reached an agreement to buy Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade for $326
million. The same day, it announced it would pay $2.6 billion for
Slim-Fast Foods, the diet company.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the mergers lies one undeniable fact: the rapid
consolidation of the supermarket industry over the last two years
has shifted power from the food companies to the retailers. For the
companies to regain bargaining power, they, too, have to
consolidate, said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst with Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always said the manufacturer has to fight back, and an
easy way of doing it is to get bigger,'' he said. ``They have to
have enough clout where they have products in every one of those
inner aisles and can go to the retailer with a larger voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly global operations of some retailers, like Royal
Ahold and Carrefours, put additional pressure on manufacturers to
grow. ``If those retailers say they want to do global sourcing and
cut deals for their chains, are you going to be able to deliver or
not?'' asked James Hagan, an assistant professor for global
marketing strategy at Cornell University. ``To a certain extent, a
merger can give you the scope to allow you to be a global
supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding Bestfoods, which is one-fifth the size of Unilever, would
make Unilever, including Ben &AMP; Jerry's and Slim-Fast, larger than
Nestle, the global leader in packaged food.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., has had
solid sales growth, about half of it generated by buying other
brands, and has many successful overseas divisions, particularly in
Latin America. Among its well-known products are Skippy peanut
butter, Knorr soups, Entenmann's baked goods, Mazola cooking oil
and Mueller's pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Though earnings have grown 10 percent or more annually over the
last 10 years, Bestfoods' share price has been disappointing. One
stock analyst said that the company could have bought back stock or
taken other steps to bolster its share price, rather than waiting
for Unilever to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Bestfoods led other food stocks higher on Wednesday in an
otherwise dismal day in the market, while Unilever's American
depository receipts dropped $2 3/16, to $22 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   At $66 a share, companies like H.J. Heinz, which approached
Bestfoods about a possible merger last summer, would be unlikely
participants, Kanter said. Multinational giants like Nestle might
be interested, but would probably face antitrust issues, another
stock analyst said. A possible contender is Philip Morris, which
owns Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of acquisitions, so we are obviously in favor of
combining one business with another,'' Shoemate said. ``But big
does not make you good. You get good by being big in brand power
and profit growth. There are lots of examples of companies that
lose their focus and get big for big's sake.'' &QL;

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I will miss John Cardinal O'Connor.
 &HT;    I haven't always felt that way, of course. Back during my 1984
campaign for vice president, in fact, there were plenty of times
when I wished fervently that he would simply go away.
 &HT;    But he didn't, and over the years I took the measure of a man
who, now that he has finally left us, leaves a void that will be
all but impossible to fill.
 &HT;    Then-Bishop O'Connor of New York burst into my consciousness
like a lion pouncing on its prey, and I don't mind admitting that I
was outraged by both the suddenness and the seriousness of his
attack.
 &HT;    As would be the case so often in years to come, the issue in
1984 was abortion. It was a battle of words, not substance, and it
was one that could never be resolved, because we had staked out our
positions and neither of us was going to be moved.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic Church's position opposing abortion is
monolithic,'' Bishop O'Connor asserted.
 &HT;    I agreed entirely, but felt that the Church didn't speak for all
Catholics on the issue. Many Catholics, including some lay Catholic
theologians, were pro-choice, I pointed out, myself among them.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic position regarding abortion is not monolithic,''
I summarized.
 &HT;    In the end, it was a disaster for all involved. We were talking
past each other, neither really trying to convince the other, and
the only winners were Ronald Reagan and George Bush, whose campaign
milked the argument between us for all it was worth, doing their
best to make it seem as if I were running against the bishop, not
Vice President Bush.
 &HT;    Needless to say, we didn't win the election.
 &HT;    It was several months before I had a chance to mend fences with
Bishop O'Connor. The occasion was his departure for Rome to be
invested as a cardinal, a prince of the Church.
 &HT;    I was genuinely happy for him, and wanted to congratulate him _
but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. Finally I decided to trust to
humor, and sent him a short note.
 &HT;    ``I want to add my congratulations to that of all your friends
on your elevation to cardinal,'' I wrote. ``I only wanted to be
vice president. You got to be a prince!''
 &HT;    I was a bit worried when I dropped that letter in the mail,
however. After all, I wasn't sure if O'Connor had a sense of humor
in the first place.
 &HT;    I was reassured when, several weeks later, I got a call from the
Archdiocese, inviting me to the Chancery for breakfast with the
cardinal. We talked for quite a while, but not about abortion _ we
both knew that was one of several issues on which we would never
agree.
 &HT;    But as we talked, it became clear that we agreed on so many
other things. I left the meeting that morning comfortable in the
knowledge that I had made a friend.
 &HT;    Over the next several years, on more than one occasion I found
my life in turmoil. Invariably, just when I needed it most, the
phone would ring and I would hear the cardinal's familiar voice
giving comfort, offering a prayer.
 &HT;    The fascinating thing about the man, I soon learned, was that
while he may have been a Prince of the Church in name, in spirit he
was very much a parish priest, always looking after his flock.
 &HT;    I guess that's what most defined him. He was a man of
contradictions, and most of them arose from conflicts between those
two roles.
 &HT;    He made headlines condemning abortion, but quietly provided
shelter for unwed mothers. He adamantly opposed gays marching in
the St. Patrick's Day Parade, but funded hospices for people with
AIDS.
 &HT;    He never pulled his punches in condemning what he believed to be
a sin, but he loved the ``sinners'' nonetheless, and quietly,
effectively, he made a difference in the lives of many of them.
 &HT;    His job required him to be a politician, and like many
politicians he engendered extreme emotional responses. Like no
Cardinal New York had known before, he seemed to splinter people
into opposing camps. People either loved him or hated him _ and
some of us did both at different times.
 &HT;    Maybe it was his military background that made him seem so rigid
on matters of faith, but maybe that also accounted for the ease he
felt with his brothers in arms in the political and business world.
 &HT;    But this soldier was also a television star, keenly aware of the
impact of television and deft in using it from the pulpit. His
sense of duty to Rome was traditional in the deepest sense, but he
was a man of the modern world when it came to using its media to
bring that message to his diocese and to the nation beyond.
 &HT;    His will be an extremely tough act to follow _ an activist
priest, a defender of dogma, a man of business acumen who was
politically knowledgeable and media-savvy, a prince of an ancient
church who left his mark on 20th-century New York and the United
States as a whole.
 &HT;    He came into my life as a lion and left it as a lamb. And I will
miss him.

 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    I will miss John Cardinal O'Connor.
 &HT;    I haven't always felt that way, of course. Back during my 1984
campaign for vice president, in fact, there were plenty of times
when I wished fervently that he would simply go away.
 &HT;    But he didn't, and over the years I took the measure of a man
who, now that he has finally left us, leaves a void that will be
all but impossible to fill.
 &HT;    Then-Bishop O'Connor of New York burst into my consciousness
like a lion pouncing on its prey, and I don't mind admitting that I
was outraged by both the suddenness and the seriousness of his
attack.
 &HT;    As would be the case so often in years to come, the issue in
1984 was abortion. It was a battle of words, not substance, and it
was one that could never be resolved, because we had staked out our
positions and neither of us was going to be moved.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic Church's position opposing abortion is
monolithic,'' Bishop O'Connor asserted.
 &HT;    I agreed entirely, but felt that the Church didn't speak for all
Catholics on the issue. Many Catholics, including some lay Catholic
theologians, were pro-choice, I pointed out, myself among them.
 &HT;    ``The Catholic position regarding abortion is not monolithic,''
I summarized.
 &HT;    In the end, it was a disaster for all involved. We were talking
past each other, neither really trying to convince the other, and
the only winners were Ronald Reagan and George Bush, whose campaign
milked the argument between us for all it was worth, doing their
best to make it seem as if I were running against the bishop, not
Vice President Bush.
 &HT;    Needless to say, we didn't win the election.
 &HT;    It was several months before I had a chance to mend fences with
Bishop O'Connor. The occasion was his departure for Rome to be
invested as a cardinal, a prince of the Church.
 &HT;    I was genuinely happy for him, and wanted to congratulate him _
but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. Finally I decided to trust to
humor, and sent him a short note.
 &HT;    ``I want to add my congratulations to that of all your friends
on your elevation to cardinal,'' I wrote. ``I only wanted to be
vice president. You got to be a prince!''
 &HT;    I was a bit worried when I dropped that letter in the mail,
however. After all, I wasn't sure if O'Connor had a sense of humor
in the first place.
 &HT;    I was reassured when, several weeks later, I got a call from the

ANALYSIS: GOP PROPOSAL TO REFORM PRIMARIES GETS SCRUTINY AND
SKEPTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Republican leaders proposed scrapping the
current presidential nominating system, they immediately confronted
a series of questions, ranging from their motives to their chance
of success to whether their new idea would work as they hoped _ or
at least work better than the system they wanted to replace.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, unveiled Tuesday, would start the primaries with
the nation's smallest states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico and three tiny U.S. territories. They could have primaries no
sooner than the first Tuesday in March. Slightly bigger states
could go in April, medium-size states in May, and big states in
June.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by the former senator and Republican Party chairman
Bill Brock, the plan seeks to maintain and deepen the public's
sense of having a role in the choice of nominees by maintaining
competitive races through June, when nearly half the delegates
would be chosen. Brock also hopes the plan would make it somewhat
easier for underfinanced candidates to make an impact by keeping
the early stages of the race inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   While many Democrats, instinctively assuming deviousness, were
trying Wednesday to figure out how the scheme would give the
Republicans an advantage, they could not find a lever.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the plan suddenly attracts public interest and support, a
remote possibility, there is nothing in it to benefit the
Republicans over the Democrats. Indeed, the burden of making some
politicians mad _ and Californians are already in a snit over the
idea of their primary being pushed back to June _ falls only on the
Republicans. Democrats can sit back and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   As to the likelihood of success, Republicans can probably get
this plan past their rules committee, on which territories and
small states have one vote each, just like California.
</P>
<P>
   But they could have a difficult time at their convention, where
the big states pushed back to June have more votes. After that,
they would try to make some post-election deal with the Democrats
and try pushing the states to change their primary dates. In sum, a
very difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   But would it work? Previous efforts to change the system have
not always succeeded as the sponsors had hoped. Some failed
immediately. In 1988, for instance, Southern Democrats' effort to
exert conservative influence by grouping their primaries on what
became known as Super Tuesday failed, giving more aid to two
liberal candidates, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, than their favorite son, Sen. Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Others fail over time, like the 1974 Federal Election Campaign
Act, which ensured clean presidential races until the accountants
figured out soft money in 1988 and perfected it in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two operational problems stand out. Nelson Polsby, a political
scientist at the University of California at Berkeley, said the
news media would thwart the plan by continuing to declare winners
on the basis of the early primaries. News organizations, he said,
``legitimately report early results and these early results
influence later results.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Patterson, a Harvard political scientist, said he thought
the first time a bunch of primaries came on the same day, the
results would be covered as if they were decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Brock disagreed. ``The press is composed of human beings, and
they very much like a contest, and that makes news.'' If the
contest lasted until the third group of states, in May, ``the odds
of anyone having mathematical certainty are zero,'' he said. ``I
think people would be very careful until the big states are heard
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major problem would be money. One dirty little secret of
the present system is that while it schedules primaries from
January until June, the federal matching grant system does not
provide money for a primary contest that lasts beyond April, when
recent races have been over. Even the wealthy Bush campaign, which
rejected public funding to avoid donation limits, would be flat
broke if it were still buying television time today.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shrum, a veteran Democratic consultant now working for Vice
President Gore, said that ``for people who are relying on public
funding, it would be a huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``People spend early to try to get a knockout. They
would run out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, an early dropout from
the 2000 Republican race, said a stretched-out calendar would help
lesser-known candidates, but the goals would not be reached with
the current $1,000 limit on campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where we ever got the idea that it takes money to
put out The New York Times, and invade Normandy and to build New
York University _ but not to run for president,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said his critics were right _ ``if people acted as they do
now.'' He said if candidates prepared for a long haul, they would
spend more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   He said that would give ``lesser-known candidates a chance to
stay in, which is very much a part of our purpose.'' But, he said,
``maybe this will force us to address the insanity of present
campaign laws which promote the importance of money over issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell West, a political scientist at Brown University,
suggested that even without more money, the Brock system could work
if it forced candidates to reach voters in ways other than
television advertisements, by emphasizing debates, the Internet and
personal campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptics like Alexander said the proposed system would be
``much better than the crammed-up primaries we have today.'' Polsby
said ``it might shift the front load to middle front load.'' And
Brock said: ``There is no perfect system. We're trying to improve
the present system. We don't say this is nirvana.''

A TEXAS BONFIRE THIS YEAR MAY BE IN DOUBT 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ New ideas abounded Wednesday on the
Texas A&AMP;M University campus.
</P>
<P>
   Most involved ways to build a better Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions ran from holding a student competition to design a
safe Bonfire, to building a memorial that could double as a place
for log-burning.
</P>
<P>
   However, the likelihood of a Bonfire this year appears to be in
doubt. At least one former engineering faculty member predicts
President Ray Bowen will cancel it because there isn't time to
design a safe one.
</P>
<P>
   He has ordered that no planning be done on Bonfire until he has
a decision in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, though. If the beloved Bonfire is to
continue, extensive changes must be made in its design and in the
management of the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   That observation became evident after a special investigation
ripped the school Tuesday for blindly following tradition at the
expense of obvious safety concerns, which led to the Nov. 18
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen will have to determine whether enough changes can be made
to ensure the safety of future Bonfires. The collapse of the
59-foot-tall, wedding-cake-shaped log structure killed 11 students
and one former student as they worked on it. Twenty-seven others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The special commission appointed by Bowen said the construction
was flawed and should not have been undertaken by students.

<P>
   Scientists have discovered what they believe may be biological
markers in the blood of newborn infants who later develop autism
and mental retardation. The markers consist of abnormally high
levels of four brain chemicals that help construct the basic
architecture of animal brains, researchers said. The finding
supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of both
autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from birth.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of
the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be
replicated in larger studies. But if it proves true, it could open
the door to new opportunities for treating these devastating mental
disorders that affect as many as six out of every 1,000 newborns.
If doctors can screen for autism and mental retardation at birth,
scientists say, affected babies could be given special early
enrichments or drugs designed to help their brains develop more
normally.
</P>
<P>
   The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by
Dr. Karin B. Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., was carried out
by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth
Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington
University Medical Center in Washington. Nelson said in a telephone
interview that the study was in the process of being submitted to a
scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   The new work ``is really exciting,'' said Dr. David Amaral, a
neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis and a
leading expert on neurodevelopmental disorders, who was not
involved in the study. The world of autism research is littered
with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of
attacking the problem at a basic scientific level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this study can be replicated and confirmed, it will be very
important,'' said Dr. Eric Courchesne, an autism expert at the
University of California in San Diego. People have been looking for
triggers, like measles vaccinations, to help explain the onset of
autism symptoms, he said. But this study suggests that the defects
may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas
about the cause of these disorders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could turn out that these brain proteins ``are not
predictive of anything,'' said Dr. Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist and
autism expert at the University of Chicago. ``The work is exciting
and I hope it's correct,'' he said, but the fact that four proteins
are elevated ``does not mean there is one simple pathway'' in the
brain to explain these disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental
retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain
chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said. But this notion
has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the
disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental
retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around
3 years old. There has never been a way to identify the babies who
might have these brain abnormalities and so researchers have not
been able study the problem early in life.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings are the result of a collaboration of
researchers from three scientific disciplines: neurochemistry,
epidemiology and analytical immunochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Neurochemists have identified many brain proteins that help
cells survive, make connections between cells and lay the basis for
learning and memory, Nelson said. The thinking was that some of
these molecules might be involved in autism and mental retardation,
but which ones remained a mystery. ``We chose eight of them,''
Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects
Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley. The program, established
nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in
seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to
help track down causes of birth defects. For example, the program
recently helped show a link between babies born with cleft palates
and mothers who smoked cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The blood samples are stored in a warehouse and can be fetched
any time epidemiologists have questions to explore, said Dr. John
Harris, director of the program. In this case, staff members in the
program went to clinics in Northern California and located
teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism,
65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls. All the teen-agers
were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in
the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The samples were sent to Dr. Terry Phillips, an immunochemist at
George Washington University and at the Office of Research Services
at the National Institutes of Health who uses sophisticated new
techniques to fish tiny amounts of proteins out of blood samples.
Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers,
he said. But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),
calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in
nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers. None of
the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy
had elevated levels of these proteins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns''
present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop
autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers
said. While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a
gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said. Too
much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in
development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to
be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique
used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that
more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not
normal in regard to these proteins at birth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But researchers who are familiar with the four proteins said the
finding was highly provocative given what was known about them. For
example, Dr. Douglas Brenneman, chief of the section on
developmental and molecular pharmacology at the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, said one
protein, VIP, was akin to a master molecule used for ``putting
brains together.'' It exerts powerful effects on at least a dozen
brain chemicals, including the other three identified in this
study, he said. Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the
mother's immune cells. After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of
the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in
other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin, a digestive hormone that is being given to many
autistic children with the hope that it will alleviate their
behavioral problems, is in the VIP family, Brenneman said. But
there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines
can ever get into the brain, he said. Nearly every controlled
clinical trial of secretin has failed to show that the hormone
works as claimed, Amaral said. On the other hand, there could be
``brain and gut interactions'' that are not yet understood. This
finding about biological markers ``opens the barn door wide open to
look for deeper causes of autism and mental retardation,'' Harris
said. ``Until now, we didn't even know this barn door was there.''

METALLICA CONFRONTS NAPSTER ON SITE USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday
to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to
list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's
permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other
users listed on Napster's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an
interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's
lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer
users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for
copyright infringement. He said that the names had been gathered
and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do
anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific
information about which Napster Web site users were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, through a lawyer, said Tuesday that it would review the
papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified
if the claims had been properly submitted. The statement, issued by
Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco lawyer, went on to say that the
result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif., functions as a
meeting place for computer users willing to share their music files
over the Net.

LEVITY PREVAILS AS AWARDS ARE HANDED TO MAGAZINES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last year has not been the smoothest for the
magazine industry. Publishers have been concerned that newsstand
consolidation would slow sales. The Postal Service has proposed a
significant increase in magazine mailing rates. Life, Mirabella and
New Woman were closed. Details is on hiatus. The future of some
notable new magazines _ Talk; O: The Oprah Magazine; and Real
Simple _ is not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   So, the tone could have been one of uncertainty at the National
Magazine Awards presentation Wednesday. Instead, the ceremony,
which held a few surprises, sounded more like an evening of
stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm having a bad hair day,'' Graydon Carter, the
editor of Vanity Fair, said as he accepted the magazine's award for
reporting, for two articles about the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After Gene Shalit, the NBC film critic, gave the induction
speech for the American Society of Magazine Editors Hall of Fame,
Carter stood again, to receive the award for photography, and
dead-panned: ``Actually, I realized my bad hair day was not so bad
when Gene Shalit came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,400 guests were on hand at the Waldorf-Astoria for the
awards luncheon, sponsored by the magazine society and administered
by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   George E. Curry, the editor in chief of Emerge magazine, became
the first African-American elected as president of the society.
</P>
<P>
   John Mack Carter of Hearst Magazines, who has served as editor
in chief of McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping in
his five-decade career, was inducted into the society's Hall of
Fame. In a brief speech listing the principles that have guided his
career, Carter drew applause with his admonitions to ``work for a
shop where editorial comes first'' and ``hug your staff.''
</P>
<P>
   When William L. Allen, the editor in chief of National
Geographic, accepted the award for general excellence, he said: ``I
would hug my staff, but our legal department has advised me not
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the surprises was Sports Illustrated, which further built
its reputation as a magazine for literature and reporting by
beating out The New Yorker and Esquire for the award for feature
writing, and by beating out Esquire and The Atlantic Monthly for
profiles, a new category this year. PC Computing faced its
formidable competition _ Esquire, Consumer Reports, Redbook and
Smart Money _ and won the award for personal service.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker, nominated for 11 awards, won 3. Esquire was
nominated for 5 awards and won 1, for reviews and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In another new category introduced by the magazine society this
year, essays, The Sciences magazine won for an essay about the
cathedral clock in Strasbourg, France.

SHAQ NEEDS TO STEP IT UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now on the threshold of taking one of the greatest pratfalls in
NBA history getting eliminated in the first round of the playoffs
by an eighth seeded team after winning 67 regular season games the
Los Angeles Lakers are taking solace in the fact that the deciding
fifth game against the Sacramento Kings will be staged at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers continue to play like they did in their two
unsightly losses in Sacramento, they will get beat again and
Shaquille O'Neal will enhance his reputation as being a post-season
choke artist of dizzying heights unparalleled by an athletic
performer of his magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shouldn't lose Friday night against the Kings, but
they shouldn't have lost both games in the state capital, either.
</P>
<P>
   They not only stumbled ignobly over their press clippings, but
Shaquille O'Neal is being out-worked and even on occasion
out-played by, of all people, Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   How can that freak of nature be happening?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a strange occurrence has unfolded on the way to
Shaquille O'Neal picking up his first MVP trophy and first NBA
title he has taken a snooze and reverted to the pacifistic form
that resulted in the Lakers the past two seasons being swept in
four straight by the Utah Jazz and San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Not statistically, of course.
</P>
<P>
   In his deepest state of somnolence, O'Neal always will get his
20 plus points and 15 plus rebounds against the Kings because of
his immense size and uncommon athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   But while Divac has been energetically scurrying around the
court, cajoling teammates and reacting emotionally to every
positive King development, O'Neal has retained the stoic
countenance of a high stakes poker player.
</P>
<P>
   That's the proper deportment if you're engaged in a card game at
the Bicycle Club, or Commerce Casino, but I'm not sure it's the
tack to take if you're the leader of a basketball team that
desperately needs to be jarred out of its lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Not once during those Laker disasters in Sacramento did O'Neal
express anger at an official, or dress down a malingering teammate,
or do anything to indicate that his competitive fires were burning
strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ol' Shaq Daddy has displayed more passion in a rap
video, or even in one of his cornball movies, than he did against
the Kings, who successfully have double and triple teamed him since
his 46-point Game 1 eruption.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was a total non-factor defensively in the 101-88 Game4
loss, as the Kings kept driving merrily around him for easy
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   He managed a mere one block in 46 minutes, the same total as his
caddy, Travis Knight, managed in a mere 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Where was O'Neal's regular season intimidation that inspired a
lot of us to favorably compare his play with that of the late Wilt
Chamberlain?
</P>
<P>
   Why did it seem as though his sneakers were stapled to the Arco
Arena floor?
</P>
<P>
   Is O'Neal hurt, and not telling anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Or is his trance a result of his unconsciously wanting the Laker
owner, Jerry Buss, to pick up a ton of extra money by playing an
extra playoff game at Staples Center?
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea what became of the inspired, motivated Shaquille
O'Neal who was so dominating throughout the NBA regular season and
the opening two games of the series against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll have greater energy in Friday's game against the
Kings, but our big man has to be more dominating,'' says Jerry
West, the Lakers' top administrator. ``We expect to win at home,
but there are no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even if Shaquille O'Neal rouses himself out of his
mysterious slumber, he will have to receive more assistance from
his Laker teammates against a young, animated Kings' team with a
talented power forward, Chris Webber, who has tormented A.C. Green
and Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Lakers are in serious trouble when Kobe Bryant
takes 30 shots, as he did Tuesday night against the Kings in a vain
effort to ignite the woeful Laker offense.
</P>
<P>
   This results in Bryant dribbling excessively, and that results
in inevitable turnovers by the Laker prodigy who seemed to be the
only player on the team to exert maximum energy against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   While scoring 32 points to top the Lakers scoring, Bryant also
committed seven turnovers, which is too many for the team to be
effective.
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame Kobe Bryant for the Lakers' current predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The team didn't get anything in Sacramento out of Green, Horry,
Glen Rice, Ron Harper, Brian Shaw, Rick Fox and Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson supposedly coaches the Lakers, but I didn't notice him
doing his job against the Kings. He seemed as disinterested in the
proceedings as Shaquille O'Neal, not once complaining harshly to
the officials, not once even angrily scolding one of his listless
players.
</P>
<P>
   If such behavior doesn't change dramatically, the Lakers soon
will be relegated to the dustbin of athletic infamy, a team that
will be cruelly ridiculed like the Buffalo Bills and Atlanta Braves
have been for their post-season failures.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the Bills kept qualifying for Super Bowls and the
Braves have kept making World Series appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers now face the harrowing prospect and the widespread
scorn and ridicule that would go with it of not even making it out
of the first round of the playoffs. &QL;

NEW YORK'S CARDINAL JOHN O'CONNOR IS DEAD AT 80
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, head of the New York
Archdiocese and one of the country's most outspoken Catholic
leaders, died Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had weakened steadily since August, when he underwent
an operation for a brain tumor. He had not appeared in public since
March 5, and even then he only spoke briefly to the congregation at
St. Patrick's Cathedral and did not read a sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time in the 16 years that he led the
archdiocese, he was unable to watch the Easter Parade from the
cathedral steps.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said that the cardinal's
condition worsened Tuesday night. O'Connor's sister, other
relatives, and fellow clergy had been sitting with him, three
people at a time, in his residence behind St. Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston flew to New York Wednesday to
be at his side. The two have long been friends and ideological
allies. Law's spokesman, John Walsh, said: ``They were made
archbishop around the same time, raised to the role of cardinal at
the same time, and share geographical proximity, similarities in
outlook on the church, so they gravitated to one another. There was
a natural chemistry there, and this relationship grew even closer
during this very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Law is one of several bishops rumored to be a possible successor
to O'Connor. Other widely mentioned possibilities include Bishop
Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass., and Auxiliary Bishop William
Murphy of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, nobody outside the Vatican knows or talks about such
matters with any certainty. When O'Connor's predecessor, Cardinal
Terence Cooke, died, nobody guessed the replacement would be
O'Connor, who had been a bishop in Scranton, Pa., and before that
vicar of the US Armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was appointed to the archdiocese in 1984 and almost
instantly stirred up controversy by expressing Rome's views on
high-profile political issues in a far more outspoken manner than
his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Right away, he publicly likened abortion to the Holocaust,
denounced homosexuality as a sin, and criticized Geraldine Ferraro,
then a Queens congresswoman running as the Democratic vice
presidential candidate, for supporting abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   These were not uniformly popular positions in the archdiocese,
which consists of 2.3 million Catholics in much of New York City,
its suburbs, and the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor defied easy categories, however, marching alongside
union workers, campaigning for a raise in the minimum wage, and
taking care, often anonymously, of dying patients in AIDS clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, after a trip to Jerusalem, he played a major role in
persuading the Vatican to admit and apologize for its record of
anti-Semitism. He became close friends with New York's Jewish mayor
of the time, Edward Koch. The two even wrote a book together.
</P>
<P>
   He was also friendly with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is
Catholic. But, unlike Cardinal Francis Spellman, who was called
``The Powerhouse'' when he ran the Archdiocese from 1937 to 1967,
O'Connor never sought to play a role political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, O'Connor considerably softened the
confrontational stance of his early days and was a popular
cardinal, though a less influential one than he may have been in an
earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   In Spellman's day, for instance, Irish Catholics formed a major
part of the city's power elite, Every cardinal in New York has been
of Irish descent. However, in recent years, the Irish have faded as
a unified ethnic bloc, and, apart from political considerations, a
growing percentage of the city's Catholics are now Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor submitted his resignation to the Vatican each year for
the past five years, a motion consistently ignored. It was widely
believed that Pope John Paul II would finally let him go last
January, when O'Connor turned 80, the age at which cardinals lose
their vote to choose a new pope, but he was kept on the job.

<P>
   LONDON _ The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges announced
plans Wednesday for a full merger as well as an alliance with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq &LR;  stock market of the United States. London
and Frankfurt are hoping to build a pan-European trading
heavyweight and a 24-hour global market in new economy stocks _
both unthinkable only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The British-German exchange would be Europe's biggest by far and
the world's fourth largest.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement offered the most significant evidence to date
of a sea change in European markets. The shift has been driven by a
clamor among investors for less-expensive trading, a challenge from
Internet-based and electronic trading systems and a perception of
Europe as a single investment arena since the introduction of a
unified currency _ the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The development also showed how far Frankfurt has progressed in
its challenge to London as Europe's prime financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Just six weeks after the exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and
Brussels announced a rival European combination called Euronext,
the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse, which operates
the Frankfurt exchange, said their merged company _ called iX, for
International Exchanges _ would have its administrative
headquarters in London and would carve European markets into two
parts. Blue-chip stocks would be listed in London, while a combined
market in high-growth technology stocks linked to the Nasdaq would
be run from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurex market for derivatives _ complex financial contracts
based on stocks, bonds commodities and currencies _ _ would
continue to be run from Germany as part of the combined exchange,
effectively aiming to isolate London's LIFFE futures and options
market, which is not part of the alliances announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, the parent of Nasdaq, told a news conference
Wednesday that the opening of a Nasdaq subsidiary in Tokyo next
month would enable investors to connect with both European and U.S.
markets, offering ``a 24-hour clock for the high-growth
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   `'The markets will follow the sun for the biggest companies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq alliance will bring together London's techMARK and
Germany's Neuer Markt as the core of a new high tech exchange.
Nasdaq and iX are to be equal shareholders in that venture, which
will be incorporated in London and operated from Frankfurt. Zarb
indicated that the deal had pre-empted Nasdaq's plans to set up a
separate European trading system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The negotiations on a Frankfurt-London tie-up have been
progressing for almost two years since an alliance was first mooted
as the core of a proposed pan-European exchange. That has now
crystallized into the competing iX and Euronext markets. While the
rival Paris-dominated Euronext market will trade stocks valued at
some $2.2 trillion, iX will group equities with a combined value of
$4.29 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   By way of contrast, the New York Stock Exchange trades shares
valued at $11.24 trillion, while Nasdaq's equities are valued at
$6.23 trillion, and Tokyo's are about $4.46 trillion, according to
the International Federation of Stock Exchanges. In Europe, the new
exchange would clearly dominate, particularly since, it said
Wednesday, smaller bourses in Milan and Madrid, also want to join
the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Without Milan and Madrid, iX said it would control 53 per cent
of all European equity trading, 81 per cent of the market in
high-growth stocks and 56 per cent of the European derivatives
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step to an integrated pan-European market,''
said Don Cruickshank, the newly-appointed chairman of the London
Stock Exchange, who will be chairman of iX. Cruickshank is expected
to hold talks with both the London International Financial Futures
and Options Exchange (LIFFE) and Euronext on expanding the
Frankfurt-London combination.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Denton, a spokeswoman for LIFFE, said the exchange
would not reject an approach from iX out of hand but felt its own
technology gave it a strong position. ``We do not see ourselves in
terms of being marginalized and left out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Euronext shrugged off the new combination, saying it proved ``we
took the right decision,'' according to Olivier Lefebvre, president
of Brussels Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Seifert, the chief executive of Deutsche Borse AG which
owns the Frankfurt exchange, will be the chairman of iX, ousting
Gavin Casey, chief executive of the London exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be owned 50-50 by the London and Frankfurt
exchanges, and will eventually use Germany's Xetra technology for
all cash transactions. Participants said the merger will be
completed by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What belongs together finally comes together,'' Seifert said.
``London is the largest cash market in Europe and we bring in the
largest derivatives market worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The management line-up reflects both the national sensitivities
underlying the merger and the increasing muscle of Frankfurt at the
heart of the 11-nation euro-zone, of which Britain is not a member.
</P>
<P>
   With 200 years of history behind it, coupled with its role as
the biggest of Europe's stock markets and its reputation as
Europe's financial capital, London would once have regarded itself
automatically as the senior partner. But Frankfurt's fast-growing
and technologically-advanced exchange earns more as a business than
the London Stock Exchange, boosting its ambitions to displace
London as Europe's financial hub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this transaction a blow to the ambitions of finance center
Germany? The answer is: no,'' said Rolf Breuer, the chairman of
Deutsche Borse, who is also chief executive of Deutsche Bank.
Indeed, some British bankers said the merger represented a German
take-over because of the use of German technology and the
appointment of Seifert as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly bad for London and good for Frankfurt,'' said
a senior investment banker, who spoke in return for anonymity.
``What's most notable is that high growth and new companies will be
listed in Frankfurt. So Frankfurt is going to become the new
economy center of Europe and London will be all old economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the differing ownership structures of the London
and Frankfurt exchanges meant that shareholdings in the merged
company would be heavily weighted towards the big German banks that
dominate the Deutsche Borse. Ownership of the London Stock Exchange
is shared by over 290 members who voted earlier this year to
demutualize, while ownership of the Deutsche Borse is much more
restricted. Seifert said the iX exchange's long-term goal was to go
public with an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the move was inevitable considering the changing
profile of the market-place.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Marks, executive chairman of Merrill Lynch Europe,
Middle East and Africa called the merger and tie-in with the Nasdaq
exchange ``a significant step forward in the creation of a broader,
deeper, more liquid marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The investors have moved on and they want one stock market to
reflect that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the German and British governments welcomed the deal and
the European Union said the merger was unlikely to encounter
regulatory hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The participants made their announcement Wednesday with more
emphasis on grand visions than detail. It remained unclear, for
instance, precisely when and at what cost Germany's Xetra
technology would be rolled out for British investors, or what
savings would accrue to investors. Seifert said the conversion
should be possible some time in the first six months of 2001.
London traders work on the SETS system and `'people are going to
face conversion costs that have not been spelled out,'' said one
trader.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the number of possible layoffs was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's position outside the euro-zone also meant that
London-listed blue-chips, including such giants as BP Amoco and
DaimlerChrysler, would be quoted in both euros and sterling. Some
bankers expressed concerns about the likely costs of clearing and
settlement in the merged market.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Borse owns 50 per cent of the Luxembourg-based
Clearstream settlement system, which is not included in the merger.
Clearstream said Wednesday that it was in talks with CrestCo
Limited of Britain. Both companies will provide settlement services
to the merged exchange, but a Clearstream spokesman said a merger
between them was ``quite a long way down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the impetus for the deal came from the rapid pace of
events beyond the control of traditional bourses, notably the
proliferation of smaller and more nimble electronic trading systems
such as Tradepoint in Britain. Tradepoint, which is supported by
big U.S. and European banks, plans to launch a pan-European trading
system in July and says it will offer investors lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge presented by such organizations emerged anew
Wednesday when Breuer, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, was asked
whether his organization would withdraw from Tradepoint in favor of
iX. His answer was less than a ringing endorsement for the merged
exchanges. ``Both systems have still to show whether they'll
perform,'' he said. `'So let's wait and see.''

 DEATHS LINKED TO PG&AMP;E COAL PLANTS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As many as 120 premature deaths would be avoided
each year if a pair of aging New England power plants owned by San
Francisco's Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. met current
environmental standards, researchers from the Harvard School of
Public Health will report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The coal-burning plants, purchased by PG&AMP;E two years ago, have
been harshly criticized by Massachusetts environmentalists as being
among the worst polluters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   However, foes of the plants until now have lacked an
authoritative study addressing the health impact of airborne
emissions from the smokestacks at Salem Harbor and Brayton Point
near Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   That changes with release of the findings from Jonathan Levy and
John Spengler of the Harvard School of Public Health's Department
of Environmental Health. A copy of the findings was obtained by The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E has consistently said that there's no evidence of health
impacts as a result of their plants,'' said Rob Sargent,
legislative director with the Massachusetts Public Intererst
Research Group, or MassPIRG.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard report confirms our suspicions that there are
substantial impacts from these emissions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from reducing cases of asthma and other disorders, the
report emphasizes that lives could be saved if PG&AMP;E's two plants
met more stringent environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that reducing emissions from the actual to the
target levels would result in 40 fewer premature deaths
attributable to Salem Harbor emissions and 80 fewer deaths
attributable to Brayton Point emissions per year,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   A PG&AMP;E spokesperson was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, coal-fired plants built before the early
1970s are exempt from meeting current environmental standards for
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study's findings are based on what would happen if
the Salem Harbor and Brayton Point facilities were brought in line
with current standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these plants were built anytime in the last 25 years they
would be considered illegal,'' said Lori Ehrlich, a Salem area
accountant and co-founder of Salem Power Plant HealthLink, a
grassroots organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants are the target of a lawsuit by Boston's
Conservation Law Foundation charging that PG&AMP;E mishandled coal
waste at the facilities, allowing chromium, arsenic, mercury and
other toxic chemicals to seep into the groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard report notes that Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci
has pledged to cut emissions from the state's worst-polluting power
plants, and that the Department of Environmental Protection is
drafting related guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG's Sargent said most local plant owners had submitted
``voluntary proposals'' for cleaning up their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Only PG&AMP;E, he said, offered a plan that would actually have
resulted in increased burning of coal, which would have increased
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something we were happy about,'' Sargent said,
``and it was enough to convince the governor that voluntary plans
would not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although PG&AMP;E officials say they have tried to work with
neighbors of the plants and with environmental groups, activists
counter that they have gotten nowhere in their dealings with the
utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been astounded by PG&AMP;E's arrogance,'' Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
   The company held its annual shareholder meeting in Boston last
month _ the first time that it ever had been held outside the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, PG&AMP;E's chief executive, Bob Glynn, was invited
to sit down with local residents to discuss ways to resolve the
situation. He did not say whether he would accept such an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, PG&AMP;E reported an 80 percent surge in quarterly
earnings from operations, topping Wall Street's estimates.

MEDIA BYTES: MOVIE ABOUT NOTORIOUS HACKER INSPIRES SUITS
AND  SUBPLOTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; It was a glitzy party for a cheesy movie.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the editor of Talk magazine, came to San Francisco
last week, unveiling for a tech and media crowd the Miramax movie
``Takedown,'' the hyped-up story of notorious hacker Kevin Mitnick
and the effort to send him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why the magazine was promoting the movie was never
exactly made clear to the 150 or so people sipping wine and
munching on asparagus spears, Chinese dumplings and chocolate
truffles at the Delancey Street screening room on the Embarcadero.
I suppose the folks at Miramax _ a partner in Talk _ were letting
the magazine use the flick to promote itself, and to show how
cybersavvy it is.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the movie. The really good story is in the
fallout the film has engendered.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a book, also titled ``Takedown,'' that John
Markoff, a New York Times reporter and one of Silicon Valley's
leading journalists, co-wrote with computer security expert Tsutomu
Shimomura, who helped catch Mitnick in 1995. The film stars Russell
Wong as Shimomura and Skeet Ulrich as Mitnick. The real Shimomura
even has a brief cameo in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Marin County author Jonathan Littman, who also wrote a book
about Mitnick (``The Fugitive Game,'' published the same day as
``Takedown''), believes that many passages from his book were
plugged into the movie.
</P>
<P>
   While Markoff and Shimomura received six-figure sums for the
rights to their book, Littman hasn't received a cent _ and last
month he filed a suit charging Miramax with copyright infringement.
Miramax is contesting the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick, who was released from prison earlier this year, says he
settled a lawsuit with Miramax in which he claimed the movie
defamed him. He wouldn't reveal details of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Markoff, on whose book the movie was based, expressed
disdain for what the filmmakers did to the story. ``I thought it
was a fundamentally dishonest movie,'' he said the day after the
screening, which he attended. ``This is every reporter's nightmare,
to see the truth get trampled.''
</P>
<P>
   While Markoff wouldn't pass judgment on the merits of Littman's
suit, his comments may have the ironic effect of supporting his
onetime-ally-turned-rival. The two talked regularly and met for
lunch while they were each following the dramatic story of
Mitnick's life underground, but they each gave the other an
unflattering portrayal in their books.
</P>
<P>
   Markoff's book told the story of Shimomura's pursuit and capture
of Mitnick, while Littman's book was based on extensive
conversations with Mitnick and was far more sympathetic to the
hacker.
</P>
<P>
   The movie contains many scenes of Mitnick in his fugitive days,
and Markoff admits that neither he nor Shimomura ``knew anything
about Kevin's activities except for the two or three weeks that
Tsutomu was chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markoff noted that the screenwriters didn't necessarily have
to rely on Littman's book; they could have dug for information on
their own from some of the voluminous public records in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has been shown in France, and plans for American
distribution _ whether in theaters or on television _ are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Littman wouldn't comment on the lawsuit, or on anything
Mitnick-related; his attorney, Bill Edlund of the San Francisco
firm Barko, Zankel, Tarrant &AMP; Miller, handled all comments.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint filed in Littman's case, which was e-mailed to
me by his public relations firm, makes a compelling argument for
copyright infringement. Miramax representatives would not discuss
any specific points raised in Littman's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint details several scenes from the movie that appear
to come directly from Littman's book, including virtually the first
20 minutes of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes with eerie similarity include those depicting Mitnick
meeting in a strip club with another hacker who is an undercover
government agent, Mitnick conning Pac Bell employees into giving
him information about security software and Mitnick using that
software to eavesdrop on phone calls by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly damning comparison involves a page from Littman's
book in which he writes that Markoff sensationalized Mitnick's
story in a front-page article in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Littman writes, ``There are plenty of allegations, but the only
solid charge against Mitnick appears to be a probation violation,
generally not the sort of stuff that lands a year-and-a-half old
fugitive case on the front page of the New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, an FBI agent reads that same story, and gripes,
``Even the article says there's no proof. Nothing connects Mitnick
to any of these allegations. It's a reporter hyping a story.''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that in Markoff's book, he didn't accuse himself of
hyping the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about the story from an FBI source,'' Markoff said,
countering the movie's claim that his article spurred the FBI to
investigate Mitnick. (The hype charge has dogged Markoff for years,
with hackers and some journalists contending that he puffed up
Mitnick's misdeeds and Shimomura's heroics in the Times for the
purposes of getting a book and movie deal. Markoff said he had
written about Mitnick since 1981, when he was a reporter at
Infoworld and that he had no way of knowing his articles would
become a book when he was writing them.)
</P>
<P>
   Littman's complaint also includes e-mails he and Mitnick
received from one of the scriptwriters for ``Takedown,'' John
Danza. To Littman, he wrote that, ``I'd really like to write a film
that doesn't rely so heavily on Tsutomu's book.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mitnick, Danza said he read ``50 pages or so'' of Littman's
book, ``and find it much more interesting than Shimomura's book.''
</P>
<P>
   In both e-mails, Danza notes that his attorneys advised him not
to read Littman's book for fear of opening him up to copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Littman is seeking an unspecified sum, and his suit claims that
while Markoff and Shimomura received $750,000 for their book rights
and $650,000 for the film rights, he received nothing. Markoff said
the numbers were wrong, but he added, ``They're not off by an order
of magnitude, but I still have my day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the alleged copyright violations, the movie is a
deeply flawed telling of the Mitnick story.
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes were invented out of whole cloth, including
confrontations between Mitnick and Shimomura on the streets of
Seattle and in a federal prison. It showed Mitnick hacking into
Shimomura's computer, which even Markoff said was unlikely, and it
also portrayed Shimomura as admitting wrongdoing in creating
anti-hacking tools that ultimately fell into Mitnick's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensationalized and fictionalized depiction,''
Mitnick said in an interview from his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Mitnick also said the book ``Takedown'' was false and defamatory,
although he never sued the authors. He also said Littman's book
contained inaccuracies, because he lied to Littman in interviews
conducted while he was on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick, 36, remains on probation until 2003, and he's now
fighting his own First Amendment battle. He said his parole officer
won't let him speak or write on computer-related topics for money,
even though this is his area of expertise. ``The U.S. government is
abridging my First Amendment rights,'' he said. ``They don't want
me to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Mitnick's perspective on the case can be gleaned at a
Web site,  &LR; www.kevinmitnick.com,  &LR; which is maintained by friends of
his, because he is not allowed access to the Web or computers of
any sort.

   ECOMPANY _ NOW: It's here. The newest new economy mag, eCompany

businesspeople and a waiter standing waist deep in a swimming pool
at L.A.'s Hotel Bel-Air.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't get it, the magazine explains: The pool

   SHAKESPEARE COVERING B2B: After reporting last week that former
Upside Editor Adrian Mello's new publication on the
business-to-business Internet industry would be called,
mysteriously, Line56, I received an e-mail suggesting that it was
based on the 56th line of Shakespeare's Hamlet: ``To be, or not to
be: that is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking in my Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, I found the famous
soliloquy, cited from Act III, Scene 1 ... Line 56.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Mello is entering a new type of journalism: Instead of
comforting the afflicted (the last quote that sent me to
Bartlett's), he'll either suffer the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune, or take arms against a sea of troubles, and by
opposing end them.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLICITY STUNT DEPT.: Upside sent out a press release saying
it's ``taking over Red Herring'' this week. Can this be for real?
Could there finally be a merger among the new economy mags, with
unlikely Upside, the grandaddy of them all, swallowing its own
spawn, the Red Herring?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no. What Upside is really doing: Taking over the San
Francisco restaurant, Red Herring, for a night, to celebrate a fat
May issue. I guess, to use a Silicon Valley phrase, Upside is
eating Red Herring's lunch. Or dinner. But, presumably, paying for
it.

 PROGRAMMER WRITES CODE FOR BAD LUCK  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Hawkins nearly hit the jackpot in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days after starting a job at a Palo Alto, Calif.,
networking startup, Cisco Systems bought out the firm for roughly
$30 million. Hawkins, 36, one of just 10 employees at Network
Translation, ended up with $100,000 in stock, which would be worth
roughly $2 million if he still held it today.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Mateo County resident's luck faded quickly after he
left Cisco in August 1996 to start a rival company, Meridian
Networks Systems of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After Hawkins' company showed off its first product at a trade
show in Las Vegas in 1997, Cisco accused the programmer of ripping
off its coveted software code and repackaging it as his own. Police
raided his home office and found copies of Cisco's software on two
of Hawkins' computers. He was charged with theft and illegal
copying.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Meridian folded ``under a cloud of litigation,''
and Hawkins was forced to find a job outside the computer industry,
said Dan Barton, Hawkins' attorney in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Santa Clara, Calif., jury on Friday acquitted him of
misappropriation of trade secrets, Hawkins was found guilty of
illegally copying Cisco's ``source code'' and faces up to three
years in prison, Barton said. To make matters worse, Hawkins sold
his Cisco stock in 1996 and 1997, before it became worth a small
fortune, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hawkins has paid dearly for this,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton says Hawkins merely did what many programmers do when
they leave a company _ make copies of the computer files on their
work computer. Barton said Cisco pushed for charges simply to fight
off a potential competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not news that dominant companies often use their power in
anticompetitive ways,'' he said. Cisco declined comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors stand by their charge that Hawkins copied the
software in order to steal Cisco's product.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an ingrate,'' said Deputy District Attorney Frank
Dudley Berry Jr., pointing to the lucrative stock options Hawkins
received from Network Translation and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also estimated that Hawkins stole software worth $2
billion, based on sales generated by products that use that code.
Barton disputes the estimate, adding that the value of tech
products erode quickly with time. Prosecutors were unable to show
that Cisco was actually harmed, because the software was not widely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins is to be sentenced June 22 by Judge Thomas Hastings.

L.A. AVENGERS' HALL MAKING MOST OF SECOND CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of Victor Hall's teammates and coaches
haven't known him long enough to learn about his past, even if they
wonder about the scars that streak the left side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been out here, I see people looking at me and I can
read their minds,'' Hall said. ``They want to say, `Were you
burned?' I understand why they are curious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, one of the top two-way players on the L.A. Avengers and a
seven-year veteran of the Arena Football League, prefers to be seen
for what he is on the field: a superbly conditioned, 6-foot-4,
265-pound lineman who attacks an opposing quarterback with the same
skill he defends his own quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an offensive lineman with a defensive lineman's
attitude,'' Avengers coach Stan Brock said, ``and the players
really feed off his positive approach to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's skill and confidence betray the fact that his existence
was once fragile. The scars on his face came not from a fire but an
auto accident that impacts his life 14 years later.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Hall was a 17-year-old football star in the small
Alabama town of Anniston, playing running back and linebacker and
drawing national attention from Division I programs.
``Untouchable'' is the word Hall uses to describe himself at the
time, but in the early morning hours of March 11, 1986, that
feeling of invincibility vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was driving home from my girlfriend's house and I feel
asleep at the wheel,'' Hall said. ``When I woke up, I hit the
brakes, I went into a skid and I was heading straight for a ravine.
The car flipped seven times, and while it was flipping, the glass
from the back window was cutting me all over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got me to the hospital, I asked to see a mirror. To
this day, I still have an image of what I looked like. I could see
the outside of my teeth, because the whole side of my face was just
torn wide open. My first words were, `Oh my God, what have I done
to myself?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hall suffered no internal bleeding but required immediate
surgery to reattach his left ear and close more than 1,000 cuts on
his face and chest. The surgery lasted 11 hours, and at one point,
Hall's heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like I was looking into a pure sky, all white, and I
encountered some type of figure and a voice,'' Hall said. ``The
voice said, `It's not your time.'''
</P>
<P>
   A second surgery, to repair Hall's cracked sternum, lasted 14
hours, and once again, he clinically died on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a voice again,'' Hall said, ``and this time it said I
had a purpose in life and I wouldn't die until I found out what
that purpose was. Now I was only 17, and at 17 I didn't know
exactly how I was supposed to figure out what my purpose was.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern to Hall was his recovery. He was a
candidate for plastic surgery, but in order to first flatten out
the scars, he had to endure weekly sessions in which he received
more than 100 shots of cortisone in the face and chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't deaden the face, you can't numb it,'' Hall said.
``It got to the point where I would cry when the needles went in. I
could feel every needle and it was a tremendous amount of pain. I
did that for a month, then I told the doctor I couldn't take it
anymore. I decided I would accept whatever cards had been dealt to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That left Hall with the insecurity of being a teen-ager and
facing his peers with a body full of scars, with a head that was
swollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aftermath was the most devastating part,'' Hall said. ``If
people didn't know me, they would stare, like I was a bad person. I
had to wear cream on my face when I went to school. Friends, when
they got mad at me, the first word out of their mouths was
`Scarface.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hall persevered, got back up to 210 pounds after a low of 145,
and the support from colleges didn't waver much. Hall chose Auburn
over Alabama. In his first practice at Auburn, Hall separated his
shoulder. The next year, he tore ligaments in his ankle in a game
against Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I was wondering whether I was meant to play
sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall eventually became a starting tight end, and after short
stints in training camp with the Minnesota Vikings and Indianapolis
Colts, he left football in 1991 to join the police department in
Hobson, Ala., and within three months he had become the youngest
police chief in state history.
</P>
<P>
   In a roundabout way, Hall believes he had begun to recognize his
purpose in life, and it centered around service. Hall joined the
Arena League's Orlando Predators in 1994 (he also played for the
Barcelona Dragons of NFL Europe that year), and joined a program in
Florida designed to promote reading in elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Hall also worked as a truant officer in Florida's Orange County,
speaks to students about his experiences and for the past two years
he has used his own money to buy Christmas trees and gifts for
local needy families in the Orlando area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a lot of kids who don't have family support
and I'm trying to break that trend,'' Hall said. ``I'm trying to
break that trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, acquired by the Avengers in a trade earlier this year, is
anxious to become involved in some type of Los Angeles service
organization and begin a motivational-speaking career. He politely
declines to have any of his family or friends in Alabama discuss
his accident and recovery but doesn't shy away from the impact that
period had on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it all really does go back to the accident and
realizing how fortunate I really am,'' Hall said. ``To have
somebody you helped come back and say, `Hey, Mr. Hall, thanks for
taking the time to help us learn,' that feels great.'' &QL;

 A HIGH-TECH PIANO THAT CAN PLAY ITSELF  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new high-tech piano could be the perfect toy
for the musically challenged dot-com magnate with extra cash to
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy, chip-powered Yamaha Disklavier Pro 2000, on display
this week in San Francisco, can literally play itself and run its
own video of the pianist. It's so talented it can recreate an
evening with the late George Gershwin, with the same flair and
style of the master himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fully loaded musical instrument has enough to make the
common desktop computer jealous.
</P>
<P>
   This voice-activated grand piano is powered by a 600-MHz Pentium
III processor, with 128 MB of RAM, a 6X DVD drive, a 20-GB hard
drive, a 1023x768, 32-bit color LCD touch panel monitor, a 3.5-inch
floppy disk drive, MIDI in and out ports and fiber-optic sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The price? Just $333,000, or about 12 times more than it would
cost to spend one year studying music at Julliard, the world-class
music school in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than we paid for our last house,'' quipped Larry
Magid, a computer industry expert and syndicated columnist from
Palo Alto, Calif. ``For that price, it should come with a year's
supply of virtuosos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see one of these dot-com billionaires saying what the
hell, that's chicken feed,'' Magid said. ``For $333,000, you can
take a lot of piano lessons or send your kid to Julliard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha spokesman Paul Calvin said the Pro 2000 was like a
``concept car'' that represented the ``future of the grand dame of
musical instruments,'' partially because you don't have to know how
to play the piano to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha has already found a growing market for high-tech pianos.
The company, which began making pianos 100 years ago, first
marketed its Disklavier series of computer-aided player pianos in
1988. The high-tech pianos range in cost from $10,000 to about
$130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those pianos can also play prerecorded music from floppy disks,
including songs converted from the old paper player-piano rolls
that captured performances from artists of the past, like Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha's Disklavier uprights and grand pianos now bring in about
$100 million a year in sales in the United States alone and account
for about 25 percent of the company's overall piano sales, said
Calvin. And 50 percent of the buyers don't know how to play the
piano, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha is not the only company that makes computerized pianos.
The Van Koevering Co. of Anaheim, Calif., for example, makes a line
of computer-powered digital pianos costing between $9,400 to
$18,000. The top of the line Baby Grand has a 333-MHz Celeron
processor, 128 MB of RAM and a 56-kbps modem.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin argued that a digital piano or even a stereo system
cannot match the sound of an acoustical piano.
</P>
<P>
   At $333,000, the Pro 2000 isn't close to being the most
expensive piano ever. In 1998, a Steinway grand piano originally
commissioned in 1884 was auctioned for $1.2 million, and a
30-year-old Steinway upright used by Beatle John Lennon to compose
``Imagine'' is expected to fetch $1.6 million at an auction in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro 2000, with its brushed aluminum legs and key cover,
cherry wood siding and Plexiglas lid, is loaded with bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   During a press demo at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco, the
device replayed a song played by renowned pianist Garrick Ohlssen
and recorded on a DVD disc. As the keys played the song, the
monitor displayed a video of Ohlssen playing the work, originally
recorded at Belmont's College of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Yamaha software developer Craig Knutsen sat down and
actually played the piano while the computer displayed the musical
sheet, following him along and automatically turning the page at
the appropriate point.
</P>
<P>
   The piano will be on display until about noon Friday at the
Sherman Clay store at 647 Mission St. in San Francisco. Yamaha is
taking the piano on tour throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Thomas, district manager for Sherman Clay, said CEOs and
other ``entrepreneurial types'' with disposable income are the most
frequent buyers of high-tech pianos. But he said the pianos are
also popular among physicians, particularly heart surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stress-relieving thing for them,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Pro 2000, he said, ``we're not going to sell one a
week, but it wouldn't be surprising to me to sell two or three of
those within a year's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Magid said, no technology can turn someone into the next
Vladimir Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``An electronic high-tech musical instrument is no substitute
for theory and training,'' Magid said. ``The analogy is a food
processor doesn't turn a lousy cook into a great chef.''

 METALLICA, FANS BANG HEADS OVER FREE ONLINE MUSIC  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto
the streets of San Mateo, Calif., Wednesday as Metallica drummer
Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and
controversial music-sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the
Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc. to deliver the names of
335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs
available for free downloads last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and
photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off
those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who
shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica,
Ulrich debated with a Napster fan. And after Ulrich left, a
longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of
Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet?'' asked
the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last
name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is
seeking $10 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who
believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties
and their livelihoods. On the other side are fans, who say the
greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their
ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the
middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will
review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by
Ulrich and attorney Howard E. King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take
the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has
identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized
form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to
create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific
artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's
notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for
any music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows
fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into
the MP3 compression format.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre have filed separate civil suits
claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it
is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital
Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored
Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435
Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free
download. The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica
hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster members were identified by their user names, which
they gave Napster when they registered to download the program,
along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their
numerical Internet Protocol address.
</P>
<P>
   Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by
Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders
from reregistering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting
down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we
will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and
admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of
Napster users as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding
behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just
go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We
want online music to be on our conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old
Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif., home to give
Ulrich a piece of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very
selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped
him from buying CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country. Randy
Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why
Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not
so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge
and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will
ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney
with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list
of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have
something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to
start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,''
Doney said.

 MAC Q&AMP;A: PREVENT PAPER WASTE BY USING PRINT PREVIEW OR UTILITIES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: When I print e-mail or Web pages on my new iMac, an abundance of
extra sheets pour out, costing me much in wasted paper as well as
self-esteem. The last message I printed had three pages of actual
worthwhile info, but along with those, the printer spat out three
additional sheets with nothing but gibberish like
``mailbox:Macintosh%2OHD
/System%20Folder/Preferences/Netscape%20Users/.'' And when I print
a Web page, I get an 8.5-by-11 sheet filled, but then another sheet
with the left margin showing what didn't fit on the first page, as
if the Web site was designed for 9-inch paper. Hard to read, and
another paper waster.
</P>
<P>
   Am I the only person who has problems like these? Can you help
me?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're certainly not the only one who struggles with such issues
_ whole forests give their lives every week to make those unwanted
sheets. I don't have a set-and-forget solution, but I can offer
some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   One is to switch from Netscape Navigator to Microsoft's Internet
Explorer and start using its nifty Print Preview feature. (It's on
the File menu in IE 4.5 and now 5.0.) Just showing you the bad news
in advance wouldn't be much of a help, but the preview page also
has radio buttons that let you decide whether or not to print
headers and footers, graphics and background colors. Best of all,
there are Shrink to Fit and Crop buttons that automatically make
the page fit on one sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer 5 is free for downloading at
 &LR; www.microsoft.com/mac/download/en/default.asp. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stick with Navigator, or if you want even finer
control over what you print, either of two top-notch shareware
utilities can help:
</P>
<P>
   -- John Moe's $10 Net-Print 8.2 ( &LR; www93.pair.com/johnmoe/ &LR; ) lets
you print (or save) just the text you've selected, instead of the
whole document, in your browser or almost any other application; it
even provides an easy way to print multiple chunks of text from
separate sources on a single sheet.
</P>
<P>
   -- MacEase's $24.95 WebPrint Plus ( &LR; www.kagi.com/MacEase &LR; 
 &LR; /webprintplusmainpage.html &LR; ) combines similar basic capabilities
with extra options like time- and date-stamping your selections and
adding personal notes. My favorite feature: a customizable keyboard
shortcut that immediately prints one copy of whatever you've
selected.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dumb Move by Apple
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How can I get AppleWorks 6 to open Microsoft Word and Excel
files? I did it all the time with ClarisWorks and never had any
trouble, but the new AppleWorks doesn't even see the files.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You've put your finger on a big problem with the latest version
of Apple's Swiss-Army-knife productivity package. Fortunately,
workarounds are already available, and more good news is on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   First, a bit of background. AppleWorks 5 and its predecessor,
ClarisWorks, could open some Word and Excel files, along with files
created by a variety of other PC and Mac word processing,
spreadsheet, database and graphics applications, because Apple used
to bundle a limited version of DataViz' MacLinkPlus
format-translation software. The DataViz technology was also
included with the Mac OS itself, versions 7.5 through 8.1.
</P>
<P>
   The bundled translators weren't the most up-to-date, so you
couldn't open files from the latest versions of Microsoft Office
unless you paid DataViz extra to upgrade. But at least you could
work with older Office formats and in particular with RTF (Rich
Text Format) and SYLK, standards created specifically to facilitate
sharing of files among applications and across platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But with Mac OS 8.5 and now AppleWorks 6, Apple opted not to
renew its bundling deal with DataViz. Thanks to Apple's own
QuickTime technology, the program can read and write more graphics
and multimedia formats than ever. But by itself, unless you have
DataViz translators installed, AppleWorks can no longer handle any
kind of file from Office except raw, unformatted text.
</P>
<P>
   This has to be one of the dumber moves Apple has made in years.
I have no problem with telling the handful of people who still need
to open, say, XyWrite or even MacWrite files to pay for a
third-party translation program.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to read and write interchange formats such as
RTF and SYLK is a different matter altogether _ it was not only a
convenience to millions of users, but also an important defense
against charges that the Mac just didn't fit in a Windows-dominated
world. Taking it out is bound to make life harder for Mac champions
in countless schools, businesses and even families.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost, though. If you owned AppleWorks 5 or
ClarisWorks, your old translation software will continue to work
with AppleWorks 6. If you're using the same system folder you used
with previous versions, the old translation options should just
show up in the format popups in the program's Open and Save
dialogs. If not, dig out your old installation CD or floppies and
use the Custom Installation option to reinstall just the format
translation software.
</P>
<P>
   For users just starting out with AppleWorks 6, neither of those
solutions is available, but I'm happy to report that Apple has just
delivered a partial solution: It has released an update called
AppleWorks 6.0.3, and one of its features is an RTF translator. For
those who already have AppleWorks 6, the update, including the
translator, is be free. See
 &LR; asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11671 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you really want to co-exist with your Office-using
colleagues _ whether they're on the Mac or PC _ without having to
bug them to save their files in RTF, you'll need translators for
the native formats of Office 97, 98 and 2000. Apple is not going to
provide those, so you'll need to look to DataViz. If you want them
only to import into and export from AppleWorks, get MacLinkPlus for
iMac, a retail package that lists for $49.95. (It actually works
with other Macs, too, including the iBook, but only within
AppleWorks.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want the option of using the translators in other
applications, in addition to AppleWorks, you'll need the full
MacLinkPlus Deluxe 11. Retail, it sells for around $99, but if you
can prove ownership of the older version bundled with Mac OS
7.5-8.1, you can upgrade for $39.95 plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   A final word on AppleWorks 6: If you're now using version 5,
think twice or three times before upgrading. Version 6 does have
some nifty new features, and the user interface has been cleaned
up, but I can't remember an Apple software product that's been
greeted with more gripes by early adopters. See, for example, the
reports collected at  &LR; www.macintouch.com/appleworks6.html &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Probably the 6.0.3 update will take care of some of these
problems, but there's still the matter of price: Apple isn't
offering a discount or even a rebate program for upgraders _ even
if you own the last release, it wants you to pay the full retail
price, $79, for the new one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Voice on iBook
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'd like to try IBM's ViaVoice speech-recognition software on my
new iBook, but it doesn't have a microphone or even a jack for an
add-on mike. Is there any way to get my voice into the iBook?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're in luck _ just pay your fare and hop on the Universal
Serial Bus. A microphone manufacturer named Telex just announced
that its two USB microphones are now iBook-compatible, provided
that you've upgraded to Mac OS 9.0.4
( &LR; www.computeraudio.telex.com/news/040600.html &LR; ). The H-531
head-worn mike is $59.99; the M-560, a ``superdirectional'' desktop
model, is $69.99. Both also work with iMacs (no mention of other
USB Mac models) and USB-equipped PCs running Windows 98 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: On April 27, I noted in a Chronicle feature on
desktop moviemaking that Apple didn't include video-editing
software with the Power Mac G4 or the latest PowerBook, even though
those models have FireWire ports that can connect to digital
camcorders. Just 24 hours later, Apple made iMovie, the easy-to-use
editing application bundled with iMac DV models, available free on
the Web ( &LR; www.apple.com/ &LR;   &LR; imovie &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Apple's press release said that it is for owners of the G4 and
the new PowerBook and that it requires Mac OS 9.0.4 and QuickTime
4.1. But anyone can download it, and users report that it seems to
work fine with blue-and-white G3s and even with older Mac models.
As for the software, the program's installer says the minimum
requirements are Mac OS 8.5 and QuickTime 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the download is 19.2 megabytes, and that doesn't
include the giant (and excellent) online tutorial that comes on the
iMac DV hard drive. If you have a slow Internet connection, or if
you want the tutorial, you can order the whole shebang on CD-ROM
for a $19.95 shipping and handling fee _ just call (800) 293-6617.

 DEATHS LINKED TO PG&AMP;E COAL PLANTS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As many as 120 premature deaths would be avoided
each year if a pair of aging New England power plants owned by San
Francisco's Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. met current
environmental standards, researchers from the Harvard School of
Public Health will report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The coal-burning plants, purchased by PG&AMP;E two years ago, have
been harshly criticized by Massachusetts environmentalists as being
among the worst polluters in the state.
</P>
<P>
   However, foes of the plants until now have lacked an
authoritative study addressing the health impact of airborne
emissions from the smokestacks at Salem Harbor and Brayton Point
near Somerset.
</P>
<P>
   That changes with release of the findings from Jonathan Levy and
John Spengler of the Harvard School of Public Health's Department
of Environmental Health. A copy of the findings was obtained by The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E has consistently said that there's no evidence of health
impacts as a result of their plants,'' said Rob Sargent,
legislative director with the Massachusetts Public Intererst
Research Group, or MassPIRG.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Harvard report confirms our suspicions that there are
substantial impacts from these emissions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from reducing cases of asthma and other disorders, the
report emphasizes that lives could be saved if PG&AMP;E's two plants
met more stringent environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We estimate that reducing emissions from the actual to the
target levels would result in 40 fewer premature deaths
attributable to Salem Harbor emissions and 80 fewer deaths
attributable to Brayton Point emissions per year,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   A PG&AMP;E spokesperson was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, coal-fired plants built before the early
1970s are exempt from meeting current environmental standards for
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard study's findings are based on what would happen if
the Salem Harbor and Brayton Point facilities were brought in line
with current standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these plants were built anytime in the last 25 years they
would be considered illegal,'' said Lori Ehrlich, a Salem area
accountant and co-founder of Salem Power Plant HealthLink, a
grassroots organization.
</P>
<P>
   The two plants are the target of a lawsuit by Boston's
Conservation Law Foundation charging that PG&AMP;E mishandled coal
waste at the facilities, allowing chromium, arsenic, mercury and
other toxic chemicals to seep into the groundwater.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard report notes that Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci
has pledged to cut emissions from the state's worst-polluting power
plants, and that the Department of Environmental Protection is
drafting related guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG's Sargent said most local plant owners had submitted
``voluntary proposals'' for cleaning up their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Only PG&AMP;E, he said, offered a plan that would actually have
resulted in increased burning of coal, which would have increased
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something we were happy about,'' Sargent said,
``and it was enough to convince the governor that voluntary plans
would not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Although PG&AMP;E officials say they have tried to work with
neighbors of the plants and with environmental groups, activists
counter that they have gotten nowhere in their dealings with the
utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been astounded by PG&AMP;E's arrogance,'' Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
   The company held its annual shareholder meeting in Boston last
month _ the first time that it ever had been held outside the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, PG&AMP;E's chief executive, Bob Glynn, was invited
to sit down with local residents to discuss ways to resolve the
situation. He did not say whether he would accept such an
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, PG&AMP;E reported an 80 percent surge in quarterly
earnings from operations, topping Wall Street's estimates.

DEMOCRATS' SUIT ACCUSES KEY REPUBLICAN OF EXTORTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
and STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an escalation of interparty warfare, Democratic
leaders sued House Majority Whip Tom DeLay on Wednesday, accusing
him of extortion and money laundering in connection with his
aggressive campaign fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual civil action, filed in U.S. District Court here
under federal anti-racketeering statutes, alleges that the Texas
Republican helped set up several tax-exempt conservative
organizations under the direction of former aides to avoid
disclosing the source and expenditure of millions in campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint, submitted by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, accused DeLay and his closest political
associates of using his high-ranking position in the House to mount
a ``scheme to extort political contributions from individuals and
entities with interests before Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay or his surrogates promised ``legislative'' favors or other
actions in return for increased giving to the Republican Party, GOP
candidates or affiliated groups, the lawsuit charged, including
putting the squeeze on potential donors such as Microsoft chairman
Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, the suit alleges, was designed to help Republicans
maintain control of the House in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeLay is unfortunately conducting these activities under
the color of his office _ as he seeks through the use of systematic
extortion _ to coerce the contribution of millions of dollars to
Republicans and to intimidate those inclined to support
Democrats,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who heads the
Democratic campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   In response, DeLay said he was ``saddened and disappointed'' by
the ``unfounded, politically motivated charges.'' Aides said the
congressman, who represents a suburban area of Houston, would have
more to say about it Thursday in a speech at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay press secretary Emily Miller called the charges ``invalid
and baseless,'' adding that the complaint was filed under an
anti-racketeering law often associated with organized crime just
for ``the pure shock value'' of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in his or her right mind would read through these
outrageous allegations and believe that the Democrats are acting in
any way other than pure ugly political venom,'' Miller said, adding
that DeLay will ask the court to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly rallied around DeLay, one of the most
successful fund-raisers in GOP history. Several members accused the
Democrats of a mean-spirited effort to shut down ``legitimate''
conservative groups by ``impugning the character of the majority
whip.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy dismissed the criticism, calling the lawsuit ``a
serious complaint'' that would shine light on illegal campaign
fund-raising tactics used by DeLay since the Republicans won
control of the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has a senior congressional and party leader
devised a scheme like this _ hammering contributors for money,
threatening to punish those who decline, and setting up a shadow
party structure outside the public view and our laws in order to
make it possible,'' said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that DeLay helped set up a
network of tax-exempt organizations outside the party to funnel
contributions to his favored GOP candidates and causes. The lawsuit
said donors were encouraged to contribute to the independent groups
to evade reporting requirements under federal election laws that
govern party fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint charges that the use of the groups, organized
under two provisions of the internal revenue code that do not
require them to report the source or expenditure of funds, amounts
to illegal money laundering by DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations named in the complaint are U.S. Family
Network, Americans for Economic Growth and the Republican Majority
Issues Committee. The three groups are run by former DeLay aides Ed
Buckham, Karl Gallant and Jim Ellis. The three men are part of
DeLay's inner circle and advise him on political matters.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint focuses a lot of attention on the Republican
Majority organization, a group headed by Gallant that is trying to
raise $25 million to use on voter drives and issue advertising in
the fall campaign. The group's effort is designed to offset the
huge expenditures that organized labor is expected to make this
year on behalf of Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gallant called the Democratic action against
DeLay ``an attack by party hacks.'' He said his conservative issue
group uses the same tactics as the Sierra Club and other ``liberal
organizations'' that normally back Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit marked the third time in a year that the Democrats
have sought to curtail DeLay's formidable fund-raising network that
Washington insiders have called ``DeLay Inc.'' Democrats filed a
complaint with the Justice Department last year that went nowhere.
They also filed similar charges with the Federal Election
Commission, with no result so far.
</P>
<P>
   But the court filing represents a ratcheting up of the
interparty feuding this election year, when control of the House
could go either way in the November voting. DeLay is a prime target
of Democrats, not only because of his successful fund-raising
tactics but because he has emerged as the party's leading hardline
conservative spokesman since the retirement of former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are asking the court to shut down DeLay's
independent fund-raising operations and to award unspecified
``damages'' under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organization Act, known as RICO.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contains little evidence collected by Democrats, and
relies primarily on news accounts of DeLay's activities. But
Democrats are hoping that the judge, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
will allow a discovery process to take depositions and pore over
DeLay's fund-raising records.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' use of a law widely thought to be aimed at
thwarting organized crime might appear to be hardball politics in a
different setting _ in a courtroom rather than on the stump. But
University of Houston law professor Sandra Guerra said a Supreme
Court decision in 1994 indicates that the case could have merit.
</P>
<P>
   In that decision, the court allowed the National Organization
for Women to proceed with its RICO lawsuit against anti-abortion
protesters who were allegedly engaged in extortion by threatening
violence against abortion-clinic workers and patients in an effort
to shut down the medical facilities. The anti-abortion group argued
unsuccessfully it was merely asserting its constitutional First
Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But law professor David Crump, also of the University of
Houston, said the Democrats will have the heavy burden of
overcoming a federal judge's inevitable skepticism. He said the
judge would have to conclude before a trial begins that Congress
intended the anti-racketeering statute to cover the fund-raising
activities of a House member.

MEDIA BYTES: MOVIE ABOUT NOTORIOUS HACKER INSPIRES SUITS
AND  SUBPLOTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; It was a glitzy party for a cheesy movie.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown, the editor of Talk magazine, came to San Francisco
last week, unveiling for a tech and media crowd the Miramax movie
``Takedown,'' the hyped-up story of notorious hacker Kevin Mitnick
and the effort to send him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The reason why the magazine was promoting the movie was never
exactly made clear to the 150 or so people sipping wine and
munching on asparagus spears, Chinese dumplings and chocolate
truffles at the Delancey Street screening room on the Embarcadero.
I suppose the folks at Miramax _ a partner in Talk _ were letting
the magazine use the flick to promote itself, and to show how
cybersavvy it is.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the movie. The really good story is in the
fallout the film has engendered.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on a book, also titled ``Takedown,'' that John
Markoff, a New York Times reporter and one of Silicon Valley's
leading journalists, co-wrote with computer security expert Tsutomu
Shimomura, who helped catch Mitnick in 1995. The film stars Russell
Wong as Shimomura and Skeet Ulrich as Mitnick. The real Shimomura
even has a brief cameo in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Marin County author Jonathan Littman, who also wrote a book
about Mitnick (``The Fugitive Game,'' published the same day as
``Takedown''), believes that many passages from his book were
plugged into the movie.
</P>
<P>
   While Markoff and Shimomura received six-figure sums for the
rights to their book, Littman hasn't received a cent _ and last
month he filed a suit charging Miramax with copyright infringement.
Miramax is contesting the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick, who was released from prison earlier this year, says he
settled a lawsuit with Miramax in which he claimed the movie
defamed him. He wouldn't reveal details of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Markoff, on whose book the movie was based, expressed
disdain for what the filmmakers did to the story. ``I thought it
was a fundamentally dishonest movie,'' he said the day after the
screening, which he attended. ``This is every reporter's nightmare,
to see the truth get trampled.''
</P>
<P>
   While Markoff wouldn't pass judgment on the merits of Littman's
suit, his comments may have the ironic effect of supporting his
onetime-ally-turned-rival. The two talked regularly and met for
lunch while they were each following the dramatic story of
Mitnick's life underground, but they each gave the other an
unflattering portrayal in their books.
</P>
<P>
   Markoff's book told the story of Shimomura's pursuit and capture
of Mitnick, while Littman's book was based on extensive
conversations with Mitnick and was far more sympathetic to the
hacker.
</P>
<P>
   The movie contains many scenes of Mitnick in his fugitive days,
and Markoff admits that neither he nor Shimomura ``knew anything
about Kevin's activities except for the two or three weeks that
Tsutomu was chasing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markoff noted that the screenwriters didn't necessarily have
to rely on Littman's book; they could have dug for information on
their own from some of the voluminous public records in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has been shown in France, and plans for American
distribution _ whether in theaters or on television _ are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Littman wouldn't comment on the lawsuit, or on anything
Mitnick-related; his attorney, Bill Edlund of the San Francisco
firm Barko, Zankel, Tarrant &AMP; Miller, handled all comments.
</P>
<P>
   But the complaint filed in Littman's case, which was e-mailed to
me by his public relations firm, makes a compelling argument for
copyright infringement. Miramax representatives would not discuss
any specific points raised in Littman's suit.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint details several scenes from the movie that appear
to come directly from Littman's book, including virtually the first
20 minutes of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes with eerie similarity include those depicting Mitnick
meeting in a strip club with another hacker who is an undercover
government agent, Mitnick conning Pac Bell employees into giving
him information about security software and Mitnick using that
software to eavesdrop on phone calls by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly damning comparison involves a page from Littman's
book in which he writes that Markoff sensationalized Mitnick's
story in a front-page article in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Littman writes, ``There are plenty of allegations, but the only
solid charge against Mitnick appears to be a probation violation,
generally not the sort of stuff that lands a year-and-a-half old
fugitive case on the front page of the New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, an FBI agent reads that same story, and gripes,
``Even the article says there's no proof. Nothing connects Mitnick
to any of these allegations. It's a reporter hyping a story.''
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that in Markoff's book, he didn't accuse himself of
hyping the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about the story from an FBI source,'' Markoff said,
countering the movie's claim that his article spurred the FBI to
investigate Mitnick. (The hype charge has dogged Markoff for years,
with hackers and some journalists contending that he puffed up
Mitnick's misdeeds and Shimomura's heroics in the Times for the
purposes of getting a book and movie deal. Markoff said he had
written about Mitnick since 1981, when he was a reporter at
Infoworld and that he had no way of knowing his articles would
become a book when he was writing them.)
</P>
<P>
   Littman's complaint also includes e-mails he and Mitnick
received from one of the scriptwriters for ``Takedown,'' John
Danza. To Littman, he wrote that, ``I'd really like to write a film
that doesn't rely so heavily on Tsutomu's book.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mitnick, Danza said he read ``50 pages or so'' of Littman's
book, ``and find it much more interesting than Shimomura's book.''
</P>
<P>
   In both e-mails, Danza notes that his attorneys advised him not
to read Littman's book for fear of opening him up to copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Littman is seeking an unspecified sum, and his suit claims that
while Markoff and Shimomura received $750,000 for their book rights
and $650,000 for the film rights, he received nothing. Markoff said
the numbers were wrong, but he added, ``They're not off by an order
of magnitude, but I still have my day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the alleged copyright violations, the movie is a
deeply flawed telling of the Mitnick story.
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes were invented out of whole cloth, including
confrontations between Mitnick and Shimomura on the streets of
Seattle and in a federal prison. It showed Mitnick hacking into
Shimomura's computer, which even Markoff said was unlikely, and it
also portrayed Shimomura as admitting wrongdoing in creating
anti-hacking tools that ultimately fell into Mitnick's hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sensationalized and fictionalized depiction,''
Mitnick said in an interview from his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
Mitnick also said the book ``Takedown'' was false and defamatory,
although he never sued the authors. He also said Littman's book
contained inaccuracies, because he lied to Littman in interviews
conducted while he was on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   Mitnick, 36, remains on probation until 2003, and he's now
fighting his own First Amendment battle. He said his parole officer
won't let him speak or write on computer-related topics for money,
even though this is his area of expertise. ``The U.S. government is
abridging my First Amendment rights,'' he said. ``They don't want
me to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Mitnick's perspective on the case can be gleaned at a
Web site,  &LR; www.kevinmitnick.com,  &LR; which is maintained by friends of
his, because he is not allowed access to the Web or computers of
any sort.
</P>
<P>
   ECOMPANY _ NOW: It's here. The newest new economy mag, eCompany
Now, has rolled off Time Warner's presses and is on newsstands and
in mailboxes, weighing in at 304 pages. Judging by its debut cover,
it's trying to make a splash. The photo features 14 Web-savvy
businesspeople and a waiter standing waist deep in a swimming pool
at L.A.'s Hotel Bel-Air.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't get it, the magazine explains: The pool
represents the Internet, and the suits represent business.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the whole concept isn't all wet.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE COVERING B2B: After reporting last week that former
Upside Editor Adrian Mello's new publication on the
business-to-business Internet industry would be called,
mysteriously, Line56, I received an e-mail suggesting that it was
based on the 56th line of Shakespeare's Hamlet: ``To be, or not to
be: that is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking in my Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, I found the famous
soliloquy, cited from Act III, Scene 1 ... Line 56.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Mello is entering a new type of journalism: Instead of
comforting the afflicted (the last quote that sent me to
Bartlett's), he'll either suffer the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune, or take arms against a sea of troubles, and by
opposing end them.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLICITY STUNT DEPT.: Upside sent out a press release saying
it's ``taking over Red Herring'' this week. Can this be for real?
Could there finally be a merger among the new economy mags, with
unlikely Upside, the grandaddy of them all, swallowing its own
spawn, the Red Herring?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no. What Upside is really doing: Taking over the San
Francisco restaurant, Red Herring, for a night, to celebrate a fat
May issue. I guess, to use a Silicon Valley phrase, Upside is
eating Red Herring's lunch. Or dinner. But, presumably, paying for
it.

 METALLICA, FANS BANG HEADS OVER FREE ONLINE MUSIC  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto
the streets of San Mateo, Calif., Wednesday as Metallica drummer
Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and
controversial music-sharing software.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the
Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc. to deliver the names of
335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs
available for free downloads last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and
photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off
those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who
shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica,
Ulrich debated with a Napster fan. And after Ulrich left, a
longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of
Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet?'' asked
the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last
name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is
seeking $10 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who
believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties
and their livelihoods. On the other side are fans, who say the
greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their
ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the
middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will
review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by
Ulrich and attorney Howard E. King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take
the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has
identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized
form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to
create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific
artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's
notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for
any music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows
fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into
the MP3 compression format.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre have filed separate civil suits
claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it
is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital
Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored
Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435
Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free
download. The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica
hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster members were identified by their user names, which
they gave Napster when they registered to download the program,
along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their
numerical Internet Protocol address.
</P>
<P>
   Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by
Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders
from reregistering.
</P>
<P>
   But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting
down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we
will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and
admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of
Napster users as immoral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding
behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just
go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We
want online music to be on our conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old
Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif., home to give
Ulrich a piece of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very
selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped
him from buying CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country. Randy
Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why
Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not
so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge
and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will
ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney
with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list
of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have
something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to
start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,''
Doney said.

 PROGRAMMER WRITES CODE FOR BAD LUCK  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Hawkins nearly hit the jackpot in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days after starting a job at a Palo Alto, Calif.,
networking startup, Cisco Systems bought out the firm for roughly
$30 million. Hawkins, 36, one of just 10 employees at Network
Translation, ended up with $100,000 in stock, which would be worth
roughly $2 million if he still held it today.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Mateo County resident's luck faded quickly after he
left Cisco in August 1996 to start a rival company, Meridian
Networks Systems of San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After Hawkins' company showed off its first product at a trade
show in Las Vegas in 1997, Cisco accused the programmer of ripping
off its coveted software code and repackaging it as his own. Police
raided his home office and found copies of Cisco's software on two
of Hawkins' computers. He was charged with theft and illegal
copying.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Meridian folded ``under a cloud of litigation,''
and Hawkins was forced to find a job outside the computer industry,
said Dan Barton, Hawkins' attorney in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Santa Clara, Calif., jury on Friday acquitted him of
misappropriation of trade secrets, Hawkins was found guilty of
illegally copying Cisco's ``source code'' and faces up to three
years in prison, Barton said. To make matters worse, Hawkins sold
his Cisco stock in 1996 and 1997, before it became worth a small
fortune, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hawkins has paid dearly for this,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton says Hawkins merely did what many programmers do when
they leave a company _ make copies of the computer files on their
work computer. Barton said Cisco pushed for charges simply to fight
off a potential competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not news that dominant companies often use their power in
anticompetitive ways,'' he said. Cisco declined comment on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors stand by their charge that Hawkins copied the
software in order to steal Cisco's product.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an ingrate,'' said Deputy District Attorney Frank
Dudley Berry Jr., pointing to the lucrative stock options Hawkins
received from Network Translation and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Berry also estimated that Hawkins stole software worth $2
billion, based on sales generated by products that use that code.
Barton disputes the estimate, adding that the value of tech
products erode quickly with time. Prosecutors were unable to show
that Cisco was actually harmed, because the software was not widely
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins is to be sentenced June 22 by Judge Thomas Hastings.

 A HIGH-TECH PIANO THAT CAN PLAY ITSELF  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new high-tech piano could be the perfect toy
for the musically challenged dot-com magnate with extra cash to
burn.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of extra cash.
</P>
<P>
   The glitzy, chip-powered Yamaha Disklavier Pro 2000, on display
this week in San Francisco, can literally play itself and run its
own video of the pianist. It's so talented it can recreate an
evening with the late George Gershwin, with the same flair and
style of the master himself.
</P>
<P>
   The fully loaded musical instrument has enough to make the
common desktop computer jealous.
</P>
<P>
   This voice-activated grand piano is powered by a 600-MHz Pentium
III processor, with 128 MB of RAM, a 6X DVD drive, a 20-GB hard
drive, a 1023x768, 32-bit color LCD touch panel monitor, a 3.5-inch
floppy disk drive, MIDI in and out ports and fiber-optic sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The price? Just $333,000, or about 12 times more than it would
cost to spend one year studying music at Julliard, the world-class
music school in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's more than we paid for our last house,'' quipped Larry
Magid, a computer industry expert and syndicated columnist from
Palo Alto, Calif. ``For that price, it should come with a year's
supply of virtuosos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see one of these dot-com billionaires saying what the
hell, that's chicken feed,'' Magid said. ``For $333,000, you can
take a lot of piano lessons or send your kid to Julliard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha spokesman Paul Calvin said the Pro 2000 was like a
``concept car'' that represented the ``future of the grand dame of
musical instruments,'' partially because you don't have to know how
to play the piano to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha has already found a growing market for high-tech pianos.
The company, which began making pianos 100 years ago, first
marketed its Disklavier series of computer-aided player pianos in
1988. The high-tech pianos range in cost from $10,000 to about
$130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those pianos can also play prerecorded music from floppy disks,
including songs converted from the old paper player-piano rolls
that captured performances from artists of the past, like Gershwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha's Disklavier uprights and grand pianos now bring in about
$100 million a year in sales in the United States alone and account
for about 25 percent of the company's overall piano sales, said
Calvin. And 50 percent of the buyers don't know how to play the
piano, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha is not the only company that makes computerized pianos.
The Van Koevering Co. of Anaheim, Calif., for example, makes a line
of computer-powered digital pianos costing between $9,400 to
$18,000. The top of the line Baby Grand has a 333-MHz Celeron
processor, 128 MB of RAM and a 56-kbps modem.
</P>
<P>
   But Calvin argued that a digital piano or even a stereo system
cannot match the sound of an acoustical piano.
</P>
<P>
   At $333,000, the Pro 2000 isn't close to being the most
expensive piano ever. In 1998, a Steinway grand piano originally
commissioned in 1884 was auctioned for $1.2 million, and a
30-year-old Steinway upright used by Beatle John Lennon to compose
``Imagine'' is expected to fetch $1.6 million at an auction in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro 2000, with its brushed aluminum legs and key cover,
cherry wood siding and Plexiglas lid, is loaded with bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   During a press demo at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco, the
device replayed a song played by renowned pianist Garrick Ohlssen
and recorded on a DVD disc. As the keys played the song, the
monitor displayed a video of Ohlssen playing the work, originally
recorded at Belmont's College of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Yamaha software developer Craig Knutsen sat down and
actually played the piano while the computer displayed the musical
sheet, following him along and automatically turning the page at
the appropriate point.
</P>
<P>
   The piano will be on display until about noon Friday at the
Sherman Clay store at 647 Mission St. in San Francisco. Yamaha is
taking the piano on tour throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Thomas, district manager for Sherman Clay, said CEOs and
other ``entrepreneurial types'' with disposable income are the most
frequent buyers of high-tech pianos. But he said the pianos are
also popular among physicians, particularly heart surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stress-relieving thing for them,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Pro 2000, he said, ``we're not going to sell one a
week, but it wouldn't be surprising to me to sell two or three of
those within a year's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Magid said, no technology can turn someone into the next
Vladimir Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``An electronic high-tech musical instrument is no substitute
for theory and training,'' Magid said. ``The analogy is a food
processor doesn't turn a lousy cook into a great chef.''

GIULIANI SAYS HELMS REFLECTS BROAD G.O.P.
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ In his first town hall meeting upstate, Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani said on Wednesday that he would, if elected
senator, support Jesse Helms as chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and that he would not share a ballot with Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his support of Helms reflected his belief that
Republicans should broaden their party to different points of view.
That would make it ``much healthier than a party dominated by one
part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is running as a moderate Republican, and Helms is
ardently conservative, opposed to abortion and equal rights for gay
people.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, who is seeking the endorsement of the state's
fractious Independence Party in his campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton for U.S. Senate, also said he would not accept the
endorsement if the party put Buchanan on its ticket for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could do that, but I'm hoping they don't do
that,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, without mentioning Giuliani by name, has said
that her Republican opponent in the race should decline to run on
the Independence Party ticket if Buchanan, the conservative
commentator, is at the top of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   At the event on Wednesday, the mayor was interviewed by Chris
Matthews, the host of MSNBC's cable program, ``Hardball,'' at the
Rochester Institute of Technology here. More than 500 students
attended the event, which was telecast live. Matthews and the
students asked questions on topics as diverse as Elian Gonzalez,
police brutality and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Matthews sat in straight-back chairs, surrounded by
students as Giuliani's media consultant, Adam Goodman, recorded the
scene on film.
</P>
<P>
   One student asked the mayor if he thought he had a good chance
of winning the Senate race, even if ``you have a reputation of
supporting police brutality.'' Giuliani, referring to the Amadou
Diallo shooting, responded that: ``It was a terrible thing that
happened. It was a great tragedy.'' But he added that a racially
mixed jury had found the police officers not guilty and that the
police were more restrained in New York than in other cities. ``You
just don't know that because the media doesn't cover that,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Giuliani appeared relaxed throughout the hourlong program
even as Mr. Matthews and some other students sometimes questioned
him aggressively. Afterward, his campaign aides sought out
reporters to impress on them their view of the mayor's steadiness
under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Clinton would never allow herself to get in this
environment,'' said Juleanna Glover Weiss, the mayor's campaign
press secretary. ``It's free flowing, it's thoughtful, it's
completely unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said at the event that he ``very much'' wanted to run
for the Senate _ ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said _ despite
his recent discovery that he has prostate cancer. He added, ``My
whole hope and intention is to do it. I'd be very disappointed if I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthews also presented the mayor with quotes from a
now-well-known paper that Giuliani wrote as a student at Manhattan
College, in which he said that objections to Robert F. Kennedy's
running for Senate from New York as a carpetbagger were ``truly
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani laughed, and responded by quoting Winston Churchill:
``Any person who isn't a liberal at 20 has no heart. And any person
who isn't a conservative by 40 has no brain.''

 MAC Q&AMP;A: PREVENT PAPER WASTE BY USING PRINT PREVIEW OR UTILITIES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: When I print e-mail or Web pages on my new iMac, an abundance of
extra sheets pour out, costing me much in wasted paper as well as
self-esteem. The last message I printed had three pages of actual
worthwhile info, but along with those, the printer spat out three
additional sheets with nothing but gibberish like
``mailbox:Macintosh%2OHD
/System%20Folder/Preferences/Netscape%20Users/.'' And when I print
a Web page, I get an 8.5-by-11 sheet filled, but then another sheet
with the left margin showing what didn't fit on the first page, as
if the Web site was designed for 9-inch paper. Hard to read, and
another paper waster.
</P>
<P>
   Am I the only person who has problems like these? Can you help
me?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're certainly not the only one who struggles with such issues
_ whole forests give their lives every week to make those unwanted
sheets. I don't have a set-and-forget solution, but I can offer
some suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   One is to switch from Netscape Navigator to Microsoft's Internet
Explorer and start using its nifty Print Preview feature. (It's on
the File menu in IE 4.5 and now 5.0.) Just showing you the bad news
in advance wouldn't be much of a help, but the preview page also
has radio buttons that let you decide whether or not to print
headers and footers, graphics and background colors. Best of all,
there are Shrink to Fit and Crop buttons that automatically make
the page fit on one sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Explorer 5 is free for downloading at
 &LR; www.microsoft.com/mac/download/en/default.asp. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stick with Navigator, or if you want even finer
control over what you print, either of two top-notch shareware
utilities can help:
</P>
<P>
   -- John Moe's $10 Net-Print 8.2 ( &LR; www93.pair.com/johnmoe/ &LR; ) lets
you print (or save) just the text you've selected, instead of the
whole document, in your browser or almost any other application; it
even provides an easy way to print multiple chunks of text from
separate sources on a single sheet.
</P>
<P>
   -- MacEase's $24.95 WebPrint Plus ( &LR; www.kagi.com/MacEase &LR; 
 &LR; /webprintplusmainpage.html &LR; ) combines similar basic capabilities
with extra options like time- and date-stamping your selections and
adding personal notes. My favorite feature: a customizable keyboard
shortcut that immediately prints one copy of whatever you've
selected.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dumb Move by Apple
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How can I get AppleWorks 6 to open Microsoft Word and Excel
files? I did it all the time with ClarisWorks and never had any
trouble, but the new AppleWorks doesn't even see the files.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You've put your finger on a big problem with the latest version
of Apple's Swiss-Army-knife productivity package. Fortunately,
workarounds are already available, and more good news is on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   First, a bit of background. AppleWorks 5 and its predecessor,
ClarisWorks, could open some Word and Excel files, along with files
created by a variety of other PC and Mac word processing,
spreadsheet, database and graphics applications, because Apple used
to bundle a limited version of DataViz' MacLinkPlus
format-translation software. The DataViz technology was also
included with the Mac OS itself, versions 7.5 through 8.1.
</P>
<P>
   The bundled translators weren't the most up-to-date, so you
couldn't open files from the latest versions of Microsoft Office
unless you paid DataViz extra to upgrade. But at least you could
work with older Office formats and in particular with RTF (Rich
Text Format) and SYLK, standards created specifically to facilitate
sharing of files among applications and across platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But with Mac OS 8.5 and now AppleWorks 6, Apple opted not to
renew its bundling deal with DataViz. Thanks to Apple's own
QuickTime technology, the program can read and write more graphics
and multimedia formats than ever. But by itself, unless you have
DataViz translators installed, AppleWorks can no longer handle any
kind of file from Office except raw, unformatted text.
</P>
<P>
   This has to be one of the dumber moves Apple has made in years.
I have no problem with telling the handful of people who still need
to open, say, XyWrite or even MacWrite files to pay for a
third-party translation program.
</P>
<P>
   But the ability to read and write interchange formats such as
RTF and SYLK is a different matter altogether _ it was not only a
convenience to millions of users, but also an important defense
against charges that the Mac just didn't fit in a Windows-dominated
world. Taking it out is bound to make life harder for Mac champions
in countless schools, businesses and even families.
</P>
<P>
   All is not lost, though. If you owned AppleWorks 5 or
ClarisWorks, your old translation software will continue to work
with AppleWorks 6. If you're using the same system folder you used
with previous versions, the old translation options should just
show up in the format popups in the program's Open and Save
dialogs. If not, dig out your old installation CD or floppies and
use the Custom Installation option to reinstall just the format
translation software.
</P>
<P>
   For users just starting out with AppleWorks 6, neither of those
solutions is available, but I'm happy to report that Apple has just
delivered a partial solution: It has released an update called
AppleWorks 6.0.3, and one of its features is an RTF translator. For
those who already have AppleWorks 6, the update, including the
translator, is be free. See
 &LR; asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11671 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you really want to co-exist with your Office-using
colleagues _ whether they're on the Mac or PC _ without having to
bug them to save their files in RTF, you'll need translators for
the native formats of Office 97, 98 and 2000. Apple is not going to
provide those, so you'll need to look to DataViz. If you want them
only to import into and export from AppleWorks, get MacLinkPlus for
iMac, a retail package that lists for $49.95. (It actually works
with other Macs, too, including the iBook, but only within
AppleWorks.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want the option of using the translators in other
applications, in addition to AppleWorks, you'll need the full
MacLinkPlus Deluxe 11. Retail, it sells for around $99, but if you
can prove ownership of the older version bundled with Mac OS
7.5-8.1, you can upgrade for $39.95 plus shipping and handling.
</P>
<P>
   A final word on AppleWorks 6: If you're now using version 5,
think twice or three times before upgrading. Version 6 does have
some nifty new features, and the user interface has been cleaned
up, but I can't remember an Apple software product that's been
greeted with more gripes by early adopters. See, for example, the
reports collected at  &LR; www.macintouch.com/appleworks6.html &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Probably the 6.0.3 update will take care of some of these
problems, but there's still the matter of price: Apple isn't
offering a discount or even a rebate program for upgraders _ even
if you own the last release, it wants you to pay the full retail
price, $79, for the new one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Voice on iBook
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'd like to try IBM's ViaVoice speech-recognition software on my
new iBook, but it doesn't have a microphone or even a jack for an
add-on mike. Is there any way to get my voice into the iBook?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You're in luck _ just pay your fare and hop on the Universal
Serial Bus. A microphone manufacturer named Telex just announced
that its two USB microphones are now iBook-compatible, provided
that you've upgraded to Mac OS 9.0.4
( &LR; www.computeraudio.telex.com/news/040600.html &LR; ). The H-531
head-worn mike is $59.99; the M-560, a ``superdirectional'' desktop
model, is $69.99. Both also work with iMacs (no mention of other
USB Mac models) and USB-equipped PCs running Windows 98 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: On April 27, I noted in a Chronicle feature on
desktop moviemaking that Apple didn't include video-editing
software with the Power Mac G4 or the latest PowerBook, even though
those models have FireWire ports that can connect to digital
camcorders. Just 24 hours later, Apple made iMovie, the easy-to-use
editing application bundled with iMac DV models, available free on
the Web ( &LR; www.apple.com/ &LR;   &LR; imovie &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Apple's press release said that it is for owners of the G4 and
the new PowerBook and that it requires Mac OS 9.0.4 and QuickTime
4.1. But anyone can download it, and users report that it seems to
work fine with blue-and-white G3s and even with older Mac models.
As for the software, the program's installer says the minimum
requirements are Mac OS 8.5 and QuickTime 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Note that the download is 19.2 megabytes, and that doesn't
include the giant (and excellent) online tutorial that comes on the
iMac DV hard drive. If you have a slow Internet connection, or if
you want the tutorial, you can order the whole shebang on CD-ROM
for a $19.95 shipping and handling fee _ just call (800) 293-6617.

TESTIMONY CLOUDS PROPOSAL BY HEARST TO BUY CHRONICLE
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco's two daily newspapers have made their names and
reputations covering the sometimes arcane and often vindictive
power struggles of their city, whose political fault zones have
made the most commonplace business interactions unstable. Now the
newspapers themselves have become front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again since last August, the Hearst Corp.'s $660
million deal to buy The San Francisco Chronicle and abandon The San
Francisco Examiner seemed on the verge of completion. But over and
over again, it has foundered in the face of dogged opposition.
First, from Mayor Willie Brown Jr. and the district attorney,
Terence Hallinan, then from antitrust lawyers in the U.S. Justice
Department. And this week, a businessman and sometime politician
filed a lawsuit seeking to scuttle the sale of both newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the businessman, Clinton Reilly, prevails in his civil
antitrust action, his lawsuit has already claimed one victim. On
Tuesday, Hearst issued a statement saying that Timothy O. White,
the publisher of The Examiner, would take ``an indefinite leave of
absence'' after his testimony on Monday that he offered favorable
editorial treatment if the mayor dropped his opposition to Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was in a tough re-election campaign at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The course of the lawsuit, and the sale, may not turn on White's
sensational testimony, with its clear implication of journalistic
logrolling and dishonesty. Still, it did nothing to clarify the
deal's murky prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Broadwater, the managing director of Veronis Suhler &AMP;
Associates, Hearst's investment banker for the sale of The
Examiner, said Wednesday, ``None of us would have thought that,
nine months after the fact, we would not have closed the
transaction, we would not have gotten approval from Justice and we
would have had this local problem crop up.''
</P>
<P>
   White almost immediately disavowed his testimony, saying he was
``tired and confused'' by the question. But then Reilly's lawyer,
Joseph M. Alioto, the son of a former San Francisco mayor, produced
an e-mail message that White sent to George Irish, president of
Hearst Newspapers, on Sept. 1, the same day he had lunch with
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the message White wrote, ``I asked Willie how I was going to
justify to my superiors in New York wanting to support him and
cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to make
our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the publisher of the first newspaper owned by
the legendary William Randolph Hearst had reverted to his old
habits of using the paper for political ends prompted a quick
reaction from company executives. Late on Monday, the Hearst Corp.
issued a statement saying, ``It is not now _ nor has it ever been _
a policy of The San Francisco Examiner to trade favorable editorial
coverage for any gains, including political influence.''
</P>
<P>
   An even stronger disavowal, drafted by Examiner journalists,
appeared on the paper's front page. It read in part: ``The newsroom
employees of The Examiner are proud that our editorial support is
not, and never has been, for sale. We fully expect any employee to
be held accountable for actions that undermine our editorial
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the newsroom of The Chronicle, which has shared its building
and its profits with The Examiner for more than three decades, the
prospect _ however unlikely _ that the new owners might condone
such behavior prompted an equally strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Asimov, an education reporter, joined with dozens of
colleagues in supporting a petition that, she said, declared that
``the appearance of trading our integrity for favors is what we
abhor.'' The petition, Asimov added, calls on Hearst, the
newspaper's prospective owner, to declare that ``this is in no way
Chronicle policy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Brown, whose political dealings
have long been the subject of tough, even harsh coverage in The
Examiner, said he remembered no deal. In a telephone interview, the
mayor's deputy press secretary, Ron Vinson, quoted Brown as mocking
the notion of a deal by saying, jokingly: ``The Examiner didn't
keep up their end of the bargain. We've never gotten a break from
The Examiner editorial board.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, James A. Finefrock, the editor of The Examiner's
editorial pages, put a memorandum to his colleagues into the
paper's computer system saying: ``I don't know what Tim White said
or meant in his conversations with Willie Brown. But I do know that
Tim has never asked me to go easy on Brown or anyone else on our
editorial page, nor would he have succeeded had he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Finefrock said in his memorandum that he wrote the newspaper's
endorsement of Brown's candidacy after all five members of the
editorial board had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Examiner editors point to the newspaper's aggressive
coverage of a federal grand jury investigation of abuses in the
selection of contractors for the long-running expansion of San
Francisco International Airport. One of the people indicted on
charges of fraud last week in connection with the investigation
worked in a city agency.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Bronstein, the newspaper's executive editor, who was having
lunch with Mayor Brown on Sept. 1 when White joined them, said he
believed that the publisher's remarks to the mayor about
cooperation were ``entirely jocular.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing jocular about Reilly's lawsuit. The
Chronicle itself, in a recent, exhaustive reconstruction of the
star-crossed sale, called Reilly ``a wild card slipped into the
deck'' after all other obstacles to sale seemed to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   He remains the lone opponent to the deal, now that Hearst,
succumbing to Justice Department pressure, found a buyer willing to
keep The Examiner running and keep San Francisco a two-newspaper
town.

   (NYT10) UNDATED -- May 3, 2000 -- HOME-IMPROVEMENT -- A central
vacuum system is a convenience, especially in large homes, because
it eliminates the need to drag a vacuum cleaner from room to room
or up and down the stairs. The heart of the system is the power
unit, which produces the suction for vacuuming. It consists of the
motor and dust-collection canister, and is usually located in the
basement, attic or garage. Because the unit remains in a fixed
location and need not be carried about, it utilizes a larger, more
powerful motor than portable ones. (Ed Lipinski/The New York Times)

UNDATED: two-newspaper town.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Examiner, an afternoon paper whose 102,000 circulation is
less than one-fourth that of The Chronicle's, has remained
financially viable only because of the profit-sharing arrangement
that is part of the joint operating agreement between the two
papers, an agreement set to end when Hearst completes its deal to
buy The Chronicle from the Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department made it clear that a sale of The
Examiner was essential before it would consider approving Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle, Hearst announced in March that it was
selling The Examiner to Ted Fang, a politically well-connected
supporter of Brown and the publisher of a group of neighborhood
newspapers. Hearst is providing Fang with $66 million over the
course of three years to keep The Examiner going.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, whose bid to buy The Examiner was rejected, is now
trying to convince Judge Vaughn R. Walker of U.S. District Court in
San Francisco that the sale is a sham and that The Examiner cannot
survive under Fang's stewardship. Still to testify in the trial are
Fang, Reilly and Hearst's president and chief executive, Frank A.
Bennack Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a soap opera, except it's real life,'' said Tom
Ammiano, the president of the city's Board of Supervisors who was a
candidate for mayor last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano added, facetiously: ``Do we want a two-newspaper town?
Maybe we should have a no-newspaper town. I'm joking, but people
feel the public trust has been betrayed.''

 &HT;    Verona suddenly threat to Juventus in Serie A
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Just when Juventus looked to be pulling away with its
26th Serie A title in Italy, up jumped Verona to throw the fight
for the ``scudetto'' wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Verona, promoted from the lower divisions before the season,
upset Juve 2-0 on Sunday, with Fabrizio Cammarata scoring both
goals. That result, coupled with Lazio's 3-2 victory over Venezia,
brings the Rome club to within two points with two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Europe's other major leagues also are going down to the
wire. Deportivo La Coruna's fragile lead in Spain also is two
points, thanks to a dramatic breakaway goal by Gustavo Lopez in the
75th minute to give Celta Vigo a 2-1 victory Saturday. Barcelona
blanked Atletico Madrid 2-0 to keep the pressure on.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen is looking more and more like
Bundesliga champions for the first time, after a 2-0 win over
Hamburg on Sunday to take a three-point lead over Bayern Munich
with two weeks remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United wrapped up the English Premier League title
two weeks ago, but not without a dramatic twist. The club had
called off a $30 million transfer of PSV Eindhoven striker Ruud Van
Nistelrooy because of an ailing knee. To prove his fitness, the
young Dutch star then went out on the training pitch and suffered a
torn anterior cruciate ligament coming down awkwardly after a
header. He will be out for eight months, making him unavailable for
the Netherlands' ambitions of winning Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
   BARCA NEEDS ANOTHER MIRACLE
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona turned in a miracle in overcoming a two-goal deficit
to best Chelsea in the European Champions League quarterfinals. The
favored Spanish giants will have to do better next week to advance
to the finals. Their Primera Liga rivals Valencia scored a smashing
4-1 victory Tuesday in the first semifinal leg.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia got two first-half goals from Miguel Angulo and another
on a penalty kick from Gaizka Mendieta before halftime. Barca's
only score came off the foot of Valencia defender Mauricio
Pellegrino for an own goal. But Claudio Lopez might have broken
Barca's back by making it a three-goal affair in second-half
stoppage time.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Real Madrid took a giant step toward making the
finals an all-Spanish affair in a 2-0 home victory over Bayern
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN2 will show the return legs of both series live, Bayern
Munich-Real Madrid on Tuesday and Barcelona-Valencia on Wednesday.
Air time is 2:30 p.m. both days.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA: MATCHES CALLED OFF
</P>
<P>
   Players in all four professional divisions boycotted play last
weekend. The mass cancellations included the First Division ``El
Classico'' renewal between Buenos Aires giants River Plate and Boca
Juniors. The players' association called the strike to protest a
lack of security at a third-division match two weeks ago in which
10 players were attacked by opposing fans, who invaded the pitch.
The holdout could continue this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: TWO MORE QUALIFY
</P>
<P>
   The final weekend of the Torneo Verano regular season will be a
wild one: Five of the eight playoff spots are still to be
determined. Guadalajara earned a berth with a 4-0 rout of city
rivals U.A. de G., as Jesus Mendoza had a pair of goals. An
82nd-minute score from Martin Boasso earned Santos a 2-2 draw with
Leon and secured a playoff position.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: OLSEN GETS THE SACK
</P>
<P>
   Facing relegation from the top flight for the first time in 14
seasons, Wimbledon fired former Norwegian World Cup coach Egil
Olsen on Monday, less than a day after Bradford City defeated the
Dons 3-0. Wimbledon has lost eight matches in a row.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: SAD TIMES IN SEVILLA
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish press raised questions has been
second-division-bound Sevilla's 3-2 loss to Oviedo over the
weekend. Meanwhile, Real Betis fired coach Guus Hiddink on Tuesday,
as it faces the possibility of making the drop with its crosstown
rival. Hiddink was 1-6-6 at Betis, which was routed 4-0 by Mallorca
on Sunday to run its winless streak to 11. Sevilla trailed 3-0
before scoring two late goals against Oviedo, which stays five
points ahead of Betis and one spot above the danger zone. Three
years ago, Betis lost to Sporting Gijon under questionable
circumstances, with Sevillia being relegated. As the game drew to
an end Sunday, Sevilla fans chanted, ``Bye-bye, Betis. You're going
down. We've got our revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: BARTHEZ DEMANDS TRANSFER
</P>
<P>
   AS Monaco goalkeeper Fabien Barthez is seeking a transfer from
the French first-division champions after alleging that manager
Claude Puel suggested that he threw a match last month against
Olympique de Marseille. Marseille fought off relegation in a 4-2
victory as Barthez, the bald French World Cup hero, had his worst
outing of the season. Club officials said Barthez misinterpreted
their concerns that he played poorly.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: CARDINAL JOHN O'CONNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, May 4:
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor, who died Wednesday after 16 years as the
voice of U.S. Catholicism, was a strong-willed, conservative
theologian whose views were tempered with a pastoral concern for
the sick, the weak and the poor. For the 2 million Roman Catholics
in the New York Archdiocese, the cardinal brought a return to a
rigorous traditional Catholicism. He passionately opposed abortion,
birth control, homosexuality, the ordination of women and even
baseball on Good Friday. Such views stirred controversy among many
New Yorkers and even some of his own parishioners, but he balanced
them with a plea for those in need, even when the needy were at
odds with his strong Catholic message.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when AIDS patients had trouble getting medical care,
he appealed to Catholic medical workers to help. He battled for
better conditions for immigrant drivers and underpaid health care
workers. Even in his last months, the cardinal mustered the
strength to speak out against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's plans to
require the homeless to work for their shelter. And he had begun to
worry that America was returning to the robber-baron era,
``creating a survival-of-the-fittest society.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing himself as ``a kid from an ordinary family in
Philadelphia,'' the cardinal was ordained into the priesthood in
1945. He became a Navy chaplain and rose to the rank of rear
admiral. In 1984, he became archbishop of New York and a year later
was named cardinal, replacing the quiet leadership of Cardinal
Terence Cooke. The shift was dramatic, with progressive New Yorkers
forced to adjust to a new cardinal who supported the war in Vietnam
and had compared abortion to the Holocaust, a statement that so
enraged Jewish leaders that one rabbi labeled it an ``obscenity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in those early years that O'Connor proclaimed his
plain-spoken message not only from the pulpit at St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, but also at regular press conferences
after mass or on his own weekly television show. As a very public
priest in the nation's media capital, he soon became not only
America's top Catholic but also U.S. Catholicism's number one
conservative communicator. His critics began to label him a papal
disciplinarian who enforced Pope John Paul II's strict church
doctrine within his church as forcefully as he preached his
Catholicism in the less-obedient political arena.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the cardinal's rhetoric softened and, although
never very far out of the city's political mix, he began to remove
the press conference from his weekly rituals. In one interview a
few years ago, he mused that the church might have been better off
``if, when I came here, I had just become a silent servant of the
people.'' It was a view his fans soundly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   He also regretted denouncing Salman Rushdie without first
reading ``The Satanic Verses'' and was distressed that his
challenge of Geraldine Ferraro's views on abortion was used against
her unfairly. The cardinal's supporters felt that his political
troubles arose when he tried to reassert the church's fundamental
principles as Pope John Paul II's agent in New York. But this firm
theological stand against reform or even moderation in his own
church also gave him clout as a mediator in other areas. The
cardinal was a strong force for ecumenism and worked to improve his
church's relations with the Jewish community. His career as
military chaplain and support of the Vietnam War, which he later
revised, nevertheless brought more attention to his anti-nuclear
stance and his push to cut defense spending. More recently, after
the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police last year, the cardinal
tried to bring all sides together to defuse racial anger ignited by
the innocent black man's death.
</P>
<P>
   As archbishop, he watched over a changing flock, with a growing
Hispanic community and diverse population of immigrants. O'Connor
will be remembered as the pope's dutiful emissary in New York City,
a powerful advocate for Catholic theology and human charity.

 By FRED M. FAOUR  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Neil Drysdale is not your typical Kentucky Derby
rookie.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, 9-5 favorite Fusaichi Pegasus and 6-1 shot War Chant will
be the trainer's first starters in the Run for the Roses when they
hold Saturday's 126th running of the race at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   But Drysdale has accomplished much in the sport, including being
named to the horse racing Hall of Fame on Tuesday. He has been to
Churchill with a potential Derby winner before, too. A.P. Indy, who
went on to become the 3-year-old champion and Horse of the Year in
1992, was scratched the morning of the Derby with a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
   So you'll have to excuse Drysdale if he isn't excited about
having the race favorite after Wednesday's draw for post position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race day isn't here yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it arrives, a full field of 20 3-year-olds will go 1\ miles
for a purse of $1 million in America's most famous race.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, with Kent Desormeaux riding, will break from
the No. 16 post; War Chant (Jerry Bailey) will break from the No. 9
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contenders, the D. Wayne Lukas-trained High Yield got
the worst of it, drawing the No. 18 post. But Lukas won his fourth
Derby last year when Charismatic also broke from post 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's a good sign,'' he said. ``Each time that we've
won it, we've agonized a bit over the post position, and it turned
out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Charismatic, Lukas' other winners _ Winning Colors
(1988, 11 post), Thunder Gulch (1995, 16) and Grindstone (1996, 15)
_ started from unfavorable posts.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, with Pat Day up, will be part of a four-horse
betting entry (meaning if you bet on one, you collect on any of the
four) with the Lukas-trained Commendable (No. 13 post, Edgar Prado)
and a pair of horses trained by Todd Pletcher, Trippi (No. 6 post,
Jorge Chavez) and Impeachment (No. 15, Craig Perret). The horses
have common ownership, hence the same betting interest. The entry
is 5-1 in the morning line.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas' other horse, 30-1 Exchange Rate with Calvin Borel riding,
will break from post No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Pletcher has two other horses, including More Than Ready (John
Velazquez), which drew post position No. 10 and was made 10-1 by
oddsmaker Mike Battaglia. Pletcher also has Arkansas Derby winner
Graeme Hall (Shane Sellers), 20-1 from post No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-tiered, made-for-TV post draw, horses first are
assigned a selection order of 1-20. The connections then select
which post they want in that order. Bob Baffert, winner of two of
the last three Derbies, had first choice and took No. 8 for Captain
Steve, who is 8-1 and will be ridden by Robby Albarado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a cavalry charge anyway,'' Baffert said. ``At
least we didn't get stuck outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, the sentimental favorite with 88-year-old trainer
Harold Rose, drew post No. 5 with Roger Velez riding in his first
Derby. The 1999 Juvenile Champion, Anees (Corey Nakatani), will
break from post No. 2 and was made 20-1 by Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows how strong this field is,'' Battaglia said,
``that the juvenile champ is 20-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy will break from post 11 and was made the 4-1 second
choice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the four-horse entry, there will be a two-horse
entry owned by Godolphin Stable _ China Visit and Curule. Though
Battaglia dismissed the pair at 50-1, China Visit is unbeaten in
two starts in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
   There will be three horses in the mutuel field (again, bet on
one and you get them all) _ Deputy Warlock, Ronton and Wheelaway,
all 30-1.
</P>
<P>
   But this might be Drysdale's year. He has contenders in Fusaichi
Pegasus and War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both horses couldn't be feeling any better,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will try to become the first favorite since
Spectacular Bid in 1979 to win the Derby. His temperamental
behavior has been a big topic at Churchill all week, and Drysdale,
who had the 12th selection, passed up several inside posts to take
No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked it to keep him out of trouble,'' he said. ``I didn't
want him to stand in the gate too long in case something goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Little has gone wrong for Drysdale in his career. Besides A.P.
Indy, Drysdale has trained champions Princess Rooney, Hollywood
Wildcat, Tasso and Fiji. Drysdale, a native of England, has enjoyed
a spectacular 1999, with 73 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he'll look for the biggest win of all.

HAL'S HOPE IS ONE UNLIKELY STORY

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Elsie Rose writes books, self-published. If
she hasn't made the bestseller list, it's understandable judging by
her latest work in progress, a sentimental and implausible tale
with an undetermined ending.
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a kindly, 88-year-old horse trainer enjoying a
new lease on life after a major heart attack and the 3-year-old
colt he bred and owns. Oh, and the jockey, a 43-year-old getting a
second chance after nearly drinking himself off the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention that the colt comes out of obscurity to win a
stakes race at 40-1, that the old man gets bold and enters him in
the Florida Derby and the beast wins that too?
</P>
<P>
   And did we leave out the part where the old man and the horse
and the jockey end up at the Kentucky Derby?
</P>
<P>
   Elsie Rose's subject is her husband, Harold Rose, his horse,
Hal's Hope, and jockey Roger Velez. If the story ends with a
victory in Saturday's Kentucky Derby, it will be too cute even for
the ``Afterschool Special.'' It just feels as if it's meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you're right,'' Harold Rose said, smiling gently in
stylish, frameless glasses and a cloth cap. ``It would be a nice
ending to a good story.''
</P>
<P>
   Who'd believe it? Except for the fact such things do happen at
the Derby, where, for much of the past decade, the trophy seemed to
be reserved for oldtimers who'd paid their dues
</P>
<P>
   Unbridled owner Frances Genter in 1990, Lil E. Tee owner Cal
Partee in 1992, Sea Hero owner Paul Mellon and trainer Mack Miller
in 1993, Grindstone owner William T. Young in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of Rose and Hal's Hope following in the footsteps of
such sentimental favorites depends on whether you believe the
trainer's optimistic reading of the colt's Derby prep, a fade to
eighth and last behind High Yield and More Than Ready in the Blue
Grass Stakes at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, a son of Jolie's Halo and Rose-owned Mia's Hope, had
started the Blue Grass as the 7-2 third choice after leading all
the way to edge High Yield in the Florida Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many horses can't handle that (Keeneland) track, and
apparently, he's one of them,'' Rose said outside a Churchill Downs
barn. ``He ran down in (suffered abrasions in) both heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Hal's Hope bounce back? He has done it before, going from a
sixth-place finish to a maiden victory at 32-1 at Calder in
November, and from a fifth-place finish to an allowance win at 13-1
at the same Miami track in December.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his handlers taught him about bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's quadruple-bypass surgery last year forced the first break
in his training career since he sold his New York-area printing
business to take up racing full time in 1968. Doctors said he'd be
away from the barn for six weeks. He was back in three.
</P>
<P>
   Velez, a native Floridian, was out of racing for four years in
the early 1990s with a drinking problem. He lived with his mother
and worked at a flower shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many young people, I made some bad choices,'' Velez said
the other morning. ``But fortunately, I found the right circle and
I turned my life around.''
</P>
<P>
   As Velez tells the story, a girlfriend dying of cancer made him
promise to clean up; meeting his wife, Patti, kept him clean.
Mounts from Rose revived his career.
</P>
<P>
   After Velez rode Hal's Hope to four victories in his first nine
starts, Rose was expected to replace him with an experienced Derby
jockey. In a final nod to good karma, Rose chose loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Four-time Derby-winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas, no less, finds
Rose's Bluegrass excuse plausible. ``Keeneland is a funny track,''
said Lukas, whose High Yield won the race. ``You can't handicap off
the Blue Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield won't be among the Derby favorites. Of course, he has
never drawn the smart money before, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the little people's horse,'' Velez said. ``He wasn't
supposed to win the Holy Bull (Stakes) at 40-1. He wasn't supposed
to win the Florida Derby. A lot of people are going to have a lot
of fun betting on him Saturday.'' &QL;

DISNEY PROFITS SURGE

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Riding the popularity of ABC's hit game show
``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?,'' The Walt Disney Co. reported a
66 percent increase in quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Disney reported earnings of $161 million, or 18 cents per share,
compared with $97 million, or 13 cents per share, for the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues increased 14 percent to $6.2 billion, from $5.4 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings figures exclude Disney's interest in GO.com,
operated by Disney but publicly traded as a separate tracking
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had told you a year ago that an innovative quiz show
would be the catalyst for the revitalization of ABC, you would have
probably thought I was sprinkling a little too much pixie dust,''
said Disney Chairman Michael Eisner in a conference call with
analysts and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'' is driving more than just the
resurgence of a once-struggling television network, however, said
analyst Kurt Billick of UBS Warburg Securities in San Francisco.
It's the linchpin of Disney's fortunes as well.
</P>
<P>
   That dependence on one giant success poses risk for investors,
Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything rides on the question what happens to
`Millionaire'? If `Millionaire' is strong, then I think you're
going to see the company continue to perform well,'' Billick said.
``Broadcasting is carrying the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Media Networks division, which includes ABC,
showed a 24 percent increase in revenues from levels in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks are a consistent profit center for Disney, Billick
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the company rolls out four new parks by 2005, that sector is
expected to continue to perform well, said Tom Staggs, Disney's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company's home video and consumer products divisions
continued to struggle. Both were targeted for improvement in
Eisner's four-point plan outlined in his December letter to
shareholders in the company's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the proverbial battleship, it cannot turn on a dime.
Maybe a 50-cent piece,'' Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
   Billick said he expects Disney to show a little weakness in its
cable properties later in its fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Cable business costs are expected to increase as the company
pays more to Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League
for broadcast rights.

`BIZARRE' PENALTIES LEFT STARS IN A GAME 3 LURCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Stars forwards Aaron Gavey and Blake Sloan
sat inches apart. Neither said a word.
</P>
<P>
   For the game's next 51 seconds, they were being forced to sit in
the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Two impatient sets of eyes shifted from the ice, where time
seemed to fly, to the scoreboard, where it seemed to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' Sloan thought as he glanced at the clock. ``Go
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 12 seconds remaining in San Jose's five-on-three
power play, forward Mike Ricci scored the Sharks' first goal in
seven periods, five minutes and 42 seconds against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Gavey stood up. He exited the box and skated to the bench,
leaving Sloan alone in the agony for another 81 seconds. They never
said a word. They didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never feel good when they score and you are in the penalty
box,'' Gavey said. ``It's the longest skate in sports, and last
night it seemed even longer.''
</P>
<P>
   When you've just helped inject life into a Sharks team that had
been lifeless, the skate back to the bench seems an eternity. The
path to and from the box was well-worn by the time Game 3 ended
Tuesday and is a big reason Game 4 tomorrow has a new sense of
urgency for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   They know where the path can lead, and they know their chances
of sweeping the series died on that course. And they know they
can't go back down it tomorrow if they plan to win.
</P>
<P>
   This became evident as player after player sat in the box with
plenty of quality time to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the best example is like ``Slap Shot'','' Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``You sit there for two minutes
and you feel shame.''
</P>
<P>
   He's joking, of course. Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars spent 13 minutes, 48 seconds in shame in Game 3,
including 9:48 in the second period. Any longer, the Sharks might
start charging rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were short-handed the whole period,'' Stars
captain Derian Hatcher said. ``I had a hard time believing it was
only five penalties. It felt like it was seven or eight to be
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   But what _ beside feeling shame _ does a player exactly do while
he is in the box?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just watch the game and hope the penalty kill bails you
out of the jam you are in,'' Stars winger Scott Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the clock. Pray. Try to ignore the obnoxious fan beating
on the glass behind you. Cheer. Drink water. Remember whether you
paid your electric bill. Grumble. Curse the officials under your
breath.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a way to make 120 seconds go faster, the Stars tried
it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The last way probably was tried more than others.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say the Stars didn't exactly agree with all of the
calls against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to have a summer vacation, and I'm not paying the fine,
so I'm not going there,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, before
later adding: ``There were some really bizarre calls.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsportsmanlike call against Matvichuk in the second period
was probably more bizarre than the others. The referees ruled he
took a dive, embellishing a hook by Sharks defenseman Brad Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Sharks were confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Matvichuk took that penalty, I thought for sure it was on
us,'' Stuart admitted, ``but then they got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Matvichuk: ``That's the first one I've seen called in the
playoffs. It was suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said Sharks goalie Steve Shields took more of a dive on
the penalty that set up the five-on-three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely touched him,'' Sloan said. ``I was actually stopped
and trying to go back the other way to get out of the way. I went
to push off, my foot hit him, and he dove down. ... Yeah, he dove
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Freak calls, not retaliatory swipes, were the reason for the
Stars' many trips to the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Stars say they aren't worried about what
they'll do in the penalty box in Game 4. They don't plan to spend
as much time there. They think the penalties were more a factor of
how the game was called than being undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't retaliatory,'' Hatcher said. ``Like Blake
Sloan's penalty. It was just more bad luck than anything. He's just
skating backwards. ... I won't say anything else. It's just bad
luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, bad luck brought Sloan and Gavey inches apart. Neither said
a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Sloan said. ``You just want to sit there and
stew.''

TESTIMONY CLOUDS PROPOSAL BY HEARST TO BUY CHRONICLE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 2nd graf to make clear lawsuit was not filed this week) By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco's two daily newspapers have made their names and
reputations covering the sometimes arcane and often vindictive
power struggles of their city, whose political fault zones have
made the most commonplace business interactions unstable. Now the
newspapers themselves have become front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again since last August, the Hearst Corp.'s $660
million deal to buy The San Francisco Chronicle and abandon The San
Francisco Examiner seemed on the verge of completion. But over and
over again, it has foundered in the face of dogged opposition.
First, from Mayor Willie Brown Jr. and the district attorney,
Terence Hallinan, then from antitrust lawyers in the U.S. Justice
Department. And this week, it was from an ongoing lawsuit filed by
a businessman and sometime politician who is seeking to scuttle the
sale of both newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the businessman, Clinton Reilly, prevails in his civil
antitrust action, his lawsuit has already claimed one victim. On
Tuesday, Hearst issued a statement saying that Timothy O. White,
the publisher of The Examiner, would take ``an indefinite leave of
absence'' after his testimony on Monday that he offered favorable
editorial treatment if the mayor dropped his opposition to Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was in a tough re-election campaign at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The course of the lawsuit, and the sale, may not turn on White's
sensational testimony, with its clear implication of journalistic
logrolling and dishonesty. Still, it did nothing to clarify the
deal's murky prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Broadwater, the managing director of Veronis Suhler &AMP;
Associates, Hearst's investment banker for the sale of The
Examiner, said Wednesday, ``None of us would have thought that,
nine months after the fact, we would not have closed the
transaction, we would not have gotten approval from Justice and we
would have had this local problem crop up.''
</P>
<P>
   White almost immediately disavowed his testimony, saying he was
``tired and confused'' by the question. But then Reilly's lawyer,
Joseph M. Alioto, the son of a former San Francisco mayor, produced
an e-mail message that White sent to George Irish, president of
Hearst Newspapers, on Sept. 1, the same day he had lunch with
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the message White wrote, ``I asked Willie how I was going to
justify to my superiors in New York wanting to support him and
cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to make
our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that the publisher of the first newspaper owned by
the legendary William Randolph Hearst had reverted to his old
habits of using the paper for political ends prompted a quick
reaction from company executives. Late on Monday, the Hearst Corp.
issued a statement saying, ``It is not now _ nor has it ever been _
a policy of The San Francisco Examiner to trade favorable editorial
coverage for any gains, including political influence.''
</P>
<P>
   An even stronger disavowal, drafted by Examiner journalists,
appeared on the paper's front page. It read in part: ``The newsroom
employees of The Examiner are proud that our editorial support is
not, and never has been, for sale. We fully expect any employee to
be held accountable for actions that undermine our editorial
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the newsroom of The Chronicle, which has shared its building
and its profits with The Examiner for more than three decades, the
prospect _ however unlikely _ that the new owners might condone
such behavior prompted an equally strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Nanette Asimov, an education reporter, joined with dozens of
colleagues in supporting a petition that, she said, declared that
``the appearance of trading our integrity for favors is what we
abhor.'' The petition, Asimov added, calls on Hearst, the
newspaper's prospective owner, to declare that ``this is in no way
Chronicle policy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Brown, whose political dealings
have long been the subject of tough, even harsh coverage in The
Examiner, said he remembered no deal. In a telephone interview, the
mayor's deputy press secretary, Ron Vinson, quoted Brown as mocking
the notion of a deal by saying, jokingly: ``The Examiner didn't
keep up their end of the bargain. We've never gotten a break from
The Examiner editorial board.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, James A. Finefrock, the editor of The Examiner's
editorial pages, put a memorandum to his colleagues into the
paper's computer system saying: ``I don't know what Tim White said
or meant in his conversations with Willie Brown. But I do know that
Tim has never asked me to go easy on Brown or anyone else on our
editorial page, nor would he have succeeded had he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Finefrock said in his memorandum that he wrote the newspaper's
endorsement of Brown's candidacy after all five members of the
editorial board had agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Examiner editors point to the newspaper's aggressive
coverage of a federal grand jury investigation of abuses in the
selection of contractors for the long-running expansion of San
Francisco International Airport. One of the people indicted on
charges of fraud last week in connection with the investigation
worked in a city agency.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Bronstein, the newspaper's executive editor, who was having
lunch with Mayor Brown on Sept. 1 when White joined them, said he
believed that the publisher's remarks to the mayor about
cooperation were ``entirely jocular.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing jocular about Reilly's lawsuit. The
Chronicle itself, in a recent, exhaustive reconstruction of the
star-crossed sale, called Reilly ``a wild card slipped into the
deck'' after all other obstacles to sale seemed to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   He remains the lone opponent to the deal, now that Hearst,
succumbing to Justice Department pressure, found a buyer willing to
keep The Examiner running and keep San Francisco a two-newspaper
town.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner, an afternoon paper whose 102,000 circulation is
less than one-fourth that of The Chronicle's, has remained
financially viable only because of the profit-sharing arrangement
that is part of the joint operating agreement between the two
papers, an agreement set to end when Hearst completes its deal to
buy The Chronicle from the Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   After the Justice Department made it clear that a sale of The
Examiner was essential before it would consider approving Hearst's
purchase of The Chronicle, Hearst announced in March that it was
selling The Examiner to Ted Fang, a politically well-connected
supporter of Brown and the publisher of a group of neighborhood
newspapers. Hearst is providing Fang with $66 million over the
course of three years to keep The Examiner going.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, whose bid to buy The Examiner was rejected, is now
trying to convince Judge Vaughn R. Walker of U.S. District Court in
San Francisco that the sale is a sham and that The Examiner cannot
survive under Fang's stewardship. Still to testify in the trial are
Fang, Reilly and Hearst's president and chief executive, Frank A.
Bennack Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a soap opera, except it's real life,'' said Tom
Ammiano, the president of the city's Board of Supervisors who was a
candidate for mayor last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano added, facetiously: ``Do we want a two-newspaper town?
Maybe we should have a no-newspaper town. I'm joking, but people
feel the public trust has been betrayed.''

 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York
City's 2.37 million Catholics and the Vatican's most forceful
spokesman in the United States, died Wednesday night at his
residence around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died of cardiopulmonary arrest, said his spokesman,
Joseph Zwilling. But he added that the cardinal's death was ``the
result of the tumor and the cancer that he was suffering from.''
Last August, O'Connor had a tumor removed from the surface of his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's failing health diminished his public appearances
in recent months but did not diminish his stature as one of its
most powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican nomination for
president, expressed regret on Feb. 27 for not speaking out against
racial and anti-Catholic intolerance during a campaign visit to Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, he did so in the form of a
letter to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was passionately outspoken in his opposition to
abortion, the issue that shaped his tenure from the start. He was
unconditional in upholding official Catholic teachings on topics
like homosexuality and the ordination of women. And he was
unwavering in his loyalty to Pope John Paul, who had named him
archbishop of New York as part of an effort to restore greater
doctrinal and organizational discipline in a church still feeling
the reverberations of reforms undertaken by the Second Vatican
Council 20 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   All this gave the cardinal the profile of a zealous
conservative, but he was also a passionate defender of organized
labor, an advocate for the poor and the homeless, a vocal assailant
of racism and anti-Semitism, and an opponent of capital punishment.
And although he had spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain and retired
with the rank of rear admiral, in the 1980s he condemned American
support of counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central
America, questioned the need for spending on new weapons systems,
and, to the end, remained a cautionary voice about American
military actions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the cardinal's grave condition spurred speculation over
his possible successor. This week, the name of Bishop Edward
Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., flew to the top of a list of
candidates that has included William F. Murphy, an auxiliary bishop
of Boston; Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the
military services; Henry J. Mansell, the bishop of Buffalo, N.Y.;
and Justin F. Rigali, the archbishop of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of an archbishop, however, is a secret process
that rests in the hands of the Vatican, and appointments often come
as a surprise to those in the church who thought they were in the
know. Indeed, when O'Connor was named archbishop in January, 1984,
his name had not even been mentioned in the speculation about who
would fill the post.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's outspokenness caused waves even before he arrived in
New York. He had upset many Jews in New York by declaring that
widespread abortion in the United States was ``precisely the same''
as the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At a televised news conference a few months later, he said, ``I
do not see how a Catholic in good conscience'' could vote for a
political candidate favoring abortion, and, then, when asked
whether he might excommunicate Gov. Mario Cuomo for his support of
abortion rights, the new archbishop refused to rule it out, setting
off an intermittent feud with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year as archbishop, Geraldine Ferraro, a Catholic
who supported abortion rights, was nominated by the Democrats to
run for vice president on a ticket headed by Walter Mondale. When
she was a congresswoman from Queens, Ferraro, along with several
other Catholic public officials, had signed a letter saying that
there was ``a diversity of Catholic opinion'' about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After the letter was released during the presidential campaign,
O'Connor assailed the candidate, saying, ``Geraldine Ferraro has
misrepresented Catholic teaching on abortion.'' He went on to say
that there was no diversity of Catholic opinion, only the opinion
of the church that abortion was wrong under all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This set off countercharges that O'Connor was signaling church
support for the 1984 re-election of President Reagan, whom he had
praised earlier as ``a friend of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the archbishop tangled with the city government over
access to contraceptive information and abortion in the church's
child care agencies. He also challenged Mayor Ed Koch's executive
order barring discrimination against gays by any employer,
including the church, that had contracts with the city. When a
court struck down the mayor's executive order, the archbishop was
equally opposed to a similar City Council bill on gay rights, which
passed, even though it contained an exemption for religious
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Catholics were delighted to have such a fresh
champion in town, but many others, inside and outside the church,
were similarly fascinated. For the cardinal's proclivity for
confrontation seemed part of a larger spontaneity and directness
that seemed right at home in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At his installation in St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 18,
1984, the new archbishop put on a Mets cap, placed his own bishop's
miter on the head of a 10-year-old altar boy from the Bronx who was
also named John J. O'Connor, and mimicked Koch's regular query,
``How'm I doing?''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been the only major religious leader to hold a
regular press conference every Sunday, after he had celebrated
10:15 Mass at the cathedral. And in his early years, he was usually
ready with a curbside quip.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters monitored his Sunday sermons and his weekly columns in
the archdiocesan newspaper, and pumped him at his news conferences,
hoping for a tabloid headline for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he expressed misgivings about the manner of his
debut in New York and his high visibility. ``Time after time I have
to ask myself if the church would be better off _ certainly, I
would be better off _ if when I came here I had just become a
silent servant of the people,'' he said in 1993 in an interview
with The New York Times. He wondered whether he might have thrust
himself too much into politics, or whether a quieter style may not
have been better.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, he mused, ``If you're false to your own
temperament, you're not going to be an effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   At times he did try to be more conciliatory. He dropped the
Holocaust analogy in his preaching against abortion, and some
Jewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Connor also became close friends with Koch, and the two of
them collaborated on a book, ``His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (William
Morrow &AMP; Co., 1989), regularly dined together and gave each other
moral support during their illnesses.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   John Joseph O'Connor was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 20, 1920,
the fourth of five children of Thomas and Dorothy O'Connor. His
father was a skilled interior painter, a specialist in applying
gold leaf to the ornamental ceilings of auditoriums and churches.
His mother suffered blindness for a year and attributed her
recovery of sight in one eye to the intervention of St. Rita of
Cascia.
</P>
<P>
   In many interviews and columns he wrote for Catholic New York,
the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, O'Connor often recalled his
early upbringing: the warmth and seriousness of family prayers and
religious observances; the forceful views of his father, ``a union
man,'' on the rights of labor; the need for frugality during the
hard Depression years. His working-class roots, he said, left him
always a bit uncomfortable in the formal surroundings of the
archbishop's residence.
</P>
<P>
   He attended both public and Catholic grade schools in
Philadelphia before entering West Catholic High School for Boys,
which was run by the order of Christian Brothers, who encouraged
him to pursue a calling to the priesthood. He was ordained a priest
on Dec. 15, 1945, a month before his 26th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, he was an assistant pastor in a Philadelphia
parish. He taught in Catholic high schools as well as a night
school for adults, conducted two weekly radio programs on local
stations, worked in hospital psychiatric wards and developed
special programs to instruct retarded children. His work with
retarded children remained a lifelong passion. As a young priest,
he thought it might be his chief occupation until he answered a
plea for chaplains to serve in the armed forces during the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year stint turned into a 27-year career, during which he
traveled the world celebrating Mass in foxholes and on aircraft
carriers. He served under fire with the Marines in Vietnam, became
senior chaplain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and, in 1975,
was appointed chief of Navy chaplains with the rank of rear
admiral. During his military career, he also found time to earn a
master's degree in clinical psychology at the Catholic University
of America and a doctorate in political science at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is surely one of the two or three smartest graduate
students I ever had,'' said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former
ambassador to the United Nations, who taught him at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to retire to parish life in 1979, he instead was made
an auxiliary bishop assigned to the military vicariate, the church
unit serving the armed forces. The vicariate was administered by
the archbishop of New York until 1985, when it became independent.
Bishop O'Connor was still supervising chaplains, although now from
a post in the Catholic hierarchy rather than from one in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Military matters were fated to play a central role in O'Connor's
life. In 1968 he published ``A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam'' (World
Publishing Co.), a book that argued that the American intervention
there was morally and legally justified. ``I am convinced that the
administration has opted to accept the tragedy of war as the only
available road to meaningful peace,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad book, you know,'' he later told Nat Hentoff, who
was interviewing him for a profile in The New Yorker that was later
expanded into the 1988 biography ``John Cardinal O'Connor''
(Scribners). ``It was a very limited view of what was going on. I
regret having published it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, church watchers wondered whether O'Connor's appointment
to bishop in Scranton, Pa., a relatively minor diocese, was a form
of ecclesiastical exile or the first step to bigger things. The
question was answered with surprising rapidity. On Jan. 31, 1984,
after only eight months in Scranton, he was named the eighth
archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who had energetically thrown himself into the Scranton
job, was taken aback by his selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Scranton, I hoped I would die there,'' he said
soon afterward, pausing for effect and then adding, ``I came to New
York knowing I would die here.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He came here in early 1984 in a glare of publicity
and a flurry of controversy, a relatively unknown bishop from
Pennsylvania suddenly catapulted into the Roman Catholic Church's
most visible post in the United States. But when Cardinal John
O'Connor died Wednesday night, after more than 16 years as
archbishop of the 2.37 million Catholics in the sprawling 10-county
Archdiocese of New York, he had become a familiar and towering
presence, a leader whose views and personality were forcefully
injected into the great moral and civic debates of his time, a man
who considered himself a conciliator, but who never hesitated to be
a combatant.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died at 8:05 p.m. at his residence around the corner
from St. Patrick's Cathedral. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died of cardiopulmonary arrest, said his spokesman,
Joseph Zwilling. But he said the death was ``the result of the
tumor and the cancer that he was suffering from.''
</P>
<P>
   In late August 1999, O'Connor entered Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, where doctors removed a tumor from the surface of
his brain. After surgery and extensive radiation treatments, he
returned to his duties, but his recuperation was marred by
setbacks. He was hospitalized for fatigue in October 1999, and
recurring weakness caused him to miss with increasing frequency his
customary celebration of Sunday morning Mass at St. Patrick's. For
the first time since becoming archbishop in 1984, O'Connor was
unable to celebrate Mass on Easter Sunday at St. Patrick's
Cathedral this year.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor's illness did not prevent him from paying a
farewell visit to Pope John Paul II in Rome in February 2000. In a
letter to New York's bishops, the cardinal said he expected the
pope to name his successor as archbishop of New York in March.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, as word of O'Connor's grave condition spread
through the city and the archdiocese, speculation about his
possible successor as archbishop again intensified. This week, the
name of Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., flew to
the top of a list of candidates that has included William F.
Murphy, an auxiliary bishop of Boston; Edwin O'Brien, who heads the
archdiocese for the military services; Henry J. Mansell, the bishop
of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Justin F. Rigali, the archbishop of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of an archbishop, however, is a secret process
controlled by Vatican, and appointments often come as a surprise to
those in the church who though they were in the know.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Connor's failing health diminished his public appearances
and his position as the Roman Catholic Church's most prominent
spokesman in the United States, it did not diminish his stature as
one its most powerful symbols on moral and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican
nomination for president, expressed regret on Feb. 27 for not
speaking out against racial and anti-Catholic intolerance during a
campaign visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina, he did so
in the form of a letter to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   A Passionate Foe Of Abortion
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was passionately outspoken in his opposition to
abortion, the issue that shaped his tenure from the very start. He
was unconditional in upholding official Catholic teachings on
topics like homosexuality and the ordination of women. And he was
unwavering in his loyalty to Pope John Paul II, who had named him
archbishop of New York as part of an effort to restore greater
doctrinal and organizational discipline in a church still feeling
the reverberations of reforms undertaken by the Second Vatican
Council 20 years earlier. It was frequently repeated, but never
confirmed, that the pope had said, ``I want a man like me in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   All this gave O'Connor the profile of a zealous conservative in
a city where cultural questions of sex and sexuality had eclipsed
old-fashioned economic divisions and in a church in which, despite
Vatican efforts to quell dissent, papal popularity no longer
automatically translated into papal authority.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor was also a passionate defender of organized labor,
an advocate for the poor and the homeless, a vocal assailant of
racism and anti-Semitism, and an opponent of capital punishment.
And although he had spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain and retired
with the rank of rear admiral, in the 1980s he condemned U.S.
support of counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central
America, questioned the need for spending on new weapons systems,
and, to the end, remained a cautionary voice about U.S. military
actions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   These were positions that were rooted in Catholic doctrine and
that reflected the stance of Pope John Paul. But they sometimes
disconcerted the O'Connor's conservative allies, while his liberal
critics often ignored them altogether or welcomed them without
really believing that they gave a true measure of the man.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Projecting the Church Into Public Debates
</P>
<P>
   His image as a leader was undoubtedly affected by memories of
the two cardinals who had preceded him. Cardinal Terence Cooke, who
led the New York Archdiocese from 1968 to 1983, kept a low profile
and preferred to work through the parishes and the archdiocesan
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, O'Connor's willingness to joust with public
officials and project the church into public debates recalled the
years from 1939 to 1967, when the archdiocesan headquarters of
Cardinal Francis Spellman was known as the Powerhouse for the
leverage that the church wielded in city affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison was deceptive, because New York City and the
church had changed. The migration to the suburbs had thinned the
church's solid constituency, especially among the Irish, and
neither the new Hispanic immigrants nor the grandchildren of the
older Irish and Italian ones were as likely to defer to the
hierarchy's judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what O'Connor tried to do by public pronouncements,
Spellman would have accomplished behind the scenes. And if O'Connor
could sometimes still affect city policies with a few phone calls
to politicians, in Spellman's day, or so it was widely believed,
the calls would have been initiated by the politicians themselves,
who were careful to check their plans with the Powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor himself rejected the comparison. ``I abhor the concept
of Powerhouse,'' he told more than one reporter. ``My job is not to
acquire or wield political power.'' But the comparison was
inevitable, given the publicity and turmoil that filled his first
years in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even before arriving, he had upset many Jews in New York by
declaring that widespread abortion in the United States was
``precisely the same'' as the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At a televised news conference a few months later, he said, ``I
do not see how a Catholic in good conscience'' could vote for a
political candidate favoring abortion, and, then, when asked
whether he might excommunicate Gov. Mario Cuomo for his support of
abortion rights, the new archbishop refused to rule it out, setting
off an intermittent feud with the governor that the press helped to
reignite at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   During O'Connor's first year as archbishop, Geraldine Ferraro, a
Catholic who supported abortion rights, was nominated by the
Democrats to run for vice president on a ticket headed by Walter
Mondale. When she had been a congresswoman from Queens, Ferraro,
along with several other Catholic public officials, had signed a
letter saying that there was ``a diversity of Catholic opinion''
about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After the letter was released during the 1984 presidential
campaign, O'Connor declared, ``Geraldine Ferraro has misrepresented
Catholic teaching on abortion.'' He went on to say that there was
no diversity of Catholic opinion, only the opinion of the church
that abortion was wrong under all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This set off countercharges that O'Connor was signaling Roman
Catholic support for the 1984 re-election of President Ronald
Reagan, whom he had praised earlier as ``a friend of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   At Odds With the City Over Gay Rights
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the archbishop tangled with the city government over
access to contraceptive information and abortion in the church's
child care agencies. He also challenged Mayor Edward I. Koch's
executive order barring discrimination against gays by any
employer, including the church, that had contracts with the city.
After a court struck down Koch's order, O'Connor was equally
opposed to a similar City Council bill on gay rights, which passed,
even though it contained an exemption for religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Catholics were delighted to have such a fresh
champion in town, but many others, inside and outside the church,
were similarly fascinated. For O'Connor's proclivity for
confrontation seemed part of a larger spontaneity and directness
that seemed right at home in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At his installation in St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 18,
1984, the new archbishop put on a Mets cap, placed his own bishop's
miter on the head of a 10-year-old altar boy from the Bronx who was
also named John J. O'Connor, and mimicked Koch's regular query,
``How'm I doing?''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been the only major religious leader to hold a
regular press conference every Sunday, after he had celebrated
10:15 Mass at the cathedral. And in his early years, he was usually
ready with a curbside quip.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters monitored his Sunday sermons and his weekly columns in
the archdiocesan newspaper, and pumped him at his press
conferences, hoping for a tabloid headline for Monday. The
prelate's words were sometimes blatantly misrepresented or ripped
out of context, as in a headline in The New York Post on June 17,
1991, supposedly quoting him saying, ``God Is a Man.'' But for a
long time this was a price he appeared willing to pay to keep his
lines open to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he expressed misgivings about the manner of his
debut in New York and his high visibility. ``Time after time I have
to ask myself if the church would be better off _ certainly, I
would be better off _ if when I came here I had just become a
silent servant of the people,'' he said in 1993 in an interview
with The New York Times. He wondered whether he might have thrust
himself too much into politics, or whether Cooke's quieter style
had not been better.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, he mused, ``If you're false to your own
temperament, you're not going to be an effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   At times he did try to be more conciliatory. He dropped the
Holocaust analogy in his preaching against abortion, and some
Jewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism. The
relationship survived tensions in 1987 over his endorsement of
Palestinian hopes for a homeland and a subsequent trip to Israel
marked by a series of diplomatic contretemps.
</P>
<P>
   Despite emotional evocations of the Holocaust, first before an
Arab audience and then at Yad Vashem, he provoked a protest from
the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations when he
acquiesced in a Vatican request to downgrade his meetings with
Israeli officials and repeated his pleas for Palestinian refugees.
The public rebuke deeply stung the cardinal, but the conflict was
patched over and they later honored him as a facilitator of the
Vatican's recognition of Israel in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Before Rosh Hashana in 1999, the cardinal issued a
characteristic expression of sorrow for wrongs that he and fellow
Catholics had done to the Jewish people, a statement widely
publicized and welcomed by Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Breaking Bread With `Hizzoner'
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor also became close friends with Koch, and the two of
them collaborated on a book, ``His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (William
Morrow &AMP; Co., 1989), regularly dined together and gave each other
moral support during their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the cardinal seemed to mellow in recent years. The
cessation of his weekly press conferences in 1990 may have
symbolized his evolution. Attention more easily shifted to his
pastoral activities and day-to-day supervision of the country's
fourth-largest archdiocese, with its 413 parishes, 55 high schools,
238 elementary schools, 882 priests, 3,707 sisters and 17 hospitals
that, along with social service and child-care agencies, serve
almost 3 million people annually.
</P>
<P>
   The archdiocese embraces Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island
as well as Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange, Sullivan, Ulster
and Dutchess counties. Brooklyn and Queens constitute a separate
diocese. The cardinal's office does not publish a consolidated
budget, but the archdiocese's annual expenditures are known to be
more than $370 million. Its real estate holdings are vast and would
bring far more than $1 billion if sold.
</P>
<P>
   But these holdings are often in the form of aging churches and
schools that generate more costs than income. O'Connor strove
mightily, and largely successfully, not to close or merge parishes
or schools, as had been done in other large archdioceses in the
United States like Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His leadership in national church affairs had also been muted in
recent years. He and Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston were both named
archbishops by the pope in the same year, and were elevated a year
later to the rank of cardinal. They were sometimes called Law and
Order for their roles as channels of Vatican policy that tightened
the reins on the American church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, for example, O'Connor publicly repudiated a policy
paper from the 50-bishop administrative board of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops that supported AIDS education
programs even when they included information about condoms. The
Vatican subsequently demanded that the bishops modify their stance.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's statements made him the target of gay groups and
advocacy groups for AIDS victims, including Act Up, which
advertised a demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral in December
1989 with pictures of a bull's-eye superimposed on the cardinal's
face. During the demonstration, Act Up members shouted, lay in the
aisles and chained themselves to pews during a Sunday Mass.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor never ceased to serve on Vatican commissions, sometimes
traveling almost monthly to Rome. Nor did he cease to encourage the
sometimes fractious elements of the anti-abortion movement. But
after 1990, when the bishops appointed Helen Alvare, a lawyer, as
the leading representative of their Pro-Life Activities Committee,
his role became less public, and other cardinals, especially
Cardinal Law, appeared to take the lead in pressing Vatican
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Working-Class Roots In Philadelphia
</P>
<P>
   John Joseph O'Connor was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 20, 1920,
the fourth of five children of Thomas and Dorothy O'Connor. His
father was a skilled interior painter, a specialist in applying
gold leaf to the ornamental ceilings of auditoriums and churches.
His mother suffered blindness for a year and attributed her
recovery of sight in one eye to the intervention of St. Rita of
Cascia.
</P>
<P>
   In many interviews and columns he wrote for Catholic New York,
the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, O'Connor often recalled his
early upbringing: the warmth and seriousness of family prayers and
religious observances; the forceful views of his father, ``a union
man,'' on the rights of labor; the need for frugality during the
hard Depression years. His working-class roots, he said, left him
always a bit uncomfortable in the formal surroundings of the
archbishop's residence at East 50th Street and Madison Avenue,
behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He attended both public and Catholic grade schools in
Philadelphia before entering West Catholic High School for Boys,
which was run by the order of Christian Brothers, who encouraged
him to pursue a calling to the priesthood. In recent years, his
descriptions of the rigors of his life at St. Charles Borromeo
Seminary in Philadelphia sometimes made it sound like Marine boot
camp designed by Charles Dickens. He stressed that it was always
the goal of ordination to the priesthood, which he achieved on Dec.
15, 1945, a month before his 26th birthday, that made him
persevere.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, he was an assistant pastor in a Philadelphia
parish. He taught in Catholic high schools as well as a night
school for adults, conducted two weekly radio programs on local
stations, worked in hospital psychiatric wards and developed
special programs to instruct retarded children.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's work with retarded children remained a lifelong
passion. As a young priest, he thought it might be his chief
occupation until, urged by Cardinal John O'Hara of Philadelphia, he
answered Spellman's plea of for chaplains to serve in the armed
forces during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year stint turned into a 27-year career, during which he
traveled the world celebrating Mass in foxholes and on aircraft
carriers. He served under fire with the Marines in Vietnam, became
senior chaplain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and, in 1975,
was appointed chief of Navy chaplains with the rank of rear
admiral. During his military career, he also found time to earn a
master's degree in clinical psychology at the Catholic University
of America and a doctorate in political science at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to retire to parish life in 1979, he instead was made
an auxiliary bishop assigned to the military vicariate, the church
unit serving the armed forces. The vicariate was administered by
the archbishop of New York until 1985, when it became independent.
Bishop O'Connor was still supervising chaplains, although now from
a post in the Catholic hierarchy rather than from one in the Navy.

   Foxhole Chaplain In Vietnam
</P>
<P>
   Military matters were fated to play a central role in O'Connor's
life. In 1968 he published ``A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam'' (World
Publishing Co.), a book that argued that the American intervention
there was morally and legally justified. ``I am convinced,'' he
wrote, ``that the administration has opted to accept the tragedy of
war as the only available road to meaningful peace.''
</P>
<P>
   His ministry in Vietnam, he continued, involved him in ``the
unglamorous, dirty business of survival, in digging a hole in a
sun-baked hill in the boiling dust of 120-degree heat, in slogging
through knee-high mud, in fighting insects, tripping over jungle
growth, sleeping night after night with one eye open, alert to the
whisper of every breeze, the snapping of every twig.
</P>
<P>
   ``No priest can watch the blood pouring from the wounds of the
dying, be they American or Vietnamese of the north or south,
without anguish and a sense of desperate frustration and
futility,'' he continued. ``The clergy back home, the academicians
in their universities, the protesters on their marches are not the
only ones who cry out, `Why?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad book, you know,'' he later told Nat Hentoff, who
was interviewing him for a profile in The New Yorker that was later
expanded into the 1988 biography ``John Cardinal O'Connor''
(Scribners). ``It was a very limited view of what was going on. I
regret having published it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a man who knew the military and combat firsthand, who had
published a moral analysis of a war and who had a Ph.D. in
political science, he was primed for an assignment that many say
changed the course of his career. He was chosen by Archbishop
Joseph Bernardin of Cincinnati, later the archbishop of Chicago and
a cardinal, to serve on a five-member committee of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops that was charged with writing a
pastoral letter on peace and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardin, a master at forging consensus, knew the importance of
including a full range of views on the committee. From the start,
and through all three publicly debated drafts of the letter,
O'Connor was regarded as the conservative, pro-military voice, the
counterweight to another auxiliary bishop on the committee, the
pacifist Bishop Thomas Gumbleton of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was billed as the Genghis Khan of the committee,'' O'Connor
later told Hentoff. Certainly, he was a conduit to the Reagan
administration and the Pentagon, consulting with them privately,
although with the committee's knowledge, and bringing their views
back to the committee. He fought vigorously for wording in the
pastoral letter that would keep the bishops from condemning nuclear
deterrence altogether, or being identified with advocates of a
nuclear freeze, who were opposed to the placement of new
medium-range missiles in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, when other committee members urged a ``halt''
to new nuclear weapons, he argued for the word ``curb.''
</P>
<P>
   On several points, including ``curb,'' he lost, but in the end,
the former Navy chaplain voted with his colleagues for approval of
a document that rejected almost all possible uses of nuclear
weapons and that condoned possession of them as a deterrent only if
linked to serious steps toward disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican was intensely interested in the American letter,
indeed wary of it, and so were the Catholic hierarchies of France
and West Germany. On one trip to Rome, Auxiliary Bishop O'Connor
had discussed the project with Pope John Paul II and Cardinal
Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state. The impression
he made probably explains why, almost simultaneously with the
completion of the letter, he was named bishop of Scranton, Pa., by
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Church watchers wondered whether his appointment to a relatively
minor diocese was a form of ecclesiastical exile or the first step
to bigger things. The question was answered with surprising
rapidity. On Jan. 31, 1984, after only eight months in Scranton and
four months after Cooke's death, he was named the eighth archbishop
of New York. His name had not even been mentioned in the
speculation about who would fill the post.
</P>
<P>
   As is the practice, recommendations from other American bishops
had been submitted to the pope by the papal representative in the
United States, at that time Archbishop Pio Laghi. O'Connor, who had
energetically thrown himself into the Scranton job, was taken aback
by his selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Scranton, I hoped I would die there,'' he said
soon afterward, pausing for effect and then adding, ``I came to New
York knowing I would die here.''
</P>
<P>
   A Priest, Yes, But Not a Simple One
</P>
<P>
   Because his predecessor, Cooke, had typically described himself
as a simple parish priest, a New York reporter asked the newly
arrived archbishop, ``Are you a simple parish priest?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a priest,'' came the reply. ``How simple I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not simple at all, although the complexity of his
personality was often reduced by the news media to two O'Connors.
There was the smiling, quipping Cardinal O'Connor, a dignitary with
the touch of the common man, waving and shaking hands and reviewing
parades from the steps of the cathedral. And there was the stern
O'Connor, asserting old or unpopular doctrines from the pulpit and
warning those who disagreed that they were in for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Facets of his personality that did not fit into these
stereotypes were often overlooked or played down. He was usually
soft-spoken, not at all a pulpit thunderer. He had many of the
reflective traits of an intellectual who could, in his slow,
ruminating answers to questions, do equal justice to the contending
sides of a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is surely one of the two or three smartest graduate
students I ever had,'' said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former
ambassador to the United Nations, who taught O'Connor when he was a
Navy chaplain studying for a Ph.D. at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the cardinal, mulling over the many sides of a question
was not incompatible with making spontaneous comments and
on-the-spot decisions, so that it sometimes appeared as though a
fine balance could be tipped by the latest opinion, a chance
encounter or a sudden inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Priests of the archdiocese were divided about how much thought
went into some of his statements and appointments. Many joked that
their leader's motto was, ``Ready, Fire, Aim!'' But they were also
deeply appreciative of his willingness to give them time and
attention to supply his counsel or discuss their futures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For O'Connor, doubt and misgivings stopped short when it came to
defending basic Catholic teachings, the decisions of the pope or
what he considered the survival and integrity of church agencies.
The combativeness with which he delivered these expressions of duty
made him one of the most fiercely denounced public figures in New
York, if not the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem once paired him with AIDS as the two worst things
about New York. Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free
Choice, an organization that supports legalized abortion, called
him ``the kind of man who, if the church still had the power to
burn people at the stake, would be right there lighting a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor did not respond to his critics, and his own readiness
to confess personal shortcomings and errors offered a disarming
contrast, although his critics saw that, too, as calculating. The
cardinal's teasing, bantering style of humor could occasionally
have a sharp, even mordant, edge, even if the barbs were directed
toward himself.
</P>
<P>
   Both his confessions of failure and his self-deprecating humor
were part of his way of framing issues in personal terms, a trait
that also marked his writing and preaching. Once, when he spoke to
New York priests about the archdiocese's financial problems, he
dwelt on his own sleepless nights worrying about how the church
could meet its responsibilities and pay its bills. Some priests
left the meeting reassured to learn that he was worrying over the
problems. But others reported frustration at not being given
specific facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regularly go down to the crypt under St. Patrick's
Cathedral, and I look at the tombs of my predecessors,'' the
cardinal wrote in one of his typically personal meditations in his
weekly column. ``Right in the center is the next marble block with
no inscription. That's reserved for me. And all that's important
when I move into that crypt is that I have served New York as a
good priest.''

LEAFS EVEN SERIES WITH DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just when it appeared that the New
Jersey Devils and the Toronto Maple Leafs were headed for overtime,
Tomas Kaberle of Toronto found himself alone with the puck outside
the left circle in the Devils' zone. With a crowd in front of
Martin Brodeur, Kaberle puckered the net on a left-handed shot with
1 minute 35 seconds left in the third period _ his first goal of
the postseason _ to give the Maple Leafs a 3-2 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's victory evened the Eastern Conference semifinal series
at two games apiece. Game 5 of the best-of-7 series will be played
in Toronto on Saturday, then the series will return to Continental
Arena Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 2-1 since the first period, the Devils tied the
game on Claude Lemieux's first goal in the playoffs with 5:46 left
in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gomez scored the first goal in the game for the Devils
against Curtis Joseph, who had 34 saves. The Maple Leafs took the
lead on first-period goals by Jonas Hoglund and Darcy Tucker
against Brodeur, who made 19 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's top line finally produced its first points in the
series, combining for Toronto's first goal in the game and the
first in the opening period in 10 games in the playoffs for the
Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas won a battle against the boards in the neutral zone
and passed the puck to Mats Sundin. The center man relayed the puck
to Hoglund, who beat Brodeur between the pads from the bottom of
the right circle, 10 minutes 1 second into the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second goal in the playoffs for Hoglund and it tied
the score after Gomez had put the Devils in the lead with his third
goal in the playoffs and second in as many games, at 1:41.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, on a power play, came on a rebound from close range on
the left after a shot by Lemieux from the right circle was put
there by Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who was in the penalty box when Gomez opened the
scoring, gave the Maple Leafs the lead with 3:58 left in the first,
lofting a backhander over the fallen Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   With a little luck from the post, Brodeur made perhaps the best
save in the series in the 11th minute. With his teammates out of
position in their zone, Brodeur sprawled across his crease to his
right to stop Sergei Berezin after a setup by Hoglund. He reached
behind him to cover the puck with his glove after it had hit the
post, but he did it while on the seat of his pants to a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto had the better chances during the second period. Players
were crashing each other against the boards, but no goals came
despite three manpower advantages in the period, two by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had a man advantage in the 11th minute but it seemed
they should have had a two-man edge because Joseph got away with a
slash on Jason Arnott. Only Sundin was sent to the penalty box, for
holding. The Devils failed on that advantage and also when Wendel
Clark was caught high-sticking Ken Daneyko in the 16th minute. &QL;

PROCESS OF CHOOSING ARCHBISHOP'S SUCCESSOR IS SHROUDED IN SECRECY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CARDINAL-OCONNOR-OBIT) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The death of Cardinal John O'Connor on Wednesday
night brings new urgency to the question of who might succeed him
as New York's ninth archbishop and the spiritual leader of of 2.4
million Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The question may be an obvious one for anyone wishing to look
ahead to the future of the archdiocese, whose leader plays a
pre-eminent role in the Catholic Church in America. But the answer,
for now, is deeply obscure.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the appointment of an archbishop is not an open
process. Instead, it is a matter that rests in the hands of the
Vatican, and is shrouded in such secrecy that the appointments to
head some of the most important archdioceses in the United States
have often come as a surprise to those within the church who
thought they were in the know.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the appointment process begins in
Washington and moves to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the papal nuncio, a prelate appointed by the
Vatican who functions as its ambassador to the federal government
and also as Rome's representative to the American church, comes up
with a short list of possible candidates when an archdiocese or
diocese becomes vacant, or is about to become so.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the nuncio in Washington has been Archbishop Gabriel
Montalvo, 70, a native of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He draws up a list of three names,'' said the Rev. Thomas
Reese, editor of America magazine, a Jesuit publication, and author
of ``Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure of the American
Catholic Church,'' (Harper &AMP; Row, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Those choices, Reese added, are based on the nuncio's research,
with information obtained through conversations with other American
cardinals, bishops and prominent Catholics. The discussions are
conducted in the strictest secrecy and those consulted promise they
will not even mention that they have been approached.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is any guide, a few details can be hazarded
about the candidates likely to be recommended for a major
archdiocese like New York _ whose occupant can expect to be named a
cardinal, with the right to vote in the selection of a future pope.
</P>
<P>
   Because of New York's importance in the American Catholic world,
anyone considered is likely to have experience as head of another
archdiocese or a diocese. He is also likely to be a senior figure
in the church, in his late 50s or 60s. He may have studied or
worked in church institutions in Rome. And he may have a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   The nuncio ranks his three candidates, then forwards the
recommendations to Rome, to be considered by the Congregation for
Bishops, the Vatican body charged with making the final
recommendations of men to head dioceses worldwide. The congregation
is composed of ``mostly cardinals, some of whom are resident in
Rome, and some are diocesan bishops around the world,'' said the
Rev. John Beal, a professor of canon law at Catholic University of
America. ``For example,'' he added, ``Cardinal O'Connor for a very
long time was a member of the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   After its deliberations, the congregation sends its selection to
the pope, who may accept it or reject it, asking the congregation
to go back over the list. Or, Beal said, the pope may choose
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Even before O'Connor underwent surgery for removal of a brain
tumor, there had been speculation throughout church circles over
who his successor might be. Names mentioned have ranged fairly
widely, from Northeastern prelates, like Bishop Henry J. Mansell of
Buffalo, to others outside the region, like Archbishop Justin F.
Rigali of St. Louis, who long worked in Vatican diplomatic circles
and is considered close to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, choosing a person for New York is a matter that
rests with the pope alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't underestimate the possibility of surprise,'' Beal said.
``I recall that no one had predicted that Cardinal O'Connor would
go from Scranton to New York when it happened.''

 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York
City's 2.37 million Catholics and the Vatican's most forceful
spokesman in the United States, died Wednesday night at his
residence around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor died of cardiopulmonary arrest, said his spokesman,
Joseph Zwilling. But he added that the cardinal's death was ``the
result of the tumor and the cancer that he was suffering from.''
Last August, O'Connor had a tumor removed from the surface of his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's failing health diminished his public appearances
in recent months but did not diminish his stature as one of its
most powerful symbols on moral and political issues. When Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, seeking the Republican nomination for
president, expressed regret on Feb. 27 for not speaking out against
racial and anti-Catholic intolerance during a campaign visit to Bob
Jones University in South Carolina, he did so in the form of a
letter to O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the cardinal's grave condition spurred speculation over
his possible successor. This week, the name of Bishop Edward
Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., flew to the top of a list of
candidates that has included William F. Murphy, an auxiliary bishop
of Boston; Edwin O'Brien, who heads the archdiocese for the
military services; Henry J. Mansell, the bishop of Buffalo, N.Y.;
and Justin F. Rigali, the archbishop of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of an archbishop, however, is a secret process
that rests in the hands of the Vatican, and appointments often come
as a surprise to those in the church who thought they were in the
know. Indeed, when O'Connor was named archbishop in January, 1984,
his name had not even been mentioned in the speculation about who
would fill the post.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor was passionately outspoken in his opposition to
abortion, the issue that shaped his tenure from the start. He was
unconditional in upholding official Catholic teachings on topics
like homosexuality and the ordination of women. And he was
unwavering in his loyalty to Pope John Paul, who had named him
archbishop of New York as part of an effort to restore greater
doctrinal and organizational discipline in a church still feeling
the reverberations of reforms undertaken by the Second Vatican
Council 20 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   All this gave the cardinal the profile of a zealous
conservative, but he was also a passionate defender of organized
labor, an advocate for the poor and the homeless, a vocal assailant
of racism and anti-Semitism, and an opponent of capital punishment.
And although he had spent 27 years as a Navy chaplain and retired
with the rank of rear admiral, in the 1980s he condemned American
support of counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central
America, questioned the need for spending on new weapons systems,
and, to the end, remained a cautionary voice about American
military actions overseas.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's outspokenness caused waves even before he arrived in
New York. He had upset many Jews in New York by declaring that
widespread abortion in the United States was ``precisely the same''
as the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At a televised news conference a few months later, he said, ``I
do not see how a Catholic in good conscience'' could vote for a
political candidate favoring abortion, and, then, when asked
whether he might excommunicate Gov. Mario Cuomo for his support of
abortion rights, the new archbishop refused to rule it out, setting
off an intermittent feud with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year as archbishop, Geraldine Ferraro, a Catholic
who supported abortion rights, was nominated by the Democrats to
run for vice president on a ticket headed by Walter Mondale. When
she was a congresswoman from Queens, Ferraro, along with several
other Catholic public officials, had signed a letter saying that
there was ``a diversity of Catholic opinion'' about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After the letter was released during the presidential campaign,
O'Connor assailed the candidate, saying, ``Geraldine Ferraro has
misrepresented Catholic teaching on abortion.'' He went on to say
that there was no diversity of Catholic opinion, only the opinion
of the church that abortion was wrong under all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This set off countercharges that O'Connor was signaling church
support for the 1984 re-election of President Reagan, whom he had
praised earlier as ``a friend of the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the archbishop tangled with the city government over
access to contraceptive information and abortion in the church's
child care agencies. He also challenged Mayor Ed Koch's executive
order barring discrimination against gays by any employer,
including the church, that had contracts with the city. When a
court struck down the mayor's executive order, the archbishop was
equally opposed to a similar City Council bill on gay rights, which
passed, even though it contained an exemption for religious
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Catholics were delighted to have such a fresh
champion in town, but many others, inside and outside the church,
were similarly fascinated. For the cardinal's proclivity for
confrontation seemed part of a larger spontaneity and directness
that seemed right at home in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   At his installation in St. Patrick's Cathedral on March 18,
1984, the new archbishop put on a Mets cap, placed his own bishop's
miter on the head of a 10-year-old altar boy from the Bronx who was
also named John J. O'Connor, and mimicked Koch's regular query,
``How'm I doing?''
</P>
<P>
   He may have been the only major religious leader to hold a
regular press conference every Sunday, after he had celebrated
10:15 Mass at the cathedral. And in his early years, he was usually
ready with a curbside quip.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters monitored his Sunday sermons and his weekly columns in
the archdiocesan newspaper, and pumped him at his news conferences,
hoping for a tabloid headline for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he expressed misgivings about the manner of his
debut in New York and his high visibility. ``Time after time I have
to ask myself if the church would be better off _ certainly, I
would be better off _ if when I came here I had just become a
silent servant of the people,'' he said in 1993 in an interview
with The New York Times. He wondered whether he might have thrust
himself too much into politics, or whether a quieter style may not
have been better.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, he mused, ``If you're false to your own
temperament, you're not going to be an effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   At times he did try to be more conciliatory. He dropped the
Holocaust analogy in his preaching against abortion, and some
Jewish leaders came to see him as an opponent of anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Connor also became close friends with Koch, and the two of
them collaborated on a book, ``His Eminence and Hizzoner'' (William
Morrow &AMP; Co., 1989), regularly dined together and gave each other
moral support during their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Joseph O'Connor was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 20, 1920,
the fourth of five children of Thomas and Dorothy O'Connor. His
father was a skilled interior painter, a specialist in applying
gold leaf to the ornamental ceilings of auditoriums and churches.
His mother suffered blindness for a year and attributed her
recovery of sight in one eye to the intervention of St. Rita of
Cascia.
</P>
<P>
   In many interviews and columns he wrote for Catholic New York,
the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, O'Connor often recalled his
early upbringing: the warmth and seriousness of family prayers and
religious observances; the forceful views of his father, ``a union
man,'' on the rights of labor; the need for frugality during the
hard Depression years. His working-class roots, he said, left him
always a bit uncomfortable in the formal surroundings of the
archbishop's residence.
</P>
<P>
   He attended both public and Catholic grade schools in
Philadelphia before entering West Catholic High School for Boys,
which was run by the order of Christian Brothers, who encouraged
him to pursue a calling to the priesthood. He was ordained a priest
on Dec. 15, 1945, a month before his 26th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, he was an assistant pastor in a Philadelphia
parish. He taught in Catholic high schools as well as a night
school for adults, conducted two weekly radio programs on local
stations, worked in hospital psychiatric wards and developed
special programs to instruct retarded children. His work with
retarded children remained a lifelong passion. As a young priest,
he thought it might be his chief occupation until he answered a
plea for chaplains to serve in the armed forces during the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year stint turned into a 27-year career, during which he
traveled the world celebrating Mass in foxholes and on aircraft
carriers. He served under fire with the Marines in Vietnam, became
senior chaplain at the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and, in 1975,
was appointed chief of Navy chaplains with the rank of rear
admiral. During his military career, he also found time to earn a
master's degree in clinical psychology at the Catholic University
of America and a doctorate in political science at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is surely one of the two or three smartest graduate
students I ever had,'' said Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former
ambassador to the United Nations, who taught him at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting to retire to parish life in 1979, he instead was made
an auxiliary bishop assigned to the military vicariate, the church
unit serving the armed forces. The vicariate was administered by
the archbishop of New York until 1985, when it became independent.
Bishop O'Connor was still supervising chaplains, although now from
a post in the Catholic hierarchy rather than from one in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Military matters were fated to play a central role in O'Connor's
life. In 1968 he published ``A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam'' (World
Publishing Co.), a book that argued that the American intervention
there was morally and legally justified. ``I am convinced that the
administration has opted to accept the tragedy of war as the only
available road to meaningful peace,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bad book, you know,'' he later told Nat Hentoff, who
was interviewing him for a profile in The New Yorker that was later
expanded into the 1988 biography ``John Cardinal O'Connor''
(Scribners). ``It was a very limited view of what was going on. I
regret having published it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, church watchers wondered whether O'Connor's appointment
to bishop in Scranton, Pa., a relatively minor diocese, was a form
of ecclesiastical exile or the first step to bigger things. The
question was answered with surprising rapidity. On Jan. 31, 1984,
after only eight months in Scranton, he was named the eighth
archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who had energetically thrown himself into the Scranton
job, was taken aback by his selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Scranton, I hoped I would die there,'' he said
soon afterward, pausing for effect and then adding, ``I came to New
York knowing I would die here.''

FISH WILL BE PLENTIFUL THIS SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif _ Twenty-three years ago, Gary Jones left
his job as an engineer in Orange County for a tiny, Crystaline
mountain lake. Regular gas costs $2.09 a gallon nearby, but the
Alpine views are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to grow up with my children'' says Jones, operator of
Silver Lake Resort along the June Lake Loop here in the Eastern
Sierra. ``Never looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Sierra has that kind of power over people, yet most
of the anglers who fished Saturday's opener of the trout season _ a
grand tradition for folks from Southern California since the early
part of the last century _ won't be back until the 2001 opener.
</P>
<P>
   The common perception among those anglers is that there just
aren't as many fish.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Milliron is working to change that. Actually, he's
already changed the fact; it's the misperception he's out to fix.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 10 years, Milliron has been the Department of Fish
and Game's biologist in charge of Crowley Lake. He's also at the
forefront of a relatively new fisheries management philosophy
nationwide, and Crowley has been his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an excellent data set,'' Milliron says. ``I know
exactly what wild trout do. I know exactly what hatchery-raised
trout do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've managed it so well that if a guy doesn't get a hook-up
every five minutes now, they think there has to be something
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Anglers caught anywhere between 15 and 25 percent of the year's
harvest of trout last weekend, but thanks to the DFG's strategy of
focusing on three different species of trout, the lake, as well as
other Eastern Sierra waterways, are generally expected to provide
excellent trout fishing for the next few weeks. A dip is
anticipated over Memorial Day weekend before increasing in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a good population of fish, we are not going to
deplete the lake like we used to,'' Milliron said. ``A lot of fish
that were raised in Crowley, fish that are now off in the
tributaries, they will be coming back after they recover from the
rigors of spawning.''
</P>
<P>
   While many anglers caught easy limits on Saturday, the day did
not go well for those positioned in the wrong spots; this year's
opener was more of an either/or event.
</P>
<P>
   While many were expecting the best opener in 20 years, Milliron
foresaw the possibility of an opener that wouldn't be as strong for
all anglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' he said Friday night, ``that only means
stronger fishing for the rest of the season. I know I put more than
a half-million fish in that lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Haynie, the region's hatchery manager, said the thinking
among DFG biologists has changed significantly over the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opener was a big, big event with hoopla. We keyed what we
did to that,'' Haynie said. ``Now, we're more concerned with
creating season-long angling. In fact, some of the best fishing now
is during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Crowley Lake, Bridgeport Reservoir and Pleasant
Valley Reservoir should be excellent fisheries throughout the
season, Haynie said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mather, who operates a service station in Independence, said
locals know not to even bother on opening weekend. There are plenty
of fish after everyone goes back to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the people, and you don't have the rat race,''
Mather said.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers will find their best stream fishing post-opener at
higher elevations, according to professional guide Tom Loe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get people who tell me they want to fish the
(lower-elevation) Owens River in July,'' Loe said. ``I tell them to
forget fishing and bring their swimsuit instead because that's the
only action you'll have.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he agrees with the DFG on which lakes to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crowley is one of the few viable, reproducing fisheries,'' he
said. ``I've taken clients out in the summer and caught 40 fish in
a day and each one is at least 16 inches long.''
</P>
<P>
   The very best place to fish post-opener is in the back country.
By early summer, every lake will be open and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back country,'' said Milliron, ``is so underutilized that
fishing will be excellent there no matter when you go.'' &QL;

TIME WARNER FACES A FINE BY FCC UNIT
</HEADLINE>
  By By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cable bureau of the Federal Communications Commission blamed
Time Warner Cable Wednesday for cutting off ABC television stations
to 3.5 million subscribers, declaring that Time Warner's action had
violated a federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC said it would separately consider what enforcement
action to take, but a spokesman for the agency said Time Warner was
likely to face a fine.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, an FCC official said, will be based on a charge of at
least $7,500 per violation per day in the areas that were blacked
out. Because seven areas lost access to ABC stations, Time Warner
could be liable for seven violations but in any event the amount of
the fine will not exceed $250,000, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the FCC chairman, William E. Kennard, said:
``Time Warner Cable committed a clear violation of FCC rules.
Unfortunately millions of consumers paid the price.'' He added,
``No company should use consumers in a private contract dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   The violation occurred, the FCC said, because Time Warner pulled
ABC stations off its cable systems in the middle of a ratings
sweeps month.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, after a protracted impasse in negotiations with The
Walt Disney Co., the parent of ABC, stopped sending ABC-owned
stations to areas around the country, including New York, Los
Angeles and Houston, on Monday. The two sides agreed Tuesday to an
extended deadline in their talks and ABC's signals were restored.
</P>
<P>
   The general counsel for Time Warner Cable, Marc Apfelbaum, said
in response to the FCC announcement that the company would ``pursue
a further review'' of the decision. In a statement, he questioned
why only the cable bureau and not the entire commission made the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we agree this ambiguous rule needs clarification,''
Apfelbaum said, referring to the sweeps month rule, ``it is
unfortunate that on an important issue affecting the entire cable
industry, and where there was no emergency, that this was done
without the full commission being involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives applauded the decision. Michael Eisner, the
Disney chairman, said during a conference call with securities
analysts that Time Warner had damaged Disney's brand name and
reputation by treating ABC shabbily.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the New York City
Council, met with Barry Rosenblum, the president of Time Warner
Cable, in New York and contended that Time Warner had violated its
franchise agreement with the city. Vallone said he believed the
company had an obligation to reimburse customers for part of their
cable bill this month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, said the
company was not ready to announce a rebate but said, ``Our
intention is to go further than that.''

AGCO CORP. TO CLOSE PLANT, LAY OFF 500 EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ Agco Corp., citing the weak farm economy,
said Wednesday it will close its Independence combine and tractor
plant at the end of June and lay off 500 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Duluth, Ga., company said the industrywide slump in the
demand for agricultural equipment led to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence plant has experienced seasonal layoffs through
the years. Nevertheless, Wednesday's announcement surprised the
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a shock,'' said Jerry Johnson, sub-director of
District 11 of the United Steelworkers of America union in
Independence. ``It would've been less surprising three years ago
when the industry was at an all-time low. But production picked
back up after that, although things have slowed down in the past
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant has manufactured the ``Gleaner'' line of combines as
well as tractors under the ``White'' and ``AGCO Allis'' names.
Formerly operated by Deutz-Allis Corp., the plant was part of a
management buyout in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Agco said the products made in Independence will be moved to its
facility in Hesston, Kan., or handled by third-party manufacturers.
Although the company said there could be opportunities for some
employees to transfer, Johnson said such prospects seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on a severance package that addresses issues like
health insurance, pensions and job-placement assistance will begin
in mid-May, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Agco has about 320 hourly union employees and about 180 salaried
employees, said Lorna Robinson, an Agco spokeswoman. The company
declined to disclose the plant's annual payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Ratliff, Agco's executive chairman, said a globalwide
decline in demand for farm equipment has led to underutilized
plants in Agco's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize this decision will impact hundreds of dedicated
employees that have contributed to the growth of Agco and have not
entered into it without consideration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agco already consolidated production from a plant in Ohio to
Hesston, Robinson said. Products made at an Agco plant in Lockney,
Texas, also are in the process of moving to Hesston, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the Independence shutdown eventually will save
the company $10 million annually. The company will take a $20
million charge this year to close the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Agco said production will stop June 30 and the plant will be
completely vacated by the end of this year. Agco plans to sell the
524,000 square-foot facility.
</P>
<P>
   Before the farm crisis of the early 1980s, the plant employed as
many as 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Chamber of Commerce is working with Agco and
Missouri Job Service to conduct a job fair for the laid-off Agco
work force, said Rick Hemmingsen, the chamber president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing but not surprising it happened,''
Hemmingsen said. ``We fully realize the global consolidation
happening in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber has many members who already have expressed interest
in taking part in the job fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know these workers are very capable, and hopefully, we'll
be able to help them in the transition,'' Hemmingsen said.
``Depending on skill levels, there are comparable-paying jobs out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But one economist said finding similar-paying work in the
manufacturing sector would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand in the economy is for high-tech, computer-skills
jobs and lower-paying jobs in services and retail,'' said Frank
Lenk, director of research services with the Mid-America Regional
Council. ``Manufacturing employment has been fairly stable over the
last decade. That puts the (Agco employees) in a tough bind.''

DEMOCRATS DROP PLAN TO DELAY IDENTIFYING `SOFT MONEY' DONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats have abandoned a policy of delaying
disclosure of ``soft money'' contributions to fund-raising
committees affiliated with Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan and other
candidates for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee came under fire
last week for deciding to withhold the names of contributors to
committees such as Missouri 2000, which was set up in conjunction
with Carnahan's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Under that policy, $117,000 in donations to Missouri 2000 would
not be reported until the money was transferred to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, rather than monthly, as was done
previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided to return to our previous policy to disclose
and itemize contributions on a monthly basis,'' Jim Jordan,
political director of the senatorial committee, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said the initial change was made for bookkeeping reasons,
but he said Carnahan and other Senate candidates wanted more timely
disclosure of contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been contacted by several of our campaign committees
who feel rather strongly we should be disclosing this on a regular,
predictable and frequent basis,'' Jordan said. Carnahan campaign
spokesman Tony Wyche said the governor had asked for the change.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the $117,000 in soft money to Missouri 2000, who
donated the money in March, will be disclosed May 20 along with
April contributions, Jordan said. In subsequent months, donors will
be disclosed on the 20th day of the following month.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money represents unlimited and corporate contributions that
individual candidates are not allowed to accept. Instead, it goes
to parties' national committees for various spending that advances
their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Most campaign reports by law must be filed quarterly, but Jordan
said last week that Democrats had found a legal exception for soft
money donations to so-called joint committees, such as Missouri
2000. Lawyers thought that names of contributors could be kept
under wraps indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said ``the carping of Republicans'' and others had
nothing to do with the change in policy, which affects not only the
Carnahan committee but also the committees of Hillary Rodham
Clinton and several other Democratic Senate candidates.

STUDENTS PLEAD FOR MONEY TO SAVE MILITARY ACADEMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOONVILLE, Mo. _ Cally White, Patrick Griffin, Jerra Rhea and
Nikki Marino, teen-agers from across the country, shared a dislike
for Kemper Military School when they first arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Too much structure. Too much discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Now the students share the opposite feeling _ adoration _ for
this 156-year-old school where they live together, study together
and grow up together.
</P>
<P>
   This campus of old, red-brick buildings in the middle of
Missouri is their second home _ a home they don't want to say
goodbye to if the school must close.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said it is highly likely Kemper Military School
and College will shut down May 13, the day money will run out to
keep the school going.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Col. Tom Challender, the school's director of alumni
affairs, said there still is hope that alumni and friends of the
school will come to the aid of this institution that has been
educating teen-agers since 1844.
</P>
<P>
   Challender's office phone rang continuously Wednesday after
people learned of the likely closing, with many graduates offering
thousands of dollars in donations.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1.3 million needed to keep the school open will be hard
to find.
</P>
<P>
   School president Edward E. Ridgley announced the likely closing
on the school's Web site Tuesday. He would not comment Wednesday on
the school's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   The students are trying to get financial help for Kemper
Military, where middle school, high school and junior college
students learn academic subjects as well as the traditions of the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
   In handwritten letter after handwritten letter, the students
this week have begged alumni for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day after day I look at Kemper as my savior,'' one student
wrote. ``From this school I have learned purpose. I have gained
some encouragement back into my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another wrote: ``This place has straightened me out &AMP; gave me
the strength I need to get through life. This is my home. These
people here are my family....This school saved so many kids
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Many cadets said the closeness to other students and teachers is
what makes them glad they attend Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Cally White, a high school junior in a blue cadet uniform, her
brown hair pulled back in a bun, said she has learned honor and
respect in a year at Kemper. She's miles away from her home in New
Hampshire, but she has found love and acceptance here.
</P>
<P>
   She has learned to hold her head up, discipline herself and take
on challenging classes.
</P>
<P>
   White said her parents are in shock about the school's pending
closure, and her father has offered to maker a donation.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't thought yet about where she might go to school in the
fall if the school closes. Finals are next week, and she wants to
stay focused on doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Griffin, a high school senior who came to Kemper from
Washington state two years ago, said he has become a new person.
Griffin said he was a slacker and drug abuser in his public high
school, but now considers himself an achiever and thanks his mom
for sending him to a military boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got people from all around the country and the world,
and we make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Griffin gave a big smile when he said his
parents will come to Missouri for his graduation May 13. His plans
for the fall aren't firm yet, but he eventually wants to go into
the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper's closing saddens Samuel Mackey, a 19-year-old from
Kansas City who is a first-year student in the junior college.
</P>
<P>
   He pays Kemper's annual $18,000 tuition with an ROTC
scholarship, after he participated in Junior ROTC at Westport High
School.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kemper is a lot safer than Westport was, without the
fights and the drugs he said were common there. When he first
arrived, he couldn't believe all the rules, the push-ups and the
sit-ups, and the insistence on respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Whoa, what have I gotten myself into?' '' he said.
But since then, he's enjoyed his schoolwork and ROTC.
</P>
<P>
   If Kemper closes, he hopes to take his ROTC scholarship to the
University of Missouri-Columbia, where he had planned to go for his
third and fourth years of college.
</P>
<P>
   But until school officials announce their final decision on
whether to close the school, Mackey said he and his brother and
sister cadets are ``just floating up in the air.''

FEDERAL JURY RECOMMENDS DEATH PENALTY IN MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the first time in 44 years, a federal
jury in Kansas City has recommended the death penalty in a murder
case.
</P>
<P>
   After five hours of deliberation over two days, jurors on
Wednesday told U.S. District Judge Gary Fenner that German C.
Sinisterra, 35, should die by lethal injection for his role as
trigger man in the 1998 murder of drug dealer Julian Colon.
</P>
<P>
   Death sentences are automatically appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be commended for the courage of your verdicts,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Valenti told jurors. ``It's time to
finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury returned to court after lunch to begin hearing penalty
arguments against Arboleda A. Ortiz, Sinisterra's co-defendant.
Ortiz, 33, and another co-defendant, Plutarco Tello, 34, also could
face a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing closing arguments in Ortiz's case, the jury
adjourned at about 4 p.m. It is scheduled to return Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Should the jury not reach a unanimous verdict for capital
punishment, Ortiz and Tello would automatically be sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's sentence, which Fenner must impose, is the first
federal death-sentence handed down in the Western District of
Missouri since Jan. 25, 1956. That year, a jury needed only 15
minutes to recommend that California robber and arsonist Arthur
Ross Brown be executed for the abduction and slaying of Wilma Allen
from a Brookside shopping area.
</P>
<P>
   Ross died in Missouri's gas chamber on Feb. 24, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, a federal jury recommended death sentences for Carl
Austin Hall and Bonnie Brown Heady for the kidnapping and murder of
6-year-old Bobby Greenlease.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Heady were executed for the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   One other capital murder case currently rests on the federal
docket in Kansas City. If convicted of the abduction, sexual abuse
and killing last fall of 10-year-old Pamela Butler, Keith Nelson
also could face the death penalty. His trial is scheduled to begin
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the jury convicted Sinisterra, Ortiz and Tello of
murdering Colon in a Prospect Avenue house after accusing him and
another man of stealing $240,000 in drug-trafficking profits.
</P>
<P>
   Colon, 23, and his nephew, Herberth Andres Borja-Molina, 17,
were bound with duct tape, taunted and beaten. But while Colon was
killed with a gunshot to the head, a similar shot meant for
Borja-Molina failed to find its mark and he feigned death.
</P>
<P>
   They were dumped in the trunk of a car, which was left in Swope
Park. Borja-Molina escaped and returned to testify against his
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors described Sinisterra, Ortiz and Tello as a
professional hit squad, sent from Houston to enforce discipline in
Kansas City after the cocaine profits went astray.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers portrayed their clients as low-level drug ring
functionaries who had agreed to intimidate Colon and Borja-Molina,
but not kill them. They said a fourth co-defendant in the case,
Edwin R. Hinestroza, ultimately was responsible for the killings.
Hinestroza has not been arrested. He remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury returned the death sentence against Sinisterra, a
Colombian national, lawyers representing Ortiz scaled back plans to
present testimony from friends and family members. Larry Pace, an
assistant federal public defender, said jurors appeared unmoved by
similar testimony offered on Sinisterra's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Pace focused on the night of Nov. 28, 1998, and emphasized that
Colon was killed on the first floor of the house, while Ortiz was
dealing with Borja-Molina in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arboleda Ortiz doesn't deserve to die because he didn't kill
anybody,'' Pace said. ``If you are going to have a death penalty,
it should be reserved for people who intentionally kill other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pace also assailed prosecutors for using testimony from
Borja-Molina, who acknowledged his role in Hinestroza's drug
business, but faced no charges from prosecutors in return for his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Miller said that's a deal he'd
gladly make again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conspiracies hatched in hell do not have angels as
witnesses,'' Miller said.

MRS. CLINTON CALLS ON GIULIANI TO REJECT INDEPENDENCE PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT EDWARD, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani Wednesday to reject the nomination of the
Independence Party if the organization nominates Pat Buchanan to
run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again attacked Buchanan for making what she described as
bigoted and anti-Semitic statements. The first lady, without
mentioning Giuliani by name, said that her Republican opponent in
the race should decline to run on the Independence Party line if
Buchanan is at the top of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not run on a ballot with him,'' Clinton said at a news
conference here as she traveled through the Adirondacks. ``And I
think that is the position that anyone who wants to represent all
of New York and all New Yorkers should be taking.''
</P>

   Giuliani has repeatedly attacked Buchanan, though he stopped
short, on an appearance Wednesday night on MSNBC, of saying he
would not accept the support of the Independence Party if it
endorsed Buchanan as its presidential candidate. Giuliani's aides
have been pushing to win the Independence Party endorsement, in the
belief that it could provide Giuliani an important source of votes
in what is expected to be a close election. The Independence Party
is the New York arm of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could do that, but I'm hoping they don't do
that,'' Giuliani said at the prospect of running on the same ticket
as Buchanan. ``I'm hoping they make some other choice. I think it's
a very important party; the Independence Party is a very important
party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they ended up doing that,'' Giuliani added, ``then I'd have
to think long and hard about it. I probably wouldn't want to be on
that ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton eagerly attacked Buchanan, the conservative commentator,
at her news conference Wednesday after he attacked her on Tuesday,
while praising Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made her comments at the start of a two-day sweep into
the Adirondacks and the Republican heart of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who moved to New York in January, sounded almost like a
tourist promoter as she recounted her travels through the state,
learning about local issues and history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am finding that as I talk about it, more New Yorkers are
saying, `I didn't know that; I had no idea that was going on in the
north country or western New York,''' she said. ``I am hoping not
only will I have a very firm grounding in what goes on all over the
state but that more New Yorkers will learn about the history.''

   BUSH SEEKS HELP: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out
Wednesday for an experienced Republican hand, Andrew H. Card Jr.,
to watch over Bush's interests at this summer's national convention
in Philadelphia. Card, vice president for governmental relations
for the General Motors Corp., worked in the White House under
President George Bush as deputy chief of staff and later was
transportation secretary. He is the second member of the elder
Bush's cabinet to join the governor's political organization in
recent weeks. The first was Dick Cheney, President Bush's defense
secretary, who was chosen to run the governor's vice presidential
search committee.

   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION RIGHTS ALERT: The National Abortion Rights and
Reproductive Action League is promoting Vice President Al Gore with
a television ad warning that if Governor Bush is elected President,
he will appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn Roe vs.
Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. The ads also warn that
Bush ``even supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw
abortion.'' Bush is on record as saying that he will appoint
justices who will ``strictly interpret'' the Constitution. Kate
Michelman, president of the league, says the right to a legal
abortion is in danger because two or more supporters may leave the
court in the next administration.

U.S. READY TO REMOVE VIEQUES PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS with JON NORDHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backed by three warships reported to be carrying
hundreds of marines, the Justice Department is ready to sweep into
the Puerto Rican island of Vieques and remove demonstrators who
oppose U.S. military training there. Senior administration
officials said Wednesday that the action could come as early as
dawn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 500 federal marshals and FBI agents are expected to
take part in the move to dislodge the protesters, who have managed
to halt the Navy's use of the eastern end of the 52-square-mile
island for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The officials cautioned that the exercise, which has been
expected for several days, could be called off at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters began settling into the Camp Garcia Army Range
last year after Navy bombers accidentally killed an island
resident, David Sanes Rodriguez, a guard. The site has since become
a rallying point for opponents of the vast U.S. military presence
in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have frustrated Pentagon officials who insist that
the 60-year-old firing range provides an irreplaceable training
site, allowing for simultaneous exercises involving planes, ships
and amphibious craft. The scenic island, which has rich coral
reefs, is littered with unexploded ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Jan. 31 agreement between President Clinton and Puerto
Rican officials, the Navy agreed to conduct bombing practice with
dummy shells. The deal, which was to secure the Navy's use of the
island until 2003, guaranteed $40 million in federal aid for the
9,400 islanders who live near the target range.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy promised, moreover, to clean up hundreds of tons of
munitions from the western third of the island and hand it back to
Puerto Rican control later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, aligned herself with
critics of the accord Wednesday, asserting that ``a small,
inhabited island should not be used for target practice.'' Mrs.
Clinton, a candidate for the Senate in New York, a state with a
large Puerto Rican population, said, ``I urge the Pentagon to
negotiate a peaceful resolution to this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Nydia M. Velazquez, D-N.Y., and Luis V. Gutierrez, D-Ill.,
went to Vieques to assess the situation and encourage the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, warned that a use of
federal force would not only upset many of Puerto Rico's four
million residents, but also antagonize Puerto Ricans living on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to direct the raid,
marking her second use of federal force in a month in a volatile
situation involving Hispanic groups. Less than two weeks ago, Reno
oversaw the seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy who
had been living with relatives in Miami after his rescue at sea in
November, in a display that many Cuban-Americans and their
political allies denounced as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, anxiety gripped islanders who for days have shared
rumors of ``impending invasion'' by federal forces.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters who have stationed themselves at the main
entrance gate to the firing range seemed split between doubt over a
brewing confrontation and a determination to complete their vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Several voiced hopes that the situation would not erupt in
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Manuela Santiago, the mayor of Vieques, said she and others on
the island feared that some protesters who have come here from the
main island of Puerto Rico might provoke violence.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the site Wednesday was Lolita Lebron, who was convicted
in the attack by Puerto Rican nationalists on Congress in 1954 and
pardoned by President Clinton last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have renounced violence,'' Lebron said, ``but I am still
fighting for the freedom of the Puerto Rican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebron, who is now 80, said, ``I want to be arrested with the
people of Vieques who want to stop the bombing and tell the
American government they have abused this paradise for too many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope the Americans don't keep an old lady like me
waiting too long in this heat.''
