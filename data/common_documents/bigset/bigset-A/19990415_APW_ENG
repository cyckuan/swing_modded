<HEADLINE> County Stadium To Host Last Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Hall of Famer Warren Spahn, who welcomed Brew  
City to the big leagues in 1953 when he started the Milwaukee 
Braves' first game at County Stadium, will be the first to say 
goodbye to the venerable ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miller Park more than half completed and literally on the  
horizon, Spahn will throw out the ceremonial first pitch Friday 
before the Brewers face the Chicago Cubs in their last home opener 
at County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The forecast, which will be rendered moot next year under a  
retractable roof, calls for temperatures in the 30s with snow 
flurries. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody will be happy when the wrecking ball smashes the  
46-year-old stadium that was baseball's masterpiece when it opened, 
luring the Braves from Boston in the game's first franchise 
relocation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will take a piece of my heart with them when they tear  
down this place,'' home run king Hank Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Author Gregg Hoffmann said that as he began writing and  
researching ``Down in the Valley,'' an upcoming book on County 
Stadium, he came to realize that stadiums ``can take on almost 
human qualities. A spirit develops in it. The facility takes on its 
own personality, based in large part on the people and great events 
within it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Like all of us humans, County Stadium has aged,'' Hoffmann  
said. ``It is in the last stage of its life. But, what a life it 
has had. What wonderful memories it has given all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before bolting to Atlanta following the 1965 season, the Braves  
never had a losing season in Milwaukee, and brought the city a 
World Series trophy in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threw the first pitch in the first game, and from that time  
on, it was a love affair between the people of Milwaukee and the 
Braves,'' Spahn said during a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They drew 2 million fans four straight seasons, but they  
abandoned Wisconsin for the South, and in 1970, Bud Selig led a 
group of investors that purchased the Seattle Pilots out of 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	When the announcement was made that baseball was returning to  
Milwaukee, hundreds of fans arrived at the ballpark and sat in the 
stands, looking longingly across the diamond where dreams would be 
born and dashed once more. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee was major league again.  
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers won the AL pennant in 1982 but lost the World Series  
to St. Louis in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Bay Packers split their home games between Lambeau  
Field and County Stadium until 1994, when quarterback Brett Favre 
bid farewell to Milwaukee with a last-second touchdown that lifted 
the Packers over the Falcons. Take that, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brewers fans have had little to cheer about lately as the  
gap widened between the game's haves and have-nots. They nearly 
lost the team until a last-minute vote in the Wisconsin Legislature 
assured financing for the new stadium in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	There were historic times: Paul Molitor's 39-game hitting  
streak, Robin Yount's 3,000th hit, heck, even Nolan Ryan's 300th 
win and Mark McGwire's and Sammy Sosa's home runs in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And there were the wild and wacky times, like Tony Phillips  
asking to be taken out of a game so he could meet a heckler behind 
the stands and beat him up, or the 1997 opener, when thousands of 
giveaway baseballs ended up on the field thanks to inebriated fans 
who nearly forced the Brewers to forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't many pennant races, but the Brewers had the  
sausage races and a number of food-related promotions 
</P>
<P>
	There were sea gulls that interrupted games, floods that turned  
County Stadium into swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, there were the zany characters. Probably the most notable  
was Johnny Logan, a shortstop for the Braves who used to start the 
fights that Eddie Mathews finished. Logan also was known for 
keeping the clubhouse loose, both during his playing days and 
afterward in his frequent visits. 
</P>
<P>
	One time, after someone said a newspaper's reporting of 0 hits  
for the game was a typographical error, Logan retorted: ``The hell 
it was. It was a clean base hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a ton of memories here,'' said Aaron, who began his  
storied career in Milwaukee. ``I'm really going to miss this 
place.''

<HEADLINE> Schools Fed Up With Pokemon Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELHAM, N.Y. (AP) -- Pikachu, Jigglypuff and the other mutating  
monsters on the Pokemon juggernaut are running into roadblocks at 
grade schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The hot-selling trading cards that capitalize on the Japanese  
cartoon phenomenon have been banned, restricted or discouraged by 
some principals in New York, New Jersey, Washington and elsewhere 
because they're distracting the early-reading set. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pelham, just north of New York City, all four grade schools  
have come down in some fashion on the cards, which have sold in the 
millions since they came out in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to be the latest craze and the children are  
beginning to become obsessed by them,'' said Gerard Finelli, the 
principal at Colonial school. Finelli has banned trading between 
pupils ``because some of our younger kids were getting suckered out 
of their more valuable cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cards are banned entirely at Prospect Hill school, where  
principal Richard Limato said, ``We were having instances in which 
the children were losing them and then getting very upset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Wolski, a second-grader at Colonial, has about 60 of the  
cards, a poster illustrating all 150 of the sometimes cuddly, 
sometimes scary monsters, a Pokemon comic book, a T-shirt and a 
pin. The 7-year-old doesn't bring his cards to school anymore 
because ``the teachers don't like it and the principal said he'd 
better not catch us trading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, wide-eyed, ``Somebody was stealing them!''  
</P>
<P>
	Like millions of other kids, Kevin jumps out of bed to watch the  
Pokemon cartoon each morning and can converse rapidly and astutely 
about the details of the trading-card game: about the gentle 
goldfish Magikarp, who can evolve into the powerful sea serpent 
Gyarados; about Psyduck, whose powers increase ``if he has a really 
bad headache''; and about Kadabra, ``who can hypnotize lightning 
bolts when his eyes light up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin's mother, Linda, has no objections to her son's new  
obsession, noting that the cards encourage kids to read, the game 
requires some arithmetic skills, and the cartoon takes pains to 
teach lessons, ``like making fun of the vanity of the villain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin's father, Mike, likes that among the big-eyed human  
characters, ``boys and girls are equally powerful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pokemon phenomenon originated in Japan three years ago as a  
Nintendo Game Boy game. Until recently, it was best-known for the 
cartoon episode that sent 700 Japanese viewers to hospitals when 
they reacted, some with epilepsy-like spasms, to a scene that 
flashed bright colors in rapid succession. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, Pokemon quickly expanded into cartoons, comic books  
and the trading cards, which are made by Seattle-based Wizards of 
the Coast under a license from Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards spokeswoman Carol Rogalski said the targeted age for the  
cards was 8 to preteen, but kids 5 and 6 have been collecting the 
cards as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just turned into this hottest thing,'' she said, and the  
cards are headed for a fifth printing. 
</P>
<P>
	The rarest cards sell to collectors for more than $50, but a  
starter set with 61 cards has a suggested retail price of $7.99. 
Other packs have list prices of $2.79 to $9.99, but there have been 
markups to $20 or so, Rogalski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wizards also makes ``Magic: The Gathering'' cards, which sparked  
a federal lawsuit against the Bedford Central schools when some 
parents thought they were satanic and shouldn't be allowed on 
school grounds. A decision in that suit is pending.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Remorseful After Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry figured out the  
consequences of his arrest pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked several times if there was anything that we could do  
to change this situation, because this was going to ruin his 
career,'' police Sgt. Marc J. Hamlin wrote in an investigative 
report following the New York Yankees outfielder's arrest on drug 
and prostitution charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the cocaine wrapped in a $20 bill inside his  
wallet did not belong to him. And while he acknowledged discussing 
sex with a female undercover officer Wednesday night, the 
eight-time All-Star insisted he was joking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strawberry continually apologized and was very remorseful for  
what he had done,'' Hamlin wrote in the report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who waived his right to an attorney before speaking  
to Hamlin, was arrested near the Yankees' training complex and 
charged with possession of .3 grams -- about 100th of an ounce -- of 
powder cocaine and soliciting a prostitute for $50. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest jolt in Strawberry's troubled personal and  
professional life, which has been beset by cocaine and alcohol 
abuse, income tax evasion, domestic strife, failure to make child 
support payments and -- last fall -- a diagnosis of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was in Cleveland to attend the  
funeral of Michael Friedman, one of the team's limited partners, 
and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonn Trost, the Yankees' general counsel, declined to comment,  
saying the team would allow the legal process to run its course 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called the arrest ``a painful  
episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, a lot of people are looking into it. We've been in  
contact with the players' association and the Yankees, and we have 
to let the justice system work here,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was in seclusion, breaking from his daily routine of  
working out at the Yankees' minor-league complex where he has been 
preparing for a comeback from his cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not here, and he's not going to be here for a while,''  
Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of player development 
said. ``I don't know what's going to happen down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cocaine found in Strawberry's wallet had an estimated street  
value of $20. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared for personal use,'' police spokesman Joe Durkin  
said. ``One hit size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the police report, Strawberry said his wife's  
uncle, Rodney Simon, used the vehicle the previous night and that 
it was possible Simon or others who were in the car might have left 
the folded $20 bill in the glove box where Strawberry found it 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The athlete said he was joking around with the undercover  
officer about sex and drove off with no intention of meeting her at 
a nearby motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the good stuff?,'' the report quoted Strawberry as  
saying to initiate his discussion with the undercover officer, who 
said he drove past her several times before stopping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the good stuff,'' the officer responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Where can I get some good stuff to party with.''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``I don't have any, but you can get it from anyone  
walking down the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Do you want to party?''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``Yes, I want to party.''  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry then arranged to have sex for $50, the police report  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said Strawberry was carrying $1,159.10 in cash in his  
left front pocket at the time he was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Police interviewed Simon by telephone at Strawberry's urging.  
They were told Simon was using Strawberry's vehicle the previous 
night and that he had been accompanied by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon ``denied that he used or even saw cocaine last  
night,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine possession is a third-degree felony with a maximum  
penalty of five years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Pam Bondi 
said. The maximum penalty for solicitation, a misdemeanor, is 60 
days in the county jail for a first offense. After that, the 
maximum penalty is a year in the county jail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's list of substance abuse problems is lengthy.  
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball suspended him for 60 days in 1995 after he  
tested positive for cocaine. The previous year, he entered the 
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and spent four weeks 
undergoing treatment for a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, while with the New York Mets, he entered the Smithers  
Center in New York for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to substance abuse, Strawberry also ran afoul of tax  
laws. In 1995, a federal court ordered him to repay $350,000 in 
back taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement, 
except for games. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, the National League Rookie of the Year in 1983 and a  
World Series champion with the Mets in 1986, also was accused of 
failing to make timely payments to an ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	He rebounded after signing with the Yankees in June 1995 and had  
remained drug free, with regular testing by major league baseball. 
His last test was Tuesday, although the results were not known yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry had his best season in seven years in 1998, hitting  
.247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees won the World Series without Strawberry, New  
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani praised him ``for the comeback 
he's made as a baseball player and the comeback he's making in 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in New York last weekend to receive his World Series  
ring, and was expected to join Triple-A Columbus as early as next 
week. He had spoken to recovering groups in recent weeks and just 
Monday appeared on ABC's ``20-20'' to discuss how his bout with 
cancer had changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was working hard and doing well,'' Newman said. ``It's too  
bad. I really love that guy.''

	House Nears Approval on 2000 Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress today moved to the brink of approving  
a $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 that Republicans hope will 
sharpen their image as tax cutters and as a party that has moved 
beyond President Clinton's impeachment. The Senate neared final 
approval of the blueprint this afternoon, a day after the House 
passed it by a near party-line 220-208 vote. The measure maps a 
10-year tax cut of at least $778 billion. Passage today would mark 
only the second time Congress has completed the measure on time 
since setting the April 15 deadline in 1987.

	Cohen: Prospect of Casualties High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signaling that the NATO air campaign in  
Yugoslavia could stretch into summer, the Clinton administration 
said today the prospect for American casualties is ``very real and 
high,'' and U.S. officials expressed regret for an accidental NATO 
attack on a refugee convoy. ``We do try to reduce the risks to 
innocent human beings,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said using ground troops is 
not under consideration. ``The reason that we have gone forward as 
we have with an air campaign is that there was not a consensus in 
the NATO alliance to do anything but this,'' Cohen said.

Dale Hoke, 25, at his Raleigh, N.C., home on charges of securities 
fraud for allegedly disseminating false information about the 
company, whose stock is publicly traded, the U.S. attorney's office

public commemorations of the 10th anniversary of the start of 
Tiananmen Square democracy protests. For two hours this morning, 
police closed off the grave site in southern China of former 
Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, who was ousted as party chief 
for being too liberal. His death April 15, 1989, started the

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom To Sell More Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German telecommunications company Deutsche  
Telekom said today it plans to make another share offering by the 
end of June, its second under a privatization begun in late 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, coupled with its report that its earnings were  
unchanged in the first quarter, sent Telekom's shares down 3.7 
percent in early trading in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Company chairman Ron Sommer said the share offering would boost  
the company's capital by up to 10 percent although he did not 
disclose how many shares would be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be used to make Telekom more competitive.

	Telekom earned 1.04 billion marks, or $575 million, in the first  
quarter, uinchanged from a year ago. It cited increased competition 
after full liberalization of Germany's telecommunications market on 
Jan. 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government, which had owned all of Telekom, sold  
about a 25 percent stake in the company in the November 1996 
initial public offering. The sale brought Telekom about 20 billion

<HEADLINE> Anderson Lee Has Implants Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former ``Baywatch'' star Pamela Anderson Lee  
has had her breast implants removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I've been wanting to do for a long time and I'm  
very happy with my decision,'' Ms. Lee said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgery on the 31-year-old actress, now appearing in the  
syndicated show ``V.I.P.,'' was performed last week in Los Angeles, 
said Ms. Lee's spokeswoman Marleah Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Leslie said Ms. Lee had no problems with the implants and is  
not worried her smaller figure will hurt her modeling career or 
chances in landing future acting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she was, she wouldn't have done it,'' Ms. Leslie told USA  
Today. ``She just wanted her body to go back to its natural 
state.''

<HEADLINE> Gators' Players Agent Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- University of Florida police are  
investigating a sports agent who represents three high-profile 
Gators in this year's NFL draft, a sports publication said. 
</P>
<P>
	Street and Smith's Sports Business Journal reported that campus  
police have included William ``Tank'' Black in their investigation 
of on-campus agent activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Black represents linebackers Jevon Kearse and Mike Peterson and  
defensive lineman Reggie McGrew. All are expected to be selected in 
this weekend's draft, with Kearse going early in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte, N.C.-based publication said campus police are  
investigating whether Black violated Florida's strict agent laws in 
recruiting and signing several players over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, university police charged Michael Joseph McDonald with  
one count of unlicensed athletic agent activity. They accused him 
of funneling money to former Florida players Tim Beauchamp and Dock 
Pollard. Both players were dismissed from the team in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Stacy Badics said Thursday the investigation  
was ongoing and the department would not release names of anyone 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sports Business Journal, in its April 12 issue, reported  
that investigator Darren Baxley confirmed Black was part of the 
investigation. The publication said police have interviewed 
students, other agents and school officials concerning Black. 
</P>
<P>
	Black told the The Orlando Sentinel he welcomed the probe.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing there,'' he said. ``I'm sure they're just  
doing their job and checking'' into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm aware, it's the same investigation that's been  
going on for two months,'' Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley 
said.

<HEADLINE> Police Brutality Facts Are Scarce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Boston, cries of police brutality are  
relatively rare. A beefed-up internal affairs division seems to be 
working, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, on the other hand, anyone who has ever heard of  
black immigrants Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo knows the nation's 
largest city has a problem when race and policing converge. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether these cities have the best and worst records in  
policing their police -- or whether police brutality is on the rise 
in American cities -- is difficult to say authoritatively. 
</P>
<P>
	No government agency keeps track, and few police departments  
collect information based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	In her longest speech to date on police conduct, Attorney  
General Janet Reno told a National Press Club luncheon today, ``No 
matter what the data show, the perception of too many Americans is 
that police officers cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is national in scope and reaches people all across  
America,'' Reno said. ``Especially in minority communities ... 
residents believe the police used excessive force, that law 
enforcement is too aggressive, that law enforcement is biased, 
disrespectful, and that they are being treated unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno outlined steps she said were needed to restore trust  
between police and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged police departments to gather hard data on racial  
patterns of traffic and other police stops of citizens and 
announced that for the first time, this year the Justice 
Department's annual survey of crime victims would ask respondents 
if they had an encounter with police in which force was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she would convene a conference in the next couple of  
weeks of police executives, academic experts and community leaders 
to discuss the problem and try to develop standards for respectful 
police-citizen contacts that are not based on racial profiles. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that rank-and-file police officers must ``make it  
unacceptable to keep silent about other officers' misconduct,'' 
that police departments should expand their recruitment in 
communities that have complained about police work and to provide 
citizens with a complaint procedure that eliminates their fear of 
speaking up while remaining fair to accused officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The question has taken on crucial dimensions. Police shootings  
have taken the lives of blacks in Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif. 
In New Jersey, Maryland and Florida, state troopers have come under 
fire for conducting traffic stops based on a driver's race -- 
so-called racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture can be cobbled together from hearsay and anecdotes but  
the lack of hard statistics riles civil rights advocates who 
believe black and brown people are more likely to end up unjustly 
facing a policeman's gun or billy club than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating to me in large part because white America  
has refused to acknowledge a problem exists,'' said Rep. Gregory W. 
Meeks, D-N.Y. ``Now in 1999, we are seeing some of the same police 
brutality we saw in the Jim Crow days, but white America just 
doesn't get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, said the Congressional Black Caucus task force on police  
brutality, which he co-chairs, plans hearings in several cities, 
including Baltimore, Chicago and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least it will be a starting point,'' said Meeks, a former  
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ron Daniels, head of the Center for Constitutional Rights,  
a New York-based civil rights group, ``We know we have a bad 
problem out there. We just don't know exactly how bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere I've gone in this country, 15 minutes into the  
conversation we are talking about some police brutality,'' Daniels 
said. He organized a national anti-police brutality march in 
Washington in early April after four officers from New York's elite 
street crimes unit fired 41 shots at Diallo, an unarmed West 
African immigrant, hitting him 19 times. The officers have been 
charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, civil rights groups have urged the Justice Department  
to collect nationwide data on excessive force cases. The collection 
of data was authorized by the 1994 Crime Act but not funded. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far we only have anecdotal information,'' said NAACP  
President Kweisi Mfume. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., reintroduced a bill  
requiring the Justice Department to collect data on traffic stops 
by local police. ``Stopping our citizens to be searched on account 
of their race is an unacceptable activity on the part of law 
enforcement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego requires that police record the race of people they  
stop in order to assess whether officers rely on racial profiling 
in making traffic stops. Some of the 35 police chiefs and activists 
who met with Attorney General Janet Reno last week discussed 
adopting such a plan elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But, generally, police officials are wary.  
</P>
<P>
	``If passed into law, the (Conyers) bill would place a burden on  
the police and lengthen traffic stops,'' said Robert Scully, 
executive director of the National Association of Police 
Organizations, which represents 4,000 police unions and 
associations. He said officers are vulnerable to attack during such 
stops and pausing to collect data ``would make a dangerous 
situation worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that in the quest for a colorblind society, some  
people want us to keep track of people by race,'' said Jim Pasco, 
executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's 
largest police labor organization, with 277,000 members. ``We're 
opposed to any kind of racial tabulation,'' he said, opposing 
proposals to accumulate data on police brutality cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasco said that police brutality hasn't been increasing. He  
notes the number of federal prosecutions of abusive cops has stayed 
at about 30 a year while the number of officers has sharply 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Available information hints that along with Boston, the police  
departments of Minneapolis and San Francisco have done the best 
jobs in curbing such abuses, according to a study last year of 14 
cities by Human Rights Watch, an international human rights 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans appear to have the  
most serious problems of abusive officers on their forces, 
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Hasbro's Earnings Climb 75 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s first-quarter earnings grew  
by more than 75 percent from a year ago, fueled by strong sales of 
its popular interactive Furby dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's No. 2 toymaker, which trails Mattel Inc., reported  
on Thursday that it earned $13.79 million, or 7 cents a share, in 
the quarter ended March 28, compared with $7.79 million, or 4 cents 
a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $668 million, up from $483 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's earnings topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Its  
stock closed up $1.87 1/2, or 6 percent, to $32 in trading on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue growth was primarily led by Tiger Electronics, which  
makes the Furby toys. Hasbro acquired Tiger Electronics a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Furby pets continue to be a smash hit,'' said Alan G.  
Hasenfeld, Hasbro's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Hasbro saw a double-digit sales growth at its  
interactive division, which produces computer and video games, and 
had brisk sales of its line based on the popular Teletubbies 
children's television show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, Hasbro anticipates strong demand for its  
toys based on the upcoming ``Star Wars'' movie. It will also be 
shipping Furby dolls in five foreign languages and will extend its 
lineup of toys based on Pokeman, the popular video game character. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro also owns several well-known brands, including Playskool,  
Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers and Galoob.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Buying by institutional investors boosted the  
dollar against the yen early Friday. Japanese share prices opened 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.06 yen in early trading, up 0.26 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and above its level of 118.83 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 27.23 points, or 0.16 percent, to  
16,754.31 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency was slightly  
higher as Japanese institutional investors actively bought dollars, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ongoing warfare in Kosovo, as well as whispers of political  
uncertainty in Russia, also supported the dollar, often seen as a 
safe haven in times of international unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices opened higher, boosted  
by heavy buying at foreign brokerage houses, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gain in U.S. stock prices may also have helped.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow rose 51.06 points -- or 0.5 percent -- to  
close at 10,462.72, topping Wednesday's record of 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	A big early gainer in Tokyo was Honda Motor. Its share prices  
soared after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported Friday that 
the Japanese automaker will build a new plant in the U.S. or Canada 
by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 2.44 points, or 0.18 percent, to 
1,340.37. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 127.44 yen, below  
its level of 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond slipped to  
1.570 percent from its close of 1.575 percent Thursday, pushing its 
price up to 102.01 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Restaurants Try Guidelines for Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- That $40 entree got you down? Or the  
appetizer that costs as much as a meal? Well, prepare for another 
slight: Some upscale restaurants have begun adding ``gratuity 
guidelines,'' to their checks, a not-so-subtle suggestion to make 
the voluntary tip a little more obligatory. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lula in Santa Monica, Calif., for instance, checks come with  
a recommended tip of 15, 18 or 20 percent of the meal's cost. 
Customers, properly encouraged, can then check a box, once they get 
over the surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Some restaurants call it a ``customer convenience.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's rude,'' said Catherine Marin, a doctor in Los  
Angeles who dined recently at Lula. ``It shouldn't be up to the 
restaurant. It should be up to the person receiving the meal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, perhaps not entirely.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Express developed a feature on its  
electronic credit card processor that will automatically calculate 
from the bill a gratuity selected by the restaurant. After the 
machine validates your card, it prints out the suggested tip on 
your receipt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason is tipping is not consistent. It can vary from $5  
to $25 for the same meal,'' said Karen Kraushaar, a spokesman for 
the 37,000-member National Restaurant Association in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has suggested a more subtle approach. It is  
distributing its own credit card-size sheets to help diners 
calculate 15 and 20 percent tips. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's no indication tipping guidelines are sweeping the  
restaurant community, ``we are seeing more experimentation with 
ways to provide more customer convenience,'' Ms. Kraushaar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some waiters, bothered by bad tips, like the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people just don't know what to do,'' said Brett Neal,  
who waits tables at Alegria, a trendy restaurant in Long Beach, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, anyone who's traveled to Europe may not be shocked at  
all at the tip suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	In France and many other countries in Europe, the gratuity is  
already part of the meal's cost and tipping beyond that is not 
customary. 
</P>
<P>
	It's mandatory, too, in many American restaurants for parties of  
six or more. A tip of 15 percent to 18 percent is automatically 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't bother me a bit. I'm a generous tipper. If they  
added 15 percent it would be cheaper for me,'' said Mike Yager, 
president Mid America Designs, an Effingham, Ill.-based Corvette 
catalog business. 
</P>
<P>
	But criticism has come from unlikely places, too.  
</P>
<P>
	David Stockman, chairman of the California Restaurant  
Association, said he doesn't believe the idea is catching on -- nor 
will it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be insulted if they brought it to me,'' he said. ``You  
don't have a way of voicing your dissatisfaction if they don't 
deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tips stand for ``To insure proper service,'' said Stockman, who  
is also senior vice president of Pasadena-based Lawry's 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	If the gratuity guidelines get substantial negative feedback,  
``they will be dropped in a heartbeat,'' Ms. Kraushaar said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they should, says bi-coastal restaurateur Michael McCarty.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to buck tradition. It seems the wrong way to  
go,'' said the owner of Michael's restaurants in New York City and 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, McCarty's restaurants added a 15 percent service  
charge to checks. They returned to the optional tipping system last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical tip left now is closer to 20 percent,'' McCarty  
said.

<HEADLINE>  El-Amin Gets Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin  
pleaded guilty today to misdeameanor possession of marijuana and 
was sentenced to one day of community service. The judge also 
ordered the stocky sophomore to warn schoolchildren about the 
dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old El-Amin appeared in Hartford Community Court  
before Judge Raymond Norko, who gave him a stern lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is aware of who you are, where you are from and what  
you have done,'' Norko said. ``The citizens of this state love you 
and have adopted you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norko reminded El-Amin of his jubilant claim after the Huskies  
upset Duke in the NCAA championship game March 29: ``We shocked the 
world!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The epilogue to that is: `I disappointed the world,''' Norko  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did not respond, except to reply, ``Yes, your honor'' to  
questions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The player was stopped for a traffic violation Tuesday evening  
and a small amount of marijuana was discovered during a search, 
Hartford police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest may not have been an unlucky coincidence, according  
to a published report. The Hartford Courant, citing police 
documents and sources it did not identify, said today an informant 
had tipped police about El-Amin's trip to an area of Hartford known 
for drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the tip, detectives arrived at the parking lot  
before El-Amin and saw him making what appeared to be a drug 
transaction, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn scoring leader Richard Hamilton was a passenger in the car  
but was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was charged with possession of less than 4 ounces of  
marijuana, a misdemeanor. His sentence was the typical punishment 
given to first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory parade for the Huskies is scheduled in Hartford for  
Saturday, but organizers said Wednesday they did not know whether 
El-Amin will take part. 
</P>
<P>
	A disappointed coach Jim Calhoun said he was standing by his  
player and would ensure El-Amin understands his position as a 
highly visible student athlete and role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player in our program has responsibilities, on and off  
the court,'' Calhoun said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Race Identification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Supreme Court has ruled that  
juries in some mixed-race criminal cases should be told that 
witnesses have a tougher time identifying defendants of another 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had argued there isn't enough scientific evidence to  
prove witnesses have more difficulty identifying members of another 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court rejected the argument Wednesday, saying there have  
been ample studies and that most jurisdictions accept the concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed some courtroom observers have commented that the  
ordinary person's difficulty of `cross-racial recognition' is so 
commonplace as to be the subject of both cliche and joke: `they all 
look alike,''' the court wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ordered a new trial in the rape case of a white  
Rutgers University student who identified a black man, McKinley 
Cromedy, as her attacker. The court said the jury should have been 
given a ``cross racial instruction'' alerting jurors to pay close 
attention to the possible influence of race in identifying 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman had not recognized a photograph of Cromedy that she  
was shown a few days after the rape. However, she alerted police 
eight months later when she spotted Cromedy on a street corner. She 
identified him as the rapist after he had been taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
	No forensic evidence was admitted during the trial. Court  
documents said it was not possible to link Cromedy to the rape 
through blood and sperm samples, and no fingerprints were taken by 
police at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial court did not allow the jury to be advised that  
``cross racial identification'' could affect the victim's ability 
to identify her assailant, a decision upheld by an appeals court 
and overturned this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an important decision,'' said Sylvia Orenstein, who  
argued the case on behalf of Cromedy. ``Science has shown, 
unfortunately, that most people tend to better recognize people of 
their own race. This is another factor a jury should be alerted to 
consider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court said a cross-racial instruction to juries should only  
be given when identification is critical to the case, and there are 
no other eyewitnesses to back up the victim's charges.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes German Peace Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia today welcomed a German proposal offering a  
24-hour halt to NATO airstrikes if Yugoslav forces withdraw from 
Kosovo, saying ending the attacks was the key to a peaceful 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Chernomyrdin, the ex-premier named to head Russia's  
efforts to find a political solution to the Kosovo dispute, said he 
plans talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to press for 
a settlement. He said the German proposal made Wednesday could 
clear the way for progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only peaceful means to settle the conflict should be sought  
and Germany's proposal for a 24-hour halt to the bombing and a 
search for compromise deserve attention,'' Chernomyrdin said after 
meeting with the German ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is eager to find a political solution, but it apparently  
lacks sufficient power or influence with either side to achieve a 
breakthrough at this stage. The United States has hoped that Russia 
can pressure its Yugoslav ally to accept a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow's proposals so far have been based on first halting the  
airstrikes and then resuming negotiations. NATO insists the 
airstrikes will continue until Yugoslav forces pull out of Kosovo 
and meet other demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that any agreement can be reached while NATO continues  
its airstrikes against Yugoslavia,'' Chernomyrdin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin said in an interview published today in the  
Kommersant newspaper that a quick solution was not likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to arm ourselves with patience and steady our  
nerves,'' he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, President Boris Yeltsin said today he was confident  
that Chernomyrdin could use his ties with Milosevic to work out a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chernomyrdin knows Milosevic well and can talk with him like  
no one else. He has dealt with him on several occasions,'' Yeltsin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Russia has cultural, religious and historical ties to  
Yugoslavia's Serbian population, it also has been critical of 
Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign against ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is studying sending additional humanitarian aid to  
Yugoslavia, Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said after 
talks with Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia last week sent a column of trucks, part of which was  
turned back by Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials said today they were readying warships for  
possible deployment in the Adriatic Sea to shadow NATO vessels 
taking part in attacks on Yugoslavia. No decision had been taken on 
how many vessels might be sent, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials said earlier this week that two warships might be  
sent this weekend to join the Russian intelligence vessel already 
in the Adriatic. The Navy has refused to confirm the reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow has said it will not be drawn militarily in to the  
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Montoya Off to Solid Start in CART </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Juan Montoya, who came to Champ Car  
racing this year with a big reputation, is still champing at the 
bit after his first two CART races. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Colombian driver, who won last year's European  
Formula 3000 championship, has finished a respectable 10th and 13th 
in CART FedEx Series events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Montoya, who replaced two-time series champion Alex Zanardi  
-- driving in Formula One this season -- was also the center of a 
controversial incident last weekend in Motegi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old racer caused a crash that took both his  
Reynard-Honda and Michael Andretti's Swift-Ford into the wall 
during a practice session for last Sunday's race. Tempers flared 
briefly as Andretti, the winningest active driver in the series, 
chastised the youngster for an arrogant attitude and team owners 
Carl Haas and Chip Ganassi momentarily faced off. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners had a conciliatory drink later that day, and the  
drivers stayed away from each other on and off the track the rest 
of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was last week,'' Ganassi said. ``It happened and it's  
over. Juan is learning new things every day and we're all just 
thinking about the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the first two oval events of his Champ Car career, Montoya  
will try his hand at a temporary street circuit in Sunday's Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a rookie, I'm still realistic about my chances,''  
Montoya said. ``At the same time, I know I have the ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I'm not confident in my ability on ovals, I'm very  
confident on road courses, and I'm anxious for the chance to show 
it. It's tough for me not to get excited about the possibility of 
winning at Long Beach and continuing our streak here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to the fact Target-Chip Ganassi Racing drivers  
have won the last three Long Beach races, with current teammate 
Jimmy Vasser taking the 1996 event and Zanardi the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, part of the Long Beach course will be new to everyone,  
not just the rookies. 
</P>
<P>
	With constant changes in the downtown area because of new  
buildings going up, the temporary street circuit has gone through 
multiple changes in the 25 years since the event was first run. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest changes have lengthened the course from 1.57 miles  
last April to its current 1.85-mile configuration that includes 
four new turns around the Long Beach Aquarium and a longer front 
straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser said, ``Nobody gets a chance to test on a temporary  
circuit like Long Beach, so we're all in the same boat. We'll all 
see it for the first time Friday morning when practice starts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Herta, the pole-winner and race runner-up last year, said,  
``The first order of business Friday will be to test the new part 
of the circuit and see if the setup from last year is still valid. 
Computer simulations can indicate a lot of the information we need 
to gather, but computers can't show you the bumps and the slippery 
patches on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya is counting on computers to help him get off to a good  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope the course is similar to the Long Beach Grand Prix  
on the Microsoft CART World Series video game I used to play,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganassi is not worried about his first-year driver.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any rookie would be nervous in his situation,'' Ganassi said.  
``But Juan has handled it extremely well. Jimmy has talked to him 
about the race and what to expect, so I think we have two drivers 
capable of winning the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser, seventh in the season standings after finishes of fourth  
and 12th, trails leader Greg Moore by 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a very superstitious person, but I have noticed that  
the driver who has won at Long Beach the past three years has gone 
on to win the championship,'' Vasser said. ``I don't think there's 
a direct correlation but, just in case, I'm making every effort to 
win this race.''

<HEADLINE> Bogus Internet Report Nets Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An employee of PairGain Technologies Inc. was  
arrested Thursday in North Carolina on securities fraud charges 
alleging he posted a fabricated financial news service report on 
the Internet that drove up the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, 25, was arrested at his Raleigh home after FBI  
agents tracked Internet addresses that were recorded despite an 
effort to access the Internet anonymously, according to U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax included a phony story about a corporate  
takeover made up to look like it was posted on the Bloomberg news 
service's Web site. It caused a dramatic increase in the stock 
value of PairGain, a Tustin, Calif., maker of telecommunications 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was believed to be the first stock manipulation scheme  
employing a fraudulent Internet site, U.S. Attorney Alejandro N. 
Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter described Hoke as a  
middle level employee. After his arrest, Hoke was arraigned in 
North Carolina, ordered to report to a Los Angeles court at an 
unspecified date and released on $50,000 bond, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Painter said there was no allegation that any higher-ups in the  
company were involved and that the company was cooperating in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles McBrayer, senior vice president and chief financial  
officer of PairGain, said, ``We're disappointed and upset that the 
trail seemed to lead to one of our employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, an employee since January 1997, accessed the Internet  
through a computer at PairGain's Raleigh facility, where he is an 
engineer, said McBrayer. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain has about 70 workers in Raleigh, where it makes  
equipment that allows phone companies to carry multiple calls over 
existing copper wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint filed against Hoke late Wednesday in Los Angeles  
and unsealed Thursday charged that investors who paid the inflated 
price for PairGain were defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
	The bogus report said PairGain would be acquired by an Israeli  
firm, ECI Telecom, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its market 
value at the time. On that day, the value of PairGain stock rose as 
high as $11.12 1/2 from a closing price the day earlier of $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
	When it was determined that the story was fake, the stock price  
dropped, however it has since been fluctuating. On Thursday it fell 
$1.31 1/4 to $11.68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint did not specifically allege that Hoke traded in  
PairGain stock on April 7, but an affidavit said Hoke has a history 
of trading securities online, and he traded PairGain stock as 
recently as January. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint names one victim of the hoax, a Santa Ana, Calif.,  
investor who purchased 1,500 shares of PairGain stock after 
learning of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint alleges Hoke used a free Web page service operated  
by Angelfire.com and a free e-mail service operated by Hotmail.com 
to create the scam. 
</P>
<P>
	According to prosecutors, Hoke also allegedly posted a bogus  
e-mail message about PairGain under the subject line ``Buyout 
News'' on a financial news message board operated by Yahoo Inc. The 
message contained a link to the bogus Bloomberg site. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayorkas said the case was the first to result from a closer  
relationship between federal prosecutors and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to protect investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities fraud is punishable by up to 10 years in federal  
prison and a $1 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Bloomberg LP filed a lawsuit over the hoax in U.S.  
District Court in New York City. The lawsuit identified the 
defendants only as John Does and seeks unspecified damages. An 
attorney for Bloomberg said the suit would help the company learn 
the identities of those involved.

<HEADLINE> How Many Strikes Does Straw Get? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even if he didn't set out looking for trouble, trouble never had  
to look very far to find Darryl Strawberry. And when he realized 
just how low he had sunk one more time, Strawberry begged the cops 
to help him save his job. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the maddening thing about guys like him. The rules are so  
simple in the games that they learn to play so well. Between the 
lines, it's always been three strikes and you're out -- no mercy, no 
appeal. It's only when they step outside, into the real world, that 
they want to be treated differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has gone from wrecking machine to wreck, from  
sympathetic figure to pathetic one and back again so many times 
that it's become difficult to keep count. But according to police, 
soon after his arrest on charges of cocaine possession and 
soliciting a prostitute, Strawberry kept pleading with them to bend 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spare, cold language of the report accompanying  
Strawberry's arrest, Tampa Police Sgt. Marc J. Hamlin wrote, ``He 
asked several times, if there was anything that we could do to 
change this situation, because this was going to ruin his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of violence against several companions, failure to pay  
child support, charges of federal income-tax evasion, bouts with 
alcoholism and substance abuse, even the colon cancer that was 
diagnosed last October -- somehow none of them, or even all of them 
combined, could sidetrack Strawberry's career. 
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't just talent that saved him, either. It certainly  
played a part in convincing ballclubs to take a chance on him more 
than once. But there was something noble about Strawberry, too, 
something that went beyond bravado and talent, that made his 
teammates and managers and most of all, Yankee boss George 
Steinbrenner, protective of him to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
	It might have been the way he refused, at age 37, to quit trying  
to make his way back to the big leagues. In the New York clubhouse, 
where the last few episodes of Strawberry's comeback battle played 
out like some kind of cautionary tale, the news was devastating. In 
2 1/2 years there, he had become a leader. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his youngest admirers, shortstop Derek Jeter, likened  
Strawberry to ``a big brother.'' One of his oldest friends, pitcher 
David Cone said, ``I'm the least objective person about Darryl. I 
love the guy. It's just an awful situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre wouldn't talk about it. Don Zimmer, who's  
filling in while Torre recovers from his own fight with cancer, 
said, ``I hope it's a mistake,'' even though he knew better. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, no one should have been surprised. And that's another  
maddening thing about guys like Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	The most charming ones usually make good liars. They get so  
good, so practiced at both sinning and covering up that they get to 
the point where even they can't tell the difference. The thing that 
disappointed his teammates the most was that Strawberry seemed so 
close to joining them in New York. They must be asking themselves 
instead how he climbed so close to the edge without even one of 
them having a clue. 
</P>
<P>
	The only question that matters now, of course, is what will  
Steinbrenner do? He made it clear he was running out of patience in 
February when Strawberry failed to show up for an autograph session 
and then was forced to publicly apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boss was attending a funeral Thursday in Cleveland and has  
yet to comment on what's next. Because Strawberry is not on the 
Yankees' 40-man roster, it's not clear whether disciplinary action 
will be handed out by the major or minor leagues. Still, the only 
opinion that counts at the moment is George's. 
</P>
<P>
	After all he's done for Strawberry, nobody could blame  
Steinbrenner if he simply walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	That must have been the player's greatest fear while he sat in  
the police station late Wednesday night, the reason he made that 
desperate plea over and over to the police. 
</P>
<P>
	He knows he may have run out of chances and the courage to make  
it back one more time himself. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Struggles To Retain Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's prime minister insisted Thursday  
that he has enough support to stay in power even after his biggest 
ally deserted him and vowed to topple his government. 
</P>
<P>
	Just two days before his government is to face a confidence vote  
in Parliament that could lead to his ouster, Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee appeared self-assured as he strode to his chair 
Thursday, accepting greetings from opposition members. 
</P>
<P>
	``What kind of government will come in my place, and who will  
lead it?'' he told lawmakers, reminding those who are wavering 
about the potential political chaos that could ensue from his 
government's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharad Pawar, speaker of the main opposition Congress Party,  
responded by blaming the government for India's deteriorating 
economy, the increasing attacks on the Christians and the 
stepped-up arms race with Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes before, Pakistan tested its second nuclear-capable  
missile in two days, in response to a similar missile test by India 
on Sunday. Both countries conducted underground nuclear explosions 
last May, taking their armed rivalry to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis in the ruling coalition was triggered by Jayaram  
Jayalalitha, leader of a group known by its Tamil acronym AIADMK, 
withdrew her 18 lawmakers Wednesday from the ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our entire attention and energies are devoted to ensuring the  
fall of this government,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Jayalalitha met with Congress Party head Sonia  
Gandhi to discuss new power-sharing arrangements. Jayalalitha said 
Congress had not decided what course of action it would take. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi's group has only 140 lawmakers and is wary of seeking  
support from socialists who have attacked Gandhi's policies or her 
Italian ancestry or who are otherwise reluctant to support her. 
</P>
<P>
	Gandhi has held no office of power and emerged as a power center  
by virtue of being a member of the Gandhi dynasty. Three of India's 
prime ministers belonged to the Gandhi family: Jawaharlal Nehru, 
his daughter Indira Gandhi and grandson Rajiv Gandhi. She is 
Rajiv's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	To remain in power, Vajpayee needs a simple majority of  
lawmakers who are present in the legislature and who vote. His 
Bharatiya Janata Party is banking on disarray among opposition 
groups, each with its own plan and regional compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	If no group is able to form a government, new elections will be  
called, four years ahead of schedule. India's last two elections 
gave no single party a clear majority to come to power on its own.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A 71-year-old man calmly walked into the  
Mormon church's renowned genealogical library during an 
international convention on Thursday and methodically shot people 
with a small-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was over, the gunman had killed a church security  
officer and a library patron and wounded five others, including a 
police officer. He was fatally shot by police and died later in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police knew of no motive for the gunman, identified as Sergei  
Babarin of Salt Lake City. Mayor Deedee Corradini said at a news 
conference that the gunman was schizophrenic and had not been 
taking his medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything. He just came in and started shooting  
people,'' said Margaret Kane, who was at the library, directly 
across the street from Temple Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked intent on what he was doing. He came to do what  
he was doing,'' said Kane, who huddled under a desk in the 
first-floor research area as the man roamed the lobby and adjacent 
classrooms, stopping at one point to reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not hear him say anything. He didn't call out, no names  
or anything. He just kept his hand held out pointing at people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin, a married man with children, he was a Russian native  
often frustrated by his broken English, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Ruben Ortega said Babarin was arrested after a 1995  
fight at a department store in downtown Salt Lake. He had been 
carrying a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and was charged with 
assault and carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, the largest center for genealogical research in the  
world, is directly across the street from the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle. It 
has more than 2 million rolls of microfilm copies of census and 
other records from more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. Some 250 people -- patrons and employees -- are in the 
building on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has been involved in genealogy since its founding  
nearly 170 years ago. The church amasses the records for what it 
calls the baptism of the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms 
give the dead the opportunity to join the Mormon church in the 
afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman Platt, a genealogist, said the gunman entered the library  
and quickly fired off a dozen rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived on  
the scene, at first leading police to believe there might be a 
second gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people on the second floor locked themselves inside  
when the shooting began and were evacuated unharmed early in the 
afternoon as SWAT teams combed the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, who had exchanged fire with police, was taken out of  
the building to an ambulance parked in front of a nearby restaurant 
about 90 minutes after the first shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics at first believed he might be wired with an explosive  
and the area was evacuated. No explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police dismissed earlier reports that two other men tied to the  
gunman had been detained. They also said the gunman apparently had 
no connection to a yellow moving truck parked three blocks from the 
library and found to contain two 55-gallon drums of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck owner, who had been at the library earlier Thursday  
and argued with an employee, was questioned at length, said Ortega, 
but he apparently was not involved in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point police blew a hole in the side of the truck to  
inspect the interior. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the five wounded was a police officer who was treated at  
the scene for a minor wound; an elderly man with a chest wound; and 
a 71-year-old woman with a head wound. Two women, ages 45 and 80, 
were in stable condition, one with a shoulder wound and the other 
with a face wound. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much regret these tragic circumstances,'' the church's  
governing First Presidency said in a statement read by Bruce Olsen, 
managing director of public affairs for the church. ``We do not 
have all of the particulars, but our hearts reach out to the 
innocent victims of this terrible tragedy and to their families.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. City, Waco Anniversaries Loom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department security officials on  
Thursday issued their annual security warning to employees about 
the April 19 anniversary of the Oklahoma City federal building 
bombing and the assault on a religious compound in Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the FBI does not have any specific threat information  
concerning the week of April 19,'' Justice Security Officer D. 
Jerry Rubino issued the annual warning ``to raise your level of 
security awareness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI sends a similar alert to federal, state and local law  
enforcement around the country each year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubino noted that April 19 is ``meaningful to self-styled  
patriots in the current militia movements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that date in 1995, the Oklahoma City federal building was  
bombed by Timothy McVeigh, a drifter who had expressed anger over 
the assault by federal agents on April 19, 1993 on the Branch 
Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. McVeigh has been sentenced to 
death; two other men have been convicted as accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 70 residents of the compound died at Waco of various  
causes as a fire broke out during the assault. The Oklahoma City 
blast killed 168 people and injured hundreds of others. 
</P>
<P>
	April 19 also is the anniversary, Rubino pointed out, of the  
1775 battles between British soldiers and American Minutemen at 
Lexington and Concord, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubino noted the week ends with the 50th anniversary celebration  
here of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and ``the continuing 
conflict in the Balkans also has the potential for initiating 
terrorist threats'' aimed at NATO officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubino said all identification badges will be checked on  
entrances to Justice buildings and arriving packages will be 
X-rayed. He advised employees with windows on the street to close 
their blinds or shades.

<HEADLINE> Investment Bank DLJ Profits Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After most of Wall Street's investment banks  
reported surprisingly strong profits, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette 
Inc. disappointed investors Thursday with a 9 percent drop in 
profits and flat revenues for the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette posted net income of $122 million,  
or 84 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimates, but below 
the $134 million, or $1 a share, earned in the first quarter of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: a decline in the market for new high-risk bonds.  
That hurt DLJ, the No. 1 underwriter of high-yield bonds. During 
the quarter, underwriting revenues sank 16 percent to $257 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted quickly to the news, sending DLJ's shares down  
$7.93 3/4, or nearly 9 percent, to $85.06 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues of $1.5 billion were basically unchanged from the  
first quarter last year. Excluding interest expenses, revenues were 
$1.1 billion, up slightly from the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	DLJ did benefit from the surging stock market. Commissions from  
trading stocks and bonds rose more than 40 percent during the first 
quarter to a record $281 million, while trading revenues increased 
46 percent to $174 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based investment bank, which has been expanding  
both in the United States and overseas, saw its income from fees 
rise 12 percent to $287 million in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income declined 37 percent to $121 million.

<HEADLINE> Girl's Conviction in Death Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court today reversed the  
conviction of a girl who prosecutors say killed a toddler when she 
was 11, ruling that her statements to police may have been obtained 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha Murray, now 14, was originally charged with capital  
murder making her the youngest person in Texas to face such a 
charge. After two trials, she was eventually convicted of injury to 
a child and sentenced to 25 years for the beating death of 
2-year-old Jayla Belton. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeals however remanded the case back  
to juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers had argued that Lacresha was unlawfully tried twice  
for the same crime and that a statement she gave police was the 
result of an illegal interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	The court agreed that the interrogation may have been illegal.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we consider the totality of the of the circumstances  
surrounding appellant's interview, it is clear that appellant's 
statements, in whatever form, were obtained in violation of the ... 
Family Code,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, we cannot say that appellant's statements were  
not the product of fright and despair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in the case did not immediately return phone calls  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Hampton, the teen's attorney, said the next move is up to  
the prosecutor, who may seek a rehearing before the appellate 
court, take it to the Supreme Court or retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to assume that they're going to retry her a third  
time,'' he said. Lacresha will remain at a Texas Youth Commission 
facility in Corsicana unless prosecutors drop the charges, Hampton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayla died on May 24, 1996, of massive internal injuries after  
spending the day in the home Lacresha shared with her grandparents 
and five brothers and sisters. The family often baby-sat for Jayla 
and other children. 
</P>
<P>
	After being placed in a children's shelter, Lacresha was  
questioned by two police detectives. She denied killing Jayla but 
admitted she may have dropped and kicked the toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the girl was read her rights and agreed to talk to  
them. Lacresha's lawyers say police coerced her testimony. They 
also said police never should have interrogated an 11-year-old 
without notifying her parents or taking her before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury in her first trial found Lacresha guilty of criminally  
negligent homicide and injury to a child, sentencing her to 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a second trial was ordered because District Judge John Dietz  
later decided that justice had not been served. The second jury 
found Lacresha guilty of injury to a child and sentenced her to 25 
years, which she is serving at a Texas Youth Commission facility in 
Corsicana. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the people championing the girl's case has been columnist  
Bob Herbert of The New York Times, who has written several columns 
arguing that the supposed facts of the case don't add up. Herbert 
suggested that another relative might have beaten the child. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no legitimate evidence against her, just a  
`confession' that even prosecutors have acknowledged would not have 
accounted for the injuries that killed Jayla,'' Herbert wrote in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Other critics say District Attorney Ronnie Earle sought a  
conviction to help his re-election campaign or was biased against 
Lacresha because she is black. Earle is white.

<HEADLINE> Predators' Bordeleau Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nashville Predators center Sebastien  
Bordeleau underwent surgery Thursday for a cracked vertebra he 
suffered when he was checked by Los Angeles defenseman Sean 
O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordeleau left Monday night's game after the first period  
complaining of neck pain. X-rays showed two vertebrae had been 
knocked out of alignment and he was taken by ambulance to Baptist 
Hospital, where further tests disclosed a fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Bordeleau will be hospitalized for a couple of  
days. They didn't know how long he'd be off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to have some discussions about some  
special risks of his return to play,'' Dr. Michael Pagnani said. 
``But we're optimistic that he will be able to if that's what he 
wants to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Predators general manager David Poile would not comment on  
whether he thought O'Donnell's hit was illegal but said he has 
talked with NHL officials about it.

<HEADLINE> FBI Warns of Serb Terrorism in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is investigating a Serb-language  
letter faxed to several Orthodox churches in the United States 
urging terrorist strikes on U.S. military installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Counterterrorism agents at the FBI sent out an electronic alert  
memo last week to military bases, nuclear weapons labs and other 
key installations after Serbian Orthodox churches in the 
Sacramento, Calif., Milwaukee, Chicago and Indianapolis areas 
received the letter via fax. It urged Serbian Americans to respond 
violently to U.S.-led NATO strikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The threat letter requested that all Serbian nationalists  
living in America take action against the NATO decision to 
intervene in the Serbian/Kosovo conflict by killing as many 
American soldiers in the United States as necessary to stop the 
NATO attacks in Serbia,'' according to the FBI memo. 
</P>
<P>
	The memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press, was  
distributed to military bases and other sensitive federal 
installations, such as nuclear weapons labs, through a special 
e-mail warning system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Watson, the FBI's deputy assistant director for  
counterterrorism, declined to discuss the memo but said the church 
letters weren't the only Serb-related terrorism threats being 
examined by FBI investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the war continues, we receive a lot of threats in here. The  
FBI looks into them,'' Watson said Wednesday in a telephone 
interview. ``This (letter) is not just an isolated situation. We 
look at threats; we take them all seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian Orthodox church officials in the cities mentioned in the  
FBI memo either declined to comment or said they had no information 
about the Serb-language letter. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made of any Serb nationals suspected of  
planning terrorist acts. The agency is investigating whether there 
is any link between the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and the 
threats in the United States, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The alert memo warned military commanders nationwide ``that  
there is a credible threat outstanding to take action within the 
United States against U.S. military personnel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military bases around the country had been on alert dating as  
far back as last summer's bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and 
Tanzania. But bases are stepping up security measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have increased our threat condition from Alpha to Bravo,''  
said Bob Pepper, spokesman for the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman 
Air Force Base, N.M., home of F-117 stealth fighters being used 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-step increase in threat awareness, he said, probably

intensive identity checks and stricter requirements for 
non-military people entering the base.

</P>
<P>
	``We are aware of these threats and we have disseminated the  
information to local commanders and it's up to them to adjust ... 
according to the threats they see,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, the Pentagon has become concerned with the  
possibility that terrorists would locate and target individual 
servicemen, perhaps in their homes. As a result, the Pentagon has 
grown reluctant to identify individual pilots flying strike 
missions and has scrubbed military Internet sites of personal and

<HEADLINE> Evidence of New Solar System Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For the first time, there is clear evidence  
that a solar system other than our own exists, researchers said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three huge planets are spinning around the star Upsilon  
Andromedae 44 light years from Earth in our Milky Way galaxy, San 
Francisco State University researchers said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Their presence indicates that many of the Milky Way's 200  
billion stars are likely to have planetary systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It implies that planets can form more easily than we ever  
imagined, and that our Milky Way is teeming with planetary 
systems,'' said Debra Fischer, one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers began their search for planets 12 years ago.  
They and their colleagues are responsible for finding 14 of the 20 
planets known to exist outside the Earth's solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	However, those planets were single bodies surrounding a star.  
This is the first time multiple planets around a star have been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	The innermost of the three planets, spotted in 1996, has at  
least 75 percent of the mass of Jupiter and is very close to its 
sun, orbiting once every 4.6 days. Jupiter is the largest planet in 
the solar system, 318 times the size of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The middle planet is twice Jupiter's mass and orbits the star  
every 242 days from a location about as far as Venus from the sun. 
The outer planet has the mass of four Jupiters and orbits its star 
every 3 1/2 to 4 years. It is more than twice as far from its star as 
Earth is from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Earthlike planets are unlikely to be found in such systems, the  
scientists said, because the forces generated by huge Jupiterlike 
planets moving in elliptical rather than circular orbits would kick 
smaller planets out into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have a multiple system, maybe a Rosetta stone to help  
us understand a lot of these weird planets we're finding,'' said R. 
Paul Butler by telephone from the Anglo-Australian Observatory in 
Epping, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rosetta stone is an ancient inscription in three languages  
that allowed scientists to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics. 
</P>
<P>
	Upsilon Andromedae is easily visible with the naked eye,  
although it is currently behind the sun and will not be seen until 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	The planets were discovered using a method that measures their  
gravitational pull on their star, not by direct observation. 
Planets' gravity tugs on their stars, causing them to wobble 
slightly. By examining the star's ultraviolet light transmissions, 
astronomers can calculate back-and-forth shifts in the ultraviolet 
wavelengths. A larger wobble indicates the orbiting planet is 
large. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am mystified at how such a system of Jupiterlike planets  
might have been created,'' said Geoffrey Marcy, professor of 
physics and astronomy at San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will shake up the theory of planet formation.''  
</P>
<P>
	Alex Wolszczan, an astronomy professor at Penn State University,  
called the discovery an important step toward understanding the 
cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been anticipated and awaited by the scientific  
community. It's nice to see it's finally happened,'' he said. 
``What I get right away from this particular discovery is that it 
emphasizes even more how different those systems are from our 
own.''

<HEADLINE> Brighter Days for Johnson &AMP; Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Johnson &AMP; Johnson investors, it's no more  
tears. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of setbacks and months of stagnant share prices,  
stock in the health care conglomerate has risen 25 percent since 
December amid a suddenly brighter outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Two upcoming products have helped buoy that sentiment. J&AMP;J hopes  
to soon get U.S. approval for Benecol, a margarine that lowers 
cholesterol, and Aciphex, a new ulcer and heartburn drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts are also betting the company known best as  
the maker of Tylenol, Band-Aids and Johnson's Baby Shampoo, is due 
for a change in fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not a whole lot is left that could go wrong,'' said Scott  
Wilken, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, J&AMP;J's diversity of health care products has made  
it one of Wall Street's most stellar performers and a leader among 
the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	But the year just past has been painful, punctuated in December  
when the company announced it was eliminating 4,100 jobs, or 4 
percent of its workforce, and taking an $800 million restructuring 
charge in hopes of improving productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``1998 was one of the more difficult years that Johnson &AMP;  
Johnson has encountered in a long time,'' Ralph Larsen, J&AMP;J's 
chairman and chief executive officer, told shareholders in the 
annual report released this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the disappointments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Two of J&AMP;J's promising drugs, one for stroke and one for  
diabetes, failed late in the research process. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Food and Drug Administration delayed approval of Benecol  
due to a dispute with the company over the level of testing needed 
to ensure its safety. 
</P>
<P>
	-- J&AMP;J lost a costly battle with the biotech company Amgen over  
the rights to an experimental anemia drug designed to help cancer 
patients withstand chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sales of J&AMP;J 's coronary stent-- a tiny metal scaffolding that  
props open cholesterol-clogged arteries -- tumbled after competitors 
introduced newer versions. Just, four years ago, J&AMP;J had virtually 
owned the stent market. 
</P>
<P>
	Though J&AMP;J is still most known for consumer goods such as  
Tylenol, consumer products today only comprise about 29 percent of 
sales and less than 10 percent of profits. Prescription drugs last 
year made up 36 percent of sales and 69 percent of profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts believe J&AMP;J might be better off concentrating  
solely on drugs to better compete with rivals like Merck &AMP;Co. and 
Pfizer. But J&AMP;J officials say their strength remains a diverse 
product line, which also includes contact lens, surgical products 
and other medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
	And J&AMP;J has decided to stay the course.  
</P>
<P>
	``Life is not a series of mountain tops to mountain tops,'' said  
Robert Darretta, J&AMP;J vice president of finance. ``Every 
organization has periods above and below average rate of growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the company's earnings grew by 11 percent not including  
the special charge. That disappointed investors used historical 
growth rates around 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Charlene Lu of Prudential Securities said she became  
more bullish to J&AMP;J after hearing Larsen acknowledge that the 
company had made mistakes and outlined a plan to fix J&AMP;J 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J is adding 800 pharmaceutical sales representatives in  
anticipation of its two new drugs, Lu said. The company also plans 
to buy products from other companies or acquire firms with 
potentially profitable drugs. Further, the company told analysts 
that it will kill drugs earlier in their pipelines if they lack 
promise to avoid embarrassments like last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see management stepping up to the plate,'' Lu said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of J&AMP;J have risen from $76 to $98 since December. On  
Wednesday shares fell $3.93 3/4 to $94.68 3/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange amid widespread profit taking of drug company stocks on 
Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Court May Hear Immigration Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has asked a federal  
appeals court to mediate a dispute over a controversial ballot 
measure that seeks to cut off schooling to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by 59 percent of voters in 1994, Proposition 187 has  
not been implemented. A federal court found the measure 
unconstitutional last year, but then-Gov. Pete Wilson appealed that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat who opposes Prop 187, could have thwarted the  
initiative by refusing to pursue Wilson's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Davis asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal's  
mediation panel to resolve the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a governor, not a judge. I have taken an oath to enforce  
all the laws of our state and our nation, regardless of my personal 
views on those laws,'' Davis said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative would exclude illegal immigrants from public  
schools and eliminate non-emergency health and welfare services for 
which they remain eligible. It also would require public agencies 
and employees to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether to continue the appeal has developed  
into the most significant political quandary of the early months of 
Davis' administration.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earnings Jump 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said today that strong sales in  
North America helped it post a 20 percent increase in operating 
earnings during the first quarter, beating Wall Street's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker reported operating earnings of $1.81  
billion, or $1.46 a share, in the first three months of the year 
compared with $1.51 billion, or $1.22 a share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's results were higher than Wall Street analysts'  
expectations. The average estimate of 10 analysts recently surveyed 
by First Call Corp. was for operating earnings of $1.39 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford stock was up 2 percent, or by $1.25, at $64 a share this  
morning on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating earnings exclude onetime gains that boosted the  
net income figures in both the latest period and in the first 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $38 billion, compared with $36.6 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ford team is energized and focused, and we were determined  
to make a fast start in 1999,'' said Jacques Nasser, president and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news for our consumers and shareholders is that the  
transformation of Ford is really just getting started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it was the 12th straight quarter that operating  
earnings had improved. Analyst John Casesa of Schroder &AMP; Co. said 
Ford benefitted from an excellent product mix in North America, 
with a wide array of popular light trucks and increased retail 
sales over less-profitable fleet sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they could run the whole company like they run North  
America, you wouldn't be able to stop these guys,'' Casesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reported a one-time, after-tax gain of $165 million from  
the sale of its share in the AutoEuropa joint venture in Portugal 
with Germany's Volkswagen AG. In last year's first quarter, Ford 
had a one-time, noncash gain of $15.9 billion from the spinoff of 
The Associates, in addition to $177 million in earnings from the 
former financial subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	With the one-time factors included, Ford's earnings totaled  
$1.98 billion, or $1.60 a share in the first quarter, compared with 
$17.65 billion, or $14.23 a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car business earned $1.49 billion, up 20 percent from a  
year ago, with surging sales in North America making up for a 
break-even quarter in Europe and losses in South America. Worldwide 
sales were $32 billion, up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, Ford said it earned $1.59 billion, up 57  
percent from a year ago. Ford said its high-profit truck sales were 
up 20 percent in the quarter, and car sales were up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the AutoEuropa gain, Ford said it would have broke even  
in Europe for the quarter, compared with earnings of $230 million a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's losses in South America grew substantially, rising to  
$165 million from $45 million a year ago. The company says it does 
not expect to earn a profit there this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses were about twice what Casesa was estimating; he  
called the result ``disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon, Ford's parts subsidiary, said it earned $208 million in  
the first quarter, up 10 percent from $189 million a year ago. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up 9 percent from $4.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit said it earned $300 million, up 8 percent from $278  
million last quarter. Hertz said it earned $49 million, up 14 
percent from a year ago. Ford's share of the company's earnings was 
$40 million.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Lashes IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though he wasn't there, Juan Antonio Samaranch  
no doubt got the message loud and clear: Members of the U.S. 
Congress aren't impressed with the pace of reform on the 
international Olympic scene, and they are prepared to do something 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	International Olympic Committee members Anita DeFrantz and James  
Easton, standing in for IOC president Samaranch, were grilled for 
45 minutes Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, 
which criticized a ``culture of corruption'' that has left the 
rings tarnished and the games defamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were expressed doubts about our intentions,'' DeFrantz  
said with understatement when asked how she would describe the 
hearing to Samaranch. ``When you're out to do a task, you like to 
have encouragement. Maybe we should use these doubts as 
encouragement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Sen. John McCain pulled no punches as he examined the  
worst corruption case in the 105-year-old modern Olympic movement 
and said he would consider a second hearing. He also said he would 
immediately introduce a bill to place the IOC under the Federal 
Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids bribery of foreign officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the White House said it hoped to have an answer  
soon on a USOC request to make the IOC a public body under 
international anti-corruption statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This issue is about the integrity of an institution and the  
public trust,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two committee members called for Samaranch to resign, and McCain  
seemed perturbed that the IOC president declined an invitation to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, however, the Arizona Republican appeared ready to  
take the go-slow approach advocated by former Senate Majority 
Leader George Mitchell, who suggested Congress give the IOC until 
the end of the year to adopt reforms before enacting any 
tax-exemption-related legislation that could hurt the international 
body financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have to be given the chance to make the  
recommended changes on their own,'' said Mitchell, chairman of an 
oversight panel that made several recommendations for IOC reform. 
</P>
<P>
	But DeFrantz, an IOC vice president hand-picked to testify by  
Samaranch, and Easton categorically endorsed just one of the 
Mitchell report's four main recommendations, on term limits for IOC 
members who now are essentially elected for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very interesting,'' McCain said with a raised eyebrow  
during the hearing. He later said he was ``very concerned about 
their lack of enthusiasm for the Mitchell commission 
recommendations,'' and that the IOC should carry the ``burden of 
proof'' if it fails to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said the IOC was dragging its feet on reforms.  
While he has created a 24-member task force to restructure the IOC, 
Samaranch has announced six members so far, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Another member of the Mitchell's committee, Ken Duberstein,  
noted that the U.S. Olympic Committee has already adopted the 
suggested reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USOC is following doctor's orders,'' Duberstein said.  
``The IOC prefers to get a second opinion to its liking. They want 
to take two aspirin and call the doctor in the morning -- sometime 
in the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spent large amounts of time trying to pin down the IOC  
members on financial matters, asking DeFrantz three times how much 
money the Olympic committee spent on direct support of athletes. 
DeFrantz finally said she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, McCain repeatedly asked how much the Lausanne,  
Switzerland-based IOC made each year. DeFrantz said the committee's 
budget was $40 million but did not know annual income figures, and 
finally had to ask for time to produce a written report, again 
being chastised by the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	News that the IOC kept the minutes of its general assemblies  
secret for 10 years, and those of executive board sessions locked 
up for 20 years, brought expressions of disbelief from McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty percent of the IOC's income is from American  
corporations and donations and the American people deserve to know 
what happens in those meetings,'' he told DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
	While McCain's attacks on the IOC and Samaranch weren't exactly  
subtle, other Senators were even more blunt. Democrats Ernest 
Hollings of South Carolina and Richard Bryan of Nevada said the IOC 
president should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this problem starts at the very top,'' Bryan said.  
Any reforms the IOC enacts, he said, ``would lack credibility 
unless he (Samaranch) takes the honorable action to step down.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today, with  
blue chips in record high territory for the fourth day in a row but 
technology and consumer stocks dropping once again. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
35.24 at 10,446.90, after rising 16.65 Wednesday to its third 
consecutive closing high of 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.52 today to  
1,317.92, and the Nasdaq composite index, which has a high number 
of technology stocks, was off 37.32 at 2,469.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's gain in the Dow came at the expense of technology  
and consumer stocks, which investors sold mercilessly to make room 
for cyclical issues, manufacturing and basic-materials stocks that 
are especially sensitive to changes in the economic outlook. That 
trend was continuing this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial stocks ``are rallying like crazy,'' said Charles  
White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``It feels like 
people who have been definitely underweighted in these sectors are 
coming in and buying. We're seeing some of these vast mutual fund 
complexes known for buying value stocks stepping up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh blow to technology stocks was a warning from Storage  
Technology, a maker of computer storage equipment, that it wouldn't 
meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. Storage Tech 
shares were down 8 1/16 at 18, and they pulled ECM, another 
computer storage company, down 11 7/8 to 113 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical stocks were lower amid investors' rush out of  
consumer shares. Dow member Merck was down 2 9/16 at 75 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports helped some stocks but not others.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Boeing's earnings far exceeded expectations,  
sending its shares up 4 at 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford Motor and General Motors posted first-quarter profits  
that surpassed analyst estimates. Ford down 1/2 62 1/4, but GM was down 
2 3/16 at 87 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta Air Lines was down 4 at 67 1/4, even after the company's  
earnings came in above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 504.95 million 
shares, up substantially from Wednesday's pace of 386.13 million.

<HEADLINE> Burger King Keeps Coke As Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Burger King Corp. has reached a new long-term  
agreement with Coca-Cola Co. to keep Coke as the soft-drink 
supplier for its restaurants in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal weren't announced, but it extends Coke's  
current 10-year run as supplier for Burger King's 8,200 restaurants 
in North America. The current agreement expires Sept. 30, and the 
new one, tied to volume, likely will last at least 10 more years. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke has supplied Burger King for most of the restaurant chain's  
history, starting with the first Burger King that opened in Miami 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi gained Burger King's soft-drink syrup business in 1984,  
but Coke won the fast-food chain back in 1990. Last year, Coke also 
reached a new 10-year agreement with Wendy's International 
fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are proud of the strong partnership we have developed with  
Burger King, and look forward to refreshing their customers and 
working together to build both of our businesses well into the 21st 
century,'' said Jack Stahl, Coke senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose to continue our relationship with Coca-Cola because  
of its preferred brands, technical and marketing capabilities that 
help drive soft-drink profitability, their strategic support, as 
well as their passion for helping us grow our business,'' said Paul 
Clayton, Burger King Corp.'s president for North America. Burger 
King is a subsidiary of Diageo PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Burger King also renewed a long-standing arrangement  
with Dr Pepper/Seven Up Inc. to keep Dr Pepper in Burger King's 
U.S. restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi-Cola had bid for the Burger King business and said  
Coca-Cola must have paid a high price to keep it. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Impeachment cost at least $1.2 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid its top impeachment  
investigators as much as $20,000 a month, part of the $1.2 
million-plus price tag for the five-month congressional proceedings 
that ended with President Clinton's acquittal, expense records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, chief Republican investigator David Schippers and  
Democratic counsel Abbe Lowell were given special consultant status 
that allowed them to bypass congressional restrictions on outside 
income and continue work at their private law firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers, whose private practice is in Chicago, was paid at the  
rate of $20,000 a month during the height of the investigation, 
according to House Judiciary Committee records. Lowell, a 
Washington lawyer, was paid at a monthly rate of $18,000, according 
to expense records reviewed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted to annual salary, both men were being paid at a rate of  
more than $200,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, staff lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
earn between $66,563 and $118,400 annually. The independent 
counsel's deputies must also sever ties with their private law 
firms -- a prohibition that does not apply to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators earn $136,700 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Judiciary Committee records, the panel paid for a  
portion of its investigation with $1.2 million from a special fund, 
which covered compensation for investigators, equipment, travel, 
communications, printing and other expenses solely related to 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to taxpayers was much higher, but can't be  
readily calculated because much of the staff work -- in the House, 
Senate and White House -- was performed by permanent, salaried 
employees who would be paid regardless of their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee granted the requests of Schippers and  
Lowell -- as well as several investigators under them -- to work as 
consultants rather than full-time congressional employees. The 
special status allowed them to avoid the restrictive House rules 
for lawmakers and senior staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers said he and his firm were losing money -- ``$40,000 in  
the hole'' at one point -- because he was paying his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My business was going to hell in a handbasket,'' he said in an  
interview. ``I was begging for it (consultant status) because I was 
really getting into financial difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was offered a straight salary of about $130,000 a  
year to handle the inquiry but declined because ``I would have had 
to take my name off the door'' of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment inquiry began Sept. 9 when Starr delivered a  
report to the House. In December, the House impeached Clinton on 
two articles alleging perjury and obstruction of justice and on 
Feb. 12 the Senate acquitted the president on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers and Lowell led the House Judiciary Committee  
investigation of Clinton's alleged offenses, and Schippers then 
assisted the 13 House GOP lawmakers named to prosecute the 
president at the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats have attacked the entire inquiry as an  
unnecessary expense, committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said 
that both Schippers and Lowell were worth the money because of 
``their work and sacrifices'' in a town where top private lawyers 
frequently earn upwards of $400 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the overall cost, Hyde said: ``I think that vindicating  
the Constitution is always worth it. I don't think there were any 
extravagances at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment-related expenses ranged from communications  
equipment to numerous trips by investigators. Most of the travel 
destinations were unspecified in the expense records. 
</P>
<P>
	A Xerox copier cost $14,440, a laser printer was $2,863, a  
shredder cost $2,399 and television was $4,354. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's private lawyers on the impeachment case, led by  
David Kendall of Washington, were paid from a legal defense fund 
created in early 1998 to help Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton with their lawyer bills. 
</P>
<P>
	By Feb. 25, the fund had paid $3 million of Clinton's legal  
expenses from the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the 
impeachment case and Starr's investigations. The legal expenses are 
expected to total about $10 million.

<HEADLINE> Shirley Jones Asked To Leave PTC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Howard Stern's badgering may have won him  
some unexpected results. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Jones and her husband, Marty Ingels, have parted ways  
with a conservative media watchdog group, citing an encounter with 
the shock jock. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star of ``The Partridge Family'' resigned as honorary  
co-chairman of the Parents Television Council this week, and Ingels 
was asked to resign as a member of the advisory board, Ingels said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still agree with the aims of the PTC,'' Ingels said, but  
they had reservations about the group's approach to reducing sex, 
violence and profanity on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, whose late-night CBS-TV show has been a particular target  
of the PTC, confronted Ms. Jones and Ingels on his radio show last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept asking ``Why would you want me thrown off the air?'''  
Ingels recalled. ``He said we were going along with McCarthy 
tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Ingels said, his wife re-examined the shows given a  
negative appraisal by the PTC and found she disagreed with the 
group in many cases.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes' Hill To Miss Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Sean Hill, one of the top defenseman for  
the Carolina Hurricanes, will miss at least the first round of the 
Stanley Cup playoffs with multiple fractures to his face, coach 
Paul Maurice said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hill was struck in the face with the puck by a slap shot off the  
stick of Ken Klee in the first period of Wednesday night's 3-0 
victory over the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the ice and did not return. X-rays revealed numerous  
fractures to the left side of his face and sinus damage that will 
require major reconstructive surgery, possibly as early as 
Saturday, said Maurice and team conditioning coach Pete Friesen. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors must wait until the blood clots in Hill's face heal  
before surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean Hill has a broken face, man,'' said a dejected Maurice.  
``He's got to get that thing put back together. It's not good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said doctors told him a best-case scenario would be for  
Hill's return in two weeks following surgery, but admitted that 
could be ``just dreaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friesen said a more realistic outlook would be four weeks or  
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of soft tissue damage in conjunction with this  
that he'll have to get over, not only the fracture,'' Friesen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year NHL veteran has had a rough time with the  
Hurricanes since being acquired from Ottawa in November 1997. Hill 
missed the final 13 games of last season with a broken fibula and 
16 games this season with a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``A guy can only go so far without getting a little bit down,''  
Friesen said. ``I think everybody is a little bit down because of 
this. He's a great guy in the locker room and now he's lost at a 
critical time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes, who won the Southeast Division, are the No. 3  
seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs and will face either 
Buffalo, Boston, Pittsburgh or Philadelphia next week in the first 
round of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said Hill's toughness in the corners will be missed in  
tight-checking playoff games. The defenseman is also a plus-9, 
third best on the team.

<HEADLINE> Artwork on Paris Bridge Causes Jam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- A monumental sculpture show portraying Custer's  
Last Stand and other artworks on a footbridge over the Seine River 
is causing a human traffic jam in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Security officials said Thursday they're regulating the flow of  
people walking across the Pont des Arts, which links the Left Bank 
to the Louvre, so visitors can get close to the larger-than-life 
portrayals of American Indians and African tribesmen. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 visitors, from foreign tourists to French school  
groups, cross the bridge daily. But weekends draw twice that many 
people, creating gridlock around the works. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Paris city hall denied recent media reports  
that the two-lane crush of people could undermine bridge security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bridge in wood and steel was conceived to handle many more  
tons than the weight of a few hundred people,'' said the 
spokeswoman on condition of customary anonymity. ``Neither the 
bridge nor the visitors are in any danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 68 works depicting the African Massai, Peuls and Nouba  
tribes, as well as the American Indians who triumphed over George 
Custer and his men at the 1876 battle at Little Big Horn, are by 
Ousmane Sow, a 63-year-old Senegalese artist trained as a physical 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	The realistic pieces in subtle earth tones, on display until May  
20, are made of wire, plaster, rubber and paper fiber coated with a 
special veneer to protect them from the elements. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a triumphant Indian brandishing a soldier's scalp,  
hand-to-hand combat, falling horses with nostrils flaring and Chief 
Sitting Bull at prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the fact that this sculpture is part of the environment  
and accessible to everyone,'' said Gerald Ganann, of Minneapolis, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	``The western pieces are very moving to people like me, who've  
been out to the Dakotas and seen the actual sites of the historical 
events'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Toddler Survives Third-Story Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A 21-month-old boy escaped serious injury  
when he knocked out a window in his third-floor apartment while 
playing on his bed and fell about 30 feet to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Varing landed on grass, surrounded by glass shards.  
Latches holding the window in place gave way after the boy pushed 
or fell against the window, said police officer Dana Jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just amazing,'' Jabs said. ``There's absolutely nothing  
wrong with that child. I think somebody was watching over him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony's mother, Jody Varing, was a short distance away in the  
bathroom when her son fell Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at Children's Hospital said Anthony suffered no internal  
injuries. His mother and police said he had some cuts from the 
glass, but otherwise was fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taking a nap now; he's had a long day,'' Jody Varing  
said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Comes Up With Payment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- The NCAA will ask each of its 310  
Division I member schools to share the pain in the $54.5 million 
settlement in the restricted-earnings case. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a plan approved this week by the management council,  
payments into the settlement fund would range from a low of about 
$77,000 for small schools, many of which had few 
restricted-earnings coaches, to around $200,000 for each of the 
big-time institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA faced a potential revolt from its money-making Division  
I schools if they had been asked to shoulder the entire amount, 
which will be distributed among roughly 2,000 coaches in various 
sports whose salaries were unlawfully capped by the NCAA at $16,000 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller schools argued they should have to pay little if  
anything. The major schools noted that the small schools voted for 
the rule and also receive money from the men's basketball 
tournament while rarely contributing much to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what they've come up with shows Solomon-like wisdom,''  
said Patty Viverito, associate commissioner of the Missouri Valley 
Conference. ``It was a compromise in the truest sense of the 
word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for the NCAA to use about $18 million in cash  
reserves. Most of the rest will come from future funds to be 
distributed to schools from CBS' television contract for the men's 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the reserves and the projected future distribution, the  
amount each school actually will pay by May 7 will be far less than 
its total bill. ACC schools, for example, will ultimately be 
responsible for the highest amount, $239,989 each, according to 
NCAA figures. 
</P>
<P>
	But each ACC school will have to pay up front only $50,533. The  
most any school must pay up front will be about $57,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be people who are not happy. But we've got a bill  
to pay, ladies and gentlemen, let's get on with it,'' Viverito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which goes to the NCAA's board of directors for final  
approval, was agreed upon during the management council meetings, 
and after what one representative of small schools described as a 
``subtle threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But NCAA president Cedric Dempsey said there was no threat of  
any kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was framed right at the beginning that neither of the two  
extreme arguments were acceptable,'' Dempsey said. ``I don't know 
if someone would have misperceived that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA must submit the full cash payment of $54.5 million to  
lawyers for the restricted earnings coaches by May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches, however, probably won't see any of that money until  
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been advising the coaches we would like to see payments  
made within the next 6-to-8 months,'' said Lori Schultz, one of the 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The coaches will be compensated according to what sport they  
coached, for how long and where. Schultz said very few will receive 
any significant amount above what they would have earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many small Division I schools, Campbell University of Buies  
Creek, N.C., voted for the restricted-earnings rule in 1991. Yet 
Campbell never had an assistant who made more than $12,000 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the NCAA is the villain in this. I think the  
courts are,'' Campbell athletic director Tom Collins said. ``Our 
assessment is $57,000, and that is going to hurt us. But I don't 
think our coaches suffered $57,000 worth of damages.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Pilots Battle Over Bedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta pilots derisively call it ``the coffin.''  
</P>
<P>
	The snug new bunkbed unit aboard the airline's long-haul flights  
has crew members complaining of too little elbow room and too much 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta insists the onboard bedding is among the best in the  
industry, but the pilots' union says the bunks put passengers at 
risk by making it tough for the crew to catch needed rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate touched passengers on a Delta flight from Atlanta to  
Tokyo when the pilot cut short the 14-hour flight and landed in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Roscoe McMillan, a 30-year veteran, said the four-man crew  
was unable to rest in the bunks, jeopardizing the safety of the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt it would compromise his level of comfort and what he  
wanted as an acceptable safety margin,'' said Capt. Andy Deane, a 
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, Delta's pilots' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident involving McMillan was the latest salvo in a  
long-running battle between pilots and Delta, which had shrunk the 
sleeping space on some planes to make more room for higher-paying 
business class passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has filed a grievance with the company, asking for  
bunks that allow for more space and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's small. It lacks adequate privacy considerations and it's  
in a noisy area where the activities of the cabin and the cockpit 
make it difficult if not impossible to get sleep,'' Deane said. 
``Simply being horizontal is not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta says the bunks are safe and approved by the Federal  
Aviation Administration. The airline has questioned McMillan and 
his three-member crew, and the pilots' union fears he could be 
fired if the airline decides he acted out of rebellion rather than 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The aborted flight April 7 was disclosed in a report in The Wall  
Street Journal Thursday. It angered passengers, who were forced to 
wait for another flight to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilots said they had tried to use the sleep module and  
were unable to get to sleep because of outside noise. The captain, 
because of that, made his decision,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry 
said Thursday. ``He felt that his crew could not be sufficiently 
rested to complete the flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were told before the plane landed that ``crew rest  
issues'' had caused the captain to turn back, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry wouldn't say if Delta is considering sanctioning the  
pilot, who is just 11 months from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Deane said he fears the airline suspects ``this was an act  
perhaps of premeditation or he was doing this as a gesture of 
defiance over the rest facility. That is not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMillan declined to comment when contacted at home Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The FAA requires airlines to provide onboard sleeping quarters  
for pilots on flights of 12 hours or more. A crew of four -- two 
pilots, two co-pilots -- take turns at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Delta flights exceeding 12 hours are nonstop from  
Atlanta to Tokyo. Three Delta MD-11s are equipped with the bunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, crew members used walled-off sleeping quarters  
-- pilots called them ``the condo'' -- located in the middle of the 
business-class section. At nearly 7-feet tall and 5-feet wide, it 
was spacious enough for changing clothes and far enough from the 
cockpit's noisy hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bunks are located between the cockpit and the business  
class area and include a 2-inch thick curtain to keep out noise. 
Pilots have to assemble the bunks in front of the passengers, 
pulling them out from the wall in telescoping sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said the captain can ask flight attendants to keep noise  
levels down when people are trying to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do your best to create a facility that it conducive to  
sleep,'' Berry said. ``It's FAA-approved. It's the largest of its 
type of units used by other airlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said Delta is looking into making improvements to the  
sleeping quarters, such as giving crew members a bit more elbow 
room.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends NATO Air Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today that a united  
NATO is determined ``to maintain and intensify attacks'' against 
the Serbs to save Kosovo and to guarantee the security of its 
ethnic Albanians with an international force. He invited Russia to 
join such an effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the  
NATO air war will be waged until Slobodan Milsevic's forces are so 
weakened they yield their grip on the province or permit ethnic 
Albanian refugees to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering editors' questions, Clinton said the mistaken bombing  
that the Yugoslavs said killed 75 refugees near the Albanian border 
was regrettable and tragic, but no reason to change the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like  
this occurring,'' he said. ``This is not a business of 
perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton said the refugees would not have been in harm's way  
had not Milosevic's forces driven them from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot simply watch as hundreds of thousand of people are  
brutalized, murdered, raped, forced from their homes ... all in the 
name of ethnic pride,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked how he would respond to radio talk show  
critics who question whether he has the moral authority to be 
commander in chief and how he would answer to an Air Force pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't have to. ``I am his commander in chief,'' and  
U.S. pilots are performing admirably. ``They don't deserve to hear 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the possibility of Russian aid in protecting ethnic  
Albanians once the bloodshed ends, Clinton it is ``the kind of 
mission I hope Russia can join as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, bitter opponents of the current air campaign,  
joined the peacekeeping force that settled ethnic strive in Bosnia 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The president began by saying that the forum itself was striking  
evidence of the difference between a free press and a closed press. 
He said the government run press in Yugoslavia ``has created an 
alternative reality'' based on propaganda about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness our press and the press around the world have  
tried to get at and get out the truth,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long term, he said, NATO is fighting for the future and  
stability of multiethnic democracies in southeastern Europe, the 
historically troubled Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our NATO allies are in Kosovo today because we want to  
stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic's aim was to drive the Albanian majority from  
the province even if it means turning Kosovo ``into a lifeless 
wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Yugoslav leader also sought to divide NATO, but  
after three weeks, the alliance is solid. He said ``NATO is more 
united today than when the operation began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned  
and long premeditated attack on an entire people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO will end it, and will at the same time increase  
efforts to help the more than 500,000 refugees driven from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One editor told Clinton that he had heard the Pentagon had  
intelligence that Milosevic's forces had chemical weapons. He asked 
what the U.S. response would be to use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it would be ``swift and overwhelming. ... I think  
they are well aware of the dangers of overly escalating this. ... 
That's all I should say right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Clinton's staff signaled an end to the  
question-and-answer session, but the president said he would go on. 
``They think the longer I stay up here, the greater my chances of 
screwing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lack of information released by the military  
about bombing attacks, Clinton explained that there were problems 
with weather and with coordinating the response with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware this is a difficulty, I am working on it, and trying  
to get NATO to do more as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he feels ``the more information we can get out  
there quickly, the better off we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the convention hotel, several hundred protesters chanted  
``No war, no bombs, no new Vietnam.'' A smaller group demonstrated 
in support of the NATO campaign.

<HEADLINE>  Bust Clouds Strawberry's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- By most accounts, Darryl Strawberry was well  
on his way back to the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder had completed chemotherapy  
treatment for colon cancer and was expected join Triple-A Columbus 
as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He was involved in charitable activities and spoke this week  
about how his illness changed his perspective on life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's made me more aware of my purpose of living and who I'm  
living for,'' the eight-time outfielder said on ABC's ``20/20'' 
during an interview aired Monday -- two nights before his arrest by 
Tampa police on drug and prostitution charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I'm not living for me, Darryl Strawberry, to play  
baseball and be a hero at that anymore. You know, I'm living for, 
you know, the grace that God has given to me and allowed me to -- to 
be able to walk, walk on the baseball field again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take the 37-year-old slugger long to figure out the  
consequences of his latest brush with the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he was apologetic about the charges of possession of  
cocaine and soliciting a prostitute that cloud his future in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He asked several times, if there was anything that we could do  
to change this situation, because this was going to ruin his 
career,'' an investigative report read. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unfortunate thing for Mr. Strawberry, but there's no  
question in our mind what had transpired,'' police spokesman Joe 
Durkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said the powder cocaine found wrapped in a $20 bill  
inside the outfielder's wallet did not belong to him. And while he 
acknowledged discussing sex with a female undercover officer 
Wednesday night, he insisted he was joking around. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated the street value of the cocaine at $20.  
</P>
<P>
	``The $20 bill was folded up to keep it in place,'' Durkin said,  
adding the .3 grams -- about 100th of an ounce -- was enough for 
about ``one hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest was the latest jolt in Strawberry's troubled personal  
and professional life, which has been beset by cocaine and alcohol 
abuse, income tax evasion, domestic strife, failure to make child 
support payments and -- last fall -- a diagnosis of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who lives in Tampa, was in  
Cleveland to attend a funeral and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonn Trost, the Yankees' general counsel, declined comment,  
saying the team would allow the legal process to run its course 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig called the arrest ``a painful  
episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, a lot of people are looking into it. We've been in  
contact with the players' association and the Yankees, and we have 
to let the justice system work here,'' Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was in seclusion, breaking from his daily routine of  
working out at the Yankees' minor-league complex, where he has been 
preparing for a comeback from his cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not here, and he's not going to be here for a while,''  
Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of player development 
said. ``I don't know what's going to happen down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who waived his right to have an attorney present  
during questioning, told police the cocaine might have been left in 
the vehicle by a driver or passengers from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielder said his wife's uncle, Rodney Simon, used the  
vehicle Tuesday night and it was possible Simon or others in the 
car might have left the folded $20 bill in the glove box where 
Strawberry found it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry said he was joking around with the undercover officer  
about sex and drove off with no intention of meeting her at a 
nearby motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the good stuff?,'' the police report quoted  
Strawberry as asking the undercover officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the good stuff,'' the officer responded.  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Where can I get some good stuff to party with.''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``I don't have any, but you can get it from anyone  
walking down the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``Do you want to party?''  
</P>
<P>
	Officer: ``Yes, I want to party. What do you want?''  
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry: ``I want it all.''  
</P>
<P>
	The baseball player, carrying $1,159.10 in cash, then arranged  
to have sex for $50, the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators interviewed Simon by telephone at Strawberry's  
urging. They were told Simon was using Strawberry's vehicle the 
previous night and that he had been accompanied by friends. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon ``denied that he used or even saw cocaine last  
night,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who hit .247 with 24 homers and 57 RBIs for the  
Yankees last season, is not a stranger to substance abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He entered a center for alcohol rehabilitation in 1990 and spent  
four weeks undergoing treatent for a subtance abuse problem in 
1994. The following year, major league baseball suspended him for 
60 days after he tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's had financial woes, too.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal court ordered him in 1995 to repay $350,000 in back  
taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement, except 
for games. He was once also accused of failing to make timely 
payments to an ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Split on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- As the world increasingly looks to  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations for a solution 
to the Kosovo crisis, the Security Council's divide illustrates the 
chasm that must be bridged. 
</P>
<P>
	It's Russia and China vs. the United States and its NATO allies.  
Again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it's not the Cold War battle of communists and  
capitalists. But the rhetoric is equally heated, and at the moment 
there are no signs of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	As Wednesday's council meeting on the humanitarian crisis in  
Macedonia and Montenegro demonstrated, the protagonists are focused 
on different sides of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov has decried the impact of  
NATO bombing on innocent civilians at every recent Security Council 
meeting -- and Wednesday he denounced the attack on a Yugoslav 
bridge while a train was crossing as ``barbaric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun went even further, claiming  
the twin NATO strikes on the bridge deliberately targeted civilians 
as an act of terror, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO members on the council countered that the alliance  
expressed regret about the bridge bombing -- and pointedly noted 
that there had been no expressions of regret about the hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians expelled or forced from their homes 
by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no targeting -- none, zero in terms of NATO  
planning,'' said deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies then tried to push for a council statement demanding  
that Yugoslav authorities immediately release two Australian 
humanitarian workers whom Belgrade has accused of spying -- but 
Russia opposed asking for their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the debate, council members could agree only on a  
statement calling for immediate consular access to the Australians 
and expressing ``deepest concern at the grave humanitarian 
situation in and around Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Security Council's divisions have relegated it to the  
sidelines so far, last week's peace initiative by the 
secretary-general and Wednesday's proposal by Germany -- which 
suggests a U.N. peacekeeping role -- could make the council a 
significant player in a Kosovo settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union on Wednesday backed Annan's five-point  
proposal, which closely resembles NATO's conditions for stopping 
airstrikes. It calls for Yugoslavia to end the intimidation and 
expulsion of civilians, withdraw military forces, and allow 
deployment of an international military force to help the return of 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no talk Wednesday in the Security Council of any peace  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Danilo Turk said Annan's ``very  
carefully crafted'' initiative provides the framework for a 
solution -- but he said ``conditions are not yet ripe'' for any 
council action. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the German proposal, Lavrov said when NATO is ready  
to stop the bombing, the council might be ready to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Burleigh said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must  
take the first step.

<HEADLINE> Media Frenzy Following Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Hours before what may have been Wayne  
Gretzky's final NHL game in his native Canada, Ottawa Senators 
goaltender Ron Tugnutt looked forward to perhaps being part of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a bench-clearing brawl during the warmup so I  
can go out and grab his stick,'' Tugnutt joked Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran goalie is among those who don't believe the  
38-year-old Gretzky will retire after the New York Rangers' final 
regular-season game on Sunday, but the commotion at the Corel 
Centre could not be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers opted not to have a game-day skate, keeping Gretzky  
well clear of the media mob that has begun to track his every move. 
Instead, the reporters invaded the usually tranquil Senators' 
dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	There, they found consensus on one issue -- if Gretzky opts to  
retire after 20 record-setting seasons, it won't be because he no 
longer contributes on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Gretzky's reasons are for pondering retirement -- a sore  
back, a losing team in New York, the stifling trap system of the 
1990s, having reached all the milestones -- they can't include no 
longer being able to help his team win. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hands are still there -- they haven't gone anywhere,'' said  
Tugnutt. ``It's strange to say, but he's more dangerous behind the 
net than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a talent no one else has.''  
</P>
<P>
	Behind the net -- Gretzky's ``office'' that he uses for pinpoint  
passes to wings and charging defensemen -- has been his favorite 
setup spot since he broke into the league in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gretzky went into the Ottawa game with only nine goals  
-- well below his 1981-82 record of 92 -- he had 52 assists, better 
than all but an elite handful in the 27-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the blue-line in, he's still one of the best at finding  
an open man and making things happen,'' said Senators wing Daniel 
Alfredsson. ``When I'm 38, I hope I can still walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have the same speed, but he reads the game as well  
as anybody. Before he gets the puck, he knows what he's going to do 
with it. He's one of the few guys who can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Alfredsson first witnessed the magic when the  
Gretzky Tour - a pickup team of NHLers organized during the 1994-95 
NHL lockout -- visited his Frolunda club in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we lost 5-3, but that was a special game for me,''  
Alfredsson said. ``He's probably the best player ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he plays another year. It's a treat just to watch  
him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In agreement was Senators coach Jacques Martin.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a factor in a game,'' Martin said. ``Look at his  
production with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still an elite player with tremendous skill and  
anticipation. If you don't watch him, he'll hurt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz over Gretzky's possible retirement made the Senators  
the hottest ticket in Ottawa, clearly overshadowing the team's race 
with New Jersey for first place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senators did not feel slighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a game we remember forever,'' Alfredsson said.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Burn 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Diego Serna scored a late tying  
goal and Jeff Cassar made three saves in the shootout as the Miami 
Fusion rallied for a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Burn on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami won the shootout 3-0 as Henry Gutierrez, Jay Heaps and Leo  
Cullen scored on Dallas goalkeeper Matt Jordan. Cassar saved 
attempts by the Burn's Brian Haynes, Temoc Suarez and Mickey 
Trotman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion, which had lost its previous two matches by 4-1  
scores, won despite the absence of star midfielder Carlos 
Valderrama. The veteran midfielder has been benched indefinitely by 
coach Ivo Wortmann. 
</P>
<P>
	The win capped a contentious week for Wortmann, who told  
Valderrama that he doesn't fit Miami's system of play. 
</P>
<P>
	With Valderrama out, Wortmann's starting lineup had four rookies  
and three second-year players. The Fusion got even younger in the 
25th minute when second-year forward Jason Boyce replaced Brazilian 
forward Roberto Gaucho, who left the game with an injured shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas played the final 47 minutes with 10 men after captain  
Richard Farrer was given a red card by referee Robert Sheker for a 
hard slide tackle on Miami's Nelson Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Serna's goal in the 74th minute, the Fusion's inexperience  
proved to be a bigger shortcoming than the Burn's one-man deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas took a 1-0 lead in the 58th minute when Dante Washington  
scored on a breakaway against Cassar after beating Miami's offside 
trap. Fusion rookie defender Jeremy Aldrich failed to push up on 
the trap, leaving Washington onside to receive a cross from Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna equalized for Miami 16 minutes later when he headed Henry  
Gutierrez's free kick into the far netting. The goal was the first 
allowed by Dallas this season, and broke a 402-minute scoreless 
streak by the Burn dating to last season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The annual income tax filing deadline has come  
and gone, but Republicans in Congress say they won't abandon their 
promises to cut taxes this year despite many obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will succeed,'' vowed House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,  
R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But once again, the GOP-led House failed in its annual April 15  
vote to push through a proposed constitutional amendment to require 
that most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress instead 
of a simple majority. The amendment itself required a two-thirds 
majority, and the 229-199 vote Thursday was short by 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax  
rally featuring top GOP leaders, enabled Republicans to remind 
voters that tax relief tops their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day when people are particularly sensitized, and they  
need to know which party wants to cut their taxes,'' said Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also chose Thursday to rush through legislation  
giving tax breaks to troops involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
Sponsors said the measure extends the relief to more support 
personnel than a nearly identical executive order signed by 
President Clinton this week for soldiers in the combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pointed out that five of  
the GOP's top 10 priority bills deal with tax relief and 
Republicans in the House and Senate have adopted a budget blueprint 
promising an unspecified $778 billion tax cut using projected 
government surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's an overcharge to the American people, they ought  
to get a refund,'' Hastert said at the rally. ``We need to hold 
down the tax burden on the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans are having a tough time deciding which taxes  
to cut. They have already backed away from a proposed 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut and face a money crunch that is 
likely to allow for only modest relief in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment to limit tax increases  
went down to defeat for the fifth straight year. All but a handful 
of Republicans voted for the measure, while most Democrats were 
against it and derided it as little more than an April 15 stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a gimmick,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
top Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. 
``This annual attempt to tinker with the Constitution will never 
provide a penny of tax relief to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents, noting that 14 states have similar laws,  
promised they would not give up and said it was worthwhile to have 
the debate each April 15, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other tax-related hearings and events in the  
Capitol, including introduction of a bill to abolish the income tax 
entirely -- it was created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment -- and 
replace it with a 15 percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	One other annual announcement came from the Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, which said May 11 will be this year's 
``Tax Freedom Day.'' The foundation calculates it would take until 
then -- a day later than last year -- for the average American to 
earn enough to pay his or her share of all federal, state and local 
individual and corporate taxes.

<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Friday morning on buying by  
foreign and domestic investors, rebounding sharply from the 
previous day's decline. The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average climbed 236.48 points, or 1.41 percent,  
to 16,963.56 at the end of the morning session. On Thursday, the 
average closed down 37.60 points, or 0.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.74 yen at late morning, down 0.06 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its level of 118.83 yen in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices moved higher, boosted by  
heavy buying from investors anticipating economic improvement in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Individual investors are very active,'' said Tsuyoshi  
Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier rally on Wall Street also encouraged investors in  
Tokyo, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.06 points  
-- or 0.5 percent -- to another record high of 10,462.72, topping the 
previous record close of 10,411.66 set Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Early gainers in Tokyo included Honda Motor Co. Its share price  
soared after the Nihon Keizai business daily reported that the 
Japanese automaker will build a new plant in the U.S. or Canada by 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno later denied the report, saying  
his company had made no decision to build another North American 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 15.78 points, or 1.18 percent, to 
1,353.71. The TOPIX closed down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar drifted lower in the  
absence of major market-moving news ahead of the weekend, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.46 yen, down  
from 128.27 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.600  
percent from its close of 1.575 percent Thursday, pushing its price 
down to 101.74 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Bogus Internet Report Nets Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A technology company employee was arrested  
Thursday on charges he fabricated an Internet news report that 
drove up the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax involving telecommunications manufacturer  
PairGain Technologies is believed to be the first stock 
manipulation scheme using a fraudulent Internet site, U.S. Attorney 
Alejandro N. Mayorkas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Dale Hoke, 25, a low-level PairGain engineer, was arrested  
at his Raleigh, N.C., home after an FBI trace of Internet addresses 
led to him, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed and upset that the trail seemed to lead to  
one of our employees,'' said Charles McBrayer, PairGain's senior 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke was arraigned on securities fraud charges and released on  
$50,000 bail. The crime is punishable by up to 10 years in federal 
prison and a $1 million fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke is an engineer at PairGain's Raleigh facility.  
</P>
<P>
	Sam Currin, Hoke's attorney, said he will be discussing the case  
with the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles to set a time for 
Hoke to travel to California and enter a plea, The News &AMP; Observer 
of Raleigh reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Hoke did not return phone calls and no one  
answered the door at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	The hoax included a phony story about a corporate takeover made  
up to look like it was posted on a Bloomberg News Service Web site. 
It caused a 31 percent increase in the stock value of PairGain, a 
Tustin, Calif., maker of telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock dropped after the report was debunked later  
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Hoke also allegedly posted a bogus e-mail  
message about PairGain under the subject line ``Buyout News'' on a 
financial news message board operated by Yahoo Inc. The message 
contained a link to the bogus Bloomberg site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke has a history of online securities trading and had owned  
stock in the company as recently as January, according to a federal 
affidavit filed Thursday. But the complaint does not allege Hoke 
was holding PairGain stock during the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
	PairGain executives were not involved in the scheme and are  
cooperating with investigators, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher 
Painter said.

<HEADLINE> Tax Procrastinators Face Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the millions of Americans rushing to meet  
tonight's income tax deadline, consider this: Many middle-class 
people are actually paying slightly less in federal taxes than they 
did in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, taxpayers with the  
median family income -- about $39,000 in 1999 -- will pay 18.9 
percent of their income in all federal taxes this year. That 
compares to 19.7 percent four years ago, and is about $400 less. 
</P>
<P>
	That might provide some small comfort as people rush to one of  
the hundreds of larger post offices that will stay open late, many 
until midnight local time, to handle the crush of up to 40 million 
state and federal tax returns to be dispatched today. 
</P>
<P>
	A reminder: If you can't finish in time, file for an extension  
using Form 4868 and pay the Internal Revenue Service as much of 
your estimated bill as possible to avoid interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also pay by MasterCard, American Express or Discover  
card by calling 1-888-2PAYTAX -- for a 2.5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expects to receive 126 million individual income tax  
returns this year, with total income taxes projected at $828.6 
billion. That's just under half the $1.7 trillion in overall 
federal tax collections used to pay for everything from cruise 
missiles to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Working people pay more in U.S. taxes than more than 40,000  
foreign-controlled corporations operating in this country. The 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
reported Wednesday that tax loopholes allowed a majority of 
foreign-based companies to escape any taxes in 1995 -- a loss to the 
government estimated at $35 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of citizenship here, but these corporations are  
getting by in many cases with a free ride,'' said Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., who released the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mainly because of new child and education credits,  
Americans are enjoying much larger refunds -- $1,563 on average, 15 
percent above last year. And they've used computers to 
electronically file 21.1 million returns, almost 24 percent more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury is still out on whether the much-publicized IRS  
reform law is making the agency treat taxpayers better. Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, whose hearings last year 
helped spark the reforms, said he believes only about 20 percent of 
all IRS employees support the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, a bureaucracy will say, 'We'll just wait it out,'''  
said Roth, R-Del. ``We're talking about changing attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, however, told the Finance  
Committee on Wednesday that key changes include a new 
service-oriented mission statement, ways to rate employees that 
don't include enforcement quotas and a reorganization to create 
four separate operations aimed at individual taxpayers, small 
businesses, large corporations and tax-exempt entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little doubt that real change is occurring,''  
said Rossotti, who has been in his position 17 months. ``We have 
only just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who cannot pay, the IRS has relaxed its  
``offer-in-compromise'' program to let more taxpayers negotiate a 
lower settlement of their tax bills. Rossotti promised the new 
rules would prevent a duplication of last year's 80,000 rejections 
out of 105,000 offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Installment agreements are also easier to get. In almost all  
cases, the IRS will automatically accept a request for an 
installment plan -- attach Form 9465 to your return to request one -- 
as long as the amount owed is $25,000 or less and the taxpayer 
agrees to pay within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more people are depending on professional tax preparers  
to do their taxes -- an estimated 61 million returns this year. One 
big reason is the tax code's complexity, which Congress increased 
the past two years with more than 1,200 tax law changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether taxpayers will have to deal with more  
changes next year. Congressional Republicans are pushing through 
budget blueprints that call for some $800 billion in tax relief 
over the next decade, but there is very little money for tax cuts 
in fiscal 2000 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet anti-tax sentiment continues to run high on Capitol Hill.  
Coinciding with the tax deadline, the House today was planning to 
debate for the fifth year in a row a proposed constitutional 
amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to pass most tax 
increases. The measure has no chance of passing.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Leaves for Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole left Thursday for Macedonia to  
visit Kosovo refugees as she planned to assess the Yugoslavia 
crisis and burnish her foreign affairs credentials for the 2000 
presidential campaign 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican strategists were divided over whether the two-day  
trip by the former American Red Cross president would boost a 
campaign that has shown signs of stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to discuss the trip from a political point of  
view, because that's not the purpose of the trip,'' Dole spokesman 
Ari Fleischer said. ``She's going because she's concerned about the 
humanitarian crisis and wants to personally assess the role of the 
United States should and could play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, advisers say privately that the trip will highlight her  
years of relief work with the Red Cross and draw much-needed 
attention to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole planned to tour a refugee camp Friday and visit a  
Macedonia family housing Kosovars. She tours another camp Saturday 
before returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleischer said Mrs. Dole planned to present her findings in a  
speech next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the smartest strategic move she has made since  
January,'' said Scott Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential 
campaign of her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovo crisis is front and center and in the national  
news. She needs to highlight her foreign policy credentials and 
there's no better way to do it than to build on her role as 
president of the Red Cross,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip began one day after Mrs. Dole laid out her foreign  
policy beliefs in a speech to midshipmen at the United States Naval 
Academy. She criticized Clinton and urged the president to ``use 
all the power necessary'' to win in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, a former Cabinet secretary under two GOP presidents  
and a veteran of national political campaigns, consistently fares 
well in public opinion surveys. Most polls place Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush atop the GOP field, with Mrs. Dole in second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she has had trouble raising money, has moved slowly to build  
key-state operations and only recently found her voice on national 
issues such as abortion and foreign policy. Some GOP strategists 
doubted that the solutions to her problems can be found an ocean 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``She will get more benefit out of going to New Hampshire and  
organizing for an election that is less than a year away,'' said 
Dave Carney, a New Hampshire consultant with national campaign 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, she is running an unusual, nontraditional campaign  
and trying to do it through the media. Maybe people are right, 
though, and she is running for vice president and burnishing her 
credentials,'' Carney said. ``I don't know what her strategy is, 
but if you're running for vice president it doesn't hurt to get out 
of the country to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole has said she is preparing to run for president, not  
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a McCain-lite strategy,'' said Republican  
consultant Mike Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a former Vietnam War prisoner of  
war, has increased interest in his presidential campaign with a 
flurry of interviews and speeches about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has ... experience in relief work so this is a good  
opportunity to express that and try to get on some front pages, 
where she's been missing for some time,'' Murphy said. ``Her 
campaign is clearly stalling so I think this is an attempt to 
jump-start it. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, Carney and Reed are not working for any presidential  
hopefuls, though Murphy informally advises McCain and former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander.

<HEADLINE>  Spain May Seek Pinochet Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's top law enforcement official dashed Gen.  
Augusto Pinochet's hopes of immediately returning home by ruling 
today that Spain can continue seeking the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that even though the House of Lords  
drastically reduced the case against the 83-year general last 
month, Home Secretary Jack Straw considered the remaining charges -- 
which include torture and conspiracy to torture -- serious enough to 
go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will wait to see the full explanation offered by Mr. Straw,  
but this clearly indicates that the government wants to prosecute 
the general,'' said Patrick Robinson, a spokesman for Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	The human rights group Amnesty International hailed the ruling,  
saying Pinochet's alleged victims and their relatives were ``one 
major step closer to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains under armed guard at a mansion outside  
London, now faces the prospect of months or possibly years in 
British courts battling Spain's attempt to bring him to trial for 
allegedly torturing opponents while in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision marked the second time Straw has ruled against  
the general. He had asked to reconsider Spain's extradition request 
after the law lords' ruling last month. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet's lawyers said they would need time to study  
Straw's ruling to determine grounds for an appeal, a magistrate 
adjourned extradition proceedings until April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish warrant  
that alleged thousands of abuses committed during his 17-year 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or  
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after he toppled the 
country's elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, in a groundbreaking decision, Britain's highest  
court ruled that he enjoyed a limited immunity from arrest as a 
former head of state. They said most of the charges against the 
general had to be dismissed because they predated Britain's 1988 
adoption of an international law against torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, however, was denied immunity for acts committed after  
1988, which upheld enough of the case to keep Spain's extradition 
request alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The general's lawyers then immediately filed their next  
challenge in the High Court, attacking Straw's December decision 
allowing the extradition process to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The court granted Straw's request to reconsider the case afresh,  
giving him until today to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Straw had to pore over a mountain of evidence and  
public appeals from all sides. But, unlike the courts, he also was 
allowed to consider political and humanitarian factors, in addition 
to legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the law lords reduced the number of charges, the Home  
Office said Straw concluded that ``the remaining offenses for which 
return has been sought are serious, and in the nature of those for 
which, domestically, passage of time would not be regarded as 
restricting prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw did not consider the possibility of a trial in Chile as an  
alternative to extradition, the Home Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under English law, extradition requests are allowed to proceed  
through the courts only with the home secretary's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	With Straw's go-ahead, legal experts said they expect the  
prosecuting lawyers now to prepare a fresh arrest warrant based on 
the reduced charges. That warrant will probably include some of the 
new cases of torture and torture conspiracy that Spanish Judge 
Baltasar Garzon has added in recent months to bolster his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon had no immediate comment. But lawyers involved in the  
Spanish case hailed Straw's ruling as a blow to what they called 
conservative elements in Britain, the United States and Chile 
exerting political pressure for London to free the general.

Augusto Pinochet's hopes of immediately returning home by ruling 
today that Spain can continue seeking the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that even though the House of Lords  
drastically reduced the case against the 83-year general last 
month, Home Secretary Jack Straw considered the remaining charges -- 
which include torture and conspiracy to torture -- serious enough to 
go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will wait to see the full explanation offered by Mr. Straw,  
but this clearly indicates that the government wants to prosecute 
the general,'' said Patrick Robinson, a spokesman for Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	The human rights group Amnesty International hailed the ruling,  
saying Pinochet's alleged victims and their relatives were ``one 
major step closer to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who remains under armed guard at a mansion outside  
London, now faces the prospect of months or possibly years in 
British courts battling Spain's attempt to bring him to trial for 
allegedly torturing opponents while in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision marked the second time Straw has ruled against  
the general. He had asked to reconsider Spain's extradition request 
after the law lords' ruling last month. 
</P>
<P>
	After Pinochet's lawyers said they would need time to study  
Straw's ruling to determine grounds for an appeal, a magistrate 
adjourned extradition proceedings until April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish warrant  
that alleged thousands of abuses committed during his 17-year 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or  
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after he toppled the 
country's elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, in a groundbreaking decision, Britain's highest  
court ruled that he enjoyed a limited immunity from arrest as a 
former head of state. They said most of the charges against the 
general had to be dismissed because they predated Britain's 1988 
adoption of an international law against torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, however, was denied immunity for acts committed after  
1988, which upheld enough of the case to keep Spain's extradition 
request alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The general's lawyers then immediately filed their next  
challenge in the High Court, attacking Straw's December decision 
allowing the extradition process to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	The court granted Straw's request to reconsider the case afresh,  
giving him until today to act. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Straw had to pore over a mountain of evidence and  
public appeals from all sides. But, unlike the courts, he also was 
allowed to consider political and humanitarian factors, in addition 
to legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the law lords reduced the number of charges, the Home  
Office said Straw concluded that ``the remaining offenses for which 
return has been sought are serious, and in the nature of those for 
which, domestically, passage of time would not be regarded as 
restricting prosecution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Straw did not consider the possibility of a trial in Chile as an  
alternative to extradition, the Home Office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under English law, extradition requests are allowed to proceed  
through the courts only with the home secretary's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	With Straw's go-ahead, legal experts said they expect the  
prosecuting lawyers now to prepare a fresh arrest warrant based on 
the reduced charges. That warrant will probably include some of the 
new cases of torture and torture conspiracy that Spanish Judge 
Baltasar Garzon has added in recent months to bolster his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon had no immediate comment. But lawyers involved in the  
Spanish case hailed Straw's ruling as a blow to what they called 
conservative elements in Britain, the United States and Chile 
exerting political pressure for London to free the general.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Sues Public Schools, Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Schools, military bases and other publicly funded  
groups have no business sponsoring Boy Scout troops so long as 
Scouts are required to take a religious oath, the American Civil 
Liberties Union says. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, the ACLU argues that  
public funding of Boy Scouts of America troops violates the 
constitutional requirement of separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government agencies simply cannot spend tax dollars on  
programs that exclude people because of their religious beliefs,'' 
ACLU attorney Roger Leishman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed on behalf of five taxpayers, names as defendants  
the Chicago Public Schools and the United States Transportation 
Command, headquartered at Scott Air Force Base in southern 
Illinois. Leishman said the two defendants represent any local 
agency in Illinois that receives state funding and all federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not know how many schools in Illinois sponsor troops.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no allegation that any individual student or leader  
has suffered any kind of discrimination based on religion in 
connection with any program sponsored by the Chicago Public 
Schools,'' said Robert Hall, first assistant attorney with the 
Chicago Public Schools system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boys Scouts of America also said the lawsuit is without  
merit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is regrettable that the ACLU would seek to deny these boys  
access to the scouting program simply because they promise to do 
their duty to God,'' national spokesman Gregg Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has been a longtime critic of the Boy Scouts. Last  
year, it sued the city of Chicago over the organization's oath as 
well as its ban on gay members. The city, which had sponsored 
troops, ended its affiliation with the organization.

<HEADLINE> Calvin Klein Candles Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 35,000 fragranced candles are being  
recalled because they may burn with high flames that could pose 
fire hazards, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein Cosmetics Co. recalled the candles after getting  
eight reports from consumers about higher-than-normal flames. One 
person ported a minor burn injury, the CPSC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recalled candles come in two sizes -- 2 1/4 inches and 1 1/2 inches  
high -- and were packaged in tin containers of various colors. The 
larger candles were sold individually and in gift sets. The smaller 
candles were given away as samples, gifts and included in gift 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty and major department stores sold the candles from July  
1998 until recently. Consumers who have them should cease using 
them immediately and return the items to the store where they were 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	The fragrances of the recalled candles are: Obsession, Obsession  
for Men, Eternity, Eternity for Men, Escape, Escape for men, 
Contradiction, CK One and CK Be.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo Files Countersuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- In the latest twist to an escalating  
family feud, San Francisco 49ers co-owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. 
filed a $150 million countersuit Thursday against his sister, 
claiming breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is control of the family's billion dollar-plus  
financial empire, whose single most valuable asset is the football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio in response to  
last week's suit against DeBartolo by his sister, Denise DeBartolo 
York and the corporation, demanding her brother repay $94 million 
to the company and attempting to oust him from any team management 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is one of the lowest moments of my life, but my sister  
has left me with no option but to file this lawsuit,'' DeBartolo 
said, reading from a statement at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (corporation's) lawsuit ... was necessary to maintain the  
stability of the company my father created and I am not surprised 
by my brother's response,'' responded Mrs. York in a written 
statement. ``I'm glad that Eddie has now stated he would like to 
pursue talks to settle these issues out of the public eye and it's 
unfortunate that the Corporation had to file a lawsuit against 
Eddie to prompt any meaningful discussions,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance were former 49ers quarterback Joe  
Montana, who led the team to four Super Bowl victories, former 
running back Roger Craig and wide-receiver Jerry Rice -- all there 
to show support for the beleaguered owner. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo's suit claims Mrs. York wrongfully repudiated an  
August 1998 written agreement with her brother that would have 
divided the assets of their jointly owned business, with DeBartolo 
regaining control of the team. The suit also seeks to enforce 
agreements which DeBartolo claims would allow him to resume control 
of the team after his NFL suspension is lifted next February. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, DeBartolo claims they had agreed to a gross team  
value of the San Francisco 49ers of $350 million, while the value 
of other pro football franchises skyrocketed. The Cleveland Browns 
sold for $530 million and the Washington Redskin were to sell for 
$800 million, but that deal has since fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred any other course of action and I am  
still hopeful that my family can find some way to settle its 
differences outside a court room. If not, however, I will continue 
to pursue my rights vigorously,'' DeBartolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, on advice of attorneys, would not take any questions,  
except when asked at the news conference about the nature of his 
relationship with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're brother and sister. Genes did that, I didn't,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo family advisor Mark Vorsatz answered questions on  
DeBartolo's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be hopeful we could continue dialogue that could lead  
to a constructive resolution,'' Vorsatz said. They wouldn't go into 
specifics, but Vorsatz said they would examine all options. 
</P>
<P>
	Vorsatz said DeBartolo made a $25 million payment in April of  
1998 to satisfy an obligation he had with the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo voluntarily withdrew from an active ownership role and  
also resigned his board position with the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. 
in December 1997 when he became entangled in a Louisiana gambling 
fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to an extortion related  
charge stemming from a $400,000 payment he made to former Louisiana 
governor Edwin Edwards as part of an effort to secure a riverboat 
gambling license. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on probation, fined $2 million and agreed to  
testify against Edwards and others charged in the case. Last month, 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue extended DeBartolo's suspension 
through the 1999 season, but said he could be reinstated if he 
lived up to the terms of the league-imposed sanction.

<HEADLINE> Huskers' Wiggins Gets Eligibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- The NCAA, reversing an earlier ruling,  
granted a sixth year of eligibility for Nebraska receiver and kick 
returner Shevin Wiggins on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An NCAA appeals committee reinstated Wiggins on the premise that  
he ``would meet all the eligibility requirements for competition.'' 
In its announcement Thursday, the school didn't elaborate on those 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins was recruited in 1994 but sat out while gaining academic  
eligibility. He redshirted in 1995 and played the last three years, 
gaining a measure of fame when his kicked ball at the goal line 
fell into the arms of teammate Matt Davison as the Cornhuskers 
rallied to win at Missouri in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a recent court ruling, the NCAA allowed students with  
disabilities -- Wiggins has a reading disability -- to regain the 
year of eligibility they missed.

<HEADLINE> Delta Earnings Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines reported its third-quarter  
earnings rose 11 percent as its passenger load rose 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said Thursday its net income for the three months ending  
March 31 was $216 million or $1.42 per share, up from $195 million 
or $1.23 per share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-share figure is about 13 percent higher than analysts  
had predicted. The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call Corp. was $1.26 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta stock fell more than 4 percent, or by $3.18 3/4, to close  
at $68 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said its operating revenue for the quarter rose 3 percent  
to $3.5 billion from $3.4 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported it flew 25 million passengers during the  
quarter, up 2 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	President Leo F. Mullin credited Delta's efforts at improved  
customer service, in part, for the results. The company also 
continued to upgrade its fleet during the quarter, refurbishing 
plane interiors and agreeing to sell some of its older planes. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Delta reported net income  
of $737 million or $4.80 per share. That's an increase of 15 
percent from the same period last year, when net income was $639 
million or $4.06 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $10.75 million, up nearly 4 percent  
from $10.38 million a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Delta Pilots Battle Over Bedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Delta Air Lines pilot cut short an  
Atlanta-to-Tokyo flight this month, saying the plane's redesigned 
sleeping quarters for his crew were so cramped and noisy that 
they'd never get enough rest to complete the flight safely. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident, involving 30-year veteran Capt. Roscoe McMillan,  
was the culmination of a months-long fight between pilots and 
Delta, which had shrunk the sleeping space on some long-haul planes 
to make more room for higher-paying business class passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots call the tube-like bunks ``the coffin.'' Their union, the  
Air Line Pilots Association has filed a grievance with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's small. It lacks adequate privacy considerations and it's  
in a noisy area where the activities of the cabin and the cockpit 
make it difficult if not impossible to get sleep,'' said Capt. Andy 
Deane, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. ``Simply 
being horizontal is not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta says the bunks are safe and approved by the Federal  
Aviation Administration. The airline has questioned McMillan and 
his three-member crew and the pilots' union fears he could be fired 
if the airline decides he acted out of rebellion rather than safety 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The aborted flight happened on April 7 when McMillan landed the  
plane in Portland, Ore, four hours into a 14-hour trip. His action 
angered passengers, who were forced to wait for another flight to 
Japan. It was the first time the bunk bed battle disrupted any 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilots said they had tried to use the sleep module and  
were unable to get to sleep because of outside noise. The captain, 
because of that, made his decision,'' Delta spokesman Bill Berry 
said Thursday. ``He felt that his crew could not be sufficiently 
rested to complete the flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry wouldn't say if Delta is considering sanctioning the  
pilot, who is just 11 months away from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the issue that the company is looking at ... is tied  
to a suspicion on their part that this was an act perhaps of 
premeditation or he was doing this as a gesture of defiance over 
the rest facility. That is not true,'' said union spokesman Deane. 
</P>
<P>
	McMillan declined to comment when contacted at home Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The FAA requires airlines to provide onboard sleeping quarters  
for pilots on flights of 12 hours or more. A crew of four -- two 
pilots, two co-pilots -- take turns at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The only Delta flights exceeding 12 hours are nonstop from  
Atlanta to Tokyo. Three Delta MD-11s are equipped with the bunks. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, crew members used walled-off sleeping quarters  
-- pilots called them ``the condo'' -- located in the middle of the 
business-class section. At nearly seven-feet tall and five-feet 
wide, it was spacious enough for changing clothes and far enough 
from the cockpit area's noisy hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bunks are located between the cockpit and the business  
class area and include a two-inch thick curtain to keep out noise. 
Pilots have to assemble the bunks in front of the passengers, 
pulling them out from the wall in telescoping sections. That can be 
embarrassing for crew members fumbling with the pieces for the 
first time, said Delta First Officer Winford Speakman, who 
co-pilots MD-11s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't instill a lot of confidence in some of our  
passengers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bunks are 30-inches wide at the shoulders and close to  
seven-feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	``You enter from the top and you literally have to tuck your  
knees up and insert your legs down into the tube,'' said Deane. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew members can hear the cockpit door opening and closing,  
toilets flushing from the lavatory at the foot of the bunk, and 
chatter from passengers who sometimes stand and lean against the 
sleeping quarters, Speakman said. Flight attendants sometimes bump 
into them with their serving carts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have a very loud, overriding noise it's almost  
like a shock to you,'' Speakman said. ``All of a sudden you get a 
very loud thump or a bang. As a pilot, we're trained to listen to 
these things that are out of the ordinary. It will absolutely wake 
you up in a flash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokesman Berry said the captain can ask flight attendants  
to keep noise levels down when people are trying to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do your best to create a facility that it conducive to  
sleep,'' Berry said. ``It's FAA approved. It's the largest of its 
type of units used by other airlines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said Delta is looking into making improvements to the  
sleeping quarters, such as giving crew members a bit more elbow 
room.

<HEADLINE> FCC Makes Phone Bills Clearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators approved a plan today  
designed to make all those charges on your monthly phone bill 
easier to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's plan, which is backed by  
the Clinton administration, generally would have phone companies 
reorganize bills to flag new charges and service providers, give 
clear descriptions of all charges and information about how to 
contest them. The plan, adopted in a 4-1 vote, could take effect in 
a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Local telephone and long-distance companies would have to abide  
by all of the FCC's provisions, but cellular and other wireless 
companies would have to comply with just some. Violations could 
trigger fines or other penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will require local, long-distance and wireless  
providers to identify the company associated with each charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and long-distance companies also will have to flag -- the  
FCC doesn't specify how -- when a new provider or charge that hadn't 
appeared on previous bills shows up. For example, the bills will 
have to show when a person's long-distance carrier was switched 
from, say, AT&AMP;T to MCI WorldCom, or the person is charged for calls 
to a psychic hotline. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also will require local and long-distance companies to  
use ``clear and non-misleading'' descriptions about their charges 
and provide information on when nonpayment could cause phone 
service to be cut off. For now, the FCC won't apply this provision 
to wireless companies but will seek comment on whether it should in 
the future, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the FCC's 30,000 complaints about phone charges involve  
local and long-distance companies, not wireless providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC doesn't specify the language for the descriptions but  
encourages the industry to come up with uniform wording. 
</P>
<P>
	The clear-language requirement also will cover the many  
line-item charges that have been popping up on phone bills 
nationwide over the last two years. Those charges, under different 
names, come from a government overhaul of phone fees, from itemized 
charges for government-ordered subsidies once included in rates and 
to pay the costs of complying with other government requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's plan requires standardized language for these  
line-items, with the wording yet to be determined, the officials 
said. If wireless companies include such line-items in their bills 
they also would be subject to uniform labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	Local, long-distance and wireless companies also will have to  
give people toll-free numbers to call with questions or to dispute 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, local and long-distance companies already  
provide such information about their own charges, but that 
information usually is not posted for charges from third parties. 
Often when unauthorized charges are ``crammed'' onto a bill, 
customers spend hours trying to track down companies charging for

	Most of the nation's Bell companies have begun, or plan to make,  
changes in phone bills to make them easier to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies and consumer advocates have been generally  
supportive of the FCC's goals. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Commsioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth voted against the plan,  
saying the FCC had no legal authority to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also adopted rules giving U.S. phone companies more  
flexibility in cutting deals with foreign carriers to terminate 
calls in countries where there is some competition. Regulators 
expect the changes could make it cheaper for U.S. customers to call 
most Latin American countries, most of Europe and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Couch Could Be Browns' No. 1 Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch will be  
Cleveland's first choice in Saturday's NFL draft as long as there 
are no problems negotiating a contract, league sources told several 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alex Martins, a Browns' spokesman, said today the club was  
negotiating with agents for Couch and two other potential No. 1 
picks, Oregon QB Akili Smith and Texas running back Ricky Williams. 
No decision had been made, Martins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually in continuing negotiations with agents for all  
three of the picks under consideration. The organization has not 
made a final determination as of this point as to which player we 
will select on Saturday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiating process will continue over the course of the  
next few days and we don't anticipate making a decision on the pick 
until Saturday morning,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch had his second workout for Cleveland last Sunday in  
Lexington, Ky., a rigorous, 90-minute, 115-pass session conducted 
by Browns coach Chris Palmer. And apparently he performed well 
enough to convince the team he is their franchise quarterback of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns reportedly contacted Couch's agent, Tom Condon, of  
Cleveland-based IMG over the past few days to begin preliminary 
contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reports are accurate and the Browns have decided on  
Couch, it would mean the New Orleans Saints never increased their 
offer to trade all their picks in this year's draft plus some 
future ones for Cleveland's top pick. The Browns were reportedly 
seeking the Saints' No. 1 in 2000 and 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns seemed to be leaning toward making a trade in recent  
days, making their strongest statements about a possible deal after 
watching Couch work out. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, 21, set four NCAA records last season while completing 72  
percent of his passes at Kentucky. He decided to skip his senior 
year of college for a chance to be drafted No. 1, and has openly 
campaigned for an opportunity to play for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared to be the frontrunner before Smith blew away Palmer  
during a private workout in Eugene, Ore. Smith, who played only one 
full season for the Ducks, has a stronger arm than Couch and Palmer 
was impressed by the 23-year-old's charisma and maturity after 
playing some minor league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who won the Heisman Trophy following a record-setting  
senior season at Texas, was said to be in a three-man race to be 
the Browns' top pick following a strong workout last week in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland has been wrestling with the responsibility of having  
the No. 1 pick for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've definitely had some sleepless nights over this thing,''  
said Dwight Clark, the team's director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	There is added pressure on the Browns to use the No. 1 pick  
wisely. Cleveland is an atypical expansion franchise. Unlike 
Jacksonville and Carolina, the Browns already have tradition and 
die-hard, demanding fans. So whomever they take first will be 
scrutinized like no other player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal. I understand that,'' said Clark. ``It's an  
important decision to the organization. But it's not just my 
decision. We'll make the decision together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then joking, he added: ``If it all works out, it's a decision by  
committee, if it doesn't work out, then I guess coach and I will 
take the heat.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Official Speaks Out on Intel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The only member of the Federal Trade  
Commission to oppose last summer's antitrust lawsuit against Intel 
Corp. expressed doubt Thursday the government would have won had it 
not settled with the company in March. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Commissioner Orson Swindle, the dissenter in the 3-1 vote,  
also said he believes the government will have a difficult time 
enforcing its proposed ``sin no more'' settlement with the 
microchip giant. 
</P>
<P>
	In its lawsuit, the commission accused Intel of holding a  
monopoly in the market for microprocessors, the ``brains'' of 
computers. The suit charged Intel illegally used its monopoly power 
to withhold key technical information about its future chips from 
three companies: Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph Corp. and 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC claims Intel withheld the data to punish the companies  
for refusing to license key patents to Intel without charge. In the 
process, according to the government, Intel's actions hurt 
consumers by curbing innovation and barring other companies from 
potentially entering the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle, in a written statement of his first public comments on  
the case, expressed doubts about those claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``One can question the very basis for issuing this complaint --  
and for injecting a government agency into the dynamic workings of 
a fast-moving, high-technology industry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Intel reached a settlement with the government just as  
the case was to begin a lengthy hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency commissioners voted 3-0 to approve the settlement, which  
will become final after a 60-day public comment period now under 
way. Swindle did not vote because he was on medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, Intel promised to share important  
technical details with other companies about its computer chips, 
but allowed for exceptions in rare circumstances. In return, Intel 
was not required to admit it has monopoly power. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Swindle questioned whether Intel's hold on the  
microchip market ``is as unassailable as the complaint suggests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel products run roughly 85 percent of the world's personal  
computers. The company had sales of $26.2 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Swindle pointed out that Intel now faces unprecedented  
competition in supplying chips for low-end personal computers, an 
area where a good portion of consumer demand has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Available information has not dispelled my questions about  
whether Intel has monopoly power -- as opposed to just an extremely 
large market share -- in general-purpose microprocessors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swindle said he expects the FTC will have a hard time enforcing  
the settlement because ``it is extremely doubtful that Intel is 
going to create any kind of record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that my pessimism is unwarranted but the key terms of  
the order seem destined to enmesh the commission in expensive, and 
perhaps intractable, enforcement proceedings if Intel is ever 
suspected of violating it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, the remaining FTC commissioners -- Sheila  
F. Anthony, Mozelle Thompson and Chairman Robert Pitofsky -- said 
they are confident that agency and Intel attorneys ``have done a 
commendable job of crafting a remedy that addresses serious 
potential competitive harm without significantly hindering Intel's 
legitimate business activity.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Ovitz Endorses LA Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The bid to return pro football to a remodeled  
Coliseum appeared to gain momentum with a report that Michael 
Ovitz, the Hollywood dealmaker who proposed building a new stadium 
on a former Carson landfill, had given up on that idea and was 
going to endorse the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has approached Fox Group, which owns the Los Angeles  
Dodgers, about the possibility of building a new baseball stadium 
next to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's the Coliseum, great,'' Ovitz told the Los Angeles  
Times for today's editions. ``The Dodger situation sounds like a 
great opportunity for the city, and that didn't exist a month ago. 
This changes things, and if this helps bring football back to Los 
Angeles, that has been our goal from the outset.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said in a statement Wednesday that his position is  
unchanged from last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of weeks ago, I met with commissioner Tagliabue after  
the NFL owners' meeting in Phoenix,'' Ovitz said. ``I told him that 
my partners and I were committed to doing whatever was in the best 
interest of bringing NFL football back to Los Angeles, even if that 
meant voluntarily withdrawing our Carson stadium proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said the league had encouraged his group to continue to  
pursue the Carson proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next Tuesday, we expect that the NFL will select a stadium  
plan on which to focus its efforts over the coming months,'' Ovitz 
said. ``As I told commissioner Tagliabue, we will support the NFL 
in whatever decision is made and we will continue to pursue our 
goal of owning and operating a successful NFL franchise in Los 
Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Carson councilman says that city won't wait in line for an NFL  
team if the league fails to make a deal with the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is anticipated that Carson will be waiting in the  
wings if the Coliseum-Dodger stadium deal doesn't go through,'' 
said councilman Daryl Sweeney, who led the suburban city's bid to 
get a team. ``They're probably thinking we'll be there saying, 
`Come back to us.' But that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney anticipates an announcement next week when the NFL  
expansion committee visits Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a decision is going to be made on Tuesday, and I think  
that decision is to go to the Coliseum and to give them some time 
to get their act together,'' Sweeney said Wednesday in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney's reaction to the chances of the Dodgers' moving to  
Exposition Park near the Coliseum: ``That's never going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the March meetings in Phoenix, the NFL owners voted  
conditional approval to give the Los Angeles area the league's 32nd 
franchise, but did not choose between Carson and the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer carried a Sept. 15 deadline for whichever group was  
picked to present a stadium and financing plan that meets the 
owners' approval. 
</P>
<P>
	If no deal can be worked out with the Coliseum, Houston likely  
will get the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney said that if Ovitz does endorse the Coliseum proposal,  
Carson officials won't feel shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've gained a lot of positive press and publicity out  
of it,'' the councilman said. ``Now we're going to plan to go ahead 
(with the site), possibly with the building of a mall.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Inmate Testifies in Framing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A man released from death row was back in  
court to testify -- this time as the accuser against sheriff's 
deputies and former prosecutors accused of railroading him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolando Cruz admitted Wednesday that he repeatedly lied to  
detectives, but insisted he never made an incriminating statement 
at the center of the tangled 16-year drama. 
</P>
<P>
	``After listening to him today, I think we're all salivating to  
get our teeth into him,'' said defense attorney Terry Ekl. Cruz's 
testimony was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 35, spent nearly a decade on death row for the 1983 murder  
of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico. He was acquitted in 1995 after a 
sheriff's official changed key testimony, casting doubt on claims 
that Cruz revealed incriminating details to detectives in a 
statement describing a ``vision'' or ``dream'' he had about the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz denied making the dream statement or offering detectives  
details that suggested he was involved in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like I said, I never had a dream or vision,'' he testified.  
``I never told them that, never.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Cruz said, he offered detectives a made-up version of  
the crime fingering three other men. He said he repeated that story 
in a tape-recorded statement the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz testified that police knew he was making up information.  
And he alleged that one of the detectives stopped him during his 
taped statement -- when Cruz said he heard a stick was used to 
bludgeon the girl -- and told him to say a baseball bat was the 
murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz and fellow defendant Alejandro Hernandez were twice found  
guilty of murder, first in a joint trial in 1985 and later in 
separate retrials. But each verdict was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against Hernandez were dropped after Cruz was acquitted,  
and an investigation led to charges against the law enforcement 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are three former DuPage County assistant state's  
attorneys: Thomas Knight, now in private practice; Patrick King, 
now an assistant U.S. attorney; and Robert Kilander, now a DuPage 
County circuit judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were Detectives Dennis Kurzawa and Thomas Vosburgh  
and Lts. James Montesano and Robert Winkler of the sheriff's 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are accused of lying, creating evidence and  
conspiring to frame Cruz.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Nixes Shipbuilding Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon sank a proposed merger between  
two shipbuilders, saying it wanted to preserve competition in the 
rapidly consolidating defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 billion deal between defense contractors General Dynamics  
Corp. and Newport News Shipbuilding would have created a single 
shipbuilder for the Navy's largest and most expensive ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost savings to the Navy would not justify that loss of  
competition, Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a statement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the merger would collapse the two existing companies  
into a single entity, there would be a reduction in the likelihood 
of future competition,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, which is based in Falls Church, Va., made an  
unsolicited bid for Newport News in February. The deal required 
Pentagon review and also was subject to a review by the Justice 
Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, General Dynamics would have dominated the $7  
billion annual market for Navy ships, including $4 billion aircraft 
carriers and submarines costing roughly half that. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Pentagon review concerned calculating possible cost  
savings, which Cohen called considerable, from having shipbuilding 
engineering, research and development talent concentrated in one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohen said planned improvements at Newport News' Virginia  
shipyards could save nearly as much money as the merger offered, 
without a loss in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with Newport News announced at the same time  
Wednesday, the shipyard will renegotiate some Navy contracts and 
agree to a lower price, but will keep profits reaped from 
improvements in efficiency over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief  
executive officer, called the Pentagon's merger decision 
``disappointing'' and said the firm had withdrawn its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Dynamics believes that its proposed acquisition of  
Newport News Shipbuilding would have meant significant savings for 
the U.S. Navy, enhanced value for the shareholders of both 
companies, and still preserved jobs,'' Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William P.  
Fricks said Pentagon opposition meant the company would proceed 
with a previously planned buyout of another rival shipyard, 
Avondale Industries of New Orleans. He said the proposed tranaction 
had received antitrust clearance from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics employs 31,000 people and had 1998 earnings of  
$364 million on sales of nearly $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the parent firm for Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., which  
builds nuclear submarines, and Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, 
which builds the Aegis destroyer. General Dynamics also builds the 
Abrams tank, high-speed Gatling guns for aircraft and helicopters, 
advanced fiber-optics products, and high-speed processors for 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News employs 18,000 people and earned $66 million last  
year on sales of $1.86 billion. It is the Navy's sole supplier for 
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As much as Americans despise paying taxes,  
Thursday brought music and back rubs to the nation's post offices, 
along with a spirit of camaraderie among last-minute filers jammed 
into lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got it done. I've just got to figure out where to send the  
money that I owe,'' said 21-year-old Steve MacIntyre as he rooted 
through a mountain of forms at Boston's main post office. 
</P>
<P>
	His paperwork was creased and grubby from being in the back  
pocket of his jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aargh! No envelopes!'' he shouted, pounding the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	MacIntyre's was just one of 126 million tax returns the Internal  
Revenue Service expected to receive this year. The agency said it 
had already received more than half by late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the procrastinators, the forgetful and the flummoxed  
who took in the festive atmosphere at the nation's mailrooms on the 
final day of filing. Some post offices were open as late as 
midnight, with parties scheduled until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	At New York's huge main post office across from Pennsylvania  
Station, hundreds of last-minute filers weaved through clogged 
sidewalks to fling their returns into a row of curbside bins. 
</P>
<P>
	At Boston's main postal office around 8 p.m., the atmosphere was  
downright celebratory. A pianist serenaded a crowd of about 50, and 
free bagels, donuts, ice cream bars and coffee were also on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Bladt, 28, of Boston, a high school lacrosse coach, said he  
hadn't expected to find a buffet and free entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm astounded -- it's like a big party, and it's the farthest  
thing I expected,'' said Bladt, who said he anticipates getting a 
refund this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cannon, a postal service spokesman, said it appeared  
there were more last-minute filers in Boston this year than in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety percent of these people aren't getting a refund, so  
we're trying to make it as painless as possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A party at the Springfield, Mass., post office on Thursday  
included four bands and food donated from eight restaurants. 
Taxpayers also had a chance to get even with IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two dunk tanks this year, not just one,'' boasted  
Postmaster Flossie Paluszec. 
</P>
<P>
	Other post offices around the country tried to rub out the  
anxiety of tax filing with free back and neck massages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, fans going to Thursday night's Los Angeles  
Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks game at Bank One Ballpark could bring 
their tax returns out to the ballgame. A mobile post office was 
destined for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspiring actors and actresses might have wanted to pay their  
taxes in Newport Beach, Calif. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
was capitalizing on the crowds at the post office by conducting 
screen tests for its ``Got Milk'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In Springfield, Va., the certified public accountants of  
Crutchley, Marginot &AMP; Tosi P.C. closed the office early, and like 
accountants around the country, they planned to celebrate an end to 
80-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut down at noon, we start our party at 2 p.m. and it goes  
through the night,'' said accountant Mary Ann Dougherty.

<HEADLINE> Wealthy Targeted in Bankruptcy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert E. Brennan, head of the now-defunct  
First Jersey Securities, used to alight from his helicopter in 
nationwide TV ads and beckon investors to ``come grow with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's a poster child in a campaign by Sen. Charles Grassley,  
R-Iowa, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to close a 
loophole that has allowed some notorious defendants in fraud cases 
to shelter income from creditors by filing bankruptcy under the 
same terms as corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	An SEC enforcement official says the change is needed to  
eliminate abuse of the laws by people like Brennan, who filed for 
bankruptcy protection in August 1995 after being ordered to pay $75 
million for swindling investors. 
</P>
<P>
	After his bankruptcy filing, Brennan proceeded to pay himself an  
annual salary of more than $1 million from the companies in his 
estate, according to court documents. And the bankruptcy court 
trustee alleged, among other things, that Brennan was paid for 
personal air-travel expenses in 1997 totaling $241,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is  
proposing an amendment to major bankruptcy legislation that would 
tighten payment requirements for individuals who file for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
	The overhaul legislation, which would make it harder for  
individuals to sweep away their debts in bankruptcy, mostly applies 
to ordinary people who are not super-rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapter 11 was designed to be used by companies, as it has been  
in recent years by Eastern Airlines, Texaco Inc., Broadway producer 
Livent Inc. and a host of others -- but many celebrities and other 
wealthy individuals also have filed under it. Under Chapter 11, an 
insolvent company or individual attempts to reorganize debts while 
under bankruptcy court protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, higher-income professionals such as lawyers and  
doctors file under Chapter 11,'' said a summary of Grassley's 
proposed amendment released Wednesday. It noted that some 
celebrities such as Burt Reynolds also have done so. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike in Chapter 13, which most people file under if they wish  
to reorganize their debts under bankruptcy court supervision, 
debtors filing under Chapter 11 are not required to devote their 
future earnings to repay their creditors. Grassley's proposal would 
make such income available to creditors when an individual files 
under Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current laws, Chapter 11 is especially attractive to  
securities fraud defendants because their current income, which 
they often draw from companies they own, is not available to 
creditors. That allows them ``to expend it to live in luxury while 
under the protection'' of the bankruptcy court, Judith R. Starr, 
assistant chief litigation counsel at the SEC, said in a letter 
Tuesday to a Grassley aide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation has attracted individual Chapter 11 filings by  
some of our most notorious defendants,'' Ms. Starr wrote. In 
addition to Brennan, she cited Andrew Bressman, who filed under 
Chapter 11 after being sued by the SEC for his role in a 
small-company stock fraud for which he was subsequently convicted, 
and Thomas Warde, who filed after an appeals court upheld the SEC's 
$3 million judgment against him for insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1991, the Supreme Court ruled, 8-1, that individual  
debtors may seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11, even 
though it is mainly used by companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year 862 individuals and 7,524 businesses nationwide filed  
under Chapter 11, down from 1,071 individuals and 9,694 companies 
in 1997, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, a group of 
6,400 attorneys, judges, bankers and professors that does not take 
positions on bankruptcy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcy legislation in the House does not include a provision  
similar to Grassley's amendment. An aide to Rep. George Gekas, 
R-Pa., the House bill's chief sponsor, had no immediate comment 
Wednesday on the amendment.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Again Asks for New Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Information given to Terry Nichols near the end of  
his Oklahoma City bombing trial contained enough leads about 
another suspect to warrant a new trial, his attorney argued 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In renewing his request for a hearing on Nichols' motion for a  
new trial, attorney Michael Tigar rejected prosecutors' contentions 
that the information had previously been turned over to the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Government counsel argued that Mr. Nichols mixed the bomb and  
that he was with Mr. (Timothy) McVeigh for long periods on April 17 
and 18,'' Tigar wrote. ``The withheld evidence contradicts this key 
government theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols, 44, was convicted Dec. 23, 1997, of conspiracy and  
eight counts of involuntary manslaughter in the April 19, 1995, 
bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The blast killed 
168 people and injured hundreds more. He is serving a life prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh has appealed his death sentence after he was convicted  
of murder and weapons-related charges in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	During Nichols' trial, defense attorneys sought to show others  
were involved by calling witnesses who said they saw McVeigh with 
an unknown suspect identified as John Doe No. 2 or other people 
during key periods. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the new trial motion are dozens of FBI lead sheets  
given to the defense attorneys on Dec. 11, 1997. The sheets are 
used to record information taken during informal interviews or from 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigar identified several FBI lead sheets which he said had  
``truly helpful information'' that the defense would have pursued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government actively concealed these sheets,'' he said.  
``We did not discover them until we smoked them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, Nichols has been charged with 160 counts of  
first-degree murder and three other felony charges stemming from 
the bombing. If convicted, he faces the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Drug-maker Perrigo To Cut 150 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLEGAN, Mich. (AP) -- Perrigo Co. announced Thursday it will cut  
120 to 150 jobs in a bid to save between $5 million and $6 million 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of store-brand over-the-counter drugs said the job  
cuts will affect professional, managerial, administrative and 
support staff -- but not production workers. The company said the 
cuts will focus on salaried workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it anticipates 80 to 100 jobs will be  
eliminated through attrition, redeployments and early retirements. 
The other affected workers face layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The staff reductions are based on our need to tightly manage  
costs and are not a reflection on the quality of work or the 
commitment of those people being displaced,'' Michael Jandernoa, 
the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said Thursday it will incur fourth-quarter  
costs of between $3 million and $4 million relating to an early 
retirement offer.

<HEADLINE> Tyco To Cut 4,000 AMP Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Tyco International Ltd. will cut 4,000 jobs  
from recently acquired AMP Inc., which already has undergone 
massive rounds of layoffs in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to have AMP regain the leadership in its  
market,'' Tyco spokesman Brad McGee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	AMP, based in Harrisburg, Pa., is one of the world's largest  
makers of connectors for electric and electronic devices that are 
put into just about everything from refrigerators to missiles. The 
company has been hit hard by the Asian economic crisis and a failed 
expansion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, which is based in Bermuda and has its U.S. headquarters in  
Exeter, completed its $11.3 billion purchase of AMP two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4,000 layoffs at AMP come on the heels of 4,200 layoffs AMP  
has made in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	No Tyco jobs will be cut, McGee said.  
</P>
<P>
	McGee said he had no details about where the jobs would be cut.  
AMP has about 45,000 workers at 125 plants in more than 50 
countries. Most of its 68 U.S. plants are in Pennsylvania and North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco, a widely diversified manufacturer, is the world's largest  
manufacturer and installer of fire protection systems, the largest 
provider of electronic security services and the largest 
manufacturer of flow control valves.

1967 film version of the children's classic ``Doctor Doolittle,'' 
died Wednesday of cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, playwright, author, composer, lyricist and singer was  
first diagnosed in 1985 with renal cell cancer and had one kidney 
removed. After years of good health, the cancer returned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Newley had lived in Surrey, England, about 35 miles outside of  
London, for years and moved to Florida permanently in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The former husband of actress Joan Collins, Newley shot to fame  
as the Artful Dodger in the 1948 film version of ``Oliver Twist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his heyday, he had a series of hit records, appeared in a  
string of films and was a major live performer in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Newley co-wrote the score for the hit musicals ``Stop The World  
-- I Want To Get Off,'' ``Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory'' 
and ``The Roar of The Greasepaint -- The Smell of the Crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote a number of best-selling hit singles, including  
``What Kind Of Fool Am I?'', ``The Candy Man'' and ``Goldfinger.''

</P>
<P>
	BRACKNELL, England (AP) -- Harvey Postlethwaite, a leading figure  
in Formula One race car design and engineering, died Tuesday of a 
heart attack. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Postlethwaite died in Barcelona, Spain, where he was overseeing  
a test session for Honda's new car. 
</P>
<P>
	He started his F1 career in 1971 with March Engineering and  
designed the car which James Hunt drove to victory in the Dutch 
Grand Prix in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Postlethwaite was the designer for the Wolf team, which won its  
debut Grand Prix in 1977 and finished the season as runner-up in 
the constructors' championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Ferrari in 1981 and designed a chassis for the Italian  
team's new turbocharged engine. Postlethwaite-designed Ferraris won 
the constructors' title in 1982 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Britain in 1988 as technical director of the  
Tyrrell team. His raised-nose car design of 1990 revolutionized F1 
aerodynamics and is a standard feature of single-seater design.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Estelle Sapir, a Holocaust survivor who sued a  
Swiss bank to recover her family's money, died Tuesday of cardiac 
arrest. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sapir was the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit  
involving thousands of other Holocaust survivors until Credit 
Suisse settled her case one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the settlement was not disclosed, but estimates  
ranged from $300,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946 she asked Credit Suisse for the money but was repeatedly  
refused on the ground that she had no death certificate for her 
father, which she said was impossible to obtain since he had died 
in a concentration camp. Finally, the bank acknowledged his death 
on the basis of other documents.

Monday of a respiratory illness. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Slavin began at the News in the early 1950s as a copy boy and  
worked there until the newspaper folded in 1972. He later worked as 
a city editor at the Daily Journal of Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Slavin left newspapers to become vice president of the

<HEADLINE> Researchers Find Huge Bacterium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers sampling ocean dredgings have  
found the largest bacterium ever identified -- as large as the 
period at the end of this sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	A giant, one-celled microbe big enough to be seen with the naked  
eye was found in the South Atlantic Ocean near Namibia. It lives by 
absorbing sulfur and nitrates, and it swells as the chemicals are 
stored inside its cell walls, researchers report in a study to be 
published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest of the bacteria is 0.75 millimeter, according to a  
report by Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology,  
who made the discovery, said the microbes form chain-like colonies 
that tend to glow from the absorbed nitrates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look like a thin string of pearls,'' said the scientists,  
who named the new microbe Thiomargarita namibiensis, which means 
``Sulfur Pearl of Namibia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the largest Thiomargarita was a blue whale,'' Science said  
in a statement, ``then an ordinary bacterium would be a bit smaller 
than a newborn mouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this analogy, the largest previously known bacterium ``would  
be about as big as a lion,'' about 100 times smaller than 
Thiomargarita, Science reports. The previous record holder was 
Epulopiscum fishelsoni, a microbe found in the gut of surgeonfish. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Planck researchers said the bacteria live in an environment  
with high levels of hydrogen sulfide, conditions that are toxic to 
most other forms of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said Thiomargarita is found in great  
concentrations in Namibian coastal sediments that contain high 
levels of toxic sulfide.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Trails in Endorsement Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson seems to have accepted that no  
matter what he does on the court, he'll never achieve the 
endorsement success of Michael Jordan. Corporate America fears him 
the way a lone defender on the wing does. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia 76ers controversial star has only one  
endorsement deal, with Reebok, even though his jersey is one of the 
top-five sellers in the country. The Sixers are trying to change 
that, but it's a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, the Sixers will undertake the latest attempt to  
sell Iverson, who leads the NBA in scoring but trails mightily in 
the race for endorsements. The Sixers brain trust came up with the 
idea of a beanbag doll modeled after their star player -- complete 
with cornrows, a goatee and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson hopes the promotion, which is responsible for the  
Sixers' third sellout of the season, doesn't just turn into another 
missed opportunity or ill-perceived reach for acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to be me, man,'' Iverson said. ``If people are  
going to market me, I don't want it to be anything phony. If 
they're going to market me, I want it to be the way I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly music to the ears of Madison Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
	It's no secret that Iverson's rocky past and his public image  
work against him. Few in the corporate world have walked the 
streets Iverson has. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been arrested on marijuana and gun charges, spent four  
months in jail for his role in a bowling alley brawl, been 
implicated by friends who were pulled over while driving away from 
an alleged drug dealing in his Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	He has seen death up close, in the tragic, senseless way that it  
happens in America's blighted outposts. He once had eight friends 
killed in one summer. His father is serving nine years in prison 
for assault, and a surrogate father figure, Tony Clark, also was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iverson's mind, he has coped in the most admirable way  
possible -- by refusing to abandon the people and places who made 
him who he is. Thus, the braided hair, jewelry and tattoos that 
decorate his sinewy arms, the most prominent one proclaiming, 
``Only the strong survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Madison Avenue isn't ready for cornrows,'' said Rick Burton,  
director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of 
Oregon. ``That's racist, but that's the way Madison Avenue tends to 
be, because they have to sell to a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't understand cornrows or African American history or  
culture. It's hard for them be able to appreciate a young man like 
Iverson, who is so driven and so focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is part of the dilemma facing the Sixers, who have on their  
watch an incredible basketball talent perceived as a ticking time 
bomb. Dave Coskey, the team's vice president for public relations, 
recalls working with a similar lightning rod for controversy in his 
early days with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow named Charles Barkley.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was incorrigible. He was outrageous. He was outspoken,''  
Coskey said. ``The older basketball writers used to say, `He's 
nothing like the guys we're used to covering.' Now fast-forward. 
Charles is the elder statesman in the NBA. A lot of analogies can 
be drawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More so than with Barkley, the Sixers are torn when trying to  
market Iverson. On one hand, they see a young man up close whose 
allure to children defies his public image. Earlier this season, 
after a Sixers loss, Coskey stood in awe while Iverson taped a 
segment that was to be shown to a child dying of AIDS and brain 
cancer in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they stand by helplessly while Iverson curses his coach,  
Larry Brown, and causes a weeklong controversy that threatens to 
derail the team's bid for a first playoff berth since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The contradictions hurt Iverson's chances for endorsements, but  
maybe it's too early to write him off as a marketing failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson hopes the doll is a start. The toy, named ``Alien  
Iverson,'' will be given away to the first 5,000 kids in the 
building for Friday night's game against Indiana. And surprise, it 
managed to attract a sponsor -- Rold Gold pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has studied athletes who overcame negative images to gain  
appeal as pitchmen. He was involved in Miller Lite's famous ``Less 
Filling, Tastes Great'' commercials that showed tough, seemingly 
aloof jocks in a humorous light. He believes the same approach may 
someday work for Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When show you can laugh, you can break a lot of people's  
defenses down,'' said Burton, hitting on Iverson's favorite pastime 
on the court. ``Let's laugh at some of what Larry Brown and the 
media represent. Let's laugh at ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson recently fired agent David Falk, saying he wants his  
replacement to be more aggressive in pursuing endorsements. But he 
remains steadfast in his position that he won't change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to see myself on TV, I can just turn on ESPN every  
night,'' Iverson said. ``I'm not big on having a bunch of 
commercials and all that. That's not what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like it isn't fair, but I don't ever cry  
about it. It's not fun all the time, because I'm not the person 
that they try to make me out to be.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Editors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is making his case for U.S.  
engagement in Kosovo to a crowd of influential opinion-makers in 
San Francisco on the first stop of a two-day trip that mixes his 
roles as commander in chief and leader of his political party. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was speaking today to the annual meeting of the  
American Society of Newspaper Editors before traveling to Detroit 
and Boston to raise money for House and Senate Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The address to the editors' meeting was another chance for  
Clinton to emphasize why he believed NATO needed to act against the 
forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chance to speak to newspaper editors who, on a daily  
basis, speak to their readers back home, offered us a unique 
opportunity to go and make the case,'' White House press secretary 
Joe Lockhart said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel, about 50 protesters carrying signs denouncing  
U.S. involvement in Kosovo chanted ``No war! No bombs! No new 
Vietnam!'' Their signs also assailed news coverage of the crisis in 
the Balkans: ``Journalistic credibility? Where?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A smaller knot of protesters supported NATO with signs saying  
``Stop the Hitler of the Balkans'' and urging the alliance to arm 
the Kosovar guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has been making almost daily pronouncements on NATO's  
airstrikes and the effort to aid the hundreds of thousands of 
refugees fleeing Kosovo to Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that the president continues to make the case,  
both on a day by day basis about what's going on in the military 
campaign, but also more broadly about what our interests are,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset of the Kosovo operation last month, Clinton  
canceled a fund-raising swing through Western states to devote his 
full attention to the U.S.-led NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the campaign into its fourth week, the White House  
wanted to show that Clinton also was tending to other business. In 
Detroit and Boston on Friday he was expected to raise more than $1 
million for Democratic House and Senate candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business of this country is ongoing,'' Lockhart said.  
``One of the things that any president does, whether it's a 
Democrat or a Republican, whether it's the '90s or the '80s, is, as 
a leader of the party, participates in party politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Detroit, Brian Atwood, the head of the Agency for  
International Development, and James Lee Witt, director of the 
Federal Emergency Management Administration, was to join Clinton to 
highlight efforts to help Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has sent nearly $150 million in humanitarian  
aid to the region since 1998, including $50 million since the NATO 
confrontation with Yugoslavia began March 24. But U.S. officials 
admit they were unprepared for the scale of the exodus from Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Ford Earnings Jump 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said today that strong sales in  
North America helped it post a 20 percent increase in operating 
earnings during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 2 automaker reported operating earnings of $1.81  
billion, or $1.46 a share, in the first three months of the year 
compared with $1.51 billion, or $1.22 a share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's results were higher than Wall Street analysts'  
expectations. The average estimate of 19 analysts recently surveyed 
by First Call Corp. was for operating earnings of $1.39 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The operating earnings exclude onetime gains that boosted the  
net income figures in both the latest period and in the first 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $38 billion, compared with $36.6 billion a year  
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ford team is energized and focused, and we were determined  
to make a fast start in 1999,'' said Jacques Nasser, president and 
CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news for our consumers and shareholders is that the  
transformation of Ford is really just getting started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford reported a one-time, after-tax gain of $165 million from  
the sale of its share in the AutoEuropa joint venture in Portugal 
with Germany's Volkswagen AG. In last year's first quarter, Ford 
had a one-time, noncash gain of $15.9 billion from the spinoff of 
The Associates, in addition to $177 million in earnings from the 
former financial subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	With the one-time factors included, Ford's earnings totaled  
$1.98 billion, or $1.60 a share in the first quarter, compared with 
$17.65 billion, or $14.23 a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's car business earned $1.47 billion, up 20 percent from a  
year ago, with surging sales in North America making up for a 
break-even quarter in Europe and losses in South America. Worldwide 
sales were $32 billion, up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, Ford said it earned $1.59 billion, up 57  
percent from a year ago. Ford said its high-profit truck sales were 
up 20 percent in the quarter, and car sales were up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the AutoEuropa gain, Ford said it would have broke even  
in Europe for the quarter, compared with earnings of $230 million a 
year ago. Ford's losses in South America grew substantially, rising 
to $165 million from $45 million a year ago. The company says it 
does not expect to earn a profit there this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Visteon, Ford's parts subsidiary, said it earned $208 million in  
the first quarter, up 10 percent from $189 million a year ago. 
Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up 9 percent from $4.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Credit said it earned $300 million, up 8 percent from $278  
million last quarter.

	Pinochet To Be Extradized to Spain  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's Home Secretary dashed Gen. Augusto  
Pinochet's hopes of immediately returning home by ruling today that 
Spain can continue seeking the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition. The ruling means that even though the House of Lords 
drastically reduced the case against the 83-year-old general last 
month, Home Secretary Jack Straw considered the remaining charges -- 
which include torture and conspiracy to torture -- serious enough to 
go forward. Pinochet, who remains under armed guard at a mansion 
outside London, now faces the prospect of months or possibly years 
in British courts battling Spain's attempt to bring him to trial 
for allegedly torturing opponents while in power.

blasting apart a convoy of refugees under Serb police escort

only, and the Pentagon suggested that Serbs may have been 
responsible for the carnage. NATO targeted military barracks, 
transmitters carrying the state-run television program and a series 
of bridges earier today that reportedly injured three people the

	Pakistan Ups Nuclear Ante With India

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan tested a second  
nuclear-capable missile earlier today, upping the ante in the 
missile race with its uneasy neighbor India. The missile tested was 
the Shaheen I, the first in a new series of missiles. Pakistan 
tested its first nuclear-capable missile yesterday in response to a 
similar test carried out by India last Sunday. It wasn't 
immediately clear why Pakistan chose to conduct a second test or 
whether it would prompt India to respond. Since the two countries 
exploded nuclear devices last year and declared themselves nuclear 
powers, the international community has been trying to avert an 
arms race.

defense contractors General Dynamics Corp. and Newport News 
Shipbuilding would have created a single shipbuilder for the Navy's

<HEADLINE> Deadly Storm Hits Mississippi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOSO, Miss. (AP) -- Powerful storms ripped into southern  
Mississippi, destroying homes and downing power lines as they 
churned east. One man was killed and more than two dozen injured. 
</P>
<P>
	J.B. Pickering, 71, from rural Soso, died of massive injuries as  
a result of an apparent tornado that destroyed his mobile home, the 
Jones County coroner's office said. Three other family members were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities early today were trying to determine the full scope  
of the damage caused by the storms that hit the area 60 miles 
southeast of Jackson late Wednesday. A Jones County sheriff's 
dispatcher said deputies reported numerous downed trees and power 
lines and widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 50 families had been displaced by the storm and  
needed shelter, said James Grimes, a communications officer with 
the sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had enough officers and other resources out during the  
night that we are confident now that we don't have anyone 
missing,'' he said. ``Everyone is accounted for as far as we 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at South Central Regional hospital in nearby Laurel  
said they had treated 25 to 30 people for minor injuries, mostly 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain and windy conditions were reported throughout  
Mississippi, but the majority of the damage appeared to be in 
Jones, Jasper and Covington counties. 
</P>
<P>
	In Covington County, one home was destroyed and two were heavily  
damaged. Trees were down and livestock was reported killed.

preparing for the Goody's Body Pain 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race at Martinsville Speedway will mark the first time  
all 43 drivers pit on the front stretch. Many drivers have lauded 
the change as an equalizer, but others are reserving judgment until 
after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, half the field pitted on the front straightaway and  
half pitted on the back, with the second group hugely 
disadvantaged. No driver since Lee Petty in 1959 has won at 
Martinsville from the back pits. 
</P>
<P>
	Points leader Jeff Burton said that setup wasn't fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think in Winston Cup racing today, the penalty for  
qualifying poorly shouldn't be that you can't win the race,'' said 
Burton. ``I think everybody ought to have a chance to win the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's older brother, Ward, isn't so sure he agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why they did it,'' Ward Burton said. ``We either  
need to run frontstretch-backstretch pits or mile-and-a-half tracks 
with one long pit. I know they're trying to make things better for 
the guys on the backstretch, but I'm not sure this is the way to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward Burton is seventh in the points race after seven races.  
</P>
<P>
	A big concern for many drivers is the pit road speed of 35 mph,  
which will make the drive down pit road unusually long and 
frustrating. Pit road opens at the entrance to turn No. 3 and exits 
coming out of No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On a track that measures .526 miles, that's a long way at 35  
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing it will do is really change the way you approach  
the place,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``You have to make really good 
decisions on when to pit. The key is going to be avoiding pitting 
under green if you can. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when you might drop in early if you thought  
you were on the verge of some kind of problem. Make a quick stop, 
lose one lap and figure you could get it back. You drop it now and 
you're going to come out three or four laps down. You aren't going 
to make that up on the racetrack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti expects pitting under a caution to be tricky, too,  
especially for cars on the tail end of pit road. He said the pit 
situation could lead to yet another strategic change on NASCAR's 
shortest track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know a lot more after the race,'' Andretti said. ``You  
sure want to get good fuel mileage. That might be a first for a 
short track.''

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Starts Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The state of Michigan reversed its policy  
allowing the force-feeding of prisoners on the same day Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian went to prison vowing to begin a hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The assisted-suicide advocate, sentenced Tuesday to 10 to 25  
years in prison, said he would begin a hunger strike immediately, 
The Oakland Press reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State prison officials said they reversed their policy on  
force-feeding the same day the 70-year-old retired pathologist was 
sentenced. They denied the change had anything to do with 
Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal came after state lawyers realized the previous  
policy requiring force-feeding of an inmate was contrary to a 1996 
state court order that banned a prison from feeding a man against 
his will. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth questioned the timing of the  
policy change. ``Isn't that assisted suicide?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known Wednesday whether Kevorkian began the hunger  
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, if a prisoner refuses food or liquids for  
72 hours, prison officials present a waiver to sign, stating that 
the inmate knows refusing nourishment will lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms that they're fully aware of what they are doing  
and they are doing it voluntarily,'' said Michigan Department of 
Corrections spokesman Matt Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Kevorkian was taken Wednesday to the Oaks  
Correctional Facility in Eastlake for orientation. He will be 
evaluated for the next few weeks before officials decide where he 
will serve his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder for injecting  
Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal dose of chemicals in September at 
Youk's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death of the Lou Gehrig's 
patient to ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to state prison rules, Kevorkian will be eligible for  
parole in about eight years.

<HEADLINE> First Union Profit Down 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- First Union Corp. reported an 11 percent  
drop in first-quarter profits Thursday as the nation's 
sixth-largest bank absorbed the cost of buying CoreStates Financial 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union posted net income of $706 million, or 73 cents a  
share, for the first three months of the year, down from $790 
million, or 81 cents a share for the first-quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's profits from operations totaled $965 million, or $1 a  
share, excluding an after-tax charge of $259 million for its 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure, however, includes a one-time gain from the sale of  
its interest in Electronic Payment Systems. Without that gain, 
First Union earned 88 cents a share. That was the number Wall 
Street expected, but during the quarter the bank had guided 
analysts to lower their estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1998, First Union reported profits from  
operations of $809 million, or 84 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were pleased in the first quarter with the disciplined way  
our company focused on reducing our cost structure,'' Edward E. 
Crutchfield, First Union's chairman and chief executive, said in a 
statement. ``Although we view 1999 as a challenging year, we 
continue to invest in areas that promise higher revenue growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First Union announced last month it was cutting 5,850 jobs and  
leaving two non-core businesses as it restructured following the 
$16.1 billion merger with CoreStates. Expenses are expected to grow 
by about 3 percent in 1999 after the restructuring plan, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte-based bank reported a return on average  
stockholders' equity of 24.3 percent and a return on average assets 
of 1.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from fees and other income rose 41 percent to $1.9  
billion, excluding securities transactions. The growth was led by 
residential mortgage income, capital markets and capital 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, First Union saw a 3 percent drop in net interest  
income for the quarter from $1.86 billion last year to $1.81 
billion. The decline reflected the sale or securitization of $5 
billion in residential mortgages and student loans late last year 
which were not fully reinvested until late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union had assets of $223 billion at the end of the first  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union's shares closed up 81 1/4 cents at $55.87 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Republicans in Congress, Thursday's income  
tax deadline brought a chance to renew their promises for tax 
relief and cast symbolic votes on a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would make it tougher to raise future taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become an annual April 15 exercise, the GOP-led  
House failed to approve the amendment, which would require that 
most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress instead of a 
simple majority. The amendment itself required a two-thirds 
majority, and the 229-199 vote was short by 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax  
rally featuring top GOP leaders, enabled Republicans to remind 
voters that tax relief tops their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day when people are particularly sensitized, and they  
need to know which party wants to cut their taxes,'' said Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also chose Thursday to rush through legislation  
giving tax breaks to troops involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
Sponsors said the measure extends the relief to more support 
personnel than a nearly identical executive order signed by 
President Clinton this week for soldiers in the combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pointed out that five of the  
GOP's top 10 priority bills deal with tax relief and that 
Republicans in the House and Senate have adopted a budget blueprint 
promising an unspecified $778 billion tax cut using projected 
government surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's an overcharge to the American people, they ought  
to get a refund,'' Hastert said at the rally. ``We need to hold 
down the tax burden on the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans are having a tough time deciding which taxes  
to cut. They have already backed away from a proposed 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut and face a money crunch that will 
likely allow for only modest relief in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment to limit tax increases  
went down to defeat for the fifth straight year. All but a handful 
of Republicans voted for the measure, while most Democrats were 
against it and derided it as little more than an April 15 stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a gimmick,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
top Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``This 
annual attempt to tinker with the Constitution will never provide a 
penny of tax relief to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents, noting that 14 states have similar laws,  
promised they would not give up and that it was worthwhile to have 
the debate each April 15, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other tax-related hearings and events in the  
Capitol, including introduction of a bill to abolish the income tax 
entirely -- it was created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment -- and 
replace it with a 15 percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	One other annual announcement came from the Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, which said May 11 was this year's 
``Tax Freedom Day.'' The foundation calculates it would take until 
then -- a day later than last year -- for the average American to 
earn enough to pay his or her share of all federal, state and local 
individual and corporate taxes.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Rip Through Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes ripped through two rural counties  
in middle Georgia on Thursday, injuring at least 30 people and 
destroying several businesses and homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The first twister touched down Thursday morning in Vienna, about  
50 miles south of Macon, causing extensive damage downtown. Up to 
30 people were injured by flying debris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 25 homes were destroyed and another 40 were damaged,  
prompting Gov. Roy Barnes to declare a state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a house that was just taken from the foundation, moved  
10 or 15 feet back and then just flattened,'' Barnes said after 
touring the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also declared a state of emergency in Metter, about 100  
miles east. At least two people were injured and four mobile homes 
were destroyed or damaged there when a tornado hit at about 1:30 
p.m. north of town, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm spawned a third tornado around 3 p.m. near Metter,  
about 60 miles west of Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Carolina, severe thunderstorms brought high winds to in  
eastern North Carolina. One person was killed and others were 
injured when the storms overturned mobile homes in Robeson County. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail, heavy rain and downed power lines were reported elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday in southern Mississippi, a tornado tore through  
rural Jones County, killing a 71-year-old man and smashing homes 
and cars in several small communities.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Cost At Least $1.2M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid its top impeachment  
investigators as much as $20,000 a month, part of the $1.2 
million-plus price tag for the five-month congressional proceedings 
that ended with President Clinton's acquittal, expense records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, chief Republican investigator David Schippers and  
Democratic counsel Abbe Lowell were given special consultant status 
that allowed them to bypass congressional restrictions on outside 
income and continue work at their private law firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers, whose private practice is in Chicago, was paid at the  
rate of $20,000 a month during the height of the investigation, 
according to House Judiciary Committee records. Lowell, a 
Washington lawyer, was paid at a monthly rate of $18,000, according 
to expense records reviewed by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusted to annual salary, both men were being paid at a rate of  
more than $200,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, staff lawyers for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr  
earn between $66,563 and $118,400 annually. The independent 
counsel's deputies must also sever ties with their private law 
firms -- a prohibition that does not apply to Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	House members and senators earn $136,700 a year.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Judiciary Committee records, the panel paid for a  
portion of its investigation with $1.2 million from a special fund, 
which covered compensation for investigators, equipment, travel, 
communications, printing and other expenses solely related to 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual cost to taxpayers was much higher, but can't be  
readily calculated because much of the staff work -- in the House, 
Senate and White House -- was performed by permanent, salaried 
employees who would be paid regardless of their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judiciary Committee granted the requests of Schippers and  
Lowell -- as well as several investigators under them -- to work as 
consultants rather than full-time congressional employees. The 
special status allowed them to avoid the restrictive House rules 
for lawmakers and senior staff members. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers said he and his firm were losing money -- ``$40,000 in  
the hole'' at one point -- because he was paying his own expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``My business was going to hell in a handbasket,'' he said in an  
interview. ``I was begging for it (consultant status) because I was 
really getting into financial difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was offered a straight salary of about $130,000 a  
year to handle the inquiry but declined because ``I would have had 
to take my name off the door'' of his law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment inquiry began Sept. 9 when Starr delivered a  
report to the House. In December, the House impeached Clinton on 
two articles alleging perjury and obstruction of justice and on 
Feb. 12 the Senate acquitted the president on both charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schippers and Lowell led the House Judiciary Committee  
investigation of Clinton's alleged offenses, and Schippers then 
assisted the 13 House GOP lawmakers named to prosecute the 
president at the Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While Democrats have attacked the entire inquiry as an  
unnecessary expense, committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said 
that both Schippers and Lowell were worth the money because of 
``their work and sacrifices'' in a town where top private lawyers 
frequently earn upwards of $400 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the overall cost, Hyde said: ``I think that vindicating  
the Constitution is always worth it. I don't think there were any 
extravagances at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment-related expenses ranged from communications  
equipment to numerous trips by investigators. Most of the travel 
destinations were unspecified in the expense records. 
</P>
<P>
	A Xerox copier cost $14,440, a laser printer was $2,863, a  
shredder cost $2,399 and television was $4,354. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's private lawyers on the impeachment case, led by  
David Kendall of Washington, were paid from a legal defense fund 
created in early 1998 to help Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton with their lawyer bills. 
</P>
<P>
	By Feb. 25, the fund had paid $3 million of Clinton's legal  
expenses from the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, the 
impeachment case and Starr's investigations. The legal expenses are 
expected to total about $10 million.

<HEADLINE>  UConn's El-Amin Expresses Remorse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- A contrite and emotional Khalid El-Amin  
apologized Thursday to his family, his teammates and the people of 
Connecticut and Minnesota for his arrest on marijuana possession 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut point guard, joined by coach Jim Calhoun at a  
news conference in Gampel Pavilion, called the actions leading to 
his arrest Tuesday evening ``a gross error of judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have earned the respect of this school ... and I just want a  
second chance to prove myself,'' said El-Amin, glancing at notes 
scrawled on a blue sheet of paper and taking long pauses to collect 
himself. ``To all the people who have supported me ... I am very 
sorry for this incident. It will never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Minneapolis native, a sophomore majoring in  
communications, was stopped for a traffic violation in Hartford, 
and a small amount of marijuana was discovered during a pat-down 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn scoring leader Richard Hamilton was in the car, but was  
not charged. El-Amin also publicly apologized to Hamilton on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun has stood by El-Amin since the arrest, and on Thursday  
called him an ``asset to the university and the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun also ended any speculation that El-Amin would not  
participate in a victory parade on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tie him down to make sure he's on the float,'' Calhoun  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was arrested 15 days after leading the Huskies to their  
first national championship, and a day after he was honored in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The public apology came hours after El-Amin appeared in a  
Hartford courtroom and entered a conditional plea on the 
misdemeanor marijuana charge. He drew a sentence of community 
service and a stern lecture from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin also was ordered to speak to school children on the  
evils of drug use, an assignment he said he welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a role model and I'll continue to be a role model,''  
El-Amin said. ``I just want to help the youngsters understand to 
make the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Raymond Norko handed El-Amin a rebuke along with the  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is aware of who you are, where you are from and what  
you have done,'' Norko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge reminded El-Amin of his jubilant claim after the  
Huskies upset Duke in the NCAA championship game March 29: ``We 
shocked the world!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The epilogue to that is: `I disappointed the world,''' Norko  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did not respond, except to politely reply, ``Yes, Your  
Honor'' to questions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest might not have been a coincidence, The Hartford  
Courant reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing police documents 
and sources it did not identify, said an informant had tipped 
police about El-Amin's trip to an area of Hartford known for drug 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives arrived at the parking lot before El-Amin and saw him  
making what appeared to be a drug transaction, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was charged with possession of less than 4 ounces of  
marijuana, a misdemeanor. His sentence is the typical punishment 
given to first-time offenders. His record will be wiped clean in 30 
days if he successfully completes his community service. 
</P>
<P>
	His unspecified community service is scheduled for April 21. The  
lectures to middle schools are not yet scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of UConn fans watched the proceedings, one bringing a  
basketball he hoped to have autographed. The 5-foot-10 point guard 
quietly passed autographs to two courthouse workers sitting behind 
him before his lawyer instructed him not to sign any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said the incident does not tarnish the program  
accomplishments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at the trophy and it looked exactly the same,'' he  
said. ``I don't know how this got involved with the basketball 
game. It's a quantum leap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel we didn't win the national championship because one  
kid made an error in judgment? No,'' Calhoun said. ``Has the last 
week not been as happy as the last two? Yes.''

<HEADLINE> Reform of Students' Funding Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools that fail to educate students  
shouldn't benefit from an $8 billion federal program to boost the 
learning of poor children, education officials told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The money should go to the student, who would be free to take it  
to schools that work, said Diane Ravitch, a New York-based 
education analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Ravitch and others told the House Education and Workforce  
Committee on Wednesday that federal money spent on poor 
schoolchildren had done little to improve their progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current system breeds bureaucracy,'' said Ravitch, an  
Education Department official during the Bush administration. 
``Schools would get money depending on how many poor kids are 
enrolled. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program, commonly known as Title I, along with other federal  
education aid is up for renewal by Congress this year. The money is 
distributed to states and districts according to the percentage of 
poor students they have. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the program -- the largest federal  
kindergarten-through-12th grade program -- has little to show for 
itself after 34 years. They cite consistent gaps in the test scores 
of poor and wealthy children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be creative,'' said Maris Vinovskis, a University of  
Michigan researcher. ``Like welfare reform, let's see what works 
and what doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although many large education groups, including teachers'  
unions, want to leave the program untouched, there isn't enough 
research to prove that's a good idea, Vinovskis told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Casserly, who heads an organization of large-city school  
districts, said Title I hasn't been all bad. As of last year, it 
served 71 percent more urban students than in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate are debating how to spend federal education  
money overall; today, they planned to put the finishing touches on 
the so-called ed-flex bill, which will free states from federal 
rules tied to funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the federal government supplies, on average, 7 percent  
of a state's total education budget, some cash-strapped states like 
Mississippi and Alabama get 15 percent to 20 percent of their 
school dollars from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative lawmakers want to convert the money to grants for  
states to use more freely. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democratic members are resisting that idea, saying  
money not tied to a school district could follow a poor child to a 
school that doesn't need the money or might not spend it on the 
child who brought it.

<P>
	``It's a foot in the door for vouchers,'' Rep. Matthew G.  
Martinez, D-Calif., said of the suggestion that public money be 
given to poor students to spend on the schools of their choice, 
even if they are private or religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics complain that after more than 30 years and more than  
$100 billion spent, achievement lags for students who are poor and 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Education Department researcher Alan Ginsburg acknowledged  
it was hard to measure whether the program has helped poor and 
disadvantaged students. He cited some gains in national test 
scores, but added that large gaps remain between rich and poor 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	The Title I program was created in 1965 to help poor children by  
paying for items such as reading instruction and staff hiring. The 
law, originally focused on remedial education, was changed in 1994 
to focus on high standards. It now allows schools with 50 percent 
poor students to use the money on all students, rather than 
providing extra help to a limited number.

<HEADLINE>  UConn's El-Amin Expresses Remorse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- A contrite and emotional Khalid El-Amin  
apologized Thursday to his family, his teammates and the people of 
Connecticut and Minnesota for his arrest on marijuana possession 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut point guard, joined by coach Jim Calhoun at a  
news conference in Gampel Pavilion, called the actions leading to 
his arrest Tuesday evening ``a gross error of judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have earned the respect of this school ... and I just want a  
second chance to prove myself,'' said El-Amin, glancing at notes 
scrawled on a blue sheet of paper and taking long pauses to collect 
himself. ``To all the people who have supported me ... I am very 
sorry for this incident. It will never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Minneapolis native, a sophomore majoring in  
communications, was stopped for a traffic violation in Hartford, 
and a small amount of marijuana was discovered during a pat-down 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn scoring leader Richard Hamilton was in the car, but was  
not charged. El-Amin also publicly apologized to Hamilton on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun has stood by El-Amin since the arrest, and on Thursday  
called him an ``asset to the university and the program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun also ended any speculation that El-Amin would not  
participate in a victory parade on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tie him down to make sure he's on the float,'' Calhoun  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was arrested 15 days after leading the Huskies to their  
first national championship, and a day after he was honored in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The public apology came hours after El-Amin appeared in a  
Hartford courtroom and entered a conditional plea on the 
misdemeanor marijuana charge. He drew a sentence of community 
service and a stern lecture from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin also was ordered to speak to school children on the  
evils of drug use, an assignment he said he welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a role model and I'll continue to be a role model,''  
El-Amin said. ``I just want to help the youngsters understand to 
make the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Raymond Norko handed El-Amin a rebuke along with the  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is aware of who you are, where you are from and what  
you have done,'' Norko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge reminded El-Amin of his jubilant claim after the  
Huskies upset Duke in the NCAA championship game March 29: ``We 
shocked the world!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The epilogue to that is: `I disappointed the world,''' Norko  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did not respond, except to politely reply, ``Yes, Your  
Honor'' to questions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest might not have been a coincidence, The Hartford  
Courant reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing police documents 
and sources it did not identify, said an informant had tipped 
police about El-Amin's trip to an area of Hartford known for drug 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives arrived at the parking lot before El-Amin and saw him  
making what appeared to be a drug transaction, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was charged with possession of less than 4 ounces of  
marijuana, a misdemeanor. His sentence is the typical punishment 
given to first-time offenders. His record will be wiped clean in 30 
days if he successfully completes his community service. 
</P>
<P>
	His unspecified community service is scheduled for April 21. The  
lectures to middle schools are not yet scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of UConn fans watched the proceedings, one bringing a  
basketball he hoped to have autographed. The 5-foot-10 point guard 
quietly passed autographs to two courthouse workers sitting behind 
him before his lawyer instructed him not to sign any more. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun said the incident does not tarnish the program  
accomplishments this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at the trophy and it looked exactly the same,'' he  
said. ``I don't know how this got involved with the basketball 
game. It's a quantum leap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I feel we didn't win the national championship because one  
kid made an error in judgment? No,'' Calhoun said. ``Has the last 
week not been as happy as the last two? Yes.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Coach Has Kidney Platform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers assistant Kevin Gilbride  
took the offensive Thursday against a disease that killed his 
father and afflicts four siblings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride, the former San Diego Chargers coach hired in January  
as the Steelers' offensive coordinator, asked Congress for more 
money for polycystic kidney research, saying scientists are very 
close to finding a cure. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've made the home turn and are just looking for the fuel  
to get across the finish line,'' Gilbride said during a House 
Appropriations subcommittee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many scientists believe they are within five years of finding a  
cure, and Gilbride said he would be disappointed if they lose their 
momentum for lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Current and future generations of families like mine ... need  
the assurance that we will win out over (the disease) sooner, not 
later,'' he said. ``I implore you to act decisively to end this 
scourge once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride, 47, was introduced at the hearing by Rep. J.C. Watts,  
R-Okla., a former Oklahoma football star. Gilbride was Watts' 
quarterback coach with the CFL Ottawa Rough Riders in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Polycystic kidney disease causes fluid-filled cysts to form in  
the kidneys, preventing them from functioning properly. More than 
600,000 Americans have the disease, which is passed through genes 
and can cause such symptoms as high blood pressure, chronic pain, 
and urinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation is seeking $20.2  
million in 2000 for basic research projects, specialized research 
centers and related programs. Current funding is about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Larson, president of the foundation, said polycystic kidney  
disease has not received as much funding or attention as other 
disorders because it has fewer celebrities making the pitch. He 
said he hoped Gilbride would help fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbride said he has advocated research funding ``more quietly  
through the years'' and is now playing a more visible role -- just 
as four younger siblings reach an age at which symptoms may begin 
to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you have to do is experience one family member going  
through the affliction,'' he told reporters. ``Watching my dad die 
is painful, watching him deteriorate, degenerate over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father died from the disease at age 45. His grandmother and  
an aunt died as well, while an uncle and two cousins needed kidney 
transplants. Gilbride and two other siblings did not inherit the 
disease.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Hotels Worry Over Fuel Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Hotel officials on Kauai, the lush Garden Isle  
of the Hawaiian chain, are worried that a grounded fishing vessel 
is sinking efforts to restore the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a hit,'' grumbled Ron Romano, who doesn't have  
to look far for the wreckage of the Van Loi. It's right in front of 
the Kauai Coconut Beach Resort he manages. 
</P>
<P>
	He and others fear the 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled by  
the 95-foot ship will cause greater damage to the island's No. 1 
industry than to its environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests at several hotels are complaining about fumes and debris  
from Saturday's accident. Some were moved to rooms away from the 
ocean, but others left. The exodus continued Thursday. Romano 
estimated that he's lost at least five rooms daily from his 
312-room resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipwrecks don't have to be such a downer. Last month,  
sightseers flocked to Waldport, Ore., to see the rusty, oil-laden 
bow of the New Carissa after it nosed ashore. There were T-shirts 
for rubber-necking visitors, motels were full and it actually cost 
money to park. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been no such shipwreck popularity here, and local  
officials fear any negative publicity will stunt efforts to return 
tourism to levels enjoyed before Hurricane Iniki decimated the 
island in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Hawaii has been mired in an economic malaise since 1991  
and preliminary estimates said the state received 6.8 million 
visitors in 1998, a 1.6 percent drop from 1997. Tourism is an $11 
billion industry in Hawaii, generating about a quarter of the 
state's tax revenue and a third of its jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Coconut Beach and the nearby 200-room Islander on the  
Beach have written letters to guests detailing the situation and 
telling them not to go in the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotels also tell guests that this isn't the Exxon Valdez.  
</P>
<P>
	``If they panic, we lose them all,'' Islander general manager  
Hakim Ouansafi said. ``The first `Oh, no' is for the environment 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second concern is trying to let the people who saved for  
five years to come over here know that it's an unusual accident 
that could happen anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kauai is about 100 miles northwest of Honolulu. The island -- the  
beautiful backdrop to such movies as ``South Pacific'' and 
``Jurassic Park'' -- had slightly more than 1 million visitors last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kauai Visitors Bureau hopes to attract 1.1 million this year  
with the addition of direct flights from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hopes are people will pick up the phone and call and say,  
`I was coming in two weeks. Is this affecting the entire island or 
is it just an isolated area?''' executive director Sue Kanoho said, 
adding that her answer will be ``isolated area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My fear is they won't call and they'll book their trip to  
Maui.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Van Loi grounded Saturday on its way to Midway Island to  
catch swordfish. The vessel broke up after relentless pounding by 
12-foot waves and strong winds that kept the Coast Guard from 
unloading the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the vessel was in four pieces, with all except the  
stern drifting toward shore. The accident occurred about 250 yards 
out in shallow water popular for snorkeling and diving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard still is working with vessel owner Vincent  
Nguyen of Honolulu to remove the wreckage. Fuel-soaked Styrofoam, 
wood planks and life preservers have been found, but there have 
been no traces of diesel found in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	About four miles of beach have been closed since Sunday but the  
state was expected to reopen them by this weekend. Authorities 
believe most of the fuel has dissipated, though a state marine 
biologist said diesel can damage coral and marine invertebrates, 
including urchins and sea cucumbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews also are trying to find near-invisible fishing lines that  
drifted from the grounded vessel. Those lines contain thousands of 
hooks that may attract endangered Hawaiian monk seals and sea 
turtles living near the reef. 
</P>
<P>
	There is an upside: the vessel held about 500 boxes of frozen  
squid bait and suspicions are that the seals and sharks have eaten 
it.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Re-sign QB Hoying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Just as the Philadelphia Eagles appear  
poised to use the second pick in Saturday's NFL draft on a 
quarterback, the team re-signed restricted free agent quarterback 
Bobby Hoying on Thursday to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying, the team's starter heading into the 1998 regular season,  
lost his job midway through the year and may still be traded for a 
draft pick this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago at the club's minicamp, Hoying said he hoping for  
a new start. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a new coaching staff, and I'm trying to put last year  
behind me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have to do so with a new team. The Eagles already signed  
veteran Doug Pederson as an unrestricted free agent and named him 
the starting quarterback for 1999. Koy Detmer played well in his 
five starts to close the '98 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The odd quarterbacks out, should the Eagles use the No. 2 pick  
Saturday on a quarterback, would appear to be Hoying and Rodney 
Peete. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoying completed just 50.9 percent of his passes last year, and  
threw zero touchdowns and nine interceptions in 224 attempts. He 
was a third-round pick of the Eagles in 1996. It was a terribly 
disappointing performance for Hoying, who had given the Eagles hope 
the year before that he might become a ``franchise'' quarterback 
after he passed for 11 touchdowns in six starts in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Eagles are giving strong signs they are going to use the  
second pick in this year's draft on another player they hope is a 
``franchise'' quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles also announced on Thursday the signing of 10th-year  
veteran free agent safety Tim Hauck to a one-year contract. The 
32-year-old is coming off his finest NFL season posting 
career-highs in both tackles (83) and forced fumbles (2) for the 
Indianapolis Colts in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fairchild Buys Samsung Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Fairchild Semiconductor has  
completed the $450 million purchase of the Power Device Division of 
Samsung Electronics Co., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Pond, Fairchild's president and chief executive, said  
Wednesday the purchase adds several hundred products to his 
company's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Samsung division makes a variety of semiconductors,  
including those used in televisions, fluorescent lights and power 
car seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Samsung's Power Device business is a strategic purchase for  
Fairchild,'' Pond said. ``It provides Fairchild with geographic 
balance, boosting our presence in Korea and the Asia Pacific 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Power Device Division's 1,200 workers are in  
Beuchon, South Korea, where production lines are located for such 
non-memory parts as transistors, power devices and linear 
integrated circuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will boost Fairchild's annual revenue to more  
than $1 billion, officials said. That would put it in third place 
for revenues in Maine, after Hannaford Bros. and Unum insurance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairchild has 6,300 workers at its headquarters in South  
Portland; at additional manufacturing plants in California, Utah 
and Malaysia; and at regional sales offices around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The company manufactures low-voltage semiconductors, or computer  
chips, used in personal computers, industrial equipment, 
telecommunications equipment, consumer goods and automobiles. 
Samsung's Power Device Division manufactures high-voltage chips for 
such items as televisions and fluorescent lights.

<HEADLINE> `Erotica USA' Expo Debuts in NYC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wandering through a sprawling Manhattan  
convention center on Thursday, chastity belts and electric body 
zappers seemed almost commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	Even cell phone companies and Tower Records had stands at  
``Erotica USA,'' an expo -- complete with theme CD -- of nearly 
everything having to do with sex. It's debuting in New York before 
it travels to Miami, Chicago, Boston and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a lot different from the car show,'' exclaimed  
Bob Miles, a retired banker, as he wandered between a stand selling 
chocolate genitalia and a stage where erotic dancers performed. 
``They advertised it at my gym. It's -- uh -- interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miles was one of thousands of people, mostly men, who paid the  
$30 fee to get a peek at the expo's debut in this country after 
three years in London. ``Erotica USA'' will be in New York for four 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 78 exhibits at the Jacob Javits Convention Center,  
plus performers and talks by experts on sexuality. The show even 
had its own CD, ``Erotica Primal,'' which, along with other music 
and videos, was on sale at a Tower Records stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Another company was selling cell phones because ``We think  
everybody needs to keep in touch, whether it's erotic or not,'' 
said salesman Hector Lugo, adding ``I never expected to be working 
at an erotica expo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul and Brigitta Tooker, owners of Access Denied, one of the  
few companies in the United States to make chastity belts, said 
that within the first hour of the expo, they had already gotten 
orders for two of their belts, which cost as much as $440. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest show we've been to,'' Brigitta Tooker  
said. She called the belts ``quite sweet actually,'' and said some 
people wear them to feel protected and safe. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone was charmed by the exhibit, just blocks from  
Times Square, which until recently a haven for sex shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Redix, of Garden City, stood alone inside a police  
barricade across the street shouting her objections into a 
megaphone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disgraceful. It's really bad,'' she told anyone who would  
listen. ``I would like for there to be a larger turnout here. This 
is a battlefield. It truly is. It's just that not everyone is up to 
the battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a brief news conference held by the nonprofit group  
Morality in Media, in which a handful of clergy and others 
condemned the expo as pornographic and illegal, opposition to the 
expo seemed minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, famous for his tough opposition to sex  
shops, said only that he found it ``inappropriate'' the expo was 
held at a convention center with government connections. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Bari, an organizer of ``Erotica USA,'' said the mayor had  
been ``wonderfully silent'' about the expo and noted he did not 
understand all the fuss about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a basic, primal, human need. Without it, none of us would  
be here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a few visitors found it anything but basic.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like an adult bookshop -- a really big adult bookshop,''  
said Ed Heubner, a railroad worker from Massapequa Park.

<HEADLINE> Military Tests New Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) -- In 24 years with the Marines  
Corps, Wayne Medeiros learned a few things about communication in 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like the guy on the ground was always the last to  
get data,'' the retired major said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Medeiros has designed a device known as the End User  
Terminal, or EUT -- a mobile, wireless computer communication and 
tracking system that soldiers can wear into battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The device was one of several high-tech systems demonstrated  
Wednesday as troops staged a raid on a mock city of cinderblock 
buildings at Camp Pendleton, 40 miles north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The EUT allows combat soldiers to pinpoint the location of  
friendly and enemy troops in the area. Then they can relay that 
information in real time back to commanders, who can then send in 
air strikes or reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it is designed to do is eliminate the fog of war,''  
Marine Col. Mark Thiffault said. 
</P>
<P>
	Worn like a backpack, the EUT includes an ultra-small notebook  
computer, a power amplifier and global positioning system receiver. 
Medeiros, a designer for Litton PRC of McClean, Va., said the 
12-pound pack costs about $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The EUT is part of a larger battlefield communications project  
that has a four-year budget of between $20 million and $30 million 
annually. Most of the systems are still being tested or developed. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration for top military brass, foreign observers and  
reporters was an overall show of strength by the Marine Corps. F-18 
jets swooshed overhead. Cobra attack helicopters rumbled at the 
edge of the valley. Two Sea Knight transport helicopters lumbered 
above two buildings, depositing teams of Marine squads to take the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Some troops liked the EUT, but it has some faults.  
</P>
<P>
	Lance Corporal Tae Yun, 24, from Columbia, Md., said he had  
trouble hearing commands over the headphones or making himself 
understood through the voice-activated microphone during 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other soldiers worried about what would happen if the computer  
took a beating on the battlefield, became infected with chemical 
weapon residue or fell into enemy hands -- with precise data on 
troop locations.

<HEADLINE> Questions Remain Over Browns Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As the Browns make their final preparations for the NFL draft,  
the two most important players for the team to evaluate might be 
Tom Condon and Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Condon, who represents Tim Couch, and Steinberg, Akili Smith's  
agent, were both contacted this week by the Browns, who have made 
it known their two clients are among three players -- along with 
Ricky Williams -- Cleveland is considering taking with the No. 1 
pick in Saturday's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	And as months of speculation, rumors and analysis are reduced to  
hours, the Browns continue to insist they haven't decided what 
they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch is apparently the frontrunner to go to Cleveland, with  
Smith now likely to be selected by either Philadelphia with the No. 
2 pick or Cincinnati at No. 3 if the Eagles go for another 
quarterback, Donovan McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	While appearing on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' on  
Thursday night, Couch said he didn't know where he might wind up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I wish I knew,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch isn't alone. It seems everyone thinks they know who the  
Browns are going to take. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have them taking Couch with the first selection as long  
as a contract can be worked out with Condon of Cleveland-based IMG 
before Saturday. But the Browns maintain they haven't anointed the 
Kentucky quarterback the chosen one yet, and that it's still a 
three-man race for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually in continuing negotiations with agents for all  
three of the picks under consideration,'' Browns team spokesman 
Alex Martins said Thursday. ``The organization has not made a final 
determination as of this point as to which player we will select on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiating process will continue over the course of the  
next few days, and we don't anticipate making a decision on the 
pick until Saturday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same thing the Browns said last month and again last  
week. So either they're still unsure of who to take or they're 
playing a mean game of poker, savoring every moment of holding an 
unbeatable hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Whomever the Browns take first will be a rich man. Condon is  
reportedly seeking a seven-year, $44 million deal, plus a $12 
million signing bonus. Last year, the Indianapolis Colts gave the 
top pick, quarterback Peyton Manning, a six-year, $48 million 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Browns' No. 1 derby comes down to the wire, it appears to  
have become a two-man duel between Couch and Smith. Williams has 
apparently dropped from consideration and will probably be taken by 
Indianapolis with the No. 4 pick after the Colts traded running 
back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and Smith appear together on the cover of this week's  
Sports Illustrated with both wearing Browns No. 99 jerseys -- Couch 
in brown, Smith in white. They're sitting side-by-side as ``Big 
Dawg,'' the leader of Cleveland's Dawg Pound, stands behind them 
holding a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, director of football operations  
Dwight Clark and other Cleveland front office personnel have spent 
the week behind closed doors dissecting game films, scouting 
profiles and background checks on the pair of passers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a quarterback guru, is thought to favor the more mobile,  
more mature Smith over Couch, who was put through a rigorous, 
90-minute workout by the Browns in Lexington, Ky., last weekend. 
Palmer was reportedly displeased with Couch's initial workout and 
wanted to see how Couch responded to some hands-on coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who drew wide criticism in 1997 while in San Francisco  
for taking QB Jim Druckenmiller over Jake Plummer, has been a Couch 
proponent and thinks the 21-year-old's ``upside'' might be greater 
than Smith, who is 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever differences exist, team president Carmen Policy  
promises the Browns will be of ``like mind'' when draft day 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he and Clark have been going over draft day  
scenarios for weeks and feels a difference in opinion is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwight and I have been on the same page since I started with  
the Cleveland Browns,'' he said. ``Every time I've started off in a 
different direction we've come back to the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> Terror Grows Over Ethnic Cleansing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- Hamide Feteh Mulaj filled out a landing  
card like those for tourists, but around her the children's 
mewling, the blood oozing from broken shoes, the blank stares all 
suggested something else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs, it appeared, were suddenly in a new hurry to rid  
Kosovo of ethnic Albanians, and their systematic terror seemed to 
have reached an unprecedented pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	For days now, refugee columns to Albania have numbered in the  
thousands. On Wednesday there were 3,600, with even more on 
Thursday; more than 5,500 arrived over those two days in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government maintains the refugees are fleeing NATO  
airstrikes, but the refugees tell similar stories of being forced 
out, suggesting that Serbs have decided to methodically empty the 
last redoubts, village by village, using all the force they can 
muster. Repeated accounts tell of wholesale beatings and sometimes 
mass executions of fighting-age males. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first expulsions seemed relatively orderly,'' said Jacques  
Franquin, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, 
``but now it is getting very nasty. I'm afraid we saw the best we 
could expect, and now we will see the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franquin said when he watched thousands of women, children and  
old men stumble over the mountain-pass border after four days of 
walking ``it made me ashamed to be a human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees who came out weeks ago agreed with Franquin's  
assessment. ``They are rushing to steal everything they can and 
occupy everything while there is still time,'' said Valmer Zeka of 
Prizren, echoing a widely held view. 
</P>
<P>
	About 550,000 ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo to neighboring  
countries since late March, the UNHCR estimates, and as many as 
400,000 displaced people may still try to get out if Serbs pursue 
them into forests and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenan Idrizaj, a Kosovar refugee helping the French Doctors of  
the World, said medical teams at the border treated at least 100 
people Wednesday night for serious exposure after up to a week of 
walking with no food and little water. 
</P>
<P>
	Some decided to flee on foot after hiding out for weeks without  
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we could do for one young boy was put a blanket over him  
and return the body to the father,'' he said. An undetermined 
number of old people died on the way and had to be left unburied in 
the rush, Idrizaj said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the latest refugees are from the Drenica area, mainly  
villages near Skenderaj, not far from Pec. This, they admit with 
some pride, is a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hurriedly build Greek camp in Kukes, Albania, Raza Sahiti  
rested on the ground with her bare feet and ankles painted bright 
purple, one of many treated with gentian violet antiseptic to fight 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
	With her 17-year-old daughter Sharife adding details, she  
described a typical ordeal faced by the new wave of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Six days ago, she said, Serb troops stormed into her village of  
Kopiliqi at 4 a.m. and began shooting through doors. She thinks 
five people were killed, but she did not have time to linger to 
find out. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the men, including her husband, were rounded up and taken  
away. That was the last she saw them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharife and a younger son walked out with her. Two older sons  
are in the mountains fighting with the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next tent, is Lushi Loshozh, a 53-year-old ex-driver  
whose bus was burned a year ago when the Serbs also burned his 
house. With two sons in the KLA, he had to remain out of site, 
hiding in the mountains or in small Drenica villages near his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days ago, Serbs swept through the villages and rounded up  
the men. The women and children were told to leave immediately or 
face death. Loshozh got away with his wife and seven young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Dyka,'' he said, proudly patting his 8-year-old  
daughter in an off-brand sweatshirt with ``Boston Bravers'' 
emblazoned on the front. ``As soon as the kids are settled, I am 
going back to fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many other new refugees came from the city of Prizren, urban  
people with no links to the KLA. They said Serbs simply decided it 
was time for them to get out, leaving everything behind, and no one 
was in a position to argue. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered reports of systematic rape, mutilation and murder of  
young women are often secondhand and difficult to verify, but many 
refugees who repeat the details among themselves respond 
emotionally as if they were true. 
</P>
<P>
	Added to indisputable facts of recent history, the bitterness  
runs deep. Clearly, the Serbs are playing for keeps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never!'' Raza Sahiti spat when asked if she thought Albanians  
and Serbs could ever cohabit Kosovo in peace. A large group of men 
and women around her shook their heads in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheide Derakaj, 32, joined in for the first time with an angry  
torrent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' she began, her voice rising fast. ``How can  
we live with Serbs, who have surrounded us four times, traumatized 
our children, taken our men, killed us? Impossible.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Cop Accused of Running Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A police officer charged with running a drug ring  
was accused Thursday by a drug dealer of giving guns and bags of 
ammunition to one gang so they could wage war on another. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation was in a plea agreement between federal  
prosecutors and Joseph DeLeon, 32, one of three men who pleaded 
guilty Thursday to being part of a ring that put more than 220 
pounds of crack cocaine on the streets of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused officer, gang-crimes investigator Joseph  
Miedzianowski, has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to 
possess and distribute cocaine. He has not been charged with 
weapons violations. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who are narcotics peddlers, dope dealers, and  
they know that their only way out so they can see the light of day 
again is to make up stories about Joe Miedzianowski,'' Phillip 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors have charged that Miedzianowski, 46, took  
part in the drug trade he was hired to fight, distributing cocaine, 
supplying guns, taking protection money and identifying undercover 
officers to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	They also claim he supplied guns in late 1997 and early 1998 for  
DeLeon's Imperial Gangsters, who were engaged in gang warfare with 
their rivals the Spanish Cobras. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns allegedly were stolen from the Cook County sheriff's  
shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLeon and the three others who pleaded guilty -- Francisco  
Figueroa, 29, and David Ruiz, 28, and Yolanda Navarro, 26 -- are 
expected to be government witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were among a dozen individuals indicted in the case on  
April 9, including Miedzianowski, who has been suspended. The 
police department has started proceedings to fire him.

<HEADLINE> New Arteries Grown in Laboratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experiment with pig cells and a machine  
that mimics the pulse of the heart shows that new, living arteries 
can be grown in the laboratory to replace diseased vessels, an 
important step in the developing field of making new body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Laura A. Niklason of Duke University, leader of the research  
team that made the pig arteries, said that the vessels ``are 
indistinguishable from the native structure. They are completely 
smooth, glistening structures inside and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason, first author of a study that appears Friday in the  
journal Science, said that although the experiment used pigs, it 
demonstrated that it is fundamentally possible to grow new arteries 
to replace those that have become clogged or blocked by heart 
disease. She said engineered, living arteries may someday be used 
in human heart bypasses instead of the leg veins that doctors now 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is proof that one can take a vessel from an adult animal,  
make an artery and then put it back in and have it work,'' said 
Niklason. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of labs are now experimenting with tissue culture  
techniques designed to grow new body parts. Some have grown 
ligaments, tendons, bone and even a new ear. But Niklason said her 
experiment was different because the incubation machine 
rhythmically pumped nutrients through the developing cells, 
imitating the pressures from a beating heart. 
</P>
<P>
	This pulsation, she said, increased the strength of the finished  
artery and made it last longer when it was transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first tissue engineering in a lab system that  
tried to mimic the pulse in the human body,'' she said. ``Other 
tissue engineering has been done in a static system where there was 
no real attempt to copy what is happening so far as the push and 
pull of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles A. Vacanti, director of the Center for Tissue  
Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, said 
Niklason's work ``is an important advance in tissue engineering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vacanti, whose work includes growing a new thumb bone for one  
patient, said that so much is unknown about how nature makes new 
tissue that ``the best thing you can do is mimic the human body. 
She (Niklason) has demonstrated that that principal is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her experiment, Niklason made a tube resembling an artery  
from a polymer material. This tube would eventually dissolve, but 
it acted as a scaffold for the developing tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason then removed a small segment of a neck artery from a  
pig and from this vessel took some smooth muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The tube was placed in a machine that circulates a broth that  
includes cell nutrients and oxygen. The tube was then seeded with 
the pig smooth muscle cells. A pump sent pulses of nutrient through 
the tube, feeding the cells and causing them to grow new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 weeks, the polymer tube had been replaced by a tube of  
smooth muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason then added endothelial cells, the tissue that lines  
arteries. In just three days, the inner surfaces were smoothly 
covered and the artery was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Arteries made in this way were grafted into the pigs that  
donated the cells and Niklason said that the vessels ``worked 
beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some specimens made without the pulsing system failed after two  
weeks, but the arteries made with the pulsing ``functioned like 
native vessels'' for up to four weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason said it will be years before she is ready to attempt to  
make human arteries, but she predicts that eventually doctors will 
use engineered vessels routinely as replacement parts when 
operating on ailing hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, surgeons must remove up to 24 inches of leg vein in  
order to find segments needed for heart bypass surgery. Often, the 
vein removal causes more complications for patients than does the 
heart bypass itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason said that to make an engineered artery may require only  
about an inch of vein and this would leave the leg vessels 
essentially unaffected.

<HEADLINE> Martinsville Has New-Look Pit Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- NASCAR's oldest oval will be sporting a  
new look when the Winston Cup series arrives for the Goody's Body 
Pain 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race at Martinsville Speedway will mark the first time  
all 43 drivers pit on the front stretch. Many drivers have lauded 
the change as an equalizer, but others are reserving judgment until 
after the race. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, half the field pitted on the front straightaway and  
half on the back, with the second group hugely disadvantaged. No 
driver since Lee Petty in 1959 has won at Martinsville from the 
back pits. 
</P>
<P>
	Points leader Jeff Burton said that setup wasn't fair.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think in Winston Cup racing today, the penalty for  
qualifying poorly shouldn't be that you can't win the race,'' 
Burton said. ``I think everybody ought to have a chance to win the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's older brother, Ward, isn't so sure he agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why they did it,'' he said. ``We either need to  
run frontstretch-backstretch pits or mile-and-a-half tracks with 
one long pit. I know they're trying to make things better for the 
guys on the backstretch, but I'm not sure this is the way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big concern for many drivers is the pit road speed of 35 mph,  
which will make the drive unusually long and frustrating. Pit road 
opens at the entrance to turn No. 3 and exits coming out of No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	On a track that measures .526 miles, that's a long way at 35  
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing it will do is really change the way you approach  
the place,'' Jeremy Mayfield said. ``You have to make really good 
decisions on when to pit. The key is going to be avoiding pitting 
under green if you can. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when you might drop in early if you thought  
you were on the verge of some kind of problem. Make a quick stop, 
lose and lap and figure you could get it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You drop it now and you're going to come out three or four  
laps down. You aren't going to make that up on the racetrack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti expects pitting under a caution to be tricky, too,  
especially for cars on the tail end of pit road, and said the pit 
situation could lead to yet another strategic change on NASCAR's 
shortest track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll know a lot more after the race,'' Andretti said. ``You  
sure want to get good fuel mileage. That might be a first for a 
short track.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends NATO Air Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today that a united  
NATO is determined ``to maintain and intensify attacks'' against 
the Serbs to save Kosovo and to guarantee the security of its 
ethnic Albanians with an international force. He invited Russia to 
join such an effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the  
NATO air war will be waged until Slobodan Milsevic's forces are so 
weakened they yield their grip on the province or permit ethnic 
Albanian refugees to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering editors' questions, Clinton said the mistaken bombing  
that the Yugoslavs said killed 75 refugees near the Albanian border 
was regrettable and tragic, but no reason to change the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like  
this occurring,'' he said. ``This is not a business of 
perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton said the refugees would not have been in harm's way  
had not Milosevic's forces driven them from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot simply watch as hundreds of thousand of people are  
brutalized, murdered, raped, forced from their homes ... all in the 
name of ethnic pride,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked how he would respond to radio talk show  
critics who question whether he has the moral authority to be 
commander in chief and how he would answer to an Air Force pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't have to. ``I am his commander in chief,'' and  
U.S. pilots are performing admirably. ``They don't deserve to hear 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the possibility of Russian aid in protecting ethnic  
Albanians once the bloodshed ends, Clinton it is ``the kind of 
mission I hope Russia can join as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, bitter opponents of the current air campaign,  
joined the peacekeeping force that settled ethnic strive in Bosnia 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The president began by saying that the forum itself was striking  
evidence of the difference between a free press and a closed press. 
He said the government run press in Yugoslavia ``has created an 
alternative reality'' based on propaganda about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness our press and the press around the world have  
tried to get at and get out the truth,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long term, he said, NATO is fighting for the future and  
stability of multiethnic democracies in southeastern Europe, the 
historically troubled Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our NATO allies are in Kosovo today because we want to  
stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic's aim was to drive the Albanian majority from  
the province even if it means turning Kosovo ``into a lifeless 
wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Yugoslav leader also sought to divide NATO, but  
after three weeks, the alliance is solid. He said ``NATO is more 
united today than when the operation began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned  
and long premeditated attack on an entire people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO will end it, and will at the same time increase  
efforts to help the more than 500,000 refugees driven from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One editor told Clinton that he had heard the Pentagon had  
intelligence that Milosevic's forces had chemical weapons. He asked 
what the U.S. response would be to use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it would be ``swift and overwhelming. ... I think  
they are well aware of the dangers of overly escalating this. ... 
That's all I should say right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Clinton's staff signaled an end to the  
question-and-answer session, but the president said he would go on. 
``They think the longer I stay up here, the greater my chances of 
screwing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lack of information released by the military  
about bombing attacks, Clinton explained that there were problems 
with weather and with coordinating the response with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware this is a difficulty, I am working on it, and trying  
to get NATO to do more as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he feels ``the more information we can get out  
there quickly, the better off we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the convention hotel, several hundred protesters chanted  
``No war, no bombs, no new Vietnam.'' A smaller group demonstrated 
in support of the NATO campaign.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Hope To Force Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers who want to stop paying federally  
mandated promotion fees say they are one step closer to forcing a 
vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the so-called ``checkoff fees'' planned to announce  
at a news conference today in Des Moines, Iowa, that they had 
gathered 16,500 signatures on a petition -- more than the 14,986 
required by the Agriculture Department to call for a referendum on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The signatures, which must represent 15 percent of all hog  
producers and importers, must still be verified by federal 
officials before a referendum can be set, but organizers said they 
were confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``To end up with 2,000 more I think says something,'' said  
Rhonda Perry, a Missouri organizer for the Campaign for Family 
Farms. ``There is a lot of opposition to a program that has 
absolutely no accountability to the people who are paying for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petitioners would like USDA to hold a referendum in 60 to 90  
days. Federal law, however, sets no specific timetable for setting 
a referendum once the signatures have been verified. A referendum 
would be decided by a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The fee or checkoff requires pork producers to pay 45 cents for  
every $100 of animal value. 
</P>
<P>
	The money goes to the quasi-governmental National Pork Board,  
which contracts promotion services through the National Pork 
Producers Council, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit released last week by the Agriculture Department's  
inspector general said the pork board was too closely tied to the 
industry group and recommended that it take steps to separate. The 
audit found no evidence, however, that the pork board had misused 
checkoff dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Perry and others contend producers get very little for  
the millions they pay each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a business person and you continue to throw money  
into a program in which your business does not see a return on 
investment, people would say you're a bad manager,'' Perry said. 
``In agriculture, that's called a mandatory checkoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers have been especially stressed this year as an  
oversupply dropped prices to their lowest level in four decades. 
They also point to the disparity between the prices producers are 
getting and what retailers are charging consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle producers are already collecting signatures for a vote on  
their checkoff fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc.'s stock skidded 10 percent Thursday  
after the drug company reported a drop in sales of Viagra and 
warned that profit growth would slow in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, which released its first-quarter results Thursday, said  
it will fall far short of the 35 percent profit growth it enjoyed 
last spring due to the explosive initial sales of the 
anti-impotence pill Viagra. Pfizer also hinted that overall 1999 
earnings would be slightly below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the just-ended quarater, Pfizer earned $815 million, or 62  
cents per share, up 27 percent from $692 million, or 53 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer revenues jumped 29 percent to $3.93 billion from $3.04  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings met analysts' expectations, according to surveys by  
First Call. Yet, many traders had quietly hoped the company would 
beat Wall Street's already rosy forecasts. Pfizer stock fell $14.75 
to $129.88 on Thursday in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Pfizer could have posted higher profits, but  
instead chose to spend more on research and building its sales 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very smart strategy for the long haul, but does not  
help the short term,'' said Steven Gerber, an analyst with CIBC 
Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, the world's fourth-largest drug company, has been a  
pharmaceutical dynamo the past three years. It owns or sells the 
three fastest growing new drugs in pharmaceutical history: Viagra; 
the cholesterol drug Lipitor, which it markets with Warner-Lambert; 
and the arthritis pill Celebrex, which it markets with Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
	The three drugs combined are expected to generate more than $4  
billion in 1999 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	With such high expectations, analysts said Pfizer's stock was  
vulnerable to a big selloff, especially during a week when 
investors are moving from growth stocks to cyclical stocks, those 
that tend to rise and fall with the economy, and to smaller company 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said profit growth would be in the single digits in the  
second quarter, far below the 20 percent to 30 percent Wall Street 
has come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer posted $193 million in worldwide Viagra sales during the  
first quarter, down 18 percent from $236 million in the fourth 
quarter. In the second quarter of 1998, Viagra had $411 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Viagra sales rose slightly to $149 million in the first  
quarter of 1999, up from $131 million in the prior three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra sales should improve markedly in the second quarter with  
the drug's launch in Japan and Canada, Pfizer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak Viagra sales in the United States were attributed to the  
leveling off of the curiosity factor related to the drug and to 
limits insurers have placed on coverage for it, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the demand for the first-ever impotence pill are  
startling. More than 9 million prescriptions have been written for 
4 million patients since its launch in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the Viagra problems, as far as overall sales and  
earnings growth, Pfizer is still a rising company,'' said Hemant 
Shah, analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer's biggest-selling drug, Norvasc, a hypertension  
medication, posted a 24 percent increase in first quarter sales to 
$703 million. Sales of the antibiotic Zithromax rose 44 percent to 
$441 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues that Pfizer gets from marketing other companies' drugs,  
such as Lipitor and Celebrex, rose 168 percent to $403 million.

<HEADLINE> Storms Kill Two in Miss. and Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOSO, Miss. (AP) -- Powerful storms swept through parts of the  
South, destroying homes, damaging a marina and downing power lines 
as they churned eastward. Two people killed and more than two dozen 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	J.B. Pickering, 71, died as a result of an apparent tornado that  
destroyed his mobile home in rural Soso, the Jones County coroner's 
office said. Three other family members were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, a tree blew onto a mobile home in the Castlelaw  
Trailer Park in Crockett County late Wednesday, killing a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight line winds blew down trees and power lines throughout  
the county, crushing 50 to 60 boats at the Mansard Island Marina on 
Kentucky Lake's Big Sandy Basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Marina owner Cee Koenig said the wind picked up one portion of  
the dock with the boats moored to it, and dropped it on another 
portion of the dock. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the height of our fishing season and we had a full  
house of guests,'' Koenig said. Nobody was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, high wind destroyed a mobile home in Russell County  
while downing trees and power lines in several locations, but no 
one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Mississippi worked today to determine the scope  
of the damage caused by the storms that hit the area 60 miles 
southeast of Jackson late Wednesday. Heavy rain and wind were 
reported throughout Mississippi, but the majority of the damage 
appeared to be in Jones, Jasper and Covington counties. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 36 residences, 21 of them mobile homes, were reportedly  
damaged or destroyed in Jones County. As many as 50 families had 
been displaced by the storm, said James Grimes, a communications 
officer with the Jones County sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had enough officers and other resources out during the  
night that we are confident now that we don't have anyone 
missing,'' Grimes said. ``Everyone is accounted for as far as we 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at South Central Regional hospital in Laurel said they  
had treated 25 to 30 people for minor injuries, mostly cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In Covington County, one home was destroyed and two were heavily  
damaged. Trees were down and livestock was reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Crosby and her neighbors gathered outside her white,  
woodframe home in Soso at midmorning today, looking over the damage 
left by the storm and giving thanks they survived. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a blessing from the Lord,'' Crosby said as she  
looked over the twisted remains of two vacant mobile homes that 
were torn from their plots beside her home. ``It's Jesus that this 
house is still standing.''

<HEADLINE>  Algerian Candidates Charge Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Algerians were urged to vote today in a  
presidential election left with a lone contender after six other 
candidates abruptly pulled out, alleging vote fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise developments on the eve of the election were a blow  
to hopes that the voting would help mend fractures in this nation 
caught up in a cycle of violence since 1992, the start of an 
Islamic insurgency. Some 75,000 people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The single remaining contestant, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, widely  
viewed as the candidate of the powerful military, said he would 
accept victory only if backed by a large majority and a massive 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	Turnout was light as polls opened this morning in the North  
African nation of 31 million people. Results were not expected 
until Friday, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Many saw the election to give Algeria its first civilian  
president since 1965 as a step toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The pullout was to protest alleged fraud in early voting by  
army, police and customs personnel in Algeria's vast Saharan 
expanse. It also represented an act of defiance against the 
army-backed old order, which has bred fraud and corruption since 
Algeria gained independence from France in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates, from across the political spectrum, pulled out  
after President Liamine Zeroual refused to meet with them on the 
fraud charges, suggesting instead they file formal complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeroual, a retired general who is stepping down 18 months before  
his five-year term ends, sharply criticized the candidates' 
withdrawal in a nationwide television address and ordered the 
election to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting his ballot early today, Zeroual continued his rebuke of  
the withdrawal, saying that ``history will judge the positions of 
each'' one of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the main thing is that the right to speak is given to the  
people so they can make their choice,'' Zeroual added. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts in electoral law said such a withdrawal would not halt  
an election. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika has for months been billed in the press as the  
``candidate of consensus.'' The statement is a derogatory reference 
to his backing from a large segment of the establishment, including 
the powerful UGTA union, a moderate Islamic party in the coalition 
government and the National Liberation Front, which ruled Algeria 
for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Bouteflika said that  
to become president, he needed ``a massive participation of the 
people and a score that gives me the capacity to meet the extremely 
numerous challenges which just have been complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say what figures would be acceptable. Without a huge  
success at the polls, ``I'll go home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to explain what he thought would happen if he failed to  
meet his own conditions, he replied: ``The institutions are there. 
The state won't collapse. It's not the end of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called the withdrawal of the six a ``flagrant twisting of the  
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he skirted the issue of whether the army tapped him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a bit hurt to see the intelligentsia of my country not  
knowing how to negotiate this particularly delicate turn,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Algeria is in the process of rebuilding its institutions,  
dismantled in an army coup that canceled 1992 legislative elections 
the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The move triggered the insurgency and the country veered into  
near chaos. 
</P>
<P>
	A measure of the hope placed in the election was the call by the  
Salvation Front for Algerians to vote ``en masse,'' after boycott 
calls in three previous elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement issued last week by the banned party's exiled  
leaders in Europe praised all the candidates for their will to seek 
national reconciliation, while asking citizens to cast ballots for 
Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, a former minister sympathetic to the Islamic 
cause and one of the six who withdrew Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Lynn Jennings Returns to Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Although Lynn Jennings never has officially run a  
marathon, she'll feel like the world's greatest distance runner at 
the start of the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll make sure I have my Nike necklace on and my temporary  
Powerbar tattoos on my biceps,'' she said. ``That makes me feel 
like Superwoman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will help her psychologically, not necessarily physically  
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also aiding her mentally will be a cockiness that often scares  
opponents. Physically, she also will be abetted by having completed 
a rigid and well-disciplined six-month training program that put 
her in superb condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel prepared to stand on the starting line,'' Jennings  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like she does for every race. Hardly any runner in the  
world is considered more focused on a race than the 38-year-old 
Jennings. She often says she ``owns'' her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Such confidence has helped her win 10 titles at the USA Outdoor  
Championships -- two at 3,000 meters, one at 5,000 and seven at 
10,000 -- along with an Olympic bronze medal in the 10,000, and nine 
U.S. cross country championships. She also holds the American 
record for 10,000 meters; American indoor records for two miles, 
3,000 and 5,000 meters; American road records for 5 and 10 
kilometers; and has won scores of road races all over the world 
during her 23-year racing career. 
</P>
<P>
	She even beat her coach in her only marathon, when she was an  
unofficial entrant in the 1978 Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	At that time, she was a precocious high school senior at the  
Bromfield School in Harvard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was too young for a number,'' she said. ``You had to be 18.  
I was an impulsive 17-year-old. I had done a 20-mile workout 
leading up to that race. I was a track and cross-country runner in 
high school, but my longest race had been 10K (6.2 miles).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings finished the 26-mile, 385-yard course under 2:47, in  
third place among the women, less than three minutes behind winner 
Gayle Barron. She might have finished first, but she was afraid, 
perhaps for the only time in her career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I held back, because I didn't want Jock Semple to be mad at  
me,'' she said. ``I didn't want to finish any higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Semple was the irate race official who forcibly tried to remove  
Kathy Switzer from the 1967 Boston Marathon -- because she was a 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	John Babington, who had coached Jennings since she was 14, also  
was in the race and finished about 10 minutes behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's no disgrace,'' Babington said. ``She's beaten a lot of  
men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, after the race, Babington and Jennings split --  
amicably. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going off to college (Princeton),'' Jennings said. ``It  
was a cordial relationship between coach and athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babington describes the break a little differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't approve of her running in that race,'' he said. ``We  
weren't on the best of terms when she went off to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marathon led to the falling out. I felt she was too young.  
The marathon was not for someone her age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the race, Jennings injured a knee and needed arthroscopic  
surgery. She had been the 1977 national junior champion at 1,500 
meters and couldn't defend her title in the spring of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Babington and Jennings resumed their athletic relationship 11  
years later, and basically have been on the same page since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized how good she could be as a runner,'' Babington  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings didn't fully realize her potential until she watched  
Joan Benoit Samuelson win the first women's Olympic marathon at the 
1984 Los Angeles Games. Jennings trained alongside Samuelson as 
teammates on the Liberty Athletic Club and had beaten her several 
times in competitive races. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspired by Samuelson's gold medal performace, Jennings -- who  
had quit running several times out of frustration -- rededicated 
herself to the sport. She made the 1988 Olympic team at 10,000 
meters and finished sixth at the Seoul Games. Four years later, she 
was the 10,000 bronze medalist at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	Why run the marathon now?  
</P>
<P>
	``She's been looking for a new challenge,'' Babington said.  
``People have been asking her for a long time when she was going to 
run a marathon. She just got a hankering to do it. It just seems 
right to do it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Will marathoning be her future?  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see how this goes and proceed from there,'' Jennings  
said. ``My focus is on the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the world ends on April 19. Is there an April 20?''

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Black Farmer Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge's final stamp of approval on a  
multimillion-dollar settlement for black farmers is being hailed as 
a significant step in ending years of discrimination by the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time ever in a racial discrimination case that  
serious money has been paid out,'' Alexander Pires, lead attorney 
for the plaintiffs, said after the judge's approval was announced 
Wednesday. ``I think it's going to encourage others to speak out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman issued a statement saying the  
settlement was ``fair and just, both for the black farmers and for 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With this approval, USDA can move forward, putting a painful  
chapter of our history behind us,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's approval came four months  
after attorneys for the two sides announced a settlement. At that 
time, Friedman gave preliminary approval to the deal, but he held a 
fairness hearing last month to get farmers' input. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has worked with attorneys on both sides over the past  
few weeks to try to address some of the farmers' concerns. No 
changes were made in the financial terms, although some safeguards 
were added to ensure farmers' rights during the settlement process, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers had complained that the deal lacked checks and balances  
to prevent them from being abused during the process. Many also 
wanted long-term safeguards against racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Black farmers sued two years ago because they had been denied  
access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pires said more than 18,000 farmers have already signed up for  
the settlement and estimated that it could eventually be worth more 
than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, farmers with less documented evidence of  
discrimination can take a $50,000 payment, as well as $12,500 to 
cover taxes, and have their government debts forgiven. Farmers with 
more evidence could opt to go before an independent arbitrator and 
seek larger damages. Farmers could also choose to opt out of the 
lawsuit and pursue their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At the judge's suggestion, attorneys added a provision that  
allows the judge to select a monitor who will oversee the 
settlement. Another provision adds a layer of retired judges to 
review decisions made by an adjudicator, who will decide whether 
many farmers qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some black farmers had a lukewarm response to the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it still leaves a lot to be desired,'' said Gary  
Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists 
Association. ``The membership mostly has been saying, 'Get rid of 
it, it's not any good.'''

<HEADLINE> 89-Year-Old Caught Selling Crack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Brose Gearhart was due to spend his 90th  
birthday Friday behind bars for selling crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Gearhart was sentenced to 1 1/3 to four years in state prison on  
Monday for felony crack possession with intent to sell. Police said 
he ran a $1,000-a-week crack sales operation from his Saugerties 
home and routinely traded drugs for sex with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding his age, we have to send a message,'' Ulster  
County senior assistant district attorney Michael Miranda said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence stems from a police raid on Gearhart's Saugerties  
home in March 1998 that netted about an ounce of crack worth an 
estimated $2,000 to $2,500. He made the $3,000 bail on that charge 
but was arrested months later when police found crack cocaine in 
his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got nothing to say, I guess,'' Gearhart told the judge at  
his sentencing. He was still awaiting transfer from jail to the 
state prison system Thursday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Clear Two Okla. Convicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADA, Okla. (AP) -- Two men who spent 12 years in prison for rape  
and murder -- one of whom was on death row - were freed Thursday 
because DNA tests ruled both out as the killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Williamson, 46, had been sentenced to death and Dennis  
Fritz, 49, to life in prison. Both had maintained their innocence 
since juries in 1988 convicted them of strangling and assaulting a 
21-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never replace the 12 years the defendants have been  
incarcerated, nor can we forget Debra Carter. All we can do is go 
forward,'' Pontotoc County District Judge Tom Landrith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the same DNA tests that cleared the two  
identified a third man, a witness against both men, as a suspect. 
The man, Glen Gore, 38, escaped from a prison work detail 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore testified that he saw Williamson with the victim the night  
she died. He was the only witness to connect them. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the victim's family left the courtroom in tears,  
refusing to comment. The crowd showed little emotion as Williamson 
and Fritz were led out to pick up their belongings at the county 
jail, but the men returned to applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Living on death row, I can say ... there's a lot of pain and  
misery,'' Williamson said. ``That's a miserable existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz remains frustrated: ``For the innocent person it's  
difficult, because you have no way to release your feelings. You 
have no way to justify your incarceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new trial a federal judge ordered for Williamson cleared the  
way for the DNA testing of semen samples and hair samples from the 
crime scene. Tests showed the samples did not match either man. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed against Gore, who was serving three  
40-year sentences for first-degree burglary, kidnapping and 
shooting with intent to injure.

<HEADLINE> Slow-Moving Japan May Avoid Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's slow-moving court system, red tape-bound  
industries, stodgy corporate culture and reluctance to embrace the 
personal computer at home and work may be a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of a senior analyst who said Thursday that  
fears of Japan triggering a worldwide crisis Jan. 1 with its 
inability to cope with the so-called millennium bug are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	The very structural woes that have kept the world's  
second-largest economy in the doldrums will help mitigate the 
impact of the switch to 2000, said Makoto Nomura, chief economist 
at Sumitomo-Life Research Institute Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Year 2000 problem is a real problem, but the impact from  
any computer system breakdowns will be limited,'' Nomura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has ordered all government agencies  
to test major systems by late June -- a date private firms also have 
been encouraged to meet. Banks are required to submit quarterly 
reports detailing their progress. 
</P>
<P>
	But questions remain about whether Japan will be ready.  
</P>
<P>
	Computers that refer to only the last two digits of a year may  
be unable to distinguish between 2000 and 1900, which could trigger 
system crashes or create erroneous data. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura, a former top official in the Economic Planning Agency,  
told reporters that Japan has been stepping up efforts to deal with 
the Y2K bug and increase public awareness. 
</P>
<P>
	While disruptions may occur, he dismissed concerns that computer  
failures will cause major dislocations in the Japanese business 
world or society at large. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, dependence on computers is much lower here than  
in the United States. Use of PCs in Japan is only half as 
widespread as in the United States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Japanese companies have only recently begun to go digital,  
so the computer equipment they do have tends to be newer and more 
compliant with 2000-numbered years, Nomura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically heavy-handed corporate decision making means most  
departments in a company or industrial conglomerate use the same 
computers -- often installed with in-house software, all of which 
makes across-the-board upgrades easier, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's strong influence on basic industries has helped  
prod compliance as well, which may reduce the chance of service 
outages by electrical and water utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't say a lot for structural reform efforts, but  
government regulation of utilities remains strong,'' Nomura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan also has a wealth of experience dealing with big date  
changes and big disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sumitomo-Life expert noted that Jan. 1, 1989 -- the outset of  
the current emperor's reign, known as Heisei, caused few 
disruptions. And in 1995, Japan had to respond to a devastating 
earthquake that killed more than 6,000 people in the western port 
city of Kobe.

<HEADLINE> Endangered Species Act Shift Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some conservationists say an effort to make  
the 1973 Endangered Species Act more landowner-friendly would put 
taxpayers in the position of paying property owners for merely 
following the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill that would require the government to compensate owners  
for taking measures to protect endangered species -- by not killing 
wildlife or destroying their habitat -- ``is a shotgun blast that 
would cripple the ESA and the irreplaceable fish, wildlife, and 
plant species that depend on it,'' Steven Shimberg, a National 
Wildlife Federation vice president, told the House Resources 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill said they want to protect endangered  
species, but also want to provide relief to landowners, who are 
bearing too much of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to force some people alone to bear public burdens  
which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public 
as a whole,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, committee chairman and 
sponsor of the bill. The measure would require the federal 
government, in its efforts to protect wildlife, to minimize any 
impact on property rights or compensate the owner with taxpayers' 
money for any loss of use of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., has introduced a package of bills,  
similar to legislation has been unsuccessful in the past, to update 
wildlife protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he wants to protect people who find themselves in  
situations similar to that of a constituent who wanted to open a 
recycling business on 20 acres in the central California community 
of McKittrick, but balked when a federal agency said he would have 
to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to get a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and  
Wildlife Service asked the landowner to buy an additional 380 acres 
of land for a wildlife refuge to mitigate any harm the recycling 
business would cause to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Each acre cost about $1,000, Thomas said. ``This is simply  
extortion, plain and simple,'' he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Endangered Species Act became law 25 years ago, few  
lawmakers imagined the controversy it would unleash: fights pitting 
the protection of plants and animals against the rights of humans 
to own and manage their land, perform their jobs and meet the needs 
of a growing population. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures deemed necessary to protect such wildlife as the snail  
darter, spotted owl, kangaroo rat, Delhi fly, and black-spored 
quillwort have caused headaches for landowners, bringing many 
projects to a temporary or permanent halt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I voted for the ESA in 1973, Congress was not told that  
this law would be used to force private property owners to set 
aside land for habitat for species against their will and without 
being compensated for the loss of their property,'' Young said. 
``And if they aren't willing to set aside their land, the federal 
government can put them in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shimberg said efforts to improve the law, which has strong  
support from the public, should concentrate on providing financial 
incentives for property owners to go beyond the law's requirements 
by taking action to benefit endangered wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paying people not to do the wrong thing defies common sense  
and would be a raid on the treasury,'' Shimberg said. Landowners 
who feel they have been mistreated by the government already have 
recourse in the courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Young's bill, private property owners ``would be free to  
bulldoze sea turtle and shorebird nesting beaches and to chop down 
eagle nesting trees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1142.

<HEADLINE> Marquee Fight Pits Jones &AMP; Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he cannot resist a challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the WBC-WBA light heavyweight champion could get one when  
he fights IBF champion Reggie Johnson in a 175-pound title 
unification bout June 5 in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in 
Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of Roy's career, and it's the  
biggest fight of my career,'' the left-handed Johnson (39-5-1, 24 
knockouts) said Thursday. Jones has a 39-1 record, with 33 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the news conference were some students of PS72 in  
upper Manhattan, and one youngster had a question for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, in what round do you think you will knock Mr.  
Johnson down?'' the boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it I'll knock him down or not, but from round  
one to round 12, I'll be doing a job on him,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match will be the fourth in a string of HBO-televised fights  
that run will run through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Naseem Hamed of Britain retained the WBO featherweight  
title by stopping Paul Ingle of Britain in the 11th round April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The next fight will be Oscar De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title  
defense against Oba Carr on May 22 in Las Vegas. It will be 
followed by Felix Trinidad's defense of the IBF welterweight title 
May 29 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Jones-Johnson match, a 
heavyweight fight between Michael Grant and Lou Savarese on June 19 
at Madison Square Garden in New York and another bout featuring 
Hamed, on July 17, against an opponent to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, also said that a  
pay-per-view rematch between heavyweight champions Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis -- who fought to a disputed draw March 13 
-- would be held Nov. 6 or Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one meeting away,'' Abraham said when asked if the fight  
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson won the WBA light heavyweight title in  
1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round Feb. 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Franklin Exhibit Focuses on Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In revolutionary America, a small corps of  
earnest experimenters and observers of nature came to see 
themselves as citizens not just of a new nation but of a far more 
universal ``republic of science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the center was Benjamin Franklin, equally at ease in the  
roles of printer, writer, postmaster, philosopher, rebel, diplomat 
and statesman. But his scientific experiments with electricity made 
him an international legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Franklin and His Friends, Portraying the Man of Science in  
18th Century America,'' opening Friday at the National Portrait 
Gallery, stitches together the many threads of the human network 
that comprised Franklin's scientific world. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, the product of more than four years of research,  
runs through Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever possible, the show's curators match portraits of the  
fledgling American scientists with the brass telescopes, 
microscopes, electrostatic generators and other instruments they 
actually used. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of several portraits, Franklin is shown in 1762, seated  
in his study next to two metal bells attached by wires to an 
outside lightning rod. The bells rang, alerting their inventor, 
when a storm electrified the iron rod. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby is a bent and rusty but highly prized iron rod, dating  
from about 1756. It was attached to a Philadelphia house according 
to Franklin's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's network included John Winthrop, a mathematician and  
astronomer famed for charting the course of Venus across the sun. 
Winthrop is painted with a treasured telescope. The actual 
London-made instrument is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	An engraved Thomas Jefferson displays the Declaration of  
Independence. But he is ready to turn immediately to a machine that 
generates electricity when a crank-turned glass plate is rubbed 
against a leather pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The show includes astronomer and instrument maker David  
Rittenhouse, botanist William Bartram, museum pioneer and painter 
Charles Wilson Peale, and physician and chemist Benjamin Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most flamboyant member of Franklin's group was  
Harvard-educated physician John Jeffries, whom Franklin entertained 
repeatedly in Paris in 1785 after Jeffries made the first crossing 
of the English channel by hot-air balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffries is portrayed in flight, wearing a striking leopard-skin  
cap and clutching a large barometer. 
</P>
<P>
	The original barometer, in a nearby case, is prized as ``the  
world's oldest surviving flight instrument.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Jeff, a 35-year-old computer technician,  
believes if he loves Jesus enough he will stop having sex with men. 
Marc, a 39-year-old father of four, studies the Bible with the hope 
it will help him stop having homosexual affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men live in an unusual group home. It has only gay  
residents and is run by Love In Action, an independent Memphis 
ministry which preaches that homosexuals can become heterosexuals 
through Christian faith -- and will pay the price of an unhappy, 
disordered life if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe God holds us accountable for choices that are  
inappropriate,'' said John Smid, Love In Action's director and a 
self-described former homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff, who like the other residents declined to give his last  
name, has seen changes in himself since he joined Love In Action 
about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a renewed connection with God,'' he said. ``I'm finding  
joy in embracing masculinity, traditional masculinity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The belief that homosexuality is a choice rather than a  
predisposition is not new, nor is the idea that homosexuals can be 
``converted'' by following the Bible. Some fundamentalist 
Christians refer to that conversion as ``reparative therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and  
the Christian Coalition began a national advertising campaign 
urging gays to find religion. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the American Psychiatric Association's board  
rejected Christian-based therapy for homosexuals, saying it could 
cause ``depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior.'' The 
American Psychological Association reached a similar conclusion a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody can be a real, true Christian but at the same time  
have sexual feelings which are very different. You get kind of an 
irreconcilable conflict. Am I really this or am I that?'' said Leon 
Hoffman of the American Psychoanalytic Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Baines, a Southern Baptist minister and member of Equal  
Partners in Faith, a Washington, D.C., group that preaches 
religious tolerance and inclusion, said campaigns like the one 
started by the Christian groups can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates an environment that allows the extremists to act on  
their hate. We have to stop rhetoric that demonizes individuals 
simply because they are attracted to the same gender,'' said 
Baines, who is gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Love In Action is one of more than 90 ministries drawing  
referrals from Exodus International of Seattle, one of the largest 
organizations for ``ex-gays'' in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Exodus officials say they know of three other residential  
programs for gays -- New Hope in San Rafael, Calif.; Freedom at Last 
in Wichita, Kan.; and CrossOver Ministries International in 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Love In Action has three group homes in Memphis with room for 16  
men and four women. Currently, 14 spots are filled. Most of the 
participants come to Memphis from other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Each house has staff managers on duty 24 hours a day, and  
clients are closely monitored over the 18 to 24 months they are in 
the program. They pay $950 a month rent and must find jobs approved 
by Love In Action that will not interfere with counseling sessions 
or other program functions. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants follow a 12-step program similar to those used by  
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts. The first step is to admit 
``we are powerless over homosexuality and compulsive sexual 
behavior, that our lives had become unmanageable.'' Other steps 
include believing that Jesus Christ can ``restore us to sanity,'' 
and making ``a searching and fearless moral inventory of 
ourselves.'' The last step is experiencing a ``spiritual 
awakening'' that will control the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Group discussions are held four to five nights a week. Residents  
who feel compulsions to act on homosexual tendencies can call Love 
In Action counselors 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff, a St. Louis resident, repeated more than a year in the  
program after he was caught looking at gay pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could either leave or start over,'' said Smid, who  
estimates 60 or so of the 185 clients who have come to his program 
over the past 12 years ``remain free of homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff said the incident renewed his commitment to becoming  
straight. ``I know now that absolute sobriety is necessary,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ultimate goal is a change to heterosexuality,  
abstinence of homosexual acts is imperative, Smid said, even if gay 
thoughts persist. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you starve, dies,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His group considers any sexual act outside a Christian marriage  
as a sin, including masturbation and viewing pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc, the Louisiana father of four, said he came to Love In  
Action after his wife filed for divorce. He said his homosexual 
feelings and infidelities raised tensions in his household to 
unbearable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``These behaviors were the things I turned to when I got angry,  
when I was upset, when I was hurt, as someone else might turn to 
drugs or alcohol,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie, 28, of Memphis, said she joined the program because  
of ``inappropriate emotional attachments'' to other women, though 
she has never had sex with a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely have struggled strongly with lesbianism and would  
have ended up in the lifestyle eventually,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baines said the idea that there is such a thing as a ``gay  
lifestyle'' is a misnomer propagated by groups like Love In Action. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do the same things everyone else does. We go to movies. We  
take walks on the beach. It's about an intimate connection with 
another human being,'' Baines said. ``There is no gay lifestyle. 
It's a phrase to scare sincere people of faith into saying this is 
some kind of national evil.''

<HEADLINE> 200 Evacuated From Burning NJ Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A suspicious fire gutted much of a  
hotel early today as firefighters scrambled to escort nearly 200 
guests to safety. Just one guest was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-alarm blaze broke out in a large banquet hall at the  
Quality Inn shortly before midnight Wednesday night, Assistant Fire 
Director Steven McGill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters scoured the 150-room, two-story facility, banging  
on doors and breaking many of them down to awaken sleeping guests, 
McGill said. Flames spread quickly from the banquet hall and gutted 
the portion of the hotel containing the main lobby and a smaller 
banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 firefighters had the blaze under control in about 50  
minutes. ``Most of the I-beams that hold up the roof are distorted 
and twisted,'' McGill said. ``That's the main part of the building 
where arson investigators are going to look this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 53-year-old man was hospitalized for treatment of smoke  
inhalation, McGill said. There were no other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The hotel is close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel,  
attracting tourists who want to visit New York City without paying 
Manhattan-level hotel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The occupants included more than 100 teen-agers visiting from  
France and a group of students from Hartford, Conn., who had just 
arrived on a school trip. 
</P>
<P>
	There were initial reports that hotel maintenance workers shut  
off fire alarms as they were trying to find the fire, McGill said, 
adding, ``That's extremely dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGill said chaperones with the Hartford group wanted to end the  
trip, but the students voted to continue it. Buses were brought in 
to move the two groups of youths to another hotel.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finished Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Aggressive selling of technology issues pushed  
Tokyo stock prices slightly lower today. The dollar dropped 
marginally against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 37.60 points,  
or 0.22 percent, to close the day at 16,727.08. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 49.52 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.80 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.39  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 118.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Players said the weakness in technology stocks was partly  
prompted by a 76.22 point fall in the technology-rich Nasdaq 
Composite on Wednesday to 2,507.28 -- its fourth largest point 
decline of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also sold because of the recent  
strengthening of the yen, traders said. A weaker dollar reduces the 
value of export earnings when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshihiko Kuroichi, manager of the research department at  
Kankaku Securities, said that technology stocks were ripe for 
profit-taking after recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the decliners was NEC, 33 cents lower at $10.60. Sharp  
fell 13 cents to $11.08, and Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 13 
cents to $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market lost steam after a strong morning, when bank  
shares rose and Sony Corp. issues soared after an announcement 
Wednesday that it will jointly develop and market digital editing 
systems for TV broadcasting with International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, to

were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained early on a wave of  
buying from Japanese trust banks. But selling pressure mounted 
after the Nihon Keizai business newspaper reported Wednesday that 
Japanese life insurers would reduce their investment in U.S. 
Treasury bonds.

<HEADLINE> 6 Hurt in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A gunman opened fire at the Mormon  
church's Family History Library today, wounding at least five 
people before he was shot by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Ken Hanson said the gunman fired a small-caliber  
handgun, and the wounded included a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect is down. We shot the suspect. We are unaware of  
his condition,'' Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman Platt, a genealogist, said the gunman entered the library  
and quickly fired off a dozen rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in critical condition were transported to LDS  
Hospital, a spokeswoman there said. A Mormon church spokesman had 
no additional details. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, one of the world's top centers for genealogical  
research, is directly across the street from Temple Square, site of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple 
and Tabernacle. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has been involved in genealogy since its founding  
nearly 170 years ago. The church amasses the records for its 
so-called baptism of the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms 
give the dead the opportunity to join the Mormon church in the 
afterlife.

<HEADLINE> Continental Earnings Slip 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continental Airlines on Thursday handily beat  
analysts' expectations for first-quarter earnings, but its income 
of $78 million marked a slight drop from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston-based carrier earned $1.03 per share, down from $81  
million, or $1.06 per share, in the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. anticipated  
earnings of 93 cents per share. It's the second straight first 
quarter that Continental beat Wall Street's predictions by a dime. 
</P>
<P>
	The income figure excludes non-recurring gains and charges that  
pushed the company's actual first-quarter profit to $84 million, or 
$1.11 per share on a diluted basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 10.9 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.7 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The carrier credited continued increases in passenger loads  
despite slumping travel on Asian routes. Continental also has 
endured increased fuel costs, in contrast to plunging fuel prices 
this time last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Continental announced it would increased its  
stock repurchase program by $500 million to a total of $800 
million. The company has spent about $266 million on its own stock 
since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As of May 4, the ticker symbol for the airline's widely traded  
class B shares will change to CAL from CAI.B. The carrier's class A 
shares will become CAL.A instead of CAI.A. Both classes of stock 
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Makes Double Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's Cal Ripken's glove that resembles iron  
these days, not the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken made a double error in the second inning of the Baltimore  
Orioles' game against the New York Yankees on Thursday night, 
leading to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, a two-time Gold Glove who had just eight errors last  
season and holds or shares 12 fielding records, has five of his 
team's first six errors this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Baltimore ahead 4-0 and the bases loaded with two outs in  
the second, Luis Sojo hit a grounder to third that Ripken bobbled, 
then threw past first as two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch hit a two-run double off the glove of left  
fielder B.J. Surhoff on the next pitch, and Derek Jeter's double 
gave New York a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who has been bothered by a bad back this season, had two  
throwing errors in Sunday's 9-5 loss to Toronto, including one on a 
rundown that turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Ironman, who broke Lou Gehrig's record for  
consecutive games played, also misplayed Chili Davis' first-inning 
grounder in Baltimore's 14-7 loss to New York on Wednesday night, 
leading to the third run of the inning.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Hazing Lawsuit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A lawsuit Jeff Danish filed against  
linebacker Andre Royal over a hazing incident during the New 
Orleans Saints training camp last summer was dismissed Thursday on 
a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal did not respond to the lawsuit, and Danish's lawyers  
hadn't pursued the case further. U.S. District Court dismissed the 
suit because it did not want idle cases clogging its docket, 
Danish's lawyer, Richard Barker, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said that he may refile the lawsuit depending on what  
Danish wants to do. ``I'm waiting for further word from my 
client,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish said in the lawsuit he was forced to ran a gantlet of  
Saints players who were hitting, kicking and pounding on him with a 
bag of coins Aug. 20, the last night of training camp at the 
University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
	Danish had sued the Saints, Royal, an assistant coach and five  
other players, demanding that the team pay him more than $650,000 
for physical and emotional suffering, lost wages, medical expenses 
and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit against the Saints and the six others was settled in  
February. Terms of that settlement weren't released as part of a 
confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal, who admitted to NFL investigators that he took part in  
the gantlet, was traded to Indianapolis and played last season with 
the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was one of the players who did not respond, so we did not  
represent him,'' Peder Arneson, a La Crosse lawyer who represented 
the players, said of Royal. ``As part of the settlement with the 
Saints, Danish reserved the right to make claims against Royal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danish, a defensive tackle from Richmond, N.Y., broke a  
dormitory window when he hit it after running the gantlet in a 
third-floor hallway. He required 14 stitches to his left arm and 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Andy McCullough also was hazed that day, as were No. 1  
draft pick Kyle Turley, second-round pick Cam Cleeland, No. 6 pick 
Chris Bordano and seventh-round pick Andy McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleeland missed time with headaches and blurred vision in one  
eye.

<HEADLINE> Trial To Probe Great Chicago Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The defendant claims he is being framed because  
of ethnic prejudice. The prosecution insists he is not only guilty 
of perjury but responsible for a fire that is etched in American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	A mock trial today at John Marshall Law School will attempt to  
get to the bottom of one of the city's most enduring mysteries -- 
the circumstances of the Great Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, that Great Fire, the one that leveled a third of Chicago in  
October 1871, left more than 100,000 people homeless and never 
relinquished its grip on popular imagination. The one often blamed 
on the cow in Catherine O'Leary's barn. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors will attempt to show that Daniel ``Peg Leg''  
Sullivan lied in his testimony about the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we are not charging him with starting the fire, by  
the end of the trial it will be clear why he lied,'' declared Anna 
Demacopoulos, a Cook County prosecutor who will lead the team 
trying Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Counters Sullivan -- in the person of actor Andrew White, who  
will play him at the trial -- ``It seems like a conspiracy to try 
and demean the Irish people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe Sullivan started the fire accidentally in the barn  
the night of Oct. 8, 1871, then tried to escape responsibility by 
telling authorities he had seen the first flames while sitting 
outside a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
	However it started, the fire spread quickly, overwhelming the  
fire department's ability to fight it. Rain helped put out the 
flames 29 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, as many as 300 people were dead, tens of thousands of  
homes were gone, businesses were reduced to ashes and even ships on 
the Chicago River were burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The official Board of Police and Fire Commissioners report did  
not fix blame. But the legend of Mrs. O'Leary and her cow became 
widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am 100 percent convinced that `Peg Leg' Sullivan started the  
Great Chicago Fire,'' said Dick Bales, a lawyer and author of a 
history of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying little-known real estate records, Bales concluded  
two years ago that Sullivan could not have seen what he told 
investigators he did -- the first flames -- because a house would 
have blocked his view of the O'Leary barn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan's tale of dashing into the barn to try to save the  
animals, then running off to get help is also doubted by some who 
point out that his wooden leg would have made so much running 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	White -- already in character as Sullivan in an interview in  
advance of the trial -- insisted in a rich Irish brogue that he 
testified truthfully during the inquiry into the fire's cause. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will be found innocent by the jury, which will  
include former DePaul University basketball coach Ray Meyer, 
television newsman Bill Kurtis and the city police superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
	Other actors from Lookingglass Theatre Company will be taking  
the roles of Mrs. O'Leary and other figures from the time. Sullivan 
will be tried in front of a Cook County judge by county prosecutors 
and criminal defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a resolution of any kind,'' said Ralph  
Ruebner, a professor at John Marshall who has led the project the 
past two years. ``No one was ever indicted. We wanted to have a 
trial here to see where the truth may lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Chicago's City Council exonerated Mrs. O'Leary, who  
survived the fire, and her cow, which did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern University professor Carl Smith said the dark side  
of the O'Leary legend is the attempt to blame the fire on Irish 
Catholic immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is also a thing to turn into a kind of almost a whimsical  
joke, that this whole city was burned down by a clumsy cow, and it 
hides in some ways more serious things,'' he said. ``The city 
burned down because it was unprotected against such things.''

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Not On Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian has decided not to stage a  
hunger strike during his imprisonment on a second-degree murder 
conviction, his lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was sentenced Tuesday to up to 25 years in prison for  
the injection death of a Lou Gehrig's disease patient. He 
previously had told a newspaper that he would begin a hunger strike 
immediately upon entering prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thursday, lawyer Mayer Morganroth said the assisted suicide  
advocate told him he was eating and would continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian ``had changed his mind back and forth several times  
that day,'' Morganroth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The same day Kevorkian went to prison, state prison officials  
said they had reversed their policy on force-feeding. Under the new 
policy, Kevorkian, 70, would have been allowed to starve himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth said Kevorkian was in good spirits Thursday after a  
routine checkup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said the medical facilities are excellent, they gave him a  
checkup and he had a little high blood pressure, but that's about 
it,'' Morganroth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted last month of second degree murder for  
injecting Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal dose of chemicals in 
September at Youk's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death of the Lou Gehrig's 
patient to ``60 Minutes,'' hoping to force the issue of assisted 
suicide into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were the  
prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has been tried in the past, but the trials ended in  
acquittals and one mistrial. He will be eligible for parole in 
about eight years.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Revise Mental Health Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Insurance plans no longer could impose tighter  
limits on hospital stays and outpatient visits for mental health 
treatment than they do for physical illnesses under a proposal 
Wednesday to revise a 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	That law stopped employers from setting lower dollar amounts for  
mental health coverage. But many businesses now limit the number of 
hours patients can spend with therapists or days they can be 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must make treatment for this illness as available and as  
routine as treatment for any other disease,'' said Sen. Paul 
Wellstone, D-Minn., who is sponsoring the legislation with Sen. 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone and Domenici, who also led the push for the 1996 law,  
both have had family members with mental illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The law took effect in 1998 and expires in 2001. Before the law,  
most insurance plans had lifetime caps on mental treatment 
typically ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 -- far below the $1 
million to $2 million allowed each individual for physical 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller businesses are exempt from the law as are companies  
whose insurance costs rise more than 1 percent because of the 
mental health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The new legislation would remove the expiration date and broaden  
the coverage to include all businesses with more than 25 employees. 
The cost-based exemption would end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Business Group on Health, an employer-sponsored  
lobbying organization, has estimated that 75 percent of its 160 
mostly larger employers comply with the law without restricting 
visits. But many smaller companies have imposed visit limits, 
according to insurers, employers and benefit consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the caps, patients sometimes avoid treatment until  
they have to be hospitalized or are suicidal, according to mental 
health advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Virginia, Minn., clinic, a 40-year-old woman with  
depression recently had to be hospitalized twice because her 
insurance had run out and she was not being treated for her 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had the continuing care we would be able to avoid  
this,'' said Tamara Wermter, the clinic's account manager.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Gets More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The government's corporate watchdog  
rejected Philippine Airlines' revised rehabilitation plan on 
Thursday, saying it was ``fraught with generalities'' and its 
earnings forecasts were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the ailing  
airline until May 4 to improve the plan, extending Thursday's 
deadline for SEC approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In a highly critical assessment, the SEC said the plan was  
``substantially lacking'' in detail on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the new deadline was final, and warned that the airline  
will close if it cannot find investors to provide $200 million in 
exchange for new stock in the airline company -- a key element of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay said PAL failed to identify any new  
investors by the Thursday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL, which owes more than $2.2 billion to around 9,000  
creditors, said it was surprised by the SEC's decision and remains 
convinced it will find someone to provide the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in very serious discussions with potential investors,''  
said Peter Foster, the airline's chief adviser. ``We believe we're 
on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could not disclose the names because of  
confidentiality agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has set its own deadline of June 4 to come up with the fresh  
equity, which would give the new investors a 90 percent stake in 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL submitted a revised rehabilitation plan to the SEC last  
month. The plan has already been conditionally approved by the 
airline's major creditors -- a consortium of European financial 
institutions and the U.S. Export-Import Bank -- owed two-thirds of 
the total debt.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Yugo Conflict Won't Be Quick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is signaling that  
the U.S.-led NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia could stretch into 
summer. Defense Secretary William Cohen cautioned Congress today 
that ``this is not going to be quick or easy or neat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To those who say that NATO should commit ground forces to the  
effort, Cohen said, ``The reason that we have gone forward as we 
have with an air campaign is that there was not a consensus in the 
NATO alliance to do anything but this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen  
said he regretted the death of civilians that resulted when a NATO 
bomb struck a convoy Wednesday. ``It was under extraordinary 
circumstances,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said anti-aircraft artillery fire was directed at the  
pilot, who had to make a split-second decision. ``We go to 
extraordinary lengths to protect civilians,'' the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do value human life,'' said Cohen, who appeared before the  
committee with Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. ``We do try to reduce the risks to innocent human 
beings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, was testifying  
before the House Appropriations Committee as officials put together 
an emergency budget request to pay the U.S. share of NATO 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew met for nearly an hour  
Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said 
the Clinton administration was discussing something in the range of 
$4 billion to $8 billion. He said the administration wants to pay 
for the entire Balkans package using the expected federal surplus, 
including costs of caring for at least 500,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's not what we'll get our members to go along  
with,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans seem eager to pay for military costs of the  
crisis with the surplus while finding budget cuts to pay for the 
rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Cohen recalled an earlier warning to Congress  
that ``this is not going to be quick or easy or neat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He amended his earlier statements about the possibility of U.S.  
casualties to say that there was the ``probability of casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This really is a battle of freedom over fear,'' Cohen said,  
``... it's a battle of democracy over dictatorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In closed-door meetings this week with congressional officials,  
U.S. military leaders suggested NATO is poised to continue the 
3-week-old air campaign for several weeks longer, possibly into 
midsummer if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces 
continue fighting Kosovar Albanians in the Serbian province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton told lawmakers that while bombing has been frequently  
hampered by weather, conditions usually improve in the Balkans in 
June and July, the officials said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a sustained campaign,'' said one lawmaker  
who was briefed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led Gulf War in 1991 lasted only six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Won't Match Offer to WR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys refused Thursday to  
match the Carolina Panthers' offer for free-agent wide receiver 
Patrick Jeffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina signed the 6-foot-4, 218-pound Jeffers to an offer  
sheet Monday. The one-year deal was worth a reported $1.2 million, 
including an $800,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys' compensation for losing Jeffers, who had 18  
receptions for 330 yards and two touchdowns last season, is 
Carolina's fifth-round pick, No. 140 overall, in this weekend's NFL 
draft.

<HEADLINE> Coyotes' Roenick's Return Doubtful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- Just before huge Derian Hatcher of  
Dallas shattered Jeremy Roenick's jaw, another Stars defenseman 
broke Roenick's right thumb by slashing his hand with a stick, the 
Phoenix Coyotes alleged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked the league to review the slash on his hand as well,  
which -- absent the broken jaw -- the broken thumb would have kept 
Jeremy out for three to four weeks,'' general manager Bobby Smith 
said before the St. Louis Blues-Coyotes game. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, the Coyotes' leading scorer, underwent surgery Thursday  
to repair a jaw broken in three places. Smith said Roenick would 
take months to recover from what he called one of the worst broken 
jaws he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suffered two jaw fracturers myself during my career,'' Smith  
said. ``I consider them to have been very traumatic injuries, very 
difficult to come back from. And the slight fractures that I 
suffered were not nearly as severe as what Jeremy suffered last 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig cracked Roenick on the  
hand with his stick a split second before the 6-foot-6, 240-pound 
Hatcher leaped elbow-first into Roenick's face. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star center fell to the ice with blood coming from his  
mouth. He skated another shift, then left for the locker room. His 
jaw was dislocated and broken in three places, with eight teeth 
cracked or broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher received a five-minute boarding penalty and a game  
misconduct, the second penalty requiring an automatic review by the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith declined to say whether league director of hockey  
operations Colin Campbell should suspend Hatcher, but noted 
similarities in the case with others that drew suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the things they've tried to eliminate are apparent in  
this incident,'' Smith said. ``A blow to the head, an injury, the 
retaliation factor there, the question on the extent of 
premeditation. I wouldn't want to be doing Colin Campbell's job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a March 23 game in Phoenix, Roenick knocked Mike Modano,  
Dallas' leading scorer, out of the game with a hit in the first 
period. Roenick was ejected for boarding and game misconduct, but 
wasn't suspended. That incident left the Stars fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick, who had 24 goals and 48 assists, was replaced as the  
center on the first line by Robert Reichel. Third-string center Bob 
Corkum moved up to the second line between Rick Tocchet and Greg 
Adams, with Yuha Ylonen, who missed 23 of the last 25 games because 
of a sprained knee, as the third-line center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, our chemistry is blown out of the water,'' coach  
Jim Schoenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he decided against recalling center Daniel Briere  
from the team's AHL affiliate in Springfield, Mass., for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has home-ice advantage in the first round of the  
playoffs. The former Winnipeg Jets franchise hasn't advanced to the 
second round since 1987 and has been eliminated the past two 
seasons by Anaheim (seven games) and Detroit (six games).

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, criticized for not  
having enough women in his inner circle, has hired a veteran female 
strategist to be his deputy campaign manager for his 2000 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacie Spector, deputy communications director at the White  
House, will move over to the Gore campaign to assist campaign 
manager Craig Smith and be director of strategic operations,

<HEADLINE>  DeBartolo Files Countersuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- In the latest twist to an escalating  
family feud, San Francisco 49ers co-owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. 
filed a $150 million countersuit Thursday against his sister, 
claiming breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is control of the family's billion dollar-plus  
financial empire, whose single most valuable asset is the football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Ohio in response to  
last week's suit against DeBartolo by his sister, Denise DeBartolo 
York and the corporation, demanding her brother repay $94 million 
to the company and attempting to oust him from any team management 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is one of the lowest moments of my life, but my sister  
has left me with no option but to file this lawsuit,'' DeBartolo 
said, reading from a statement at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (corporation's) lawsuit ... was necessary to maintain the  
stability of the company my father created and I am not surprised 
by my brother's response,'' responded Mrs. York in a written 
statement. ``I'm glad that Eddie has now stated he would like to 
pursue talks to settle these issues out of the public eye and it's 
unfortunate that the Corporation had to file a lawsuit against 
Eddie to prompt any meaningful discussions,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those in attendance were former 49ers quarterback Joe  
Montana, who led the team to four Super Bowl victories, former 
running back Roger Craig and wide-receiver Jerry Rice -- all there 
to show support for the beleaguered owner. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo's suit claims Mrs. York wrongfully repudiated an  
August 1998 written agreement with her brother that would have 
divided the assets of their jointly owned business, with DeBartolo 
regaining control of the team. The suit also seeks to enforce 
agreements which DeBartolo claims would allow him to resume control 
of the team after his NFL suspension is lifted next February. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, DeBartolo claims they had agreed to a gross team  
value of the San Francisco 49ers of $350 million, while the value 
of other pro football franchises skyrocketed. The Cleveland Browns 
sold for $530 million and the Washington Redskin were to sell for 
$800 million, but that deal has since fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred any other course of action and I am  
still hopeful that my family can find some way to settle its 
differences outside a court room. If not, however, I will continue 
to pursue my rights vigorously,'' DeBartolo said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo, on advice of attorneys, would not take any questions,  
except when asked at the news conference about the nature of his 
relationship with his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're brother and sister. Genes did that, I didn't,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo family advisor Mark Vorsatz answered questions on  
DeBartolo's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be hopeful we could continue dialogue that could lead  
to a constructive resolution,'' Vorsatz said. They wouldn't go into 
specifics, but Vorsatz said they would examine all options. 
</P>
<P>
	Vorsatz said DeBartolo made a $25 million payment in April of  
1998 to satisfy an obligation he had with the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo voluntarily withdrew from an active ownership role and  
also resigned his board position with the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. 
in December 1997 when he became entangled in a Louisiana gambling 
fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to an extortion related  
charge stemming from a $400,000 payment he made to former Louisiana 
governor Edwin Edwards as part of an effort to secure a riverboat 
gambling license. 
</P>
<P>
	He was placed on probation, fined $2 million and agreed to  
testify against Edwards and others charged in the case. Last month, 
NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue extended DeBartolo's suspension 
through the 1999 season, but said he could be reinstated if he 
lived up to the terms of the league-imposed sanction.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Final 2000 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With unusual speed, Congress approved a final  
$1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 today that Republicans hope 
will sharpen their image as tax cutters and as a party that has 
moved beyond President Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the GOP-written plan today by a 54-44 vote  
that was along party lines. The House passed the package yesterday 
by 220-208 in another sharply partisan vote. The two senators who 
didn't vote were Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D.N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure maps a 10-year tax cut of at least $778 billion and  
underlines other issues the GOP will emphasize during this year's 
run-up to the 2000 elections: using Social Security's enormous 
surpluses to reduce the national debt and spending more for defense 
and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget passage today marks only the second time Congress has  
completed the measure on time since setting the April 15 deadline 
in 1987. Eager to counter Democratic charges that Congress has done 
little beyond impeachment of the president in recent months, GOP 
leaders want to cast themselves as efficiently performing the 
public's work. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which does not require Clinton's signature, sets  
overall tax and spending targets for later legislation that will 
fill in the details. Clashes with Clinton over those bills seem 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a dramatic difference between the two parties,'' said  
the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., 
referring to Democratic opposition to using expected federal 
surpluses for broad tax cuts. ``Republicans say, `Don't grow 
government, give it back to the taxpayers.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Republicans have made no final decisions about whose  
taxes would be reduced, Democrats say they know what the GOP will 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``A massive tax-cut scheme for the wealthiest among us, because  
that's what's really afoot here,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget's passage on April 15 -- the day income tax returns  
are due -- was also timed to spotlight GOP tax-cutting plans that 
are one of the budget's banner promises. Democrats say that money, 
which comes from anticipated federal surpluses, should be used 
mostly to strengthen Medicare and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good blueprint for America's future,'' House Speaker  
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said after the House approved the measure. 
``We're also pleased this Congress can get its work done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, internal GOP bickering over tax cuts resulted in no  
congressional budget for the first time since the current system 
began in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the GOP plan would do nothing to extend the fiscal  
solvency of Social Security and Medicare, which face pressures in 
coming years from the retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget ... falls short of what the American people need  
for meeting the challenges of the 21st century,'' he said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a budget that is going to survive,'' said Sen.  
Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, ranking Democrat on the Senate 
budget panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants smaller tax cuts. In addition, Republicans say  
they will pay for their defense and domestic spending increases by 
cutting other programs, which Democrats and even some Republicans 
say will never survive votes in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's measure was a compromise between similar House and  
Senate budgets approved last month. It envisions a surplus of $141 
billion next year, virtually all of which would come from Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan calls for using all $1.8 trillion in expected  
Social Security surpluses over the next decade to reduce the 
national debt -- or to revamp Social Security or Medicare, should a 
bipartisan compromise emerge on either. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would spend a small portion of those surpluses on  
domestic programs. Neither side has proposed changes in benefits or 
taxes for Social Security and Medicare that many experts say will 
be needed to buttress both programs for the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists agree that reducing the national debt would  
strengthen the economy by keeping interest rates lower. A larger 
economy should make it easier for the government to raise money to 
pay benefits to future retirees, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	By setting aside the Social Security surpluses, Republicans also  
hope to prevent Democrats from accusing them of diverting the money 
to tax cuts for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say their tax cut might grow if new projections  
expected this summer show larger surpluses than now expected. It 
will start relatively small, about $15 billion next year if 
Republicans can find spending cuts or new revenue to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders plan to decide which taxes to cut later this year.  
Lawmakers will also decide later this year how much to spend on 
specific programs.

<HEADLINE> Starr Denounces Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keeping silent about when he plans to leave  
the investigation of President Clinton and the first lady, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says he has the authority to 
prosecute Clinton after he's out of the White House in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, appearing Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live''  
program, said he anticipated returning to ``law practice and 
teaching,'' but he didn't say when he would depart the nearly 
5-year investigation of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was ready to step out of public life, he said,  
``Yes, very much,'' in a separate interview published in today's 
editions of USA Today. But, he added, ``I've never been able to say 
no to public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was given ample opportunity to provide a timetable for an  
exit during the two media interviews and in an appearance Wednesday 
on Capitol Hill. But he offered none. 
</P>
<P>
	On another topic, though, Starr was clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you have jurisdiction to prosecute the president criminally  
after his term of office expires?'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., 
asked Starr at a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the independent counsel replied, going on to outline  
his court-authorized mandate to investigate possible lying and 
obstruction in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he felt ``compassion'' for the president in the  
Lewinsky controversy, Starr said he did. But he also said Clinton 
shouldn't have given the untruthful testimony in the Paula Jones 
case for which he was cited for civil contempt of court this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declined to discuss the matter further.  
</P>
<P>
	And as for the first lady, had Starr ever contemplated indicting  
her? He couldn't comment, the prosecutor said on the King show. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was called to the Senate hearing to give his views on the  
independent counsel law that gave him the power to investigate the 
president's Whitewater real estate dealings, the Lewinsky affair 
and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators appeared surprised by Starr's testimony that the  
statute should not be extended when it expires June 30. Starr's own 
ongoing, $40 million probe is protected by a provision in the 
current law that allows it to continue after the expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr made clear there still was much work to do.  
</P>
<P>
	In the CNN appearance, he referred to pending prosecutions of  
presidential friend Webster Hubbell. Also, Starr said he wanted to 
find out why jurors refused to convict the Clintons' former 
Whitewater partner Susan McDougal for criminal contempt of court 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell is accused of concealing his and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton's work on a fraudulent Arkansas land development controlled 
by the Clintons' Whitewater partner Jim McDougal and Hubbell's 
father-in-law. Hubbell's June trial faces a likely delay while 
Starr's office appeals the dismissal of a major count in the case. 
Starr also has a tax evasion case pending against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. McDougal, Starr said he is ``obviously  
disappointed'' at her acquittal on an obstruction charge this week 
and her mistrial over two criminal contempt counts. A retrial is a 
possibility, Starr said.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Can't Win With No. 2 Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It seems everyone in Philadelphia has an  
opinion about what the Eagles should do with the No. 2 pick in the 
NFL draft. This happens in a lot of cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in Philadelphia do the mayor and city council get involved.  
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles are leaning toward picking a quarterback Saturday in  
perhaps the most important draft in franchise history. Public 
opinion is loud, widespread and, apparently, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ed Rendell went on the radio this week asking fans to call  
the Eagles offices to urge the team to pick Texas running back 
Ricky Williams. He even gave out the phone number. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Phillies' opener on Monday, fans in the upper deck toted  
signs spelling Williams' name. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the City Council actually voted on a resolution  
calling for the Eagles to draft Williams. It was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	So here is the dilemma facing new coach Andy Reid and director  
of football operations Tom Modrak: Whether they end up with Akili 
Smith, Tim Couch or Donovan McNabb, the Eagles will get one of the 
most touted skill players they've ever taken in the first round -- 
and incur the wrath of their fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Philadelphia, Andy.  
</P>
<P>
	``They will understand within time that the decision we make is  
the right one,'' said Reid, who replaced Ray Rhodes following the 
Eagles' 3-13 season. ``But until that player performs on Sunday, 
they probably will question that. We will make the right 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Eagles were still proclaiming Thursday that no one --  
including Williams -- is out of the running, Philadelphia seems 
ready to place the future of the franchise in the hands of a 
quarterback. The latest indications are they favor McNabb, a 
strong-armed leader with scrambling ability who ran an option 
offense at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles have contacted agents for McNabb and Smith in recent  
days, but it is common practice for teams to touch base with agents 
of players they might draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid and Modrak, who are both making the final call on draft day  
for the first time, loved McNabb's performance in the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	```He also might have the strongest arm'' in the draft, Reid  
said. ``His athletic ability intrigues me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A trade is still a possibility, although everything depends on  
what the Cleveland Browns do with the first pick. Reid and Modrak 
are giving every signal they will entertain trade offers until the 
very last moment before making their pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be foolish not to entertain offers,'' Reid said. ``We  
are sitting in a very nice position which does not happen very 
often, and I hope it doesn't happen very often. So we're sitting in 
a position here where we need to entertain offers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Eagles haven't drafted this high since 1969, when they  
picked running back Leroy Keyes of Purdue. They have 11 picks in 
this draft, and they need to get most of them right to help erase 
decades of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though scattered with gems like Randall Cunningham (second  
round, 1985), Wilbert Montgomery (sixth round, 1977) and Clyde 
Simmons and Seth Joiner in the late rounds in 1986, this team's 
draft resume is pretty grim. The litany of errors includes a 
fixation on offensive linemen who never lived up to billing (Kevin 
Allen in 1985, Bernard Williams in '94 and Jon Harris in '97.) 
</P>
<P>
	It's easy to see why Reid, Modrak and the Eagles have so much  
riding on this draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we're new together,'' Modrak said. ``But we've  
approached it the same way that Andy did in Green Bay and we did in 
Pittsburgh. We put a lot of thought into it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the things that's exciting this time. Everyone  
is pulling the same way.''

<HEADLINE>  Iverson Trails in Endorsement Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson seems to have accepted that no  
matter what he does on the court, he'll never achieve the 
endorsement success of Michael Jordan. Corporate America fears him 
the way a lone defender on the wing does. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia 76ers controversial star has only one  
endorsement deal, with Reebok, even though his jersey is one of the 
top-five sellers in the country. The Sixers are trying to change 
that, but it's a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, the Sixers will undertake the latest attempt to  
sell Iverson, who leads the NBA in scoring but trails mightily in 
the race for endorsements. The Sixers brain trust came up with the 
idea of a beanbag doll modeled after their star player -- complete 
with cornrows, a goatee and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson hopes the promotion, which is responsible for the  
Sixers' third sellout of the season, doesn't just turn into another 
missed opportunity or ill-perceived reach for acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to be me, man,'' Iverson said. ``If people are  
going to market me, I don't want it to be anything phony. If 
they're going to market me, I want it to be the way I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly music to the ears of Madison Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
	It's no secret that Iverson's rocky past and his public image  
work against him. Few in the corporate world have walked the 
streets Iverson has. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been arrested on marijuana and gun charges, spent four  
months in jail for his role in a bowling alley brawl, been 
implicated by friends who were pulled over while driving away from 
an alleged drug dealing in his Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	He has seen death up close, in the tragic, senseless way that it  
happens in America's blighted outposts. He once had eight friends 
killed in one summer. His father is serving nine years in prison 
for assault, and a surrogate father figure, Tony Clark, also was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iverson's mind, he has coped in the most admirable way  
possible -- by refusing to abandon the people and places who made 
him who he is. Thus, the braided hair, jewelry and tattoos that 
decorate his sinewy arms, the most prominent one proclaiming, 
``Only the strong survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Madison Avenue isn't ready for cornrows,'' said Rick Burton,  
director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of 
Oregon. ``That's racist, but that's the way Madison Avenue tends to 
be, because they have to sell to a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't understand cornrows or African American history or  
culture. It's hard for them be able to appreciate a young man like 
Iverson, who is so driven and so focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is part of the dilemma facing the Sixers, who have on their  
watch an incredible basketball talent perceived as a ticking time 
bomb. Dave Coskey, the team's vice president for public relations, 
recalls working with a similar lightning rod for controversy in his 
early days with the Sixers. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow named Charles Barkley.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was incorrigible. He was outrageous. He was outspoken,''  
Coskey said. ``The older basketball writers used to say, `He's 
nothing like the guys we're used to covering.' Now fast-forward. 
Charles is the elder statesman in the NBA. A lot of analogies can 
be drawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More so than with Barkley, the Sixers are torn when trying to  
market Iverson. On one hand, they see a young man up close whose 
allure to children defies his public image. Earlier this season, 
after a Sixers loss, Coskey stood in awe while Iverson taped a 
segment that was to be shown to a child dying of AIDS and brain 
cancer in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, they stand by helplessly while Iverson curses his coach,  
Larry Brown, and causes a weeklong controversy that threatens to 
derail the team's bid for a first playoff berth since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The contradictions hurt Iverson's chances for endorsements, but  
maybe it's too early to write him off as a marketing failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson hopes the doll is a start. The toy, named ``Alien  
Iverson,'' will be given away to the first 5,000 kids in the 
building for Friday night's game against Indiana. And surprise, it 
managed to attract a sponsor -- Rold Gold pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has studied athletes who overcame negative images to gain  
appeal as pitchmen. He was involved in Miller Lite's famous ``Less 
Filling, Tastes Great'' commercials that showed tough, seemingly 
aloof jocks in a humorous light. He believes the same approach may 
someday work for Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	``When show you can laugh, you can break a lot of people's  
defenses down,'' said Burton, hitting on Iverson's favorite pastime 
on the court. ``Let's laugh at some of what Larry Brown and the 
media represent. Let's laugh at ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson recently fired agent David Falk, saying he wants his  
replacement to be more aggressive in pursuing endorsements. But he 
remains steadfast in his position that he won't change. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to see myself on TV, I can just turn on ESPN every  
night,'' Iverson said. ``I'm not big on having a bunch of 
commercials and all that. That's not what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I feel like it isn't fair, but I don't ever cry  
about it. It's not fun all the time, because I'm not the person 
that they try to make me out to be.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rev. Roy Magee, a Presbyterian minister based in  
Northern Ireland who has worked to resolve sectarian conflict 
there, was named the recipient of the Peace Activist Award 
presented by theTanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee, a senior research fellow at the University of Ulster,  
said religious groups should contribute more toward ending the 
centuries-old strife between Catholics and Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
	Churches have often made their members more entrenched in their  
positions, Magee said in an interview Tuesday, one day before the 
award ceremony in New York. Religious groups should risk preaching 
to people outside their circles, he said. He noted that his own 
decision to work with Protestant militant groups in the 1980s was 
initially unpopular with his church. In 1994, he helped broker a 
cease-fire involving these groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a church person is involved with people committing murder  
and mayhem, others in church are not happy about it,'' he says. 
``But I couldn't stand aloof from people, if they were asking me to 
challenge them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magee also said he favors bringing United Nations mediators to  
talks on the future of Northern Ireland, which resumed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the (politicians) decide, they've got to keep  
talking,'' he says. ``They can't let the people die.''

 *Catholic, Orthodox leaders set agenda    	
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- When Catholic and Orthodox Christian leaders  
meet in June, they will look for similarities of the two churches 
separated for almost a millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal William Keeler and Archbishop Spyridon, primate of the  
Greek Orthodox Church, outlined plans at a meeting at the Basilica 
of the Assumption. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeler said, ``The work now is to see where the church was  
before the division'' between Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian 
faiths in 1094. ``We have to get to know each other better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting, their first ever in the Western Hemisphere, will  
take place at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, chosen for 
its rural seclusion and abundance of chapels and libraries, Keeler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, Catholic-Orthodox dialogue has produced three joint  
statements on theological issues. A 1993 statement, produced at a 
meeting in Lebanon, was essentially an agreement by Catholics not 
to proselytize among the Orthodox, a tension-filled issue that has 
dominated the dialogue for most of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Among issues to be addressed: The possibility of full communion  
between the two churches and the state of churches in Central and 
Eastern Europe since the collapse of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orthodox Christian Church has 300 million followers  
worldwide. It ranks third in size among world Christian 
denominations, behind Roman Catholicism, with about 981.5 million 
and Protestantism, with about 404 million. 
</P>

 *Idaho's Lutheran Vietnamese    	
</P>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A church has been dedicated to help  
Vietnamese refugees in Idaho's Treasure Valley, who number up to 
3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no other Christian group actively reaching out to  
them because they're not big enough,'' said the Rev. Dan Kramer, 
head of the Peace in Jesus Lutheran Church. He said he expected the 
church to help ``with English classes, tutoring, even giving them 
coats to get through winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer became involved in the cause while interning as vicar of  
two churches in Boise and Nampa, learning some of the language 
while helping church elder Robert Vinh Phan interpret a Bible 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Phan said his fellow Vietnamese are more familiar with Buddhism  
and Catholicism than with the Lutheran religion, but, he added, 
they are willing to adapt if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a place where people who don't know English can learn  
it, where people who are having trouble with welfare can get help, 
where people who need to get a driver's license can learn how,'' 
Phan said. ``It's a place where we can meet other Vietnamese and 
take in food for the spirit.''

 *Religious miner wins back pay    	
</P>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A western Kentucky mining company has  
been ordered to reinstate a miner with full back pay and benefits 
and to pay $25,000 in damages in what the Kentucky Commission on 
Human Rights said was a case of religious discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Baker of Beaver Dam had been an employee of Grand Eagle  
Mining Co. of Henderson for 18 years. The company said he was fired 
for sleeping on the job and poor attitude. The commission said 
Baker was fired without a prior written reprimand for poor 
performance or attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said his problems began in May 1996, when he became a  
Baptist and asked for Sundays off for religious reasons. The 
company had a seven-day work schedule, with exceptions for 
religious observances. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker told his manager about his religious beliefs and took off  
Sunday, June 9, 1996, even though he was scheduled to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand Eagle suspended Baker for three days, even though the  
commission said company policy did not call for a suspension until 
the third unexcused absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Later that month, Baker was in his bulldozer awaiting a fuel  
truck when his supervisor came on the scene. Baker was later called 
to the office and accused of sleeping on the job.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to ASNE-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	When the weight of communist repression was lifted, these  
tensions naturally rose to the surface to be resolved by statesmen 
or exploited by demagogues. The potential for ethnic conflict 
became perhaps the greatest threat to what is among our most 
critical interests: the transition of the former communist 
countries towards stability, prosperity and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	We are in Kosovo because we care about saving lives and we care  
about the character of the multiethnic post-Cold War world. We 
don't want young democracies that have made the right choices to be 
overwhelmed by the flight of refugees and the victories of ethnic 
hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	We don't want to see Europe refight with tanks and artillery the  
same battles they fought centuries ago with axes and arrows. And 
because stability in Europe is important to our own security, we 
want to build a Europe that is peaceful, undivided and free, a 
Europe where young Americans do not have to fight and die again to 
deal with the consequences of other people's madness and greed. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is going to define the future of this part of the world? Who  
will provide the model for how the people who have emerged from 
communism resolve their own legitimate problems? Will it be Mr. 
Milosevic with his propaganda machine and his paramilitary thugs 
who tell people to leave their country, their history and their 
land behind or die? Or will it be a nation like Romania, which is 
building democracy and respecting the rights of its ethnic 
minorities? Or Hungary, which has accepted that ethnic Hungarians 
can live beyond its borders with security and freedom? Or 
Macedonia, which is struggling to maintain a tolerant, multiethnic 
society under the unimaginable pressures of the human and economic 
costs imposed by Mr. Milosevic's policies? 
</P>
<P>
	Now after our recent experience in Bosnia and Kosovo, it's easy  
to forget that despite all the violence and turmoil they have 
experienced, the people of this region have in fact found ways to 
live together through the years. If the nations of the Balkans had 
truly experienced 1,000 years of unceasing ethnic cleansing, their 
ethnic makeup wouldn't be anything like what it is. They would be 
utterly homogeneous, not so diverse. Today, most of those countries 
are democracies. Most are trying to resolve their problems by force 
of argument, not force of arms. We cannot allow the Milosevic 
vision, rooted as it is in hatred and violence and cynicism, to 
prevail. But if we truly want a more tolerant, inclusive future for 
the Balkans and all of southeast Europe, we will have to both 
oppose his efforts and offer a better vision of the future, one 
that we are willing to help build. 
</P>
<P>
	Now what does all this mean for the future of Kosovo and the  
region as a whole, starting from where we are right now? What many 
Kosovars want is independence. That is certainly understandable. 
After what they've been through, it's only natural that they should 
equate sovereignty with survival. 
</P>
<P>
	But I continue to think it is not the best answer. Kosovo lacks  
the resources and infrastructure to be viable on its own. Moreover, 
Yugoslavia's long-suffering neighbors fear that an independent 
Kosovo would be unstable, and that the instability itself would be 
contagious. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, we must remember the principle we and our allies have  
been fighting for in the Balkans is the principle of multiethnic, 
tolerant, inclusive democracy. We have been fighting against the 
idea that statehood must be based entirely on ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people think the best way to solve Kosovo's problems, and  
Serbia's and Bosnia's, is to redraw their borders and rearrange 
their people to reflect their ethnic distinctions. Well, first of 
all, a lot of people who say that haven't looked very closely at 
the maps. It is a problem of staggering complexity. Once it starts, 
it would never end. For every grievance resolved, a new one would 
be created. For every community moved to a new place, another 
community would by definition be displaced. 
</P>
<P>
	If we were to choose this course, we would see the continuous  
fissioning of smaller and smaller ethnically based, unviable 
states, creating pressures for more war, more ethnic cleansing, 
more of the politics of repression and revenge. I believe the last 
thing we need in the Balkans is greater balkanization. 
</P>
<P>
	The real question today is not whether Kosovo will be part of  
Serbia. The real question is whether Kosovo and Serbia and the 
other states of the region will be part of the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The best solution for Kosovo, for Serbia, for Bosnia, Croatia,  
Macedonia, and all the countries of southeast Europe, is not the 
endless rejiggering of their borders, but greater integration into 
a Europe in which sovereignty matters but in which borders are 
becoming more and more open and less important in a negative sense. 
It is to affirm the principle that Milosevic has done so very much 
to undermine, that successful modern states make a virtue, not a 
blood feud, out of ethnic and religious diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the solution southwestern Europe -- excuse me -- that is  
the solution that western Europe accepted not too long ago really 
when you think of it, after Europe had been consumed by two of the 
bloodiest wars in all of human history, after the Holocaust almost 
erased an entire people from the face of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is hard to visualize today, hard to remember when you drive  
across Belgium and Holland or cross the border between France and 
Germany, that twice in this century millions of people spilled 
blood fighting over every inch of that land. 
</P>
<P>
	It is hard to imagine the immediate postwar Europe Winston  
Churchill described as a rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding 
ground of pestilence and hate. But because of the changes which 
have occurred, it is not unimaginable today that the nations of 
southeastern Europe will choose integration and peace, just as 
their Western neighbors have. 
</P>
<P>
	To achieve that future, we must follow the example of the World  
War II generation by standing up to aggression and hate and then by 
following through with a post-conflict strategy for reconstruction 
and renewal. If we don't want people to remain mired in the 
miseries of yesterday, we must give them a better tomorrow to dream 
of and work for.

<HEADLINE> Union Pacific Completing Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Union Pacific Corp. is moving the rest of its  
Dallas-based holding company's operation to Omaha, effective July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people work in the corporate offices, and at least one  
will move to Omaha, one is retiring and one is moving to the 
Washington office, spokesman Gary Schuster said. Others could apply 
for UP job openings in Omaha or elect to leave the company, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Dick Davidson said moving corporate finance people to  
Omaha last spring proved that corporate offices and the Omaha-based 
railroad operations need to be closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson said he and other Union Pacific officials will continue  
to spend a lot of time in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Davidson established an office of the chairman to  
strengthen customer service in the Houston area, at the heart of 
the railroad's chemical belt. Texas also was the heart of the 
railroad's service problems two years ago. The railroad is getting 
back up to speed after gridlock hurt its service nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster said Union Pacific first moved its corporate  
headquarters to Dallas from Pennsylvania in 1997 to be closer to 
operations with its Skyway Freight and Overnight Transportation 
subsidiaries, but Skway Freight has been sold and Overnight 
probably will be.

<HEADLINE>  3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A 71-year-old man calmly walked into the  
Mormon church's renowned genealogical library during an 
international convention on Thursday and methodically shot people 
with a small-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it was over, the gunman had killed a church security  
officer and a library patron and wounded five others, including a 
police officer. He was fatally shot by police and died later in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police knew of no motive for the gunman, identified as Sergei  
Babarin of Salt Lake City. Mayor Deedee Corradini said at a news 
conference that the gunman was schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't say anything. He just came in and started shooting  
people,'' said Margaret Kane, who was at the library, directly 
across the street from Temple Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just looked intent on what he was doing. He came to do what  
he was doing,'' said Kane, who huddled under a desk in the 
first-floor research area as the man roamed the lobby and adjacent 
classrooms, stopping at one point to reload. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not hear him say anything. He didn't call out, no names  
or anything. He just kept his hand held out pointing at people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin, a married man with children, is a native of Russia who  
was often frustrated by his broken English, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin's wife told investigators he had not been taking his  
medication for schizophrenia and each day would walk a dozen-odd 
blocks from their home to the State Capitol and to Temple Square, 
Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Ruben Ortega said Babarin was arrested after a 1995  
fight at a department store in downtown Salt Lake. He had been 
carrying a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol and was charged with 
assault and carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, the largest center for genealogical research in the  
world, is directly across the street from the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple and Tabernacle. It 
has more than 2 million rolls of microfilm copies of census and 
other records from more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. Some 250 people -- patrons and employees -- are in the 
building on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
	The church has been involved in genealogy since its founding  
nearly 170 years ago. The church amasses the records for what it 
calls the baptism of the dead. Mormons believe that such baptisms 
give the dead the opportunity to join the Mormon church in the 
afterlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman Platt, a genealogist, said the gunman entered the library  
and quickly fired off a dozen rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived on  
the scene, at first leading police to believe there might be a 
second gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people on the second floor locked themselves inside  
when the shooting began and were evacuated unharmed early in the 
afternoon as SWAT teams combed the building. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, who had exchanged fire with police, was taken out of  
the building to an ambulance parked in front of a nearby restaurant 
about 90 minutes after the first shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Paramedics at first believed he might be wired with an explosive  
and the area was evacuated. No explosives were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police dismissed earlier reports that two other men tied to the  
gunman had been detained. They also said the gunman apparently had 
no connection to a yellow moving truck parked three blocks from the 
library and found to contain two 55-gallon drums of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck owner, who had been at the library earlier Thursday  
and argued with an employee, was questioned at length, said Ortega, 
but he apparently was not involved in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point police blew a hole in the side of the truck to  
inspect the interior. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the five wounded was a police officer who was treated at  
the scene for a minor wound; and a 71-year-old woman with a head 
wound. Two women, ages 45 and 80, were in stable condition, one 
with a shoulder wound and the other with a face wound. The fifth is 
a 24-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much regret these tragic circumstances,'' the church's  
governing First Presidency said in a statement read by Bruce Olsen, 
managing director of public affairs for the church. ``We do not 
have all of the particulars, but our hearts reach out to the 
innocent victims of this terrible tragedy and to their families.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at New High: 10,462.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly higher today in a  
turbulent session that saw the Dow Jones industrial average change 
direction several times but still manage to make its 
fourth-straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close, the Dow was up 51.06 at 10,462.72, topping  
Wednesday's record of 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile technology stocks, which investors had sold  
aggressively since yesterday afternoon, rallied gamely in the final 
30 minutes of trading. That pushed the Nasdaq composite index into 
positive territory for the first time today. The Standard &AMP; Poor 
500 composite index was down slightly but had pared its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wild day, with the hot technology stocks opening down  
big and doing their best to try to come back toward the end of the 
day,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, cyclical stocks, which move up and down along  
with the economy, ``still stole the show,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tthe Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 5.53 to 1,322.91, but the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 14.76 to 2,522.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,781 up, 1,296 down and 489 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 949.69  
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.78 to 622.89, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.81 to 737.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.38 to 417.77.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors began the day by continuing a strategy of selling  
technology and consumer shares and buying economically sensitive 
issues such as manufacturing and basic materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The market stumbled in the afternoon as investors keyed into a  
rise in bond yields. Interest rates were rising on heavy new supply 
in the bond market and a report that manufacturing in the 
Philadelphia area strengthened considerably this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia report did signal a pickup in manufacturing,  
making industrial stocks look even more attractive. But it also 
renewed concerns that the growing economy could reignite inflation, 
said Jack Shaughnessy, market strategist at Advest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market ``has been driven (higher) in the last three  
years by rapidly expanding money supply and falling interest 
rates,'' Shaughnessy noted. Now, ``the market is becoming 
apprehensive that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates 
because of concerns about inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was paring its losses by late afternoon. The  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was 5.52 percent, up only 
slightly from from 5.51 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow components were led higher by such recently out-of-favor  
manufacturers as Boeing, DuPont and International Paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer products makers Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Procter and  
Gamble, both of which are Dow stocks, were down sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh blow to technology stocks today was a warning from  
Storage Technology, a maker of computer storage equipment, that it 
wouldn't meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. 
Storage Tech shares fell sharply.

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO confirmed today that allied  
aircraft struck two convoys in Kosovo, one military and one mixed 
of military and civilians, and that at least one civilian tractor 
was hit. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there  
were two convoys on the same road. Two NATO planes attacked -- one 
hit the military convoy, the other struck at what he called a 
``mixed convoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officer said NATO is still studying what happened, but that  
evidence appeared to show a tractor hit in the second convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	All manned NATO planes returned to base safely from overnight  
attacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>

investigate,'' Shea said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A gunman opened fire today at the Mormon  
church's Family History Library, killing two people and wounding 
four others before he was shot to death by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police SWAT teams were combing the building to determine whether  
another gunman was inside the building more than two hours after 
the 10:30 a.m. shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people on the second floor who had locked themselves  
inside when the shooting began were evacuated unharmed early this 
afternoon as SWAT teams continued to comb the building, said Police 
Chief Ruben Ortega. Police were skeptical of early suspicions that 
a second gunman was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini told reporters that a library security  
guard and a female patron had died of their wounds and the suspect 
had also died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega said police had identified the gunman, who had a local  
address, but they did not immediately release his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, who had exchanged gunfire with police, was taken out  
of the building to an ambulance parked in front of a nearby 
restaurant, but paramedics believed he might be wired with an 
explosive and the area was evacuated. He died in the ambulance and 
police Sgt. Ken Hansen said he had no explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said the four wounded included a police officer. The  
wounds were not believed to be life-threatening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman Platt, a genealogist, said a gunman entered the library  
and quickly fired off a dozen rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaqueline Nelson, a researcher who was working on the first  
floor, said: ``We heard a pop and somebody said `Everybody get 
down.' There were 10 or 12 pops and somebody yelled `Somebody's 
shooting!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived on  
the scene, at first leading police to believe there might be a 
second gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Family History, the largest genealogical library in the world,  
is directly across the street from Temple Square, site of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple and 
Tabernacle. According to a church Web site, it has more than 2 
million rolls of microfilm copies of census and other records from 
more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. Some 250 people -- patrons and employees -- are in the 
building on a typical day. 
</P>
<P>
	A KSL-TV employee, Tamara Orr, said a man matching the  
description of a suspect asked her for directions to the Family 
History Library earlier this morning. The man, who appeared to be 
in his late 50s, was bearded and wore disheveled clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The man drove a yellow moving truck, which KSL reported was  
being investigated by a police bomb squad early this afternoon. The 
truck was parked near the station, three blocks west of the history 
library.

<HEADLINE> More Obstacles in Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dispute over abortion threatened to scuttle  
a Senate bill to rewrite the bankruptcy laws, while some Democrats 
on Thursday denounced the bill as a giveaway to credit card 
companies that would hurt hard-pressed families. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., would require  
bankrupt people found to have violated laws protecting abortion 
clinics to pay those penalties. Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., called 
the proposal a ``poison pill'' that could kill the bankruptcy 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The way ``to make sure nothing happens (with legislation) is to  
say 'abortion,''' Biden, who supports the bankruptcy overhaul bill, 
said as the Senate Judiciary Committee began a drafting session. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., is pushing an opposing  
amendment prohibiting doctors who declare bankruptcy from writing 
off penalties they owe from medical malpractice claims related to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time the bipartisan legislation, which would  
make it tougher for people to erase their debts in bankruptcy 
court, has become entangled in sensitive social issues. Last year 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with consumer groups and some 
Democrats, complained that the measure would make single mothers 
and children who are owed support by bankrupt fathers take a back 
seat to credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened in 1998 to veto a House-passed  
bankruptcy overhaul bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Senate bill split the Democrats on the Judiciary  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It basically stinks,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said at  
the drafting session. ``You talk about special-interest 
legislation: you've got it right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to an ongoing lobbying push for the legislation  
by credit card companies and retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, credit card giant Visa USA Inc. increased its  
lobbying bill to $3.6 million from $900,000 in 1997, new disclosure 
reports show. MasterCard International's lobbying expenses rose to 
$1.8 million from $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, consumer groups, unions, civil rights groups  
and bankruptcy attorneys oppose the legislation, saying it favors 
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the bill had been stripped of consumer protections  
that were included in earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer is proposing amendments that would, for example, bar  
credit card companies from imposing special fees on consumers who 
pay their balances off. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., called the bill ``irresponsible''  
and ``a gift to special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden insisted that the bill is not an attempt to ``stiff  
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden, whose home state Delaware is the headquarters site for  
many credit card issuers, and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., are 
co-sponsors of the bill with Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that we do not allow partisan politics to get  
in the way of implementing fair and reasonable reforms to the 
nation's bankruptcy laws,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the 
Judiciary Committee's chairman. ``Under this legislation, if people 
are able to repay their debts, they will be required to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee adjourned without completing work on the bill and  
planned to resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Senate and House bills would allow federal bankruptcy  
judges to determine a debtor's ability to repay. They would use an 
IRS standard to estimate living expenses and calculate whether the 
payback could be 25 percent or more of the total debt within three 
years. If so, the debtor could be forced into a Chapter 13 
reorganization plan.

	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> BankBoston Earnings Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- BankBoston Corp. reported a 6 percent decline in  
profits for the first quarter on higher expenses and lower venture 
capital income. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank on Thursday posted net income of $223 million, or 75  
cents a share, just 2 cents above Wall Street's estimate. 
BankBoston earned $207 million, or 79 cents a share in the first 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.23 billion, up 19 percent from $1.03 billion in  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We experienced healthy growth across a number of our  
businesses especially in the fee-based activities,'' Chad Gifford, 
chairman and chief executive of BankBoston, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's shares rose $1.56 1/4 to close at $51 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based company announced last month it would be  
acquired by Fleet Bank, making the combined bank the nation's 
seventh-largest. The deal is expected to close in the second half 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston reported first-quarter expenses of $806 million, down  
slightly from the end of last year, but up 22 percent from the 
first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits declined for the bank's venture capital arm because of  
lower level of transactions. At the end of March, the Private 
Equity portfolio had a value of $1.4 billion compared with $1.2 
billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brazil, BankBoston's income rose 40 percent, although mutual  
fund fees were down because of the drop in value of the local 
currency. In Argentina, net income improved by 25% from the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	It's investment banking arm, Robertson Stephens, reported pretax  
income of $30 million, double its income from the fourth quarter 
when financial markets were still shaky. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston ended the quarter with total assets of $75.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> Indy Entry List Totals 84 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jaques Lazier, the seventh rookie and the  
younger brother of former Indianapolis 500 winner Buddy Lazier, is 
among the final group of entries announced for the May 30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	Another six cars whose entries were postmarked before last  
Friday's deadline were added to the list, raising the total to 84 
eligible to compete for the 33 starting spots. Seventy-five cars 
were entered last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier, 28, who raced in the Indy Lights series last season, was  
assigned to two cars entered by DR-Lazier Racing, a team owned by 
his father, former Indy driver Bob Lazier. Buddy Lazier, the 1996 
winner, is one of three former champions entered in the race and 
will drive for Hemelgarn Racing with teammate Johnny Unser. 
</P>
<P>
	The other former winners are Eddie Cheever, who won last year,  
and Arie Luyendyk, a two-time winner who plans to retire after the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Jaques Lazier, the other late entries were for veterans  
Scott Harrington, who was 15th in his only previous start at 
Indianapolis in 1996, and Jimmy Kite, 11th as a rookie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The others in the 1999 rookie class who have been assigned cars  
are Mike Borkowski, John Hollansworth Jr., Dave Steele, Wim 
Eyckmans, Robby McGehee and Jeret Schroeder. Eyckmans is Cheever's 
teammate and protege; Steele is a Panther Racing teammate of Indy 
Racing League season points leader Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemelgarn and A.J. Foyt Enterprises each entered six cars, more  
than any other team. Defending IRL champion Kenny Brack and last 
year's Indy 500 pole winner Billy Boat are driving for Foyt, while 
another teammate could be added later for one of Foyt's other 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other drivers is Tony Stewart, a former IRL champion  
who left Team Menard to compete in the NASCAR Winston Cup series 
for team owner Joe Gibbs. Stewart has two cars entered by Tri-Star 
Motorsports, an Indy team he recently put together with Larry 
Curry, his former team manager with Menard, and Andy Card, a former 
Menard public relations man. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking Stewart's place this season with Menard is Greg Ray, who  
had the fastest speed during the recent open testing at the 
Speedway at more than 227 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Full practice will begin on May 15, with qualifications on May  
22-23.

<HEADLINE> Honda Rolls Out Sleek Roadster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Honda Motor Co. rolled out the new S2000 roadster  
on Thursday in an attempt to compete against pricier European 
sports cars in a crowded niche market. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye-catching two-seater, which will hit U.S. showrooms in  
the fall, sells in Japan for about $28,000 -- far more affordable 
than upper-end import roadsters like the $41,000 Mercedes-Benz SLK 
and the $51,000 Porsche Boxster. 
</P>
<P>
	The S2000 meets Japanese exhaust emission standards that go into  
effect next year. It also comes with a tax incentive, allowing 
Japanese motorists to save about $300 if the car is registered 
before October 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda hopes to sell 500 of the roadsters a month in Japan and  
about 10,000 a year abroad, including the United States, Europe and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've created a responsive sports car that feels good to the  
driver,'' said Shigeru Uehara, the Honda executive who heads the 
S2000 team. ``It's nimble as though it is part of your limbs, 
almost like a racing car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's S2000 has a rigid body that offers safety, an  
electrically powered top that goes up in six seconds and a 2-liter, 
4-cylinder engine. 
</P>
<P>
	First shown late last year at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show,  
the S2000 marks a return to Honda's roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's first car was the S500 roadster, introduced in 1963. The  
company, which previously only produced motorcycles, entered 
Formula 1 racing the following year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sports car embodies Honda's passion toward driving,''  
Honda President Hiroyuki Yoshino said Thursday at a reception at 
Honda headquarters in Tokyo that was attended by hundreds of 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The introduction of the S2000 -- the only roadster in Honda's  
lineup -- comes at a time when Japanese auto sales have been dragged 
down by a persistent recession, plummeting 11.2 percent in the 
fiscal year ended March 31 -- the second straight year of declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Honda sales in North America have continued to rise,  
overall sales for the last three months of last year fell 3.9 
percent, to $12.6 billion. Honda has managed to keep profits up 
through cost-cutting. The weaker Japanese yen, which boosts profits 
for exporters like Honda, has also helped. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few years back, interest in expensive sports cars was  
dwindling. But recently, more and more automakers have returned to 
the sports car as production costs come down. 
</P>
<P>
	Even ailing Nissan Motor Co. -- in which French Renault bought a  
37 percent stake last month -- has shown a prototype for a new Z-car 
that it hopes will be as popular as the original 240-Z sports car 
of 30 years ago.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Hit With Cocaine Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's turbulent baseball career  
has taken another off-field jolt: He has been charged with 
possession of cocaine with a street value of about $20 and 
soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' outfielder offered a female undercover  
officer $50 for sex, Tampa police said, then acknowledged that the 
arrest could jeopardize his future in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this interview, Strawberry continually apologized and  
was very remorseful for what he had done,'' police Sgt. Marc J. 
Hamlin wrote in an investigative report. ``He asked several times, 
if there was anything that we could do to change this situation, 
because this was going to ruin his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A search Wednesday night turned up 0.3 grams -- about 100th of an  
ounce -- of powder cocaine wrapped in a $20 bill inside Strawberry's 
wallet, police said. He was booked and released on $6,000 bond 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared for personal use,'' police spokesman Joe Durkin  
said. ``One hit size.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder told police that the cocaine did not  
belong to him and that he never intended to have sex with the 
undercover officer. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the police report, Strawberry said his wife's  
uncle, Rodney Simon, used the vehicle the previous night and that 
it was possible he might have left the folded $20 bill in the glove 
compartment where Strawberry found it Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-time All-Star said he was joking around with the  
undercover officer about sex and drove off with no intention of 
meeting her at a nearby motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	The police report said Strawberry was carrying about $1,159.10  
in cash at the time he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been in Tampa to work himself back into shape  
following colon cancer surgery last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine possession is a third-degree felony with a maximum  
penalty of five years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Pam Bondi 
said. The maximum penalty for solicitation, a misdemeanor, is 60 
days in the county jail for a first offense. After that, the 
maximum penalty is a year in the county jail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, those are general guidelines, Bondi said, indicating  
that charges for Strawberry had yet to reach the prosecutor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonn Trost, the Yankees' general counsel, declined to comment,  
saying the team would allow the legal process to run its course 
before speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees won the World Series without him, New York  
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani praised Strawberry ``for the comeback 
he's made as a baseball player and the comeback he's making in 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in New York last weekend to receive his World Series  
ring, but was not expected to join the Yankees until he completed 
chemotherapy and a stint with Triple-A Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's list of substance abuse problems is lengthy.  
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball suspended him for 60 days in 1995 after he  
tested positive for cocaine. The previous year, he entered the 
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and spent four weeks 
undergoing treatment for a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, while with the New York Mets, he entered the Smithers  
Center in New York for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to substance abuse, Strawberry also ran afoul of tax  
laws. In 1995, a federal court ordered him to repay $350,000 in 
back taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement, 
except for games. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, the National League Rookie of the Year in 1983 and a  
World Series champion with the Mets in 1986, also was accused of 
failing to make timely payments to an ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	He rebounded after signing with the Yankees in June 1995 and had  
remained drug free, with regular testing by major league baseball. 
Strawberry had his best season in seven years in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has a .250 career average with 332 homers and 994  
RBIs in 16 major league seasons with the Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
San Francisco Giants and Yankees. He led the NL with 39 homers in 
1988 and topped 100 RBIs three times with the Mets from 1987-90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, because of complicated rules involving baseball's  
luxury tax, shifted him to a minor league roster during the 
offseason, fearing he would not be healthy enough to play by 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, the No. 1 pick in baseball's June 1980 amateur  
draft, joined with Dwight Gooden to help lead the Mets to the 1986 
World Series title.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette's earnings rose 4 percent during the  
first quarter as its consumer products businesses turned in a mixed 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The personal products maker reported Thursday it earned $269  
million, or 24 cents a share, up from $268 million, or 23 cents a 
share, during the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gillette warned that some of its businesses would  
have disappointing results for the quarter. The company said 
Thursday its earnings were also reduced by higher interest costs 
for its share buyback program. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue dropped from $2 billion last year to $1.9 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's MACH3 shaving system, which went on sale in the  
United States last July, fed a 33 percent increase in the company's 
North American blade business. But overall sales were tempered by a 
weaker than expected results in the Braun business and in some 
international markets, said Alfred M. Zeien, the company's retiring 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said first-quarter sales and profits for its blade  
and razor division were considerably higher than the year before. 
Sales from Duracell batteries were virtually unchanged, while 
profits were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Oral-B sales were little changed, but profits grew sharply.  
</P>
<P>
	Gillette stock finished unchanged at $50.31 1/4 a share in New York  
Stock Exchange trading.

	NATO Begins New Round of Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Pursued by artillery fire,  
terrorized by the gruesome blasting apart of a refugee convoy a day 
earlier, thousands of Kosovar Albanians poured into neighboring 
Albania and Macedonia, even as NATO took to the skies over 
Yugoslavia for a fresh round of airstrikes today. As the alliance 
pressed ahead with its bombing campaign, circumstances surrounding 
the attack on a refugee convoy under Serb military escort yesterday 
in western Kosovo remained under bitter dispute. Yugoslav officials 
said the convoy attack, which it said killed 64 people and wounded 
20, came from NATO warplanes.

	Ex-Pakistani Premier Gets Jail Term  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A Pakistani court today sentenced  
former prime minister Benazir Bhutto to five years in jail on a 
corruption charge and disqualified her from politics, the state-run 
news agency reported. The court also fined her $8.6 million. There 
was no immediate comment from Ms. Bhutto, who was out of the 
country. The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said the Lahore 
High court found Ms. Bhutto and her husband guilty of taking 
kickbacks on government contracts. Ms. Bhutto, who had been the 
first and only female prime minister of the country, faces five 
other charges of corruption all stemming from her term in office.

	Spain May Seek Pinochet Extradition  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain's top law enforcement official dashed Gen.  
Augusto Pinochet's hopes of immediately returning home by ruling 
today that Spain can continue seeking the former Chilean dictator's 
extradition. The ruling means that even though the House of Lords 
drastically reduced the case against the 83-year general last 
month, Home Secretary Jack Straw considered the remaining charges -- 
which include torture and conspiracy to torture -- serious enough to 
go forward. Pinochet, who remains under armed guard at a mansion 
outside London, now faces the prospect of months or possibly years 
in British courts battling Spain's attempt to bring him to trial 
for allegedly torturing opponents while in power.

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan tested a second  
nuclear-capable missile today, again upping the ante in the arms 
race with its uneasy neighbor India. The missile tested was the 
Shaheen 1, the first in a new series of surface-to-surface 
missiles, military and government officials said. The missile's 
range of 450 miles was considerably less than the Ghauri II 
ballistic missile tested by Pakistan yesterday. The earlier test of 
the Ghauri II, which has a range of 1,200 miles, was carried out in 
apparent response to a trial launch of an advanced version of 
India's Agni missile last Sunday.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Powerful storms rolled across the South early

Mississippi. One person was killed and more than two dozen were 
injured, authorities said. Heavy rain and windy conditions were 
reported throughout Mississippi, but the majority of the damage 
appeared to be in northern Jones County and southern Jasper County, 
a region about 60 miles southeast of Jackson. A 71-year-old man was 
killed near Soso, according to Jones County authorities, but no 
details were immediately available. The storms were accompanied by 
very strong winds.

<HEADLINE> Moore Delivers 'The Awful Truth' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Timidity is at the very core of television,  
which remains as inoffensive as possible to keep as many viewers as 
possible. Even when programs veer into controversy, boundaries are 
carefully observed. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a narrow range of political debate, although it's hard  
to tell for all the screaming on TV talk shows. Shows that seem 
racy or profane turn out to be morality plays at heart; the bad 
guys -- and it's assumed we all agree on what's good and bad -- 
always lose in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	You want real daring, bluntness, outrageous opinion? Go read an  
alternative publication, right- or left-wing. Go listen to the 
radio. Don't bother turning on the TV set, where the status quo is 
handmaiden to commercials for cars and cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Except, except ... here comes Michael Moore, variously described  
as guerrilla, maverick or rogue filmmaker, to put a little static 
in the picture. ``The Awful Truth,'' which airs at 9 p.m. EDT 
Sunday on Bravo and repeats at 10 p.m. EDT Friday, is a 12-week 
series in the style of Moore's documentaries ``Roger &AMP; Me'' and 
``The Big One.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As in his films, his aim is to stick it to the big guys and give  
a lift to the little ones. He also wants to make us laugh and think 
at the same time. That in itself is revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Media exist to reinforce the status quo, to reinforce people's  
fears and prejudices and to guarantee that citizens will not rock 
the boat,'' Moore said in an interview. ``It is meant to sedate 
people, to numb their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Awful Truth'' is no dose of Prozac; viewers risk being  
delighted or offended by its naked satire. 
</P>
<P>
	The first episode offers a skit in which Moore, accompanied by a  
band of performers dressed as Puritans, invade the nation's capital 
to show independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Congress how to 
conduct a better and cheaper ``witch hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another segment, Moore champions the cause of a man who, we  
are told, will die without the pancreas transplant his HMO refuses 
to cover. Moore's tactics include a rehearsal funeral, casket and 
all, staged in front of the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Future bits: A chorus of people who have lost their larynxes to  
smoking serenade tobacco executives and lobbyists; Moore attempts 
to give software magnate Bill Gates a weed trimmer for his lavish 
estate; Moore plays matchmaker for Hillary Rodham Clinton, figuring 
she'll be available in January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore's trademark baseball cap and gleeful expression give him  
the look of a kid who just smacked a ball through the crabby 
neighbor's house. Ask him to apologize, and he'd probably hand you 
a bat and ball. He seems as comfortable in his subversive skin as 
he is in that all-American cap. The economic recovery, for example, 
he dismisses as the property of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	The average schmo is ``living on five Master Cards and three  
Visas and paying the minimum balance from month to month. ... The 
whole recovery is financed on personal debt on the backs of working 
people of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That the system has cleared air time for a harsh critic doesn't  
surprise Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's this incredible flaw in capitalism which says we must  
make as much money as possible, no matter what. Even if we have to 
put a guy on TV who we completely disagree with and who is opposed 
to everything we stand for,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's that old saying: The capitalist will sell you the rope  
to hang himself with. That is such a beautiful description.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is not relentlessly downbeat. He has kind words for  
corporate-owned Bravo for providing a home for him and other 
independent filmmakers. And he expects viewers to enjoy ``The Awful 
Truth'' even more than be enlightened by it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Moore's take on economics is unfair and simplistic.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you want a sermon, you should go to church,'' he says. ``If  
you want a political rally, you should join a party. First and 
foremost, my responsibility is to entertain the people watching the 
show and to make sure they have a good laugh for a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they can have that laugh at the expense of people causing a  
lot of havoc in their lives, like corporate America or these 
politicians, great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmaker plays stand-up comic in ``The Awful Truth,''  
introducing the pre-taped segments and doing shtick for a lively 
Chicago theater audience. He downplays his skill as a comedian but 
concedes he easily handles the hecklers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love hecklers, though,'' Moore said. ``I AM them.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....

	WACO REVISITED: On the sixth anniversary of the FBI assault on  
the Branch Davidian complex outside Waco, Texas, HBO is showing 
``Waco: The Rules of Engagement,'' a 1998 Academy Award-nominated 
documentary. A 51-day siege of the David Koresh-led group ended in 
1993 with an inferno that killed about 80 sect members. The film, 
showing 6:30 p.m. EDT Monday, April 19, questions the government's 
claim it was mass suicide.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Lead 2000 Fundraising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steve Forbes, who spent $37.5 million of his  
own money on his presidential campaign four years ago, reported 
Thursday he is lagging behind most other Republican presidential 
contenders in spending and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes gave his campaign $694,000 of his own money and raised  
only $18,538 during the first quarter of 1999, according to 
campaign disclosure reports filed Thursday. He had spent $599,004 
and had just $113,539 in the bank as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	At the other end of the fund-raising spectrum, Texas Gov. George  
W. Bush reported raising $7.6 million and Vice President Al Gore, 
the Democratic front-runner, raised $8.9 million. Each had more 
than $6 million in the bank, a huge lead over their competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP candidates Gary Bauer, John McCain and Dan Quayle also broke  
the million-dollar fund-raising barrier, as did former Democratic 
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's lone challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Elizabeth Dole, the former head of the American Red Cross,  
trailed Forbes in fund raising among the top GOP contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican, Lamar Alexander, reported running in the red at  
the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Juleanne Glover Weiss said Forbes didn't begin  
raising money for his campaign until this month, after the deadline 
for reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been on the phone a great deal,'' Weiss said. ``You won't  
see the seven-digit number until the next filing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expenditures Forbes reported was $254,000 for polling.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' ability to finance his own campaign allows him to forgo  
federal matching funds and the spending limits that accompany them. 
The fear that Forbes will spend millions of dollars in the early 
primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire has Bush considering 
whether he, too, will give up the federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Election Commission report showed Bush raising money  
at a pace of just over $271,000 a day. He had spent $854,000, and 
had $6.8 million in the bank as of March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said I want to make sure the fund raising is real before I  
commit,'' said Bush, who has yet to formally declare his candidacy. 
``I wanted to make sure that behind the polls there was some solid 
support. It appears there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore led all candidates in fund raising, taking in contributions  
from more than 45,000 people. He spent $2 million, including 
$693,089 for fund raising, and had $6.9 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 6,000 people gave $1,000 each to Gore, including  
actress and singer Barbra Streisand, Eastman Kodak Chief Executive 
Officer George Fisher, and Alex Ferrari, head of MTV Networks. Gore 
has more than 50 people raising $50,000 apiece for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley remained financially competitive, raising $4.3 million  
during the first three months of 1999 and finishing the quarter 
with $2.9 million in the bank. He received $1,000 apiece from 
former Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan and his wife 
Juanita; and $1,000 apiece from former New York Knicks teammate 
Phil Jackson and his wife June. Bradley reported raising another $2 
million in New York City Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans:  
</P>
<P>
	--Quayle, the former vice president, raised more than any other  
GOP hopeful except Bush, taking in $2.1 million. But much of that 
money was raised through direct mail, which is expensive; he spent 
$1 million on fund raising. Quayle had 35,251 contributors, more 
than the 23,339 people who gave to Bush. Overall, Quayle spent $1.6 
million on the campaign and had $500,443 in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	--McCain reported raising $1.8 million and transferred another $2  
million from his Senate campaign fund. He spent $1 million and had 
$2.8 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bauer raised $1.4 million, but ate most of that up by spending  
$881,518. His cash on hand, $489,367, is scarcely more than the 
debts the campaign owes, $425,563. 
</P>
<P>
	--Alexander reported owing $212,405 and having just $86,916 in  
the bank. He raised $748,773 during the first quarter of 1999 and 
spent $661,856. His chief fund-raiser, Ted Welch, said the campaign 
is just starting to take in money; 26 fund-raisers are scheduled 
between May 4 and June 23. ``There's every reason to believe we're 
going to be able to compete in Iowa and New Hampshire and gain the 
momentum needed to raise the additional funds,'' political director 
Brian Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dole raised $685,253 and spent $108,210. She had $578,042 in  
the bank. Spokesman Ari Fleischer said Dole's fund raising is just 
getting under way. ``We consider the first quarter spring training, 
which doesn't count toward the regular season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another GOP hopeful, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, is not  
disclosing how much his campaign has raised and spent. Federal 
election law allows potential candidates to raise and spend money 
without disclosing any information as long as the funds are used 
solely to gauge support for a campaign. Kasich campaign officials 
have said the congressman has raised more than $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to Editors / Presidential Speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Seaton,  
distinguished officers and members of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors. I want to thank you for giving me the 
opportunity to address the crisis in Kosovo, why we're there, what 
our objectives are, how this fits in with our larger vision of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Since I'm here I can't help noting that one of the truly  
striking aspects of this moment is the stark contrast it 
illuminates between a free society with a free press and a closed 
society where the press is used to manipulate people by suppressing 
or distorting the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade today, independent journalists are being persecuted.  
This week, one brave editor was murdered in cold blood. Meanwhile, 
the government-run press has constructed an alternative reality for 
the Serbian people in which the atrocities their soldiers are 
committing in Kosovo simply don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those conditions, decent people can remain in denial,  
supporting policies that lead them to political and economic ruin. 
Thank goodness our press and free press throughout the world have 
tried to get at and get out the truth to ensure that words like 
``refugees,'' ``displacement,'' ``ethnic cleansing,'' don't become 
stale and lifeless but remain causes for action. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned  
and long premeditated attack on an entire people simply on the 
basis of their ethnicity and religion -- an attack grounded in a 
philosophy that teaches people to dearly love a piece of land while 
utterly dismissing the humanity of those who occupy it. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what Mr. Milosevic has been doing ever since Yugoslavia  
started breaking up in 1989. For a decade he has been trying to 
build a greater Serbia by using military force to rearrange the 
ethnic character of the nations which emerged from Yugoslavia. That 
is what he did for years in Croatia and horribly in Bosnia -- what 
he is doing in Kosovo now. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he drove hundreds of thousands of people from their  
homes into the frigid mountains and let them back only after NATO 
threatened to use force. He is now determined to crush all 
resistance to his rule, even if it means turning Kosovo into a 
lifeless wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
	As these difficult days proceed, it is important to remember  
that we have no quarrel with the Serbian people. They were our 
allies in World War II. They have often been our allies. In a 
sense, they are victims of this tragedy, too. And we must 
understand the anguish of Serbian-Americans, who like 
Albanian-Americans are worried about their loved ones back home. 
Americans should not blame Serbs or look down on Serbian-Americans 
because we disagree with the Milosevic government. We must not let 
his ethnic cleansing provoke us to ethnic bias. 
</P>
<P>
	We and our 18 NATO allies are in Kosovo today because we want to  
stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing, because we want to 
build a stable, united, prosperous Europe that includes the Balkans 
and its neighbors, and because we don't want the 21st century to be 
dominated by the dark marriage of modern weapons and ancient 
ethnic, racial and religious hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	We cannot simply watch as hundreds of thousands of people are  
brutalized, murder, raped, forced from their homes, their family 
histories erased, all in the name of ethnic pride and purity. NATO 
was pivotal to ending the killing and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. 
We can do so again and this time we have responded more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Were we to stand aside, the atrocities in Kosovo would go on and  
on. Neighboring democracies, as you see, would be overwhelmed by 
permanent refugees and demoralized by the failure of democracy's 
alliance. The Kosovar Albanians would become a people without a 
homeland, a burden to host countries, a magnet for radical 
ideologies, a breeding ground for unending warfare in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO would be discredited -- yes, because it made promises not  
kept, but more important because its values and vision of Europe 
would be profoundly damaged. Ultimately, the conflict in Kosovo 
would spread anyway, and we would have to act anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, when we decided to launch the air campaign after Mr.  
Milosevic rejected peace, we believed there was at least a 
possibility that our readiness to act would deter him from moving 
forward, as it had in the past. But we also understood clearly that 
with 40,000 troops and over 250 tanks massed in and around Kosovo, 
he might intensify his repression and go on with his planned 
attack, as I made clear in my address to the nation the night the 
airstrikes began. 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one possibility that we and our NATO allies were  
not willing to entertain: that the international community would 
look the other way in the face of this brutality. Now, the NATO air 
campaign has been underway for three weeks, often interrupted or 
limited by bad weather. This is, however, a good time to assess 
what has been accomplished and where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Milosevic's strategy has been to complete the ethnic  
cleansing, then break the unity of NATO by taking the bombs and 
offering phony concessions. But NATO is more united today than when 
the operation began. Whether they are conservatives in Spain, 
socialists in France, New Labor in Britain, or Greens in Germany, 
the leaders of Europe and the people they represent are determined 
to maintain and intensify our attacks until Mr. Milosevic's forces 
leave Kosovo and the refugees return under the protection of an 
international force, or until his military is weakened to the point 
when he can no longer keep his vice-like grip on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	At the beginning of the operation, we focused properly on  
Serbia's highly developed air defenses to reduce the risks to our 
pilots. There are still significant air defenses up, and therefore 
there is still risk with every mission. But we have degraded the 
system to the point that now NATO can fly 24 hours a day, not 
simply at night. We've struck at Serbia's machinery of repression, 
at the infrastructure that supports it. We've destroyed all of 
Serbia's refineries, half of its capacity to produce ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Congress Complains About Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This being income tax day, Congress is once  
again chorusing complaints about the burdens, complexities and, by 
Republican accounting, excessive rates of the system it created. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the talk will yield to inaction on sweeping reform --  
and another round of targeted tax breaks will make it more 
complicated next time. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton wants an array of them, Republicans want fewer  
breaks and across-the-board rate cuts, too. The GOP budget seeks 
about $800 billion in tax reductions over the next decade, up to 
$15 billion of them next year. Details are to come. 
</P>
<P>
	So the 1999 debate will be about how much to cut, and for whom,  
without the push for a simplifying overhaul the Republicans had 
said was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of the GOP list now is an end to the marriage tax  
penalty, which causes about 21 million couples to pay more on their 
joint income than they would if they were single. Proposals to do 
that are geared to income, meaning new instructions and tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants targeted tax breaks for child care, senior care,  
education and more. The administration has just proposed $300 tax 
credits for middle-income Americans who invest in proposed new 
personal retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	All those changes for specific purposes and groups would add to  
the more than 2.8 million words in the tax code, triple the Bible, 
the complexity critics note. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Congress voted 1,260 changes in the  
system, reflected in 11 new forms and 177 revised ones issued by 
the IRS for 1998 income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By IRS estimate, it takes 11 hours and 34 minutes for the  
average taxpayer to prepare the basic Form 1040 for income taxes. 
Itemize deductions and it's another 4 hours, 28 minutes. With 
capital gains, add 6 hours and 41 minutes. Figuring taxes on 
interest and dividends takes an additional hour and 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why more than half the taxpayers filing an estimated  
126.1 million returns this year paid to get them prepared by tax 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is why the complexity complaints are a fixture. There is  
a Republican effort in Congress to fix it by decree -- scrap the 
current income tax code at the end of 2003, to be replaced by a 
simpler system, a flat tax or consumption tax. 
</P>
<P>
	That deadline is a fallback; the earlier one was the end of  
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The later one won't succeed, either. Democrats oppose the idea  
of ending the graduated income tax, and there is no Republican 
consensus on whether or how to do it. GOP leaders had said they'd 
settle on a plan in 1998 and act on it this year, but they didn't 
and they won't. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax code is built into the American economic system, and it  
would take time to build it out, assuming the political agreement 
and will to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, the Republican presidential candidate who made the  
flat tax his issue and pushed it, briefly, to the top of the 
campaign agenda in 1996, is running for the 2000 nomination, still 
advocating a simple, 17 percent tax. This time, his agenda is 
broader, and while he says there is broadening support for tax 
simplification, he acknowledges it is not an easy issue to sell 
because people mistrust what politicians tell them about taxes. 
``It gets to the feeling that it's like the weather,'' Forbes said. 
``That no matter what you say, not much is going to be done about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it will be a presidential campaign issue, and there will  
be action to simplify the system within four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll conducted for The Associated Press showed 66 percent of  
Americans think the system is too complicated, compared with less 
than half in a survey three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half in the poll late last month liked the idea of a  
flat tax -- but only a third said they'd be willing to give up their 
current deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier Fox News poll reflected the doubts about targeted tax  
breaks. In that survey, 62 percent said that when Clinton talks 
about targeted tax cuts, they think it means a cut for someone 
else, not for them. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll showed 53 
percent of Americans think they are paying more than their fair 
share in taxes. Forty-five percent said their tax share is about 
right.

<HEADLINE> Bill Rodgers Returns to Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- There will be a familiar sight at the start of the  
Boston Marathon Monday: Bill Rodgers, a knit hat atop his thick 
blond hair, his hands covered with white gloves and a big smile on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers will be back in his element, and the hundreds of  
thousands of spectators lining the 26-mile, 385-yard course will be 
cheering loudly for ``Boston Billy,'' even though he has no chance 
of winning the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers is 51 now, and his goals are different than they were  
nearly 25 years ago, when he won his first of four Boston Marathon 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he will be aiming to break the over-50 course record  
for an American of 2 hours, 31 minutes, 34 seconds, set by Norm 
Green in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``I run for marks,'' Rodgers said. ``I've got my sights set on  
several age-group records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sunday, he tried breaking another of Green's records,  
52:53, for 10 miles, at the Cherry Blossom Run in Washington, but 
he missed by 1:11. However, he did finish 33rd overall among the 
6,200 entrants in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers still is a bundle of energy and youthfulness -- despite  
his age -- and never has lost his enthusiasm for racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he ran 29 races at various road distances, up from  
his usual quota of 20 or 22. Since 1987, when he turned 40, he has 
been consistently ranked among the top masters runners in the 
world. In 1997, he set six U.S. records for 49-year-olds at 
distances from 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) to the half-marathon (13.1 
miles). 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Rodgers' first serious Boston Marathon since 1990  
and his first serious marathon anywhere since 1992. He ran in 
Boston's centennial marathon in 1996, but only ``on cruise 
control'' with friends, clocking 2:53. 
</P>
<P>
	He had intended to run Boston last year, but didn't ``train  
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he has been preparing diligently since December, but  
even though this will be the 58th marathon of his illustrious 
career and 16th at Boston, he surprisingly has some trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is trickier and I'm nervous, because it's my first real  
marathon in seven years,'' he said. ``But I'm psyched for the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers' last ``real'' marathon was the inaugural Vietnam  
International Marathon in 1992. Rodgers was determined to win that 
race and at 21 miles, he was in front. But the 90-degree heat and 
100-percent humidity took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to crumble and had to walk the last three miles,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers staggered across the finish line at 3:19 -- 43 minutes  
slower than his previous worst marathon performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last true Boston Marathon nine years ago, he finished  
fifth in the Masters Division at 2:20:46. He ran his first Boston 
race in 1973 and did not finish. The following year, he was 14th at 
2:19:34, then made his big breakthrough in 1975, winning at 
2:09:55. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the American record held by 1972 Olympic gold medalist  
Frank Shorter and the course record of 2:10:30 set by England's Ron 
Hill in 1970. That was despite stopping four times for water and 
once to tie a shoe lace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning that race changed my life,'' he said. ``Before that, I  
was just another American marathoner. To crack 2:10 at Boston was 
unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, I was ranked the fourth-best marathoner in the  
world. I started becoming an international runner. I felt I could 
win any race. Before that, I was a competitive runner but didn't 
think I could win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers went on to win Boston again in 1978, 1979 (breaking his  
American and course records with a 2:09:27) and 1980. He also won 
the New York City Marathon four times -- from 1976-79. Overall, he 
has 21 marathons victories, the last being the Orange Bowl Marathon 
at Miami in 1983. He also has run 28 marathons under 2:16, the most 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers knows he can't run nearly that fast now.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I can break 2:31, I will walk away very happy ... just as  
happy as the winner,'' he said. ``Those records are the carrots ... 
That's what lures me.''

<HEADLINE> Vanderbilt, DiNardo Claim Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Both Vanderbilt and Gerry DiNardo  
claimed victory Thursday in their long-running dispute over whether 
the former football coach broke his contract and owes the 
university $281,886. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati sided with  
Vanderbilt on Wednesday in finding DiNardo broke terms of a 
five-year contract in 1994 when he took the coaching job at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court sent the case back to U.S. District Court in  
Nashville to determine whether he also violated the terms of a 
two-year contract extension he signed that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won 75 percent of the case, and it was a draw on 25  
percent,'' Vanderbilt lawyer John Callison said. '' ... From our 
perspective, it's a great victory. It's not just about money, it's 
a matter of principle. We honor our contracts with the coaches; the 
coaches should honor their obligation to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiNardo said in a statement from Baton Rouge, La., he was ``very  
pleased'' with the appellate court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Robert Echols ruled in 1997 that DiNardo  
owed Vanderbilt $281,886 for the final year of the original 
five-year contract and the two-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure came from the base salary of $91,781 per year for the  
three years, plus $6,541 for the time between DiNardo's Dec. 12, 
1994, resignation and the Jan. 5 expiration date on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Callison said because the appeals court ruled DiNardo broke his  
original contract, he owes the school a minimum of one year's 
salary plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
	DiNardo said he will pay one year's salary if Vanderbilt drops  
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to restate that I remain prepared to satisfy my  
obligations under my original employment agreement. In fact, I have 
filed papers with the federal district court in Nashville stating 
that I would fulfill that obligation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Callison says Vanderbilt isn't willing to settle for that.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have said all along that we are entitled not only to the  
last year, but to the two-year extension. We entered into them in 
good faith. We expect coach DiNardo to honor them in good faith,'' 
Callison said. 
</P>
<P>
	The key questions are whether DiNardo's brother and lawyer,  
Larry DiNardo, had to approve the extension before it became 
enforceable and whether Larry DiNardo's failure to object to the 
terms amounted to approval. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 17, 1994, Gerry DiNardo signed the extension but told  
then-Vanderbilt athletic director Paul Hoolahan, ``Larry needs to 
see a copy before this thing is finalized,'' according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessean reported on Aug. 20, 1994, that DiNardo's  
contract had been extended and the coach stated publicly that he 
was ``excited'' about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, Callison faxed an unsigned copy of the draft to  
Larry DiNardo, writing on it to ``let me know if you have any 
questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 27, Callison faxed Larry DiNardo about his brother's  
television and radio contract, adding that: ``I would like your 
comments on the contract extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry DiNardo testified that he neither participated in the  
drafting nor suggested any changes to the contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not unreasonable to infer that the parties had not  
completely negotiated the details of the contract extension; the 
original contract did not expire for another year,'' Appeals Court 
Judge John Gibson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot say that Larry DiNardo's failure to object by Dec.  
12, 1994, constitutes an acceptance of the addendum.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Changes Boeing Jet Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines announced today it has scrapped  
an order for four Boeing 777 jets, which were to be delivered early 
next year, because its pilots have yet to agree on a labor contract 
for flying the new planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Delta has asked Boeing to deliver four 767-300ER  
aircraft. The smaller plane seats 197 passengers, compared with 273 
in Delta's configuration of the 777. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta had ordered a total of 14 Boeing 777s for use on its  
international routes. It has already taken delivery on the first 
two, which are to be put into service May 1. The order scrapped 
Thursday was for four more to be delivered between December and 
next April. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline spokesman Bill Berry said Delta and the Air Line Pilots  
Association are far apart in their negotiations on a contract that 
would cover pay and work rules for pilots flying the 777. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta has offered its pilots an ``industry-leading'' pay package  
for the 777, but the union's current offer is 47 percent higher 
than that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that there was a likelihood our pilots would not be  
flying these airplanes when they were delivered, and we took the 
action to defer them indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ALPA spokeswoman Karen McGuffey said the union was surprised by  
Delta's decision because the negotiations are still at an early 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them to represent this as a consequence of pilot  
negotiations ... in our opinion is a confrontational move and does 
not really reflect the realities of the negotiating process,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if an agreement would have been likely before the 777s  
arrived, she said, ``We are committed to reaching a fair 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berry said he's not sure whether future deliveries of 777s might  
be affected if the negotiations drag on. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned about the 777 program overall,'' he said.  
``But at the moment all we've done is indefinitely deferred four 
orders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two planes that will begin flying May 1 can be operated for  
six months under the current pilot contract.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen: US Casualties Could Be High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, signaling that the  
NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia could stretch into summer, said 
today the prospect for American casualties was ``very real and 
high.'' U.S. officials expressed regret for an accidental NATO 
attack on a refugee convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do try to reduce the risks to innocent human beings,''  
Defense Secretary William Cohen said, testifying before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen sought to explain the ``extraordinary circumstances''  
surrounding Wednesday's incident in Kosovo, saying the pilot was 
under anti-aircraft artillery fire and had to make a split-second 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go to extraordinary lengths to protect civilians,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, when asked if the campaign could continue for 
``many, many, many weeks or even months,'' said yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to be quick or easy or neat,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said NATO has been very fortunate in losing only one  
plane, the downing of an F-117A stealth fighter March 27. The pilot 
was rescued. Three U.S. soldiers also were captured near the 
Macedonian-Yugoslav border and remain in Serb custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the prospect for casualties remains very real and  
high,'' Shelton said, echoing Cohen's warning there's a probability 
of U.S. deaths. ``There is no such thing as a risk-free military 
operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen and Shelton said using ground troops is not under  
consideration and they urged lawmakers to give the air campaign, 
which began March 24, more time to work to stop Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic's fight against ethnic Albanians in the Serbian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason that we have gone forward as we have with an air  
campaign is that there was not a consensus in the NATO alliance to 
do anything but this,'' Cohen said. ``This really is a battle of 
freedom over fear. ... It's a battle of democracy over 
dictatorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, testifying before a House  
Appropriations subcommittee, said the flood of refugees and their 
brutal treatment have steeled NATO's determination against 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're prepared to inflict such damage on his military that he  
either accepts the outcome we seek, or the balance of power in 
Kosovo will shift against him at a time when his actions, far from 
destroying his opposition, are galvanizing its strength and 
determination,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the foreign operations subcommittee expressed concern  
that the United States is spreading its resources too thin. Rep. 
C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the Appropriations Committee, 
told Albright that resources being taken from the Korean region -- 
including an aircraft carrier, U2 surveillance planes and F15 
fighter jets -- and moved to the Balkans were increasing U.S. 
vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about North Korea,'' he said. Young said that the $4  
billion figure on an emergency supplemental bill to pay for Kosovo 
that that administration is suggesting ``would be totally 
inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do more than just replace the bullets and the  
missiles,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is putting together an emergency  
budget request to pay the U.S. share of NATO operations. White 
House budget chief Jacob Lew met for nearly an hour Wednesday with 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said U.S. officials 
were discussing something in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. 
He said the administration wants to pay for the entire Balkans 
campaign, including refugees, using part of the expected $111 
billion federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's not what we'll get our members to go along  
with,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans seem eager to pay for military costs of the  
crisis with the surplus while finding budget cuts to pay for the 
rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said today he had asked  
President Clinton to explain to the American people the long- and 
short-term goals in Kosovo and to provide a ``realistic appraisal 
of what this is going to cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the House would debate the matter once he receives an  
emergency funding request from the administration. ``I plan to have 
an open debate on that,'' he said. ``That's where the Congress has 
its just place in this scenario'' since it controls the 
government's purse strings, Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO air campaign is in its fourth week.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led Gulf War in 1991 lasted only six weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	In the latest incident of NATO-caused civilian casualties, NATO  
officials said today that a preliminary investigation shows an 
allied aircraft ``mistakenly'' dropped a bomb on a vehicle in a 
convoy of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo on Wednesday. NATO 
aircraft had been targeting a military convoy, but also apparently 
struck at a nearby mixed military-civilian convoy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serb police or military vehicles may have been in or around  
the (refugee) convoy,'' NATO said in a statement from Brussels, 
Belgium. ``NATO regrets any harm to innocent civilians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials had said Wednesday that NATO had struck a  
tractor in the refugee convoy, killing 64 people and wounding 20. 
But officials at NATO and the Pentagon initially denied the report 
and suggested the Serbs had attacked refugees in retaliation for 
the NATO airstrike. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, U.N. officials said 600 women and children refugees  
reported being attacked by Serb aircraft as they fled from Prizen, 
Kosovo, toward Albania, according to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move to bolster NATO forces, Apache attack helicopters  
began arriving in Albania on Wednesday and the full contingent of 
24 was expected by today or Friday. NATO and President Clinton need 
to give final approval for the gunships to be used in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 80 fresh U.S. warplanes also were arriving today in  
Europe to join NATO airstrikes, including 24 F-16 jet-fighters, 
four low-flying A-10 attack airplanes, six Marine EA-6B radar 
jammers to interfere with Serb air defenses, 38 refueling tankers 
and half a dozen cargo planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said Serbs have fired dozens of surface-to-air  
missiles at allied planes in the past two days in the biggest 
demonstration yet of anti-aircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the buildup, the Clinton administration is preparing  
within days to call up at least several thousand military 
reservists and approve deploying 300 more warplanes to join NATO 
airstrikes. That would bring the total air power to 1,000 aircraft 
-- two-thirds of them American.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Cop Accused of Running Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A police officer charged with running a drug ring  
has been accused by a drug dealer of giving guns and bags of 
ammunition to one gang so it could wage war on another. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation was in a plea agreement between federal  
prosecutors and Joseph DeLeon, 32, one of three men who pleaded 
guilty Thursday to being part of a ring that put more than 220 
pounds of crack cocaine on the streets of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The accused officer, gang-crimes investigator Joseph  
Miedzianowski, has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to 
possess and distribute cocaine. He has not been charged with 
weapons violations. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorney denied the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who are narcotics peddlers, dope dealers, and  
they know that their only way out so they can see the light of day 
again is to make up stories about Joe Miedzianowski,'' Phillip 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors have charged that Miedzianowski, 46, took  
part in the drug trade he was hired to fight, distributing cocaine, 
supplying guns, taking protection money and identifying undercover 
officers to gang members. 
</P>
<P>
	They also claim he supplied guns for DeLeon's Imperial  
Gangsters, who were engaged in gang warfare with their rivals the 
Spanish Cobras. 
</P>
<P>
	The guns allegedly were stolen from the Cook County sheriff's  
shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLeon and the three others who pleaded guilty -- Francisco  
Figueroa, 29, and David Ruiz, 28, and Yolanda Navarro, 26 -- are 
expected to be government witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Nixes Shipbuilding Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon sank a proposed merger between  
two shipbuilders, saying it wanted to preserve competition in the 
rapidly consolidating defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The $2 billion deal between defense contractors General Dynamics  
Corp. and Newport News Shipbuilding would have created a single 
shipbuilder for the Navy's largest and most expensive ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost savings to the Navy would not justify that loss of  
competition, Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a statement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the merger would collapse the two existing companies  
into a single entity, there would be a reduction in the likelihood 
of future competition,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, which is based in Falls Church, Va., made an  
unsolicited bid for Newport News in February. The deal required 
Pentagon review and also was subject to a review by the Justice 
Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, General Dynamics would have dominated the $7  
billion annual market for Navy ships, including $4 billion aircraft 
carriers and submarines costing roughly half that. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Pentagon review concerned calculating possible cost  
savings, which Cohen called considerable, from having shipbuilding 
engineering, research and development talent concentrated in one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohen said planned improvements at Newport News' Virginia  
shipyards could save nearly as much money as the merger offered, 
without a loss in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with Newport News announced at the same time  
Wednesday, the shipyard will renegotiate some Navy contracts and 
agree to a lower price, but will keep profits reaped from 
improvements in efficiency over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief  
executive officer, called the Pentagon's merger decision 
``disappointing'' and said the firm had withdrawn its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Dynamics believes that its proposed acquisition of  
Newport News Shipbuilding would have meant significant savings for 
the U.S. Navy, enhanced value for the shareholders of both 
companies, and still preserved jobs,'' Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William P.  
Fricks said Pentagon opposition meant the company would proceed 
with a previously planned buyout of another rival shipyard, 
Avondale Industries of New Orleans. He said the proposed tranaction 
had received antitrust clearance from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics employs 31,000 people and had 1998 earnings of  
$364 million on sales of nearly $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the parent firm for Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., which  
builds nuclear submarines, and Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine, 
which builds the Aegis destroyer. General Dynamics also builds the 
Abrams tank, high-speed Gatling guns for aircraft and helicopters, 
advanced fiber-optics products, and high-speed processors for 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News employs 18,000 people and earned $66 million last  
year on sales of $1.86 billion. It is the Navy's sole supplier for 
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

<HEADLINE>  Income Tax Deadline Is Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the millions of Americans rushing to meet  
tonight's income tax deadline, consider this: Many middle-class 
people are actually paying slightly less in federal taxes than they 
did in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, taxpayers with the  
median family income -- about $39,000 in 1999 -- will pay 18.9 
percent of their income in all federal taxes this year. That 
compares to 19.7 percent four years ago, and is about $400 less. 
</P>
<P>
	That might provide some small comfort as people rush to one of  
the hundreds of larger post offices that will stay open late, many 
until midnight local time, to handle the crush of up to 40 million 
state and federal tax returns to be dispatched today. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was depressing news as well. The Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, said today ``Tax Freedom Day'' would 
be May 11, a day later than last year. The foundation calculates it 
would take an average worker until that date to earn enough to pay 
his or her share of all federal, state and local individual and 
corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A reminder: If you can't finish in time, file for an extension  
using Form 4868 and pay the Internal Revenue Service as much of 
your estimated bill as possible to avoid interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also pay by MasterCard, American Express or Discover  
card by calling 1-888-2PAYTAX -- for a 2.5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expects to receive 126 million individual income tax  
returns this year, with total income taxes projected at $828.6 
billion. That's just under half the $1.7 trillion in overall 
federal tax collections used to pay for everything from cruise 
missiles to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Working people pay more in U.S. taxes than more than 40,000  
foreign-controlled corporations operating in this country. The 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
reported Wednesday that tax loopholes allowed a majority of 
foreign-based companies to escape any taxes in 1995 -- a loss to the 
government estimated at $35 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of citizenship here, but these corporations are  
getting by in many cases with a free ride,'' said Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., who released the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mainly because of new child and education credits,  
Americans are enjoying much larger refunds -- $1,563 on average, 15 
percent above last year. And they've used computers to 
electronically file 21.1 million returns, almost 24 percent more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury is still out on whether the much-publicized IRS  
reform law is making the agency treat taxpayers better. Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, whose hearings last year 
helped spark the reforms, said he believes only about 20 percent of 
all IRS employees support the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, a bureaucracy will say, 'We'll just wait it out,'''  
said Roth, R-Del. ``We're talking about changing attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, however, told the Finance  
Committee on Wednesday that key changes include a new 
service-oriented mission statement, ways to rate employees that 
don't include enforcement quotas and a reorganization to create 
four separate operations aimed at individual taxpayers, small 
businesses, large corporations and tax-exempt entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little doubt that real change is occurring,''  
said Rossotti, who has been in his position 17 months. ``We have 
only just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who cannot pay, the IRS has relaxed its  
``offer-in-compromise'' program to let more taxpayers negotiate a 
lower settlement of their tax bills. Rossotti promised the new 
rules would prevent a duplication of last year's 80,000 rejections 
out of 105,000 offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Installment agreements are also easier to get. In almost all  
cases, the IRS will automatically accept a request for an 
installment plan -- attach Form 9465 to your return to request one -- 
as long as the amount owed is $25,000 or less and the taxpayer 
agrees to pay within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more people are depending on professional tax preparers  
to do their taxes -- an estimated 61 million returns this year. One 
big reason is the tax code's complexity, which Congress increased 
the past two years with more than 1,200 tax law changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether taxpayers will have to deal with more  
changes next year. Congressional Republicans are pushing through 
budget blueprints that call for some $800 billion in tax relief 
over the next decade, but there is very little money for tax cuts 
in fiscal 2000 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet anti-tax sentiment continues to run high on Capitol Hill.  
Coinciding with the tax deadline, the House today was planning to 
debate for the fifth year in a row a proposed constitutional 
amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to pass most tax 
increases. The measure has no chance of passing.

<HEADLINE>  Income Tax Deadline Is Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the millions of Americans rushing to meet  
tonight's income tax deadline, consider this: Many middle-class 
people are actually paying slightly less in federal taxes than they 
did in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, taxpayers with the  
median family income -- about $39,000 in 1999 -- will pay 18.9 
percent of their income in all federal taxes this year. That 
compares to 19.7 percent four years ago, and is about $400 less. 
</P>
<P>
	That might provide some small comfort as people rush to one of  
the hundreds of larger post offices that will stay open late, many 
until midnight local time, to handle the crush of up to 40 million 
state and federal tax returns to be dispatched today. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was depressing news as well. The Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, said today ``Tax Freedom Day'' would 
be May 11, a day later than last year. The foundation calculates it 
would take an average worker until that date to earn enough to pay 
his or her share of all federal, state and local individual and 
corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A reminder: If you can't finish in time, file for an extension  
using Form 4868 and pay the Internal Revenue Service as much of 
your estimated bill as possible to avoid interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also pay by MasterCard, American Express or Discover  
card by calling 1-888-2PAYTAX -- for a 2.5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expects to receive 126 million individual income tax  
returns this year, with total income taxes projected at $828.6 
billion. That's just under half the $1.7 trillion in overall 
federal tax collections used to pay for everything from cruise 
missiles to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Working people pay more in U.S. taxes than more than 40,000  
foreign-controlled corporations operating in this country. The 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
reported Wednesday that tax loopholes allowed a majority of 
foreign-based companies to escape any taxes in 1995 -- a loss to the 
government estimated at $35 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of citizenship here, but these corporations are  
getting by in many cases with a free ride,'' said Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., who released the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mainly because of new child and education credits,  
Americans are enjoying much larger refunds -- $1,563 on average, 15 
percent above last year. And they've used computers to 
electronically file 21.1 million returns, almost 24 percent more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury is still out on whether the much-publicized IRS  
reform law is making the agency treat taxpayers better. Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, whose hearings last year 
helped spark the reforms, said he believes only about 20 percent of

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Recchi To Undergo Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers forward Mark Recchi,  
given a scare by his second injury in three weeks, will undergo 
post-concussion tests Friday to determine when he can return to the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi, acquired from Montreal on March 10 to bolster the  
Flyers' offense for the playoffs, is out for at least the two 
remaining regular-season games. His status for the playoffs depends 
on the result of the tests and exams by neurosurgeons in Pittsburgh 
scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safest thing I can tell you is, he's certainly not going  
to play in the two remaining games,'' Flyers team doctor Jeff 
Hartzell said Thursday. ``The question is, what about the first 
round of the playoffs? I still can't give an answer to that 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi suffered his second concussion in three weeks, and third  
of his career, when he was checked into the glass in a 2-2 tie with 
Buffalo Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He also suffered a concussion March 22 when he missed a check  
and went head first into the glass at Toronto. Recchi sat out for 
three games, came back and experienced some post-concussion 
symptoms after an April 1 game against Nashville, the same game in 
which team captain and leading scorer Eric Lindros suffered a 
season-ending collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi was hospitalized for one night in Nashville after  
complaining of nausea and dizziness and was sidelined for two more 
games before returning to the lineup last Thursday against 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he's complained of headaches and neck soreness, but  
nothing like the pain he felt in Nashville. Tests will determine 
whether his neurological readings have strayed from the baseline 
measurements many athletes receive to guard against post-concussion 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great physically,'' said Recchi, who can work out but  
not participate in contact drills. ``Obviously, I'm very frustrated 
and disappointed. I really want to help this team right now, and 
it's kind of up in the air with what's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi still doesn't believe he came back too soon after the  
first concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real easy to say now,'' Recchi said. ``I don't believe I  
did. I felt good. I felt 100 percent, and it's just unfortunate. 
There's always going to be skeptics. I felt good enough to play, 
and I wanted to help. That's the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros is out for at least the first round of the playoffs  
while recovering from a collapsed right lung. Lindros was released 
from the hospital Monday, four days after having blood clots 
surgically removed from his chest cavity.

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Third-quarter earnings for Sun  
Microsystems Inc., the creator of the popular Java programming 
language, rose 26 percent to $291 million, narrowly beating Wall 
Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding acquisition-related charges, including its purchase of  
storage-server maker Maxstrat Corp., Sun earned 71 cents a share. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call had estimated 70 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall net income, including the charges, for the three months  
ended March 28 was $261 million, or 63 cents a share, on record 
revenue of $2.9 billion. That compared to earnings of $232 million, 
or 59 cents a share, on revenue of $2.4 billion in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released after the close of financial markets  
Thursday. Shares of Sun fell $2.12 1/2 to close at $60.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said the outlook for coming months was  
optimistic. They predicted particularly strong corporate demand for 
Sun's workgroup computers and high-end servers, and praised the 
company's joint venture with America Online Inc. to offer one-stop 
shopping to businesses and consumers for every facet of online 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun continues to set the agenda, first redefining the  
workstation, then the server and now the world of e-commerce,'' CEO 
Scott McNealy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were not adjusted to reflect Sun's recent  
two-for-one stock split, paid on April 8.

<HEADLINE> Tardy Rodman Misses Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This time, Dennis Rodman couldn't find his  
socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, whose seven-week career with the Los Angeles Lakers has  
been filled with erratic behavior, missed another practice Thursday 
after a late arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	He showed up several minutes late at Los Angeles Southwest  
College, and was unprepared to practice once he did appear, so 
coach Kurt Rambis sent him home. 
</P>
<P>
	This came in the wake of Tuesday night's disastrous 113-86 loss  
at Portland, a game in which Rodman sat out the second half, 
claiming his left elbow was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
	Team policy for injured players is they show up an hour before  
practice to receive treatment. Obviously, Rodman didn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers had been given Wednesday off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked him what was going on, he said he was looking for  
socks and shoes, and I told him practice was 11 (a.m.) and then I 
said, `Why don't you just go home,' '' Rambis told reporters after 
practice. ``Any player being late at any time was not how I handled 
Dennis. I don't think anybody handles it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made exceptions in special cases to accommodate him, but in  
my mind, the accommodation period is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who signed with the Lakers on Feb. 23 and played his  
first game with them three days later, has told the coaching staff 
four times in his 23 games with the team he was unable to answer 
their request to return to a game. 
</P>
<P>
	And that doesn't include the four games he missed last month  
when he left the team for eight days, claiming he needed time off 
to deal with personal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last week, Rodman's publicist announced the seven-time NBA  
rebounding champion and actress wife Carmen Electra had mutually 
agreed to end their five-month marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's publicist, Matt Labov, would not comment on Thursday's  
matter, nor would Lakers' management. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who return to action Saturday night at Utah, won  
their first 11 games with Rodman in uniform, but are 6-6 since that 
time with him playing. They are 8-9 without him. He is averaging 
11.2 rebounds in 28.6 minutes of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis' reaction to Rodman's sitting out the second half Tuesday  
night was, ``He said his elbow was bothering him, and I'll take it 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis had removed Rodman from the game with 2:31 left before  
halftime. Rodman had four rebounds in 13 minutes of the Lakers' 
most one-sided loss of the season, which dropped them to 25-15 with 
10 games left in the abbreviated campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to return to last Friday night's 96-89 victory over  
Minnesota in the fourth quarter, Rodman declined, according to 
Rambis, saying his muscles had stiffened up. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 next month, was over an hour late to  
practice the next day.

<HEADLINE>  Browns Still Not Saying Who's No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Everyone seems to know what the Browns are  
going to do with their No. 1 pick. Everyone, that is, but the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Months of speculation, rumors and analysis on this year's NFL  
draft has been reduced to hours, and it won't be long before NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue officially puts Cleveland ``on the 
clock'' for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So, will the Browns use the overall No. 1 on Tim Couch? Akili  
Smith? Or Ricky Williams? Will they trade it and then trade it 
again? Can they punt? 
</P>
<P>
	Confused? Who isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm really in the dark,'' Smith, Oregon's  
rifle-armed quarterback said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really heard anything,'' said Couch, who will appear  
Thursday night on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticks down toward Saturday's draft, the Browns  
insist they still haven't decided what they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have them taking Couch with the first selection as long  
as a contract can be worked out with his agent, Tom Condon of 
Cleveland-based IMG, before Saturday. But the Browns maintain they 
haven't anointed the Kentucky quarterback the chosen one yet, and 
that it's still a three-man race for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually in continuing negotiations with agents for all  
three of the picks under consideration,'' Browns team spokesman 
Alex Martins said Thursday. ``The organization has not made a final 
determination as of this point as to which player we will select on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiating process will continue over the course of the  
next few days, and we don't anticipate making a decision on the 
pick until Saturday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same thing the Browns said last month, and again last  
week. So either they're still unsure of who to take or they're 
playing a mean game of poker, savoring every moment of holding an 
unbeatable hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Whomever the Browns take first will be a rich man. Condon is  
reportedly seeking a seven-year, $44 million deal plus a $12 
million signing bonus. Last year, the Indianapolis Colts gave the 
top pick, quarterback Peyton Manning, a six-year, $48 million 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Browns' No. 1 derby comes down to the wire, it appears to  
have become a two-man duel between Couch and Smith. Williams has 
apparently dropped from consideration and will probably be taken by 
Indianapolis with the No. 4 pick after the Colts traded running 
back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and Smith appear together on the cover of this week's  
Sports Illustrated with both wearing Browns No. 99 jerseys -- Couch 
in brown, Smith in white. They're sitting side-by-side as ``Big 
Dawg'', the leader of Cleveland's Dawg Pound stands behind them 
holding a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, director of football operations  
Dwight Clark and other Cleveland front office personnel have spent 
the week behind closed doors dissecting game films, scouting 
profiles and background checks on the pair of passers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a quarterback guru, is thought to favor the more mobile,  
more mature Smith over Couch, who was put through a rigorous, 
90-minute second workout by the Browns in Lexington, Ky., last 
weekend. Palmer was reportedly displeased with Couch's initial 
workout and wanted to see how Couch responded to some hands-on 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who drew wide criticism last year while in San Francisco  
for taking QB Jim Druckenmiller over Jake Plummer, has been a Couch 
proponent and thinks the 21-year-old's ``upside'' may be greater 
than Smith, who is 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever differences may exist, team president Carmen Policy  
promises the Browns will be of ``like mind'' when draft day 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he and Clark have been going over draft day  
scenarios for weeks and feels a difference in opinion is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwight and I have been on the same page since I started with  
the Cleveland Browns,'' he said. ``Every time I've started off in a 
different direction we've come back to the same thing.''

	``I was very pleased with Mo's progress and the prognosis is  
very favorable,'' said Yocum, the Angels' medical director. ``Mo 
has done a lot of rehab work since suffering the injury.

	Vaughn, who signed an $80 million, six-year free agent contract

<P>
	He was placed on the 15-day DL on April 9, just the second time  
on the injured list in his nine-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Yocum examined center fielder Jim Edmonds, who is  
on the DL with a sore right shoulder. There was no indication of 
when he might rejoin the team.

<HEADLINE> Court May Hear Immigration Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis asked a federal  
appeals court Thursday to mediate a dispute over a ballot measure -- 
bottled up in court for five years -- that seeks to cut off 
schooling to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Approved by 59 percent of voters in 1994, Proposition 187 has  
not been implemented. A federal court found the measure 
unconstitutional last year, but then-Gov. Pete Wilson appealed that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, a Democrat who opposes Prop 187, could have thwarted the  
initiative by refusing to pursue Wilson's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Davis asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal's  
mediation panel to resolve the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a governor, not a judge. I have taken an oath to enforce  
all the laws of our state and our nation, regardless of my personal 
views on those laws,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative would exclude illegal immigrants from public  
schools and eliminate non-emergency health and welfare services for 
which they remain eligible. It also would require public agencies 
and employees to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether to continue the appeal has developed  
into the most significant political quandary of the early months of 
Davis' administration. 
</P>
<P>
	He was faced with the dilemma of pursing the appeal and angering  
Hispanics and other opponents to the proposition, or letting the 
appeal drop and anger those who voted in favor of the measure.

<HEADLINE> USDA Pricing Overhaul Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a month after Agriculture Secretary  
Dan Glickman released his plan to overhaul the federal milk pricing 
system, some members of Congress have introduced legislation to 
overturn the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's recommended changes for the prices of fluid milk  
would hurt dairy farmers and consumers, lawmakers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary's action defies common sense,'' said Rep. John  
McHugh, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Bob Etheridge, D-N.C.: ``A reform plan for dairy  
pricing that puts farmers out of business and does not benefit 
consumers is a complete failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A department spokesman, Andy Solomon, responded: ``During the  
debate over the farm bill, Congress chose not to address this issue 
and left the massive task of reform to Secretary Glickman. Without 
hesitation, we've really worked aggressively to bring about that 
reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers defended their decision to move forward with a bill  
even though Glickman's proposal must win approval from dairy 
farmers before it could take effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that would be irresponsible of this Congress, to say  
we're going to see what farmers are going to do,'' McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 members of Congress are supporting the bill. The  
National Milk Producers Federation, which represents dairy farmers, 
also supports changing Glickman's plan. The International Dairy 
Foods Association, which represents processors, initially had 
expressed reservations with Glickman's proposal but said Thursday 
the plan was ``a much-needed step towards reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are the nation's milk pricing regions, which are  
divided into what are called milk marketing orders. The orders set 
the price that processors pay dairy farmers, much like a minimum 
wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law ordered Glickman to consolidate the nation's  
current 31 orders. Glickman's proposal reduces those regions to 11 
but it also changes some of the formulas by which dairy farmers are 
paid -- the main point of contention for the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents to the USDA plan say it would lower the minimum price  
received by dairy farmers, potentially costing them nearly $200 
million a year, according to the National Milk Producers 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they want to see Glickman use an option that was part  
of his draft proposal released last year and supported by many 
lawmakers. That version is closer to the price levels now in place, 
so it would not hurt producers, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make it more market-oriented without forgetting that  
both consumers and farmers benefit from it,'' said Jerry Kozak, 
chief executive officer of the milk producers group. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Garrison, executive director of the South East Dairy  
Farmer Association, said many southeastern states already have a 
shortage of dairy farmers and more could leave the business if 
revenues were projected to drop. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ultimately could make milk higher for consumers because  
it costs more to bring milk in,'' Garrison said.

<HEADLINE> Man Pleads Guilty to Clinton Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A man who planted two pipe bombs at an  
airport prior to a visit by President Clinton pleaded guilty 
Thursday to threatening to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffery Loring Pickering, 50, pleaded guilty to five federal  
charges, one of which carries a mandatory 10-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering admitted planting the pipe bombs June 12, 1998, one  
day before Clinton arrived to meet with families of victims from a 
fatal high school shooting in nearby Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs were found in a culvert behind the Oregon Air and  
Space Museum adjacent to the Eugene Airport. A police bomb squad 
detonated the explosives and the president's visit was not 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Pickering also admitted to threatening Clinton by making  
telephone calls saying the president would be shot or blown up by 
explosives planted along his motorcade route.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Starts Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The state of Michigan reversed its policy  
allowing the force-feeding of prisoners on the same day Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian went to prison vowing to begin a hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The assisted-suicide advocate, sentenced Tuesday to 10 to 25  
years in prison, said he would begin a hunger strike immediately, 
The Oakland Press reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	State prison officials said they reversed their policy on  
force-feeding the same day the 70-year-old retired pathologist was 
sentenced. They denied the change had anything to do with 
Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	The reversal came after state lawyers realized the previous  
policy requiring force-feeding of an inmate was contrary to a 1996 
state court order that banned a prison from feeding a man against 
his will. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth questioned the timing of the  
policy change. ``Isn't that assisted suicide?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known Wednesday whether Kevorkian began the hunger  
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, if a prisoner refuses food or liquids for  
72 hours, prison officials present a waiver to sign, stating that 
the inmate knows refusing nourishment will lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms that they're fully aware of what they are doing  
and they are doing it voluntarily,'' said Michigan Department of 
Corrections spokesman Matt Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Kevorkian was taken Wednesday to the Oaks  
Correctional Facility in Eastlake for orientation. He will be 
evaluated for the next few weeks before officials decide where he 
will serve his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder for injecting  
Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal dose of chemicals in September at 
Youk's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death of the Lou Gehrig's 
patient to ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to state prison rules, Kevorkian will be eligible for  
parole in about eight years.

	3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two people were killed and four others  
were shot today by a gunman who entered the Mormon church's Family 
History Library and began firing before being fatally wounded by 
police. Police SWAT teams were combing the building to determine 
whether another gunman was inside the building more than two hours 
after the shooting began. Thirty people remained on the second 
floor and it was feared they were being held by a second gunman. 
But they later told police by telephone they had locked themselves 
in a room, said Salt Lake police Lt. Phil Kirk. Mayor Deedee 
Corradini told reporters that a library security guard and a female 
patron had died of their wounds and the unidentified suspect had 
also died.

	Clinton Defends NATO Air Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton defended NATO air raids  
in defense of Kosovo today, telling America's newspaper editors the 
bombing stems from ``a meticulously planned and long premeditated 
attack on an entire people,'' the ethnic Albanians driven from the 
province by the Serbs. ``We and our NATO allies are in Kosovo today 
because we want to stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing,'' 
Clinton told the American Society of Newspaper Editors.

	Cohen: Prospect of Casualties High

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signaling that the NATO air campaign in  
Yugoslavia could stretch into summer, the Clinton administration 
said today the prospect for American casualties is ``very real and 
high,'' and U.S. officials expressed regret for an accidental NATO 
attack on a refugee convoy. ``We do try to reduce the risks to 
innocent human beings,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said. 
Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee to give the air 
campaign more time to work.

	Congress Approves Final 2000 Budget

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With unusual speed, Congress approved a final  
$1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 today that Republicans hope 
will sharpen their image as tax cutters and as a party that has 
moved beyond President Clinton's impeachment. The Senate approved 
the GOP-written plan today by a 54-44 vote that was along party 
lines. The House passed the package yesterday by 220-208 in another 
sharply partisan vote. The measure maps a 10-year tax cut of at 
least $778 billion. Passage today marks only the second time 
Congress has completed the measure on time since setting the April 
15 deadline in 1987.

	Evidence of New Solar System Found  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The first evidence of the existence of  
another solar system somewhat like our own was reported today. The 
discovery indicates that the Milky Way, which contains about 200 
billion stars, probably has numerous planetary systems, San 
Francisco State University researchers said. Astronomers knew one 
planet was circulating around Upsilon Andromedae, 44 light years 
from Earth. But after studying 107 stars for 11 years at the Lick 
Observatory near San Jose, scientists said evidence of two 
additional planets has been spotted. ``It implies that planets can 
form more easily than we ever imagined,'' said researcher Debra 
Fischer.

<P>
	House Impeachment Probe Cost $1.2M  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House paid its top impeachment  
investigators as much as $20,000 a month, part of the $1.2 
million-plus price tag for the five-month congressional proceedings 
that ended with President Clinton's acquittal, expense records 
show. In addition, chief Republican investigator David Schippers 
and Democratic counsel Abbe Lowell were given special consultant 
status that allowed them to bypass congressional restrictions. 
While Democrats have attacked the entire inquiry as an unnecessary 
expense, committee chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Schippers and 
Lowell were worth the money.

Dale Hoke at his Raleigh, N.C., home on charges of securities fraud

	TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- A Mexican university has canceled a U.S.  
professor's photo exhibit critical of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and working conditions in Tijuana factories. 
</P>
<P>
	The Autonomous University of Baja California, in the border city  
of Tijuana, abruptly called off the exhibit April 8 after receiving 
complaints from local factory owners about leaflets advertising the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Lonidier, a professor in the visual arts department at the  
University of California, San Diego, distributed the leaflets, said 
Rene Andrade Peterson, the school's vice rector. 
</P>
<P>
	``What bothers us is that he's using the university for this,''  
Andrade said. ``We, as a university, cannot be for or against the 
free trade agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lonidier said his photos are intended to provoke discussion  
about NAFTA -- the 1994 agreement that created a free-trade zone 
among the United States, Mexico and Canada -- and conditions in 
export-assembly factories known as maquiladoras. 
</P>

	Factory conditions are a sensitive issue in Tijuana, which has  
about 600 maquiladoras, more than any other city in Mexico.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A moderate explosion shook the crater of the

	The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters said the  
eruption could cause a light fall of ash northeast of the 
17,925-foot volcano, which is about 40 miles southeast of Mexico 
City.

	TUCUMAN, Argentina (AP) -- Researchers exploring a volcanic

believed to be hundreds of years old, an archeologist said

<P>
	The skeletal body of an infant, apparently 4 to 6 months old,  
was virtually intact and swaddled in brittle leather, said Dr. 
Carlos Aschero, an archeologist at the University of Tucuman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his staff was conducting tests to determine the baby's  
sex and date the remains. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby was found buried in a fetal position under four feet of  
volcanic rock, the archeologist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aschero said the remains were discovered in December, but were  
widely publicized only after other recent discoveries. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Tax-Mania Sweeps Post Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As much as Americans despise paying taxes,  
Thursday brought music and back rubs to the nation's post offices, 
along with a spirit of camaraderie among last-minute filers jammed 
into lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got it done. I've just got to figure out where to send the  
money that I owe,'' said 21-year-old Steve MacIntyre as he rooted 
through a mountain of forms at Boston's main post office. 
</P>
<P>
	His paperwork was creased and grubby from being in the back  
pocket of his jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aargh! No envelopes!'' he shouted, pounding the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	MacIntyre's was just one of 126 million tax returns the Internal  
Revenue Service expected to receive this year. The agency said it 
had already received more than half by late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the procrastinators, the forgetful and the flummoxed who  
took in the festive atmosphere at the nation's mailrooms on the 
final day of filing. Some post offices were open as late as 
midnight, with parties until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	A piano player was set to play in Boston's main post office  
Thursday. Outside, an actress dressed as Mother Nature was hired by 
a vitamin company to hand out free packets of kava root, which is 
supposed to ease stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A party at the Springfield post office included four bands and  
food donated from eight restaurants. Taxpayers also had a chance to 
get even with IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two dunk tanks this year, not just one,'' boasted  
Postmaster Flossie Paluszec. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 miles away, a Seattle radio station sent an anti-tax  
message by re-enacting the Boston Tea Party on an old sailing ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Other post offices around the country tried to rub out the  
anxiety of tax filing with free back and neck massages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, fans going to Thursday night's Los Angeles  
Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks game could bring their tax returns out 
to the park where a mobile post office was being set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspiring actors and actresses might have wanted to pay their  
taxes in Newport Beach, Calif. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
was capitalizing on the crowds at the post office by conducting 
screen tests for its ``Got Milk'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will give you a milk mustache and a screen test,'' said  
postal spokesman David Mazer. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't want to deal with stamps and envelopes,  
electronic filing was increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Don Roberts said 17 percent more people paid their  
taxes either online or by telephone this year than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the postal service hadn't noticed its business declining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same number that we see every year,'' said Bob  
Cannon, a Massachusetts postal service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Springfield, Va., the certified public accountants of  
Crutchley, Marginot &AMP; Tosi P.C. closed the office early. Like 
accountants around the country, they planned to celebrate an end to 
80-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut down at noon, we start our party at 2 p.m. and it goes  
through the night,'' said accountant Mary Ann Dougherty.

board. Where do you find final vindication or guaranteed health? 
</P>
<P>
	The team gets its last chance Saturday to make a big score out  
of the six compensatory picks it received for losing coach Bill 
Parcells and free-agent running back Curtis Martin to the New York 
Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure? Not for Bobby Grier, the team's vice president of  
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel any pressure at all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	As compensation for letting Parcells become coach of the Jets,  
the Patriots received picks in the third and fourth rounds in 1997, 
second round in 1998 and first round this season. So far, the picks 
yielded running back Sedrick Shaw, who has played sparingly, and 
two spot starters -- tackle Damon Denson and wide receiver Tony 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	When Martin departed before last season, the Patriots received  
two picks -- a first-rounder (running back Robert Edwards) and 
third-rounder (defensive end Greg Spires, who plays in pass rushing 
situations). 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards had a solid season as the NFL's second-leading rookie  
rusher with 1,115 yards. But he had a shattering offseason, 
suffering a career-threatening knee injury in a beach football game 
that is just the latest in a series of physical blows to the heart 
of the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
	They started last season with a 4-1 record but, as the injuries  
mounted, they went 5-6 in their last nine games and got into the 
playoffs as a wild card, losing in the first round at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, they had seven players on injured reserve,  
including wide receiver Terry Glenn and linebacker Ted Johnson. 
Quarterback Drew Bledsoe missed the last three games, including the 
playoffs, with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
	With Edwards gone at least for next season, the Patriots were  
trying to trade with Washington for the fifth pick in the draft to 
take another running back in the first round -- Williams of Texas 
or, more likely, James of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luck has quite a bit to play with it,'' Grier said. ``We never  
thought we'd be in this situation, looking for a running back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have Williams and James rated close together and  
there's a dropoff to the next best running back. That's one reason 
the team was willing to package several picks this year, and 
perhaps even one next year, to have a chance to draft one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really two unique, outstanding players that you don't  
get a chance to get that often,'' coach Pete Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the ability to pull (the trade) off if it's not just  
ridiculous'' in terms of what Washington wants, Grier said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots have 11 picks in the seven rounds of the two-day  
draft, including their own first-rounder, the 20th overall, and the 
Jets' choice, the 28th. If they keep them, they could choose Boston 
College center Woody because last year's center, Dave Wohlabaugh, 
left for Cleveland as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of how it goes, we'll have good picks in the first  
round,'' Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first-round picks haven't been all that good in Carroll's  
two drafts with the team. In 1997, they took cornerback Chris 
Canty, who was pulled from the starting lineup after the ninth game 
last year. And last year they chose Edwards and Tebucky Jones, who 
struggled with the transition from safety to cornerback, but has 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we'll get two good players if we remain where we  
are,'' Grier said. ``This is an unusual draft, because the 
quarterbacks are going to really make an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first three choices could be quarterbacks: Kentucky's Tim  
Couch, Oregon's Akili Smith and Syracuse's Donovan McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	That's one position New England doesn't need. Bledsoe was the  
first pick of the entire 1993 draft, starting a string of four 
years of successful opening-round choices. The Patriots took 
defensive end Willie McGinest in 1994, cornerback Ty Law in 1995 
and Glenn in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn, however, has been plagued by injuries and ended last  
season with a fractured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got good players. We think we've got a good team,''  
Grier said. ``We've got to get our guys healthy and get them on the 
field.''

<HEADLINE> Tax-Mania Sweeps Post Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As much as Americans despise paying taxes,  
Thursday brought music and back rubs to the nation's post offices, 
along with a spirit of camaraderie among last-minute filers jammed 
into lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got it done. I've just got to figure out where to send the  
money that I owe,'' said 21-year-old Steve MacIntyre as he rooted 
through a mountain of forms at Boston's main post office. 
</P>
<P>
	His paperwork was creased and grubby from being in the back  
pocket of his jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aargh! No envelopes!'' he shouted, pounding the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	MacIntyre's was just one of 126 million tax returns the Internal  
Revenue Service expected to receive this year. The agency said it 
had already received more than half by late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the procrastinators, the forgetful and the flummoxed who  
took in the festive atmosphere at the nation's mailrooms on the 
final day of filing. Some post offices were open as late as 
midnight, with parties until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	A piano player was set to play in Boston's main post office  
Thursday. Outside, an actress dressed as Mother Nature was hired by 
a vitamin company to hand out free packets of kava root, which is 
supposed to ease stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A party at the Springfield post office included four bands and  
food donated from eight restaurants. Taxpayers also had a chance to 
get even with IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two dunk tanks this year, not just one,'' boasted  
Postmaster Flossie Paluszec. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 miles away, a Seattle radio station sent an anti-tax  
message by re-enacting the Boston Tea Party on an old sailing ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Other post offices around the country tried to rub out the  
anxiety of tax filing with free back and neck massages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, fans going to Thursday night's Los Angeles  
Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks game could bring their tax returns out 
to the park where a mobile post office was being set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspiring actors and actresses might have wanted to pay their  
taxes in Newport Beach, Calif. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
was capitalizing on the crowds at the post office by conducting 
screen tests for its ``Got Milk'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will give you a milk mustache and a screen test,'' said  
postal spokesman David Mazer. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't want to deal with stamps and envelopes,  
electronic filing was increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Don Roberts said 17 percent more people paid their  
taxes either online or by telephone this year than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the postal service hadn't noticed its business declining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same number that we see every year,'' said Bob  
Cannon, a Massachusetts postal service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Springfield, Va., the certified public accountants of  
Crutchley, Marginot &AMP; Tosi P.C. closed the office early. Like 
accountants around the country, they planned to celebrate an end to 
80-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut down at noon, we start our party at 2 p.m. and it goes  
through the night,'' said accountant Mary Ann Dougherty.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to ASNE-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Even as we fight this conflict, we must look beyond it to what  
the Balkans, southeastern Europe, indeed the whole continent of 
Europe, should look like in 10 or 20 years. We should try to do for 
southeastern Europe what we helped to do for western Europe after 
World War II and for central Europe after the Cold War: to help its 
people build a region of multiethnic democracies; a community that 
upholds common standards of human rights; a community in which 
borders are open to people and trade, where nations cooperate to 
make war unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why my request to Congress for supplemental funding for  
our military and humanitarian operation in Kosovo will also support 
emergency assistance to Yugoslavia's neighbors, which do not want 
their dreams of democracy and integration undermined by a flood of 
refugees and the fear of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	That is why we've been working to help the countries of the  
region consolidate democratic reform and build professional armed 
forces under civilian control. We need to intensify these efforts 
and to work with the European Union and the international financial 
institutions to mobilize more support for these countries. And we 
need to condition this help, just as we did with western Europe 50 
years ago, on closer cooperation among the beneficiaries and a new 
understanding of their sovereignty. This will take constant, steady 
American engagement together with our European allies, old and new. 
</P>
<P>
	It will demand keeping institutions, including NATO and the  
European Union, open to new nations who make the right choices. It 
will take money in the form of investment and aid. It will require 
a willingness to provide material and moral support to people and 
leaders across the region who are standing up for multiethnic 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Realistically, it will require a democratic transition in  
Serbia, for the region's democracies will never be safe with a 
belligerent tyranny in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
	It will demand from us a recognition that there is no easy way  
out of the region's troubles, but there is a solution that advances 
our interest and keeps faith with our values, if we are ready to 
make a long-term commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course all of this will take time and effort. In the  
meantime, the people of Kosovo should have protection, security and 
self-government. That can only be assured by an international 
security force with NATO at the core. As in Bosnia, this force 
should also include members of NATO's Partnership for Peace that 
represent the whole range of ethnic groups in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	This is precisely the kind of mission we envisioned for the  
Partnership for Peace when it was created five years ago, and the 
kind of mission I very much hope Russia could join as well, just as 
it did so constructively in Bosnia. In the long run, our goal for 
Kosovo should not be independence, but interdependence. Our 
watchword for the region should be integration, not disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultimate answer for Kosovo, for Serbia, for Bosnia, Croatia  
-- all the Balkans -- is not to withdraw behind barriers of mistrust 
and insecurity, but to join a Europe where borders unite, rather 
than divide; to build a richly textured fabric of civilization that 
lifts all God's children and resists those who would tear it apart 
by appealing to the dark recesses of the soul that lead only to 
dead ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkan war that began in Kosovo 10 years ago must end in  
Kosovo. It should be the last conflict of the 20th century. It 
should not be the defining conflict of the 21st century. The United 
States has the opportunity and the responsibility to make that 
decision come out right for our children and our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	We can help to lead to a new day for the people of this  
long-suffering region, a more peaceful time for Europe, and a 
better future for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  
</P>
<P>
	MODERATOR: The president has kindly agreed to take questions.  
You must be an ASNE member to ask a question. I invite you to go to 
the floor, as I see you're doing. Please identify yourself and your 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Rich Oppel, Austin American-Statesman. Would you help us sort  
out what happened yesterday on the road from Prizren to Kukes? 
According to press accounts -- you had your choices, I guess -- NATO 
aircraft either bombed a convoy that included refugees, or the 
Serbs attacked the Albanians in response to our bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Did we screw up? Can the prosecution of this war be sustained --  
can it sustain the support of Americans if the newspapers of this 
country are publishing front-page stories showing dead civilians? 
And what word went out from you and Sandy Berger today to the 
Pentagon and to the NATO high command about yesterday's events? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, first of all, what we believe happened is that  
the pilot thought it was a military convoy and that there were 
apparently civilians in the convoy who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	That is regrettable. It is also inevitable in a conflict of this  
kind, with planes traveling at high speeds, doing the best to 
fulfill their mission. And if the requirement is that nothing like 
this can ever happen, then we're saying it's OK with us if Mr. 
Milosevic displaces over a million Kosovars, kills and rapes 
thousands upon thousands of them. And keep in mind, in Bosnia there 
were more than 2 million refugees and a quarter of a million people 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like  
this occurring. This is not a business of perfection. I ask you to 
think about the hundreds and hundreds of sorties which have been 
flown in the last three weeks and the small number of civilian 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be obvious to everybody in the world that we are  
bending over backwards to hit military targets, to hit security 
targets, even to hit a lot of targets late at night where the 
losses in human life will be minimized. These efforts have been 
made and they have been remarkably successful. 
</P>
<P>
	So certain regrettable things will happen. We will do our best.  
The military will evaluate this incident as it does every other 
one. So will the NATO command. 
</P>
<P>
	But I have to tell you, if anyone thinks that this is a reason  
for changing our mission, then the United States will never be able 
to bring military power to bear again, because there is no such 
thing as flying airplanes this fast, dropping weapons this 
powerful, dealing with an enemy this pervasive, who is willing to 
use people as human shields, and never have this sort of tragic 
thing happen. It cannot be done. 
</P>
<P>
	I believe when the scales are weighed, it will be obvious that  
this is a result of Mr. Milosevic's policies. If he doesn't want 
this to happen, he ought to get out of Kosovo, let the Kosovars 
come home and let people come in there who can protect them. That 
is the answer to this.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at New High: 10,462.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices closed mostly higher Thursday in a  
turbulent session that saw the Dow Jones industrial average change 
direction several times but still make its fourth-straight record 
high close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow ended up 51.06 at 10,462.72, topping Wednesday's record  
of 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was very active, with 1.3 billion shares changing hands  
in consolidated trading, a record so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market measures were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index ended 5.59 lower at 1,322.85, after paring its losses. But 
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 14.49 to 2,521.77, 
making back nearly 20 percent of the ground it lost on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile tech stocks, which investors had sold aggressively  
since Tuesday afternoon, rallied gamely in the final 30 minutes of 
trading, pushing the Nasdaq index into positive territory for the 
first time in the sesson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wild day, with the hot technology stocks opening down  
big and doing their best to try to come back toward the end of the 
day,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime 
Charter. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the end, cyclical stocks, which move up and down with the  
economy and which had trailed the market until recently, ``stole 
the show,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been a real leadership shift in the market,'' said  
Larry Wachtel, market strategist at Prudential Securities. ``The 
most unloved stocks -- the dogs of the Dow -- are winning today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks stumbled in the afternoon as investors keyed into a rise  
in bond yields. Interest rates were rising on heavy new supply in 
the bond market and a report that manufacturing in the Philadelphia 
area strengthened considerably this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia report renewed concerns that the growing  
economy could reignite inflation, said Jack Shaughnessy, market 
strategist at Advest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market ``has been driven (higher) in the last three  
years by rapidly expanding money supply and falling interest 
rates,'' Shaughnessy noted. Now, ``the market is becoming 
apprehensive that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates 
because of concerns about inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market pared its losses by late afternoon, helping the  
recovery in stocks. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at 
5.52 percent, up only slightly from from 5.51 percent late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks led the Dow industrials higher amid a continued rise  
in oil prices. Chevron advanced 4 5/8 to 95 3/4. They were also led by 
such recently out-of-favor manufacturers as Minnesota Mining and 
Manufacturing, up 4 to 79 1/4. Aircraft maker Boeing, also a Dow 
component, added 3 11/16 to 41 11/16 on a strong earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	The shares of consumer products makers fell sharply. Dow member  
Johnson &AMP; Johnson declined 2 1/2 to 92 3/8. Drugmaker Pfizer tumbled 14 5/8 
to 130 on a disappointing earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh blow to technology stocks early Thursday was a warning  
from Storage Technology, a maker of computer storage equipment, 
that it wouldn't meet analysts' first-quarter earnings 
expectations. Storage Tech shares retreated 7 1/16 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow 11-to-8  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 2.78 to 622.89, but the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.81 to 737.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.35 to 417.74.  
</P>
<P>
	In overseas markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo edged lower  
by 0.22 percent. In Europe, the FT-SE 100 index in London shed 0.42 
percent, the DAX index in Frankfurt added 0.06 percent, and the CAC 
index in Paris ended 0.89 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken Makes Double Error </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's Cal Ripken's glove that resembles iron  
these days, not the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken made a double error in the second inning of the Baltimore  
Orioles' game against the New York Yankees on Thursday night, 
leading to five unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I honestly don't feel that bad,'' Ripken said after  
Baltimore's 9-7 win. ``I wish I could claim a physical problem but 
there's not one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, a two-time Gold Glove who had just eight errors last  
season and holds or shares 12 fielding records, has five of his 
team's seven errors this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed a week of spring training last month following the  
death of his father, Cal Ripken Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge mentally right now,'' Ripken said. ``Maybe  
I'm pushing it a little too much right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the regular season, Ripken missed two starts because  
of a bad back. But he said it's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects, I feel a little rusty,'' he said. ``The good  
news is physically I feel very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has been taking extra hitting and fielding and intends to  
take more. He had two throwing errors in Sunday's 9-5 loss to 
Toronto, including one on a rundown that turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Ironman, who broke Lou Gehrig's record for  
consecutive games played, also misplayed Chili Davis' first-inning 
grounder in Baltimore's 14-7 loss to New York on Wednesday night, 
leading to the third run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting it all together,'' he said.  
``I'm going to try to work at it. It's all I can offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Baltimore ahead 4-0 and the bases loaded with two outs in  
the second, Luis Sojo hit a grounder to third that Ripken bobbled, 
then threw past first as two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Knoblauch hit a two-run double off the glove of left  
fielder B.J. Surhoff on the next pitch, and Derek Jeter's double 
gave New York a 5-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles manager Ray Miller was unconcerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cal's all right,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Body of Tammy Wynette Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Questions about country music singer  
Tammy Wynette's cause of death may be answered in several weeks 
after investigators receive the results of her autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette's body was exhumed Wednesday after her widower, George  
Richey, Wynette's fifth husband and the subject of a $50 million 
wrongful death lawsuit brought by three of her daughters, requested 
the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Richey criticized his stepdaughters for  
violating Wynette's privacy and said he asked for the autopsy in 
order to ``clarify for everyone how Tammy died so we can all move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, famous for ``Stand By Your Man'' and many other hits,  
was 55 when she died at home April 6, 1998. Her personal physician, 
Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh, flew in to sign the death 
certificate and listed the cause of death as a blood clot to the 
lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters claim Wynette could have lived longer with better  
medical care. They assert narcotics prescribed by Marsh and 
sometimes administered by Richey could have played a part in her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters -- Tina Jones, Georgette Smith and Jackie Daly --  
also claim Richey did not seek medical care for her after being 
urged to do so by Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville Medical Examiner Bruce Levy said he can determine what  
drugs were in Wynette's system at the time of her death, but is not 
sure if he can determine the amounts of each drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh, who practices at the University of Pittsburgh Medical  
Center, issued a statement last week denying any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the autopsy are expected in four to six weeks, Levy  
said.

<HEADLINE> Wright's Final Work To Stay Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) -- The last major work designed by Frank  
Lloyd Wright, Marin County's main library, will stay open for now 
despite pressure to close it down to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marin County Library Commission voted Wednesday night  
against recommending closure, opting instead to support a sales tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision is up to the county board of supervisors.  
</P>
<P>
	The library, with its domed blue roof and tall spire, is the  
centerpiece of the civic center completed after Wright's death in 
1962. The architect regarded it as the heart of the project, 
forever linking the ``center of knowledge'' to the ``center of 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're heartened by the commissioner's actions not to shut down  
this stunning facility,'' said architect Marielle Rutherford. ``But 
we'll need to work hard to gain support for a sales tax increase. 
It was Frank Lloyd Wright's vision to have a library here, and it's 
ours too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closing was proposed to help offset a $1.4 million deficit  
in the library system.

<HEADLINE> Sega To Launch New Video-Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sega Enterprises Ltd. will release Dreamcast,  
its next-generation video-game system, in September, hoping to gain 
a competitive advantage against rivals Sony and Nintendo for the 
crucial holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega is expected to announce Thursday it will launch a $100  
million marketing campaign to support the U.S. rollout of 
Dreamcast, which will retail for $199. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast has already sold more than 1 million units in Japan  
since its launch last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega will be the first manufacturer to release the next  
generation of gaming system in the United States, giving it an edge 
over rivals Sony and Nintendo -- which it has lagged behind in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony currently accounts for about 60 percent of the U.S. market  
for video game machines with its PlayStation system, while Nintendo 
holds more than 30 percent; Sega has less than 5 percent, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega hasn't launched a new system in the United States in five  
years, when it unveiled the Saturn gaming console. Its rivals have 
a wider selection of games and Nintendo's 64-bit system is twice as 
powerful as the Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is their opportunity to bring back their following,''  
said Anthony Gikas, vice president at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in 
Minneapolis. ``With this rollout, they are ahead of the cycle and 
they need that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast is the first home-gaming system to include Internet  
capabilities. With a modem installed in its base, consumers will be 
able to play games online, as well as e-mail, chat and browse the 
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo-based Sega plans to detail its Internet strategy next  
month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast will also feature advanced 3-D graphics and sound  
devices. The 128-bit system will have double the capability of the 
Nintendo 64 and four times the power of the Sony PlayStation. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be 10 to 12 games available for the Dreamcast in  
September, and by Christmas, the company expects about 30 to be on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft collaborated with Sega on the Dreamcast, the first  
time the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant has ventured into the 
home console video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that the $199 launch price puts Sega in a solid  
position to become a strong seller during the Christmas season. 
Never before has a new next generation console come to market for 
less than $200. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has received more than 30,000 pre-orders for the new  
Dreamcast already, and expects that to soar above 200,000 by the 
launch date. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they haven't dominated in the U.S. in recent years, they  
still have a good name and they have a great advantage with being 
the first to market a machine with Internet capability,'' said 
Kelly Henry, an analyst with International Data Corp. in 
Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega's launch of Dreamcast will come at least a year before Sony  
brings its newest gaming system to the United States. The 128-bit 
machine, now known as the PlayStation II, should be in stores in 
Japan next winter and in the U.S. market by the fall of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo has not yet released its plans for a new system, but  
analysts said the platform should be available in 2001.

<HEADLINE> More Obstacles in Bankruptcy Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dispute over abortion threatened to scuttle  
a Senate bill to rewrite the bankruptcy laws, while some Democrats 
on Thursday denounced the bill as a giveaway to credit card 
companies that would hurt hard-pressed families. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposal by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., would require  
bankrupt people found to have violated laws protecting abortion 
clinics to pay those penalties. Schumer said his amendment would 
``hold the perpetrators of clinic violence responsible for the 
damage they incur when they imperil a woman's legal right to 
choose. ... We must make it clear to those who would harm women and 
doctors that bankruptcy is no escape from accountability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer cited the case of Operation Rescue founder Randall  
Terry, who filed for bankruptcy court protection in November, 
blaming heavy debts owed to womens' groups and abortion clinics 
that have sued him. 
</P>
<P>
	When he filed, Terry said he could not ``in good conscience''  
allow the liberal National Organization for Women and Planned 
Parenthood, which he owes a total $1.6 million in penalties from 
lawsuits, to ``possibly get money from me to continue their crusade 
against unborn life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., called Schumer's proposal a ``poison  
pill'' that could kill the bankruptcy legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The way ``to make sure nothing happens (with legislation) is to  
say 'abortion,''' Biden, who supports the bankruptcy overhaul bill, 
said as the Senate Judiciary Committee began a drafting session. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., is pushing an opposing  
amendment prohibiting doctors who declare bankruptcy from writing 
off penalties they owe from medical malpractice claims related to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time the bipartisan legislation, which would  
make it tougher for people to erase their debts in bankruptcy 
court, has become entangled in sensitive social issues. Last year 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, along with consumer groups and some 
Democrats, complained that the measure would make single mothers 
and children who are owed support by bankrupt fathers take a back 
seat to credit card companies in collecting debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House threatened in 1998 to veto a House-passed  
bankruptcy overhaul bill and the Senate adjourned without voting on 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Senate bill split the Democrats on the Judiciary  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It basically stinks,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said at  
the drafting session. ``You talk about special-interest 
legislation: you've got it right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to an ongoing lobbying push for the legislation  
by credit card companies and retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, credit card giant Visa USA Inc. increased its  
lobbying bill to $3.6 million from $900,000 in 1997, new disclosure 
reports show. MasterCard International's lobbying expenses rose to 
$1.8 million from $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, consumer groups, unions, civil rights groups  
and bankruptcy attorneys oppose the legislation, saying it favors 
corporate profits over the needs of families struggling with debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the bill had been stripped of consumer protections  
that were included in earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer is proposing amendments that would, for example, bar  
credit card companies from imposing special fees on consumers who 
pay their balances off. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., called the bill ``irresponsible''  
and ``a gift to special interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden insisted that the bill is not an attempt to ``stiff  
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden, whose home state Delaware is the headquarters site for  
many credit card issuers, and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., are 
co-sponsors of the bill with Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is essential that we do not allow partisan politics to get  
in the way of implementing fair and reasonable reforms to the 
nation's bankruptcy laws,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the 
Judiciary Committee's chairman. ``Under this legislation, if people 
are able to repay their debts, they will be required to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee adjourned without completing work on the bill and  
planned to resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Senate and House bills would allow federal bankruptcy  
judges to determine a debtor's ability to repay. They would use an 
IRS standard to estimate living expenses and calculate whether the 
payback could be 25 percent or more of the total debt within three 
years. If so, the debtor could be forced into a Chapter 13 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, people must repay  
their debts according to a court-ordered plan. Credit card 
companies complain that too many people take shelter under the more 
lenient Chapter 7, which erases debts, when they could afford to 
restructure debts under Chapter 13.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, GTE Get Creative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bell Atlantic and GTE, seeking approval from  
federal regulators to merge, are offering a new proposal to resolve 
a thorny issue involving GTE's Internet and long-distance services, 
the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, attorneys  
for Bell Atlantic and GTE also said the companies are withdrawing 
an initial proposal to deal with the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will make a further submission that addresses the  
long-distance issues and supports our underlying merger 
application,'' said Bell Atlantic counsel Edward Young and GTE 
counsel Steven Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't say what the new proposal would entail.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the agency could  
delay a decision on the merger because it wasn't clear how GTE's 
Internet and long-distance services, when taken over by Bell 
Atlantic, would comply with a 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law forbids Bell Atlantic from offering Internet services  
across local calling boundaries and long-distance service to local 
phone customers unless it first receives FCC permission. It hasn't. 
That provision of the law, however, doesn't apply to GTE. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic said it is making progress in New York and other  
states in obtaining permission to offer telephone and Internet 
services to local customers. Given that, ``the nature and scope of 
relief'' initially sought from the FCC will change, the attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic's and GTE's initial proposal, filed in February,  
didn't appear to satisfy regulators. In that proposal, the 
companies asked for a two-year break from the law's provision. 
During that time the merged company would continue to provide GTE's 
Internet and long-distance services while trying to obtain 
necessary FCC and state approvals.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows That NATO Will Prevail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A post World War II-type reconstruction  
plan will be needed in the Balkans once the current conflict there 
is over, but the region ``will never be safe with a belligerent 
tyranny in their midst,'' President Clinton said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton invited Russia to join Western allies in protecting the  
security and self-government of a Kosovo to which ethnic Albanians 
have returned once peace is achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the annual convention of the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors, Clinton vowed anew that NATO will prevail and 
reverse Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forced expulsion of 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow the Milosevic vision -- rooted as it is in  
hatred and violence and cynicism -- to prevail,'' he declared, 
envisioning a future when the nations of southeastern Europe choose 
peaceful integration and ethnic tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Nob Hill hotel where he spoke, about 500 protesters  
carrying signs denouncing U.S. involvement in Kosovo chanted ``No 
war! No bombs! No new Vietnam!'' A smaller knot of demonstrators 
supported NATO with signs saying ``Stop the Hitler of the Balkans'' 
and urging the alliance to arm the Kosvar guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Clinton made clear that he foresees Milosevic's  
expulsion from power. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger called 
Milosevic ``a card-carrying totalitarian'' and said it was hard to 
imagine him ever being elected democratically. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he does not support ethnic Albanians' calls  
for independence in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's 
dominant republic. He said Kosovo lacks the resources and 
infrastructure to stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said a peaceful future ``realistically ... will require a  
democratic transition in Serbia, for the region's democracies will 
never be safe with a belligerent tyranny in their midst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Answering editors' questions, Clinton said he feels no need to  
respond to radio talk show critics who claim he lacks the moral 
authority to be commander in chief. ``This is a democracy and 
people can say whatever they want to say,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To a complaint about a lack of information about bombing damage  
and military progress, Clinton said the Pentagon should ``get more 
information out more quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Pentagon had problems working through the NATO  
command structure in Europe, adding that bad weather had 
complicated the problems. ``I'm aware that this is a difficulty, I 
agree that we should try to do more...'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging that a NATO pilot fired Wednesday on a convoy in  
Kosovo containing civilians, Clinton said civilian causalities were 
inevitable, ``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some 
errors like this occurring,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States has contributed $150 million to  
aid refugees and is willing to do more to promote peace and 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
	``To achieve that future,'' he said, ``we must follow the  
example of the World War II generation by standing up to aggression 
and hate and then by following through with a post-conflict 
strategy for reconstruction and renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't want people to remain mired in the miseries of  
yesterday, we must give them a better tomorrow to dream of and work 
for,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a peaceful future ``will take constant, steady American  
engagement together with our European allies, old and new.'' 
Further, he said it will demand that NATO and the European Union 
keep their doors open for new members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take money in the form of investment and aid,'' he  
said, without offering any estimate of costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton took advantage of his cross-country trip to spend the  
afternoon with his daughter Chelsea, a student at Stanford 
University. Later, he was flying to Detroit for appearances Friday.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Stunned by Strawberry Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone was so upset at the news of Darryl  
Strawberry's arrest that he didn't sleep all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just devastated,'' the pitcher said seconds after walking  
into the New York Yankees clubhouse Thursday. ``It's just awful 
news for him and his family. I just hope it's not as bad as it 
seems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees didn't want to make any rush to judgment about the  
37-year-old outfielder, whose 19 years as a pro baseball star have 
been marked by tremendous ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a waiting situation. I just want to wait until all  
the facts come in,'' said general manager Brian Cashman, who said 
the team had ``reached out'' to Strawberry but did not go into 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre, working out in Yankee Stadium before the  
game, declined to talk about the situation surrounding Strawberry's 
arrest Wednesday night in Tampa, Fla., on charges of cocaine 
possession and soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim manager Don Zimmer said any decisions will be made by  
owner George Steinbrenner, who made the decision to sign Strawberry 
in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's a mistake,'' Zimmer said. ``This guy has done some  
great things for this club in 2 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees players look up to Strawberry, who has battled drug and  
alcohol problems along with financial and health difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strawberry is like a big brother to me,'' Derek Jeter said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cone, Strawberry's teammate on the New York Mets a decade ago,  
is his closest friend on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the least objective person about Darryl,'' Cone said. ``I  
love the guy. It's just an awful situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone called the Major League Baseball Players Association  
several times Thursday to discuss Strawberry's situation. Because 
Strawberry isn't on the 40-man roster, it's unclear whether 
commissioner Bud Selig has jurisdiction over him or any discipline 
would come from the National Association of Professional Baseball 
Leagues, the governing body of the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Because he's on a minor league contract, he may not have the  
grievance rights given to major leaguers under their collective 
bargaining agreement. His situation, however, may come under major 
league baseball because he is in its aftercare program. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his comeback from a 60-day suspension in 1995 that  
followed a positive drug test, Strawberry was tested twice a week. 
Cashman said all tests have been negative. The most recent test was 
Tuesday, but those results have not come back yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was at the Yankees extended spring training program  
as he rehabilitates from colon cancer surgery. Cashman said the 
team told Strawberry not to work out the next few days and to 
attend to this situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of his goals was to make the team coming out of spring  
training,'' Cone said, ``and he was very depressed when that didn't 
happen. ... He's come so far. He had to be right on the edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone speculated that maybe Strawberry might have been better off  
with his teammates than being along in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he was around us, maybe some friends could have helped him  
if he felt a relapse coming on,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, who was in Cleveland attending the funeral of a  
Yankees limited partner, has repeatedly reached out to troubled 
athletes, signing Steve Howe and Strawberry after they were let go 
by others. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if a guy is a three-, four-, five-time loser,''  
Zimmer said, adding he thought Strawberry had been a model citizen 
with the Yankees. ``To have this happen, it hurts.''

<HEADLINE> Store Sues Amazon.com for Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Amazon Bookstore Inc. is suing Amazon.com in  
federal court, alleging the Internet giant that sells books, music 
and videos is knowingly infringing on the smaller store's 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookstore, in a lawsuit filed April 7 in U.S. District Court  
in Minneapolis, seeks cancellation of Amazon.com's federal 
trademark registrations using the word Amazon and asks that 
Seattle-based Amazon.com stop using the name. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also seeks unspecified monetary damages.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon Bookstore, a 2,000-square-foot, women-oriented  
Minneapolis bookstore, stocks 25,000 titles and mails a newsletter 
to more than 2,500 people across the United States and in 11 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get a lot of phone calls daily from people thinking we're  
Amazon.com. Sometimes they were upset they hadn't gotten an 
order,'' bookstore President Barb Wieser said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bookstore at first ignored the problem, but it has escalated  
with the growth of Amazon.com, Wieser said. Sales of Amazon.com 
grew from $147.8 million in 1997, the year the company went public, 
to $610 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get e-mail, we get faxes. It's clearly very confused in the  
public's mind. We get invoices from publishers. We have to explain 
that we're not Amazon.com,'' Wieser said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very galling to us that they took our name. It's very  
galling to us that they ignored our presence. We've been around for 
almost 30 years. We've worked hard to be who we are. It's very hard 
to see that taken away,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Capelli, spokesman for Amazon.com, said officials of the  
Seattle-based company had not been formally served with the lawsuit 
and declined comment until they had seen and studied it. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Mathias Samuel, representing the bookstore, said the  
bookstore had not registered the trademark but claims common law 
ownership through longtime use. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been listed in the phone book for years. They've had a  
1-800 number. They've been on the Internet since September 1996,'' 
Samuel said. Amazon Bookstore has been a member of the American 
Booksellers Association since 1986, while Amazon.com has been a 
member since 1994, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the lawsuit is to stop the confusion, Samuel said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the only way for that to happen is for them to  
stop using the name Amazon,'' he said. ``The rapid growth and vast 
size of Amazon.com, along with its massive marketing expenditures, 
is overwhelming Amazon Bookstore.''

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Plant Blast Injures 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- A fire led to an explosion early today  
at the University of Notre Dame power plant, seriously injuring two 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kempf, the university's chief electrical engineer, and  
security guard Jami Thibodeaux were responding to a fire in the 
cooling tower next to the power plant when a small, corrugated 
metal building housing a transformer exploded about 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``The force of the blast was considerable. The building was  
demolished,'' Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two workers were taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center. The  
hospital did not immediately provide their condition, but the 
school said both suffered fractures and concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said investigators believe the fire, which had started a  
half-hour earlier, caused the transformer to overheat. The fire was 
eventually put out, but not before the cooling tower sustained 
considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the fire was unknown.  
</P>
<P>
	Moore said the fire and explosion did not affect the  
university's power supply, but damage to the cooling tower may have 
knocked out air conditioning on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary estimates put the damage at $1.35 million, though  
the university doesn't expect to tally the total cost of the blast 
for some time.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises More Kosovo Info </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton told newspaper editors on  
Thursday the military should ``get more information out more 
quickly,'' answering a media complaint about a scarcity of details 
on the Kosovo campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Pentagon had difficulty working through the  
NATO command structure in Europe, and he added that early 
assessments of the bombing had been obscured by bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware that this is a difficulty, I agree that we should  
try to do more, more simultaneous with the actions, and I am 
working on it and trying to get NATO to do more as well,'' Clinton 
told the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless there is some specific security-related reason that  
some issue shouldn't be talked about, I think the more information 
we can get out there the more quickly, the better off we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the editors he hoped the situation improved within a few  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, several news organizations, including The  
Associated Press, delivered a letter to Defense Secretary William 
Cohen expressing concern that few details of the air campaign 
against the Serbs had been released, especially compared with 
voluminous detail released about earlier bombings of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that detailed information about the allied  
operation is vital to an informed public discussion of this matter 
of national interest,'' the editors wrote to Cohen. They asked for 
information about targets hit, planes involved in operations, 
greater access to troops and officers and daily summaries of bomb 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of specific data day to day makes it impossible to  
analyze the effectiveness of the air campaign, something that has 
to be known to the Yugoslav authorities but is concealed from the 
American public,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	News executives said they were pleased with Clinton's comments  
and would be looking for results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're encouraged to hear the president talk abut greater  
public access to the military campaign in Europe,'' said Jonathan 
P. Wolman, managing editor of the AP. ``Information has been more 
tightly held than in the past and we've been glad to see a small 
improvement even in the last few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Downie, executive editor of The Washington Post, who  
asked the question that brought Clinton's response Thursday, said, 
``What pleased me was that he had already begun to discuss this. 
... I hope that's going to bear fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Parks, editor and executive vice president of the Los  
Angeles Times, said, ``We've seen some improvement. We're going to 
continue to press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Edward Seaton, ASNE president and editor in chief of The  
Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury said, ``We're delighted with his promise 
and hope he lives up to it.''

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Union Fined $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday fined the American  
Airlines' pilots union more than $45 million -- nearly all of its 
assets -- for an illegal sickout that led to the cancellation of 
more than 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-day sickout this February stranded hundreds of thousands  
of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Joe Kendall had previously held the  
union in contempt after it initially refused his back-to-work 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of about 2,500 pilots called in sick during the job  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots were angered over the way American was integrating its  
purchase of Reno Air, a small western carrier, which resulted in 
disparities in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings were held this week to determine compensatory damages  
for the sickout, during which American Airlines claimed it lost $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had disputed the claim, saying the job action cost the  
air carrier less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall sided with American, however, fining the union $45.51  
million. The fine will be paid directly to AMR Group, the parent of 
American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's ruling could devastate the Allied Pilots Association,  
which has about $48 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	APA president Rich Lavoy hinted at an appeal would be made. ``We  
think we're a long way from this being fully adjudicated,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've very disappointed the judge would come up with this  
number. If we're going to go forward, this is not the way to 
resolve the problems. It is a shame that we've come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said it took no ``particular pleasure'' in the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're victims of this as are we,'' airline spokeswoman  
Andrea Rader. ``We went to court to get the sickout to stop. We 
want to close this chapter and get on with labor peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said both the union and its top two officials -- Lavoy  
and vice president Brian Mayhew -- were liable for the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He scheduled a hearing Monday to discuss what percentage of the  
fine the two officials would have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had previously placed $10 million, or one-quarter of  
its assets, with the court in preparation for paying a fine. LaVoy 
placed $10,000 with the court and vice president Brian Mayhew 
remitted $5,000 for their roles in the job action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall expressed sympathy for the three-quarters of the  
American pilots who didn't call in sick, saying that imposing the 
fine makes ``me sick to my stomach, because I know what's going to 
happen is some very fine men and women pilots are going to be hurt 
badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the Allied Pilots Association, however, for its  
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flying public in this instance had zero notice and that's  
why it wreaked such havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines, which originally claimed it had lost $58.7  
million due to the sickout, reduced the estimate to $50 million on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he reduced the amount further in case of error and  
on the likelihood that passengers were booking flights on other 
airlines because of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts for the pilots' union had testified that the losses they  
had calculated range between $1.4 million and about $4.5 million, 
depending on the time period considered. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one union member said the ruling was justified. ``I  
think the judge was right,'' said Captain Carmen Villani, who flies 
out of Washington D.C. ``I personally was very embarrassed what I 
experienced in the courtroom over the last two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive for American testified during a hearing before  
Kendall Thursday that the airline could have resumed normal 
operations more quickly and would not have canceled 2,279 more 
flights had pilots returned to the cockpits soon after a judge 
ordered them back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have recovered the airline two days earlier,'' said  
Tim Ahern, a vice president in scheduling at American. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the abnormally high number of sick calls was  
a rational response to the stress the labor dispute created for 
individual pilots. The union noted that safety regulations require 
pilots to stay home if they consider themselves under too much 
stress to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	American and the union have yet to resolve the assimilation  
issue involving the purchase of Reno Air. The union contends that 
Reno pilots should be integrated into American from the Dec. 23 
purchase, raising salaries for those affected from that date. The 
airline says it will pay the higher rates as the pilots are 
retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled, but are 
expected to resume.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Coverage Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton's impeachment trial  
damaged not only his credibility but the media's as well, according 
to a panel addressing a convention of the nation's newspaper 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment proceedings ``weakened the basic institutions of  
government across the board,'' from the presidency and Congress to 
the press and the public, former White House Chief of Staff Leon 
Panetta said Wednesday at the American Society of Newspaper Editors 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's domestic credibility and leadership were damaged,  
added David Broder, a Pulitzer Prize-winning political 
correspondent for The Washington Post. But he said the scandal hurt 
the media's credibility, deepened cynicism about politics and 
government and ``added to the public perception that Washington is 
a snake pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an instructor at the School of Politics  
and Economics at Claremont Graduate University and a contributing 
editor for the Los Angeles Times, said most of the nation already 
distrusted politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	There was ``not much hand-wringing over this,'' she said.  
``People couldn't be any more cynical about Washington than they 
were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhaustive coverage of the Clinton sex scandal brought  
controversial issues to the forefront at most newsrooms. Having it 
happen at a time when Web sites compete to get the latest 
information out quickly also brought its own set of challenges, 
panelists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers relied heavily on anonymous sources, according to a  
survey designed by the Committee of Concerned Journalists and 
conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the front-page impeachment-related stories appearing in The  
New York Times, Los Angeles Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The 
Washington Post and The Washington Times between January 21-24, 38 
percent relied on anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to do our job, but we didn't always do as well  
as we wanted,'' said Thomas Rosenstiel, director of the Project for 
Excellence in Journalism.

<HEADLINE> Driver in Van Crash Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELOIT, Wis. (AP) -- The 20-year-old driver in a van crash that  
killed seven members of a magazine sales crew pleaded guilty to 
vehicular homicide on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Holmes changed his mind to spare himself and the victims'  
families from the trauma of a trial, said his attorney Brenna 
Lisowski. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been very anxious not to drag this out and put other  
people through the agony of this any further,'' Lisowski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Holmes, of Clinton, Iowa, tried to switch  
places with a passenger because he had been spotted speeding and 
was driving without a valid license. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was carrying 14 young magazine sellers on March 25 when  
it veered off the freeway at 80 mph and barrel-rolled off 
Interstate 90 near Janesville. Twelve people were thrown from the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had been selling magazine subscriptions door to door  
and was on its way back to a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Holmes' guilty pleas to seven counts of  
vehicular homicide and five counts of causing great bodily harm, 
the district attorney said he would ask the judge to decide the 
prison sentence for vehicular homicide without any recommendation 
from the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum prison sentence for vehicular homicide is 14 years.  
</P>
<P>
	The van's occupants, ages 15 to 25, had been selling magazines  
for YES, an affiliate of Subscriptions Plus of suburban Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the crash, the Oklahoma Labor Department issued eight  
citations against Subscriptions Plus alleging 123 Worker's 
Compensation Act violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscriptions Plus also was accused of a child labor citation  
involving a 15-year-old Madison, Wis., girl injured in the crash. 
The company has denied the allegations and did not return telephone 
messages seeking comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rhode Island Names DeGregorio Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island promoted assistant  
Jerry DeGregorio to basketball coach on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio takes over for Jim Harrick, who left March 31 to take  
over as coach of Georgia. It is DeGregorio's first head coaching 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Cowens, a former Boston Celtics star, said earlier Thursday  
on WSKO-AM radio that he had withdrawn his name from consideration. 
Cowens, who quit earlier this season as coach of the NBA's 
Charlotte Hornets, said he would seek another NBA coaching 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio, 37, has been an assistant at Rhode Island since 1997  
and was the chief recruiter. He won widespread support in his bid 
for the head coaching position from players and boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' DeGregorio said. ``I appreciate  
the faith the university has shown me in giving me this 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's press conference at Mackal Field House was the second  
in two weeks that Rhode Island scheduled to announce a hiring. On 
April 1, the school planned to announce that Harrick had changed 
his mind and would remain at Rhode Island. But he backed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island moved quickly with its selection of a replacement  
for Harrick with national signing day approaching. Only DeGregorio, 
Cowens and Loyola of Chicago coach Larry Farmer were interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Rhode Island, DeGregorio was athletic director  
and basketball coach at St. Thomas Aquinas High School in New 
Britain, Conn., his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio was an assistant at Hofstra from 1985-88, an  
assistant at St. Thomas Aquinas College for one season and coach at 
Mattatuck Community College from 1990-1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry DeGregorio is well known and well liked by our boosters  
and our players,'' athletic director Ron Petro said. DeGregorio, 
``a proven recruiter and motivator ... impressed our search 
committee with his commitment, loyalty and emphasis on academic 
achievement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick took Rhode Island into the NCAA tournament the last two  
years and DeGregorio acknowledged he would have to match high 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned a lot from you, coach Harrick. I love you,''  
DeGregorio said during the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio also will act as a fundraiser while the school tries  
to raise $15 million in contributions for a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also faces an uncertain future, with star forward Lamar  
Odom considering entering the NBA draft. DeGregorio has been Odom's 
mentor for years and plans to speak with Odom and his family this 
weekend. The school hopes for a decision next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom was a member of the search committee and supported  
DeGregorio. But Petro said DeGregorio was not chosen in an attempt 
to persuade Odom to stay at Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> Germany Gets New Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's new finance minister was sworn in  
today, replacing a vocal predecessor whose leftist policies riled 
Germany's partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Eichel, a former Hesse state governor, is seen as fiscally  
more conservative than Oskar Lafontaine, who abruptly quit as 
finance minister March 11 in a power struggle with Chancellor 
Gerhard Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the kind of person who raises a lot of dust,'' Eichel  
told reporters after taking his oath of office before parliament. 
``I am calm and relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking further with Lafontaine's legacy, Eichel this week  
nominated World Bank official Caio Koch-Weser to replace the 
left-wing academic Heiner Flassbeck as his main deputy. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel has avoided spelling out how he intends to plug a $16.6  
billion hole in the 2000 budget at a time of high unemployment and 
faltering economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichel has said he plans to present a 2000 budget outline in the  
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine was Schroeder's main rival until his resignation. He  
antagonized the United States and European central bankers with 
calls for linking the exchange rates of major currencies and for 
interest rate cuts to stimulate European economies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lafontaine drew criticism because he had tried to do ``too much  
too quickly,'' but now ``thoroughness will go before speed'' in 
drafting policy, Eichel said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the finance job, Lafontaine also quit his powerful  
post as chairman of the governing Social Democrats, leaving 
Schroeder to take control of the party.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to ASNE-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	We've attacked its bridges and rail lines and communications  
networks to diminish its ability to supply, reinforce and control 
its forces in Kosovo. Increasingly now, we are striking the forces 
themselves, hitting tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, 
radar missiles and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	As the allies have said, all of us, repeatedly, Mr. Milosevic  
can stop NATO's bombing by meeting these conditions: One, Serbian 
security forces must leave Kosovo; two, the displaced Kosovars must 
be able to return; three, there must be an international security 
force to protect all Kosovars, including the Serb minority there as 
they work towards self-government. 
</P>
<P>
	If he refuses, our military campaign will continue to destroy as  
much of his military capability as we can so that each day his 
capacity for repression will diminish. Meanwhile, his actions, 
though absolutely devastating to the civilian population and 
horribly burdensome to the front-line states of Macedonia and 
Albania, have not destroyed the armed opposition among Kosovars. 
Indeed, their numbers and determination are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic will have to choose, either to cut his  
mounting losses or lose his ability to maintain his grip on Kosovo. 
As for NATO, we are prepared to continue this effort as long as 
necessary to achieve our objectives. Our timetable will be 
determined by our goals, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, we must do more to aid the refugees. They are  
pouring out of Kosovo. We must help to preserve their lives and 
health and their hope of return. This week, NATO approved Operation 
Allied Harbor, under which 8,000 troops will work with relief 
agencies in Albania to establish camps, provide logistical support, 
deliver aid and ensure security. Thus far, we have contributed in 
the United States $150 million to this effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions at the borders are beginning to improve. Now we are  
most concerned about the fate of the refugees, hundreds of 
thousands of them, trapped inside Kosovo. They are unable to leave 
but afraid to go home. Mr. Milosevic apparently wants to use them 
as hostages and human shields, and he's preventing relief groups 
from getting to them. People of good will all around the world 
today are trying to find ways to overcome this cruel and cynical 
manipulation of innocent human beings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Milosevic also continues to hold on to the three American  
servicemen his forces seized in Macedonia. He continues to flout 
his obligation to allow the Red Cross to visit them. I want to say 
again as clearly as I can, the United States will hold him 
personally responsible for their welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the stand we have taken, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo,  
against organized ethnic hatred is a moral imperative. But it is 
also a strategic imperative. And I'd like to talk with you a little 
about that and ask all of you to ask yourselves how you view the 
history of the last 50 years and how you imagine the next 50 years 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	The history of the United States for a very long time was  
dominated by a principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other 
countries, even when we strongly disagreed. Indeed, for most of our 
history, we have worn the principle of nonintervention as a badge 
of honor, beginning with George Washington's warning against 
entangling alliances. The 20th century changed all that with two 
World Wars, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Panama, 
Lebanon, Grenada, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo and others. Our 
steadily increasing involvement with the rest of the world, not for 
territorial gain, but for peace and freedom and security, is a fact 
of recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Cold War it can be argued that on occasion we made a  
wrong judgment because we tended to see the world solely through 
the lenses of communism or anti-communism. But no one suggests that 
we ever sought territorial advantage. No one doubts that when 
America did get involved, we were doing what at least we thought 
was right for humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now at the end of the 20th century, we face a great battle  
between the forces of integration and the forces of disintegration; 
the forces of globalism vs. tribalism; of oppression against 
empowerment. And the phenomenal explosion of technology, including 
that of advanced weaponry, might be the servant of either side or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	The central irony of our time, it seems to me is this: Most of  
us have a vision of the 21st-century world with the triumph of 
peace and prosperity and personal freedom; with respect for the 
integrity of ethnic, racial and religious minorities; within a 
framework of shared values, shared power and shared plenty; making 
common cause against disease and environmental degradation, against 
terror, organized crime, and weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	This grand vision, ironically, is threatened by the oldest demon  
of human society: our vulnerability to hatred of the other, those 
who are not like us. In the face of that, we cannot be indifferent 
at home or abroad. That is why we are in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a very small place on a very large fault line; on the  
borderlands of central and eastern Europe; at the meeting place of 
the Islamic world and the Western and Orthodox branches of 
Christianity; where people have settled in a complex patchwork of 
ethnic and religious groups; and where countless wars have been 
fought over faith, land and power. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is far from unique in its region. It is surrounded by  
nations with similar challenges of history and diversity. The only 
difference today is that they -- think of them: Albania, Macedonia, 
Bulgaria, Romania and Bosnia -- are now at least struggling to 
realize the vision of multiethnic democracy that Mr. Milosevic is 
struggling to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the former Soviet Union faces a similar challenge,  
including Ukraine and Moldova, Southern Russia, the Caucasus 
nations of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, the new nations of 
Central Asia. These nations spent most of the last half century 
under communist rule. In the years when Western Europe was 
overcoming its old animosities by integrating its economies and 
embracing democracy, in the years when Americans began confronting 
our legacy of racial hatred through open debate and political 
activism, these nations saw their problems frozen in time, kept in 
place by a rigid system that allowed no talk of change. They 
projected to the world a picture of stability, but it was a false 
picture, a stability imposed by rulers whose answer to ethnic 
tensions was not to resolve them, but to suppress and deny them.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Finishes Her Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- After three days of grueling questioning,  
Jenny Jones stepped off the witness stand and in front of cameras 
to defend her talk show and herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had portrayed her as a liar, Ms. Jones said.  
``After these three days, I think I've proven I am not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones completed nearly 12 hours of testimony Wednesday in  
the trial of a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against ``The 
Jenny Jones Show'' and its producer, Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is not being sued, insisted that she and her show  
were not responsible for the 1995 shooting death of Scott Amedure, 
a gay man who had described his crush on fellow guest Jonathan 
Schmitz during a show taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual and was humiliated, was  
found guilty of second-degree murder in the death. The conviction 
was overturned because of an error in jury selection, and his 
retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In their lawsuit, Amedure's family accuses the show of tricking  
a mentally troubled Schmitz into appearing on the program and 
leading him to believe his admirer was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones disagreed, saying ``I don't think we exploit people.''  
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, she said, ``was an adult. He knew the person with the  
crush could be a man or a woman. He was given enough information to 
make an informed choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, asked Ms. Jones, ``You  
knew the show could cause people to have regrets and 
disappointment, didn't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She responded, ``This particular show, it could go either way.''

<HEADLINE> Non-Division I Programs Recognized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Florida A&AMP;M halfback Willie Galimore and  
North Dakota linebacker Jim LeClair were among eight players and 
coaches from non-Division I programs named to the College Football 
Hall of Fame on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Galimore led the Rattlers to four conference championships from  
1953-56 and was an NAIA All-American in 1954. He later was drafted 
by the Chicago Bears and played in the NFL from 1957-63, when his 
career was cut short by a fatal car accident. 
</P>
<P>
	LeClair was an All-American at North Dakota in 1971 and later  
played for the Cincinnati Bengals and the USFL's New Jersey 
Generals. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players elected to the hall were George Bork, quarterback,  
Northern Illinois, 1960-63; Teel Bruner, defensive back, Centre 
(Ky.), 1982-85; George Floyd, defensive back, Eastern Kentucky, 
1978-81; and Randy Trautman, defensive tackle, Boise State, 
1961-64. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Nicks and James Sochor were elected as coaches. Nicks  
coached Morris Brown from 1930-42 and Prairie View A&AMP;M from 1945-47 
and 1952-65. He had a 189-55-9 record. Sochor was 158-42-5 from 
1970-89 at California Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The players and coaches will be inducted into the hall during a  
December ceremony in New York and have their plaques unveiled 
during a ceremony next August.

<HEADLINE> Intel's Stock Drops Despite Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. shares fell 6 percent Wednesday  
after the leading chip maker announced first-quarter revenues that 
fell slightly short of expectations and warned that future sales 
could drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the sales figures instead of Intel's  
better-than-expected profit, which rose 57 percent in the quarter 
amid cost-cutting. The financial results, announced late Tuesday, 
had reassured some analysts that problems in the personal computer 
business may be mostly confined to its biggest chip customer, 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel, whose chips supply the brainpower for 90 percent of  
the world's personal computers, expects second-quarter revenue to 
stay the same or fall slightly from its first-quarter revenue of 
$7.1 billion, citing ``seasonal factors'' in the microprocessor 
business. Some analysts had expected a slight increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's stock price dropped $3.50 to $57 on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Derby Winner Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Oaklawn Park officials asked state  
racing authorities Thursday to investigate whether jockey Billy 
Patin used an electrical device to make his horse run faster when 
it won the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol had not won in two outings before Saturday's $500,000  
Arkansas Derby and was a 30-1 shot when the horses left the gate. 
He paid $62.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn president Charles J. Cella told a hastily called meeting  
of the state Racing Commission that he wanted the commission to 
investigate. He said an employee found a device on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the commission to order the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse to the owner of the winner and to Patin. 
He said the commission's racing stewards, who left Oaklawn shortly 
after the meet ended Saturday, should be brought back together so 
they can investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted unanimously to go along with both requests.  
</P>
<P>
	Cella also said that, if the commission decides the rules of  
racing were violated, ``those involved should be dealt with in the 
appropriate and severe manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-place check for the race was to be $300,000.  
Withholding those earnings would put Valhol's status in question 
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. If there are more than 20 3-year-olds 
entered at Louisville, preference goes to the top 20 in graded 
money earned. The Arkansas Derby is a Grade II race and the 
first-place check would easily qualify Valhol for a spot in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials first became aware of possible  
irregularities in the running of the Arkansas Derby shortly after 
the race was declared official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately informed the stewards and the local  
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau -- the investigative branch of 
the thoroughbred racing industry,'' Cella said. ``By Monday night 
and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered additional evidence 
regarding the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence also was turned over to the national office of the  
TRPB in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties have concurred that the evidence is substantial  
enough to warrant further investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Valhol stayed just off the right flank of  
pacesetter Saint's Honor and then moved to the lead in the far 
turn. He quickly opened his advantage to 4 lengths. Patin used his 
whip on Valhol twice at the eighth pole and twice more at the 
sixteenth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Dallas Keen, Valhol was making the third start of his  
career. He was second in a maiden race in New Orleans in February. 
A month later, he was fourth in the Louisiana Derby, beaten only 2 1/2 
lengths despite some traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Arkansas Derby, Keen said anyone who saw the colt's  
troubled trip in the Louisiana Derby should not have been shocked 
by his performance at Oaklawn. ``Normally, you don't want to throw 
a maiden to the wolves. This colt showed us so much talent, we 
thought we'd take a shot,'' Keen said.

<HEADLINE> New Arteries Grown in Laboratory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experiment with pig cells and a machine  
that mimics the pulse of the heart shows that new, living arteries 
can be grown in the laboratory to replace diseased vessels, an 
important step in the developing field of making new body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Laura A. Niklason of Duke University, leader of the research  
team that made the pig arteries, said that the vessels ``are 
indistinguishable from the native structure. They are completely 
smooth, glistening structures inside and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason, first author of a study that appears Friday in the  
journal Science, said that although the experiment used pigs, it 
demonstrated that it is fundamentally possible to grow new arteries 
to replace those that have become clogged or blocked by heart 
disease. She said engineered, living arteries may someday be used 
in human heart bypasses instead of the leg veins that doctors now 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is proof that one can take a vessel from an adult animal,  
make an artery and then put it back in and have it work,'' said 
Niklason. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of labs are now experimenting with tissue culture  
techniques designed to grow new body parts. Some have grown 
ligaments, tendons, bone and even a new ear. But Niklason said her 
experiment was different because the incubation machine 
rhythmically pumped nutrients through the developing cells, 
imitating the pressures from a beating heart. 
</P>
<P>
	This pulsation, she said, increased the strength of the finished  
artery and made it last longer when it was transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first tissue engineering in a lab system that  
tried to mimic the pulse in the human body,'' she said. ``Other 
tissue engineering has been done in a static system where there was 
no real attempt to copy what is happening so far as the push and 
pull of pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles A. Vacanti, director of the Center for Tissue  
Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, said 
Niklason's work ``is an important advance in tissue engineering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vacanti, whose work includes growing a new thumb bone for one  
patient, said that so much is unknown about how nature makes new 
tissue that ``the best thing you can do is mimic the human body. 
She (Niklason) has demonstrated that that principal is true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her experiment, Niklason made a tube resembling an artery  
from a polymer material. This tube would eventually dissolve, but 
it acted as a scaffold for the developing tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason then removed a small segment of a neck artery from a  
pig and from this vessel took some smooth muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The tube was placed in a machine that circulates a broth that  
includes cell nutrients and oxygen. The tube was then seeded with 
the pig smooth muscle cells. A pump sent pulses of nutrient through 
the tube, feeding the cells and causing them to grow new cells. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 weeks, the polymer tube had been replaced by a tube of  
smooth muscle cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason then added endothelial cells, the tissue that lines  
arteries. In just three days, the inner surfaces were smoothly 
covered and the artery was complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Arteries made in this way were grafted into the pigs that  
donated the cells and Niklason said that the vessels ``worked 
beautifully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some specimens made without the pulsing system failed after two  
weeks, but the arteries made with the pulsing ``functioned like 
native vessels'' for up to four weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason said it will be years before she is ready to attempt to  
make human arteries, but she predicts that eventually doctors will 
use engineered vessels routinely as replacement parts when 
operating on ailing hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, surgeons must remove up to 24 inches of leg vein in  
order to find segments needed for heart bypass surgery. Often, the 
vein removal causes more complications for patients than does the 
heart bypass itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Niklason said that to make an engineered artery may require only  
about an inch of vein and this would leave the leg vessels 
essentially unaffected.

<HEADLINE> Wedding Websites Step Up Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More and more couples planning a marriage are  
becoming wedded to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples can do much of their research and planning -- from  
picking invitations to booking their honeymoons -- right from their 
own homes. 
</P>
<P>
	That means no more schlepping to the department store to  
register for gifts or sending out mass mailings to inform guests of 
time or location changes. 
</P>
<P>
	But competition in the Internet wedding world is heating up. As  
the space gets more crowded, many bridal sites are intensifying 
their marketing and merchandising strategies to woo shoppers their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest move comes from theknot.com, one of first online  
wedding sites. Later today the company is expected to announce that 
it will get an important boost with a $15 million investment from 
the TV retailer QVC. That will give theknot.com thousands of new 
products and a powerful new way to promote them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't going to be a single wedding site that will  
attract all couples,'' said Kate Delhagen, an analyst with 
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``But they are working hard 
now to get a reputation and become an early leader, just like 
Amazon.com did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's still plenty of room to grow.  
</P>
<P>
	While thousands of couples have turned to these sites, the  
online market is still only a mere fraction of the $35 billion 
spent on weddings each year in the United States. Theknot.com, for 
instance, only expects sales of $4.5 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts anticipate sales to jump sharply in the next few  
years, with much of the gain fueled by an increase in guests buying 
wedding gifts online. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Cassar, an analyst with the Internet research firm Jupiter  
Communications, called the wedding site idea ``an incredible 
niche'' that ``has the potential to be the fastest growing space 
online. But they need to increase the amount of commerce that is 
generated on their sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many hope for a rise in gift buying in the future, right  
now the race is on to lure the bride and groom. 
</P>
<P>
	Theknot.com sees its huge gift registry as an enticing factor.  
Under the deal with QVC, theknot.com gets access to more than 
100,000 new products -- up from the 2,500 now on their site. 
Theknot.com will also promote itself on QVC, the No. 1 television 
retailer, and its Internet arm, iqvc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge in the registry business that you have a  
two-step selling process: One to sell bride and groom and then to 
sell through to the guest,'' David Liu, chief executive of the New 
York-based theknot.com. ``We think this relationship will give us a 
great venue and opportunity to market and reach all of those 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other wedding sites are taking different approaches. The  
weddingchannel.com is aligned with Conde Nast, the publisher of 
Bride's magazine, while weddingnetwork.com is the official site for 
Modern Bride magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Della &AMP; James, a new wedding site, is expected to link up with a  
number of large retailers when it is launched later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	All the exclusively online sites face a growing challenge from  
traditional retailers, like Macy's and Bloomingdale's, which have 
just begun to enter the Internet market. These merchants benefit 
from having both stores and online capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is definitely room for different approaches and  
different personalities in this online space,'' said Delhagen. 
``But the department stores are coming, and while they are late to 
this party, they are powerful.''

<HEADLINE> Nixon's Daughter Will Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Nixon's younger daughter will be  
allowed to testify in a court battle over whether the government 
should compensate her father's estate millions of dollars for 
presidential papers and tapes it seized when he resigned in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn on Thursday rejected a  
Justice Department motion to exclude the testimony of Julie Nixon 
Eisenhower, who is 50 and lives near Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also fought the Nixon estate's plan to have its  
lead attorney, R. Stan Mortenson, testify about the government's 
chief appraiser, but the judge has not decided whether to allow 
Mortenson take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing on Wednesday, Justice Department attorney  
Neil Koslowe accused the estate of trying to call the two new 
witnesses to present new information in the rebuttal stage of the 
case. He said this would delay the trial and force the government 
to take new depositions and possibly recall witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government did not comment on the judge's ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, which has lasted 69 days, government witnesses  
have testified that the former president had no intention of 
selling any of his presidential materials. The government contends 
that if anything must be paid to compensate the Nixon estate, a 
fair market value for the materials would be no more than $2.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Appraisers for the Nixon estate place the value at $30 million  
or more -- and with interest, compensation could total $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After the hearing Wednesday, Mortenson said Mrs. Eisenhower was  
expected to testify that her father planned to put his papers in a 
traditional presidential library. If he had known the government 
was not going to establish one, his plans would have changed and 
some items might have been sold to ensure proper funding for a 
private repository, Mortenson said.

<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Poverty Program Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Milwaukee experiment began with a simple  
philosophy: People working full-time shouldn't be living in 
poverty. It offered child care, health insurance and extra cash in 
hopes of lifting the working poor toward the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
	Now researchers have concluded it worked -- increasing earnings  
and decreasing poverty while improving children's performance in 
school. Their findings, being released Friday, are sure to be 
examined by states worried that people streaming off the welfare 
rolls are still dwelling in the economic basement. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many ways, this is sort of a vision of a new kind of social  
contract: If you are willing to work full time, we will make it 
worth your while,'' said Robert Granger, who directed the study of 
the New Hope Program for Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants who were working full time were entitled to free  
child care and health care, plus extra payments that would bring 
their income to the poverty line. For those who couldn't find work, 
New Hope offered short-term, full-time community service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers found the program cut in half the number of people  
who had never worked and boosted participants' incomes by 13 
percent. The results are particularly notable because people 
outside the program were likely to work on their own, thanks to a 
strong economy and pressure from Wisconsin's tough welfare program. 
Still, the New Hope participants did even better. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the program's inception, many states, including Wisconsin,  
have begun offering some of the same services, sometimes to the 
working poor as well as people on welfare. More money is now 
available for child care and a new program to get health insurance 
to children in working poor families. The federal earned income tax 
credit has been expanded, giving more of the working poor the 
chance to sharply cut or eliminate their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hope went further, particularly by offering the  
community service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Harris began in New Hope with a community service job  
when she couldn't find anything on her own and is earning $10 an 
hour today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would just get interviews and the letters would come saying  
they found someone more qualified, with more experience,'' said 
Harris, who had been on welfare for a few years when she joined the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	She started taking messages and filing papers at a community  
health clinic. Then, when her six months of community service ran 
out, she got a regular job in the billing department. In the 
meantime, the program made sure she had health insurance and child 
care and gave her extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	Those perks are gone now; participants were only allowed three  
years in the program, but Harris is still working. In fact, 
researchers found that most people who took community service jobs 
found regular work afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hope was designed by a local nonprofit group as an  
experiment to see if offering support services could encourage 
full-time work and lift people out of poverty. It was funded by 
grants from foundations and the city, state and federal 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	It enrolled about 700 people in 1994 and 1995 and closed last  
year. Another 700 people who showed interest in the program were 
not enrolled so researchers could measure the impact of the program 
by comparing participants to the nonparticipants. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hope had different effects for those who were working and  
those who were not when they entered the program: 
</P>
<P>
	--Two-thirds of the participants were not working full time when  
they enrolled, and after two years, only 6 percent of them hadn't 
worked at all. That compared to 13 percent of nonparticipants. 
Participants earned 13 percent more -- an average of $1,389 over two 
years -- than the nonparticipants, not counting the wage supplement. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-third of the participants were already working full time  
when they enrolled in New Hope. The program did not increase their 
earnings, but it encouraged them to cut back on overtime and second 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it improved parent-child relationships,  
``possibly because these families were better able to balance work 
and family life,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> 4,500 Protest NYC Police Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of people walked across the Brooklyn  
Bridge in the largest gathering yet against alleged police abuse 
targeting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was arrested in Thursday's protest, which began outside  
the Brooklyn federal courthouse and ended four hours later in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimated about 4,500 people attended. Marchers included  
former New York City mayor David Dinkins and entertainers Harry 
Belafonte, Ossie Davis and Dick Gregory. 
</P>

	The number of protesters exceeded those of the previous  
demonstrations in the wake of the February shooting of West African 
immigrant Amadou Diallo, and the alleged 1997 station house torture 
of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, who was unarmed, was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by  
four white officers as they searched for a rape suspect in the 
Bronx. The officers have been charged with second-degree murder.

	The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the event, called for  
greater federal scrutiny of New York police.

intervene in policing in New York,'' Sharpton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	Postal Service tips on mailing tax forms:  
</P>
<P>
	--Use first-class postage. The Internal Revenue Service  
recognizes the first-class letter postmark as proof that a return 
has been mailed on time. 
</P>
<P>
	--Include a return address.  
</P>
<P>
	--Use sufficient postage. Tax agencies do not accept postage due  
mail; tax returns bearing insufficient postage will be returned, 
meaning taxpayers will be penalized for filing late tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid the mad rush at the post office. Mail returns in local  
mail collection boxes, but remember to make certain that the posted 
pickup time has not passed to ensure returns will have an April 15 
postmark. 
</P>
<P>
	--For customers who send original receipts to tax agencies,  
registered mail is a good choice.

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Derby Winner Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK (AP) -- Oaklawn Park asked state racing authorities  
Thursday to investigate whether jockey Billy Patin used an 
electrical device to make his horse run faster when it won the 
Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol had not won in two outings before last Saturday's  
$500,000 Arkansas Derby and was a 30-1 shot when the horses left 
the gate. He paid $62.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn president Charles J. Cella told a hastily called meeting  
of the state Racing Commission that he wanted the commission to 
investigate. He said an employee found a device on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the commission to order the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse to the owner and rider and have race 
stewards investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted unanimously to go along with both requests.  
When the motion to suspend the purse came up for a vote, Cella 
intervened to make certain the purse suspension applied to the 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella also said that, if the commission decides the rules of  
racing were violated, ``those involved should be dealt with in the 
appropriate and severe manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol owner James D. Jackson of Rockdale, Texas, said he was  
``absolutely distraught'' about the situation. He told The 
Sentinel-Record in Hot Springs that legal action would be ``very 
shortly under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denied use of an electrical device by the trainer or jockey.  
He also said the first he heard about the investigation was from 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, at a Grand Prairie, Texas, motel for the races at Lone  
Star Park, called the investigation a ``witch hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patin was scheduled to ride Dixie Gem in Thursday night's second  
race at Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Texas, but he was not 
available and was replaced on the horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-place check for the race was to be $300,000.  
Withholding those earnings would put Valhol's status in question 
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. If there are more than 20 3-year-olds 
entered at Louisville, preference goes to the top 20 in graded 
money earned. The Arkansas Derby is a Grade II race and the 
first-place check would easily qualify Valhol for a spot in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials first became aware of possible  
irregularities in the running of the Arkansas Derby shortly after 
the race was declared official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately informed the stewards and the local  
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau -- the investigative branch of 
the thoroughbred racing industry,'' Cella said. ``By Monday night 
and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered additional evidence 
regarding the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence also was turned over to the national office of the  
TRPB in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties have concurred that the evidence is substantial  
enough to warrant further investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said an Oaklawn employee found an electronic device on  
the racetrack sometime after the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen it and I think, at this time, it's best for us  
to not comment,'' Alexander said. ``All the evidence will come out 
at a later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about the evidence, Alexander said the commission had  
been aware of Oaklawn's investigation for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to have hard cold facts to start an investigation,'' he  
said. ``If we did not feel there was an infraction, we would not be 
having this meeting today.''

<HEADLINE> Endangered Species Act Shift Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some conservationists say an effort to make  
the 1973 Endangered Species Act more landowner-friendly would put 
taxpayers in the position of paying property owners for merely 
following the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill that would require the government to compensate owners  
for taking measures to protect endangered species -- by not killing 
wildlife or destroying their habitat -- ``is a shotgun blast that 
would cripple the ESA and the irreplaceable fish, wildlife, and 
plant species that depend on it,'' Steven Shimberg, a National 
Wildlife Federation vice president, told the House Resources 
Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the bill said they want to protect endangered  
species, but also want to provide relief to landowners, who are 
bearing too much of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is wrong to force some people alone to bear public burdens  
which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public 
as a whole,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, committee chairman and 
sponsor of the bill. The measure would require the federal 
government, in its efforts to protect wildlife, to minimize any 
impact on property rights or compensate the owner with taxpayers' 
money for any loss of use of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., has introduced a package of bills,  
similar to legislation has been unsuccessful in the past, to update 
wildlife protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said he wants to protect people who find themselves in  
situations similar to that of a constituent who wanted to open a 
recycling business on 20 acres in the central California community 
of McKittrick, but balked when a federal agency said he would have 
to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to get a permit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and  
Wildlife Service asked the landowner to buy an additional 380 acres 
of land for a wildlife refuge to mitigate any harm the recycling 
business would cause to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Each acre cost about $1,000, Thomas said. ``This is simply  
extortion, plain and simple,'' he told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Endangered Species Act became law 25 years ago, few  
lawmakers imagined the controversy it would unleash: fights pitting 
the protection of plants and animals against the rights of humans 
to own and manage their land, perform their jobs and meet the needs 
of a growing population. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures deemed necessary to protect such wildlife as the snail  
darter, spotted owl, kangaroo rat, Delhi fly, and black-spored 
quillwort have caused headaches for landowners, bringing many 
projects to a temporary or permanent halt. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I voted for the ESA in 1973, Congress was not told that  
this law would be used to force private property owners to set 
aside land for habitat for species against their will and without 
being compensated for the loss of their property,'' Young said. 
``And if they aren't willing to set aside their land, the federal 
government can put them in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Shimberg said efforts to improve the law, which has strong  
support from the public, should concentrate on providing financial 
incentives for property owners to go beyond the law's requirements 
by taking action to benefit endangered wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paying people not to do the wrong thing defies common sense  
and would be a raid on the treasury,'' Shimberg said. Landowners 
who feel they have been mistreated by the government already have 
recourse in the courts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Young's bill, private property owners ``would be free to  
bulldoze sea turtle and shorebird nesting beaches and to chop down 
eagle nesting trees,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1142.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Touts Her Credentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole talked tough: Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic ``ought to be labeled a war criminal'' 
and President Clinton must ``use all the power necessary'' to win 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	When a midshipman stood to ask whether she would risk her own  
family's blood in that faraway region, she stammered a yes. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole went to the U.S. Naval Academy on Wednesday night to  
prove her mettle on foreign policy and earn a more serious look 
from campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the former American Red Cross president departs --  
as a private citizen -- for the Kosovar refugee camps in Macedonia 
and Albania to ``let the refugees know that we care and hear their 
plea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The not-quite candidate for the Republican presidential  
nomination is methodically answering criticism that she's taken no 
hard stands on issues. In a speech in California, for instance, she 
said she opposed abortion, but that a constitutional ban was 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night, in an address titled ``Hawkish World View,''  
Mrs. Dole adopted a hard line -- to some 4,000 midshipmen in their 
summer whites -- on why she should succeed Clinton as their 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credibility counts. And if you have any question about that,  
look at the U.N. weapons inspections mess in Iraq, or today's 
tragedy in Kosovo,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, whose husband, Bob, has served as Clinton's envoy to  
the Balkans, accused Clinton of being wishy-washy in his ultimatums 
to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	She tackled head-on the politically volatile question of sending  
U.S. ground troops into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the NATO commanders and the Joint Chiefs of Staff say that  
ground troops are required to accomplish our goals, then my answer 
is 'yes,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first midshipmen called upon by a moderator during the  
question-and-answer period asked: 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you willing to send your own sons and daughters to bleed  
in Kosovo, ma'am?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his classmates ``ooooh'ed'' at his audacity, Mrs. Dole  
said yes -- without mentioning that she has no children -- then 
fumbled in repeating her line about approving troops if recommended 
by military brass. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's unnamed target, her aides said, was Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, considered her strongest competition for the 2000 
GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been criticized for what The Wall Street Journal's  
editorial page called a ``vague and tepid ... almost Clintonian'' 
statement on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior Dole adviser said she wanted to contrast herself with  
Bush by emphasizing her advantage in foreign policy experience. 
</P>
<P>
	When one questioner pressed Mrs. Dole to elaborate on her call  
for the defense of Taiwan against China, she appeared flustered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been out of the Red Cross now for three months and  
there's some issues where I want to take a very careful and 
thoughtful approach before going forward with the positions,'' she 
said. ``I am not yet an announced candidate, much less the elected 
nominee of the party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like the Cold War-era Ronald Reagan whose name she  
invoked, Mrs. Dole spoke expansively about the immediate need for a 
missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the possible expense of education funding?  
</P>
<P>
	``If indeed our country is vulnerable to rogue nations  
developing nuclear weapons that can strike the United States, then 
there's not going to be much opportunity for education. We have to 
protect ourselves -- that's first,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She ticked off her travels as Cabinet secretary and with the Red  
Cross: to aviation talks in Beijing; labor talks with Poland's 
Solidarity union; and to the Croatian-Bosnian border stations for 
prisoners from Serbian detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole veered from her text to tell of visiting a Red Cross  
camp in Congo where Rwandan orphans were too ill to be clothed. 
``We had to just keep washing them down, these poor little 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She did not say what America should have done to prevent the  
Rwandan genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Carl Zeppegno of the academy's Class of 2000, Mrs.  
Dole knows from her Red Cross work -- and from her marriage to a 
severely injured World War II veteran -- the risks of military 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's seen firsthand what we're up against and she understands  
that we have a limited capability when we're sent out with our 
hands tied behind our backs,'' said Zeppegno. 
</P>
<P>
	Min Chung, Class of '99, said he liked what he heard from Mrs.  
Dole but was holding out for a candidate with ``prior military 
service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's speech came in advance of a planned Washington  
fund-raiser later this month, the first in a series. She has banked 
a disappointing fraction of the $6 million that Bush raked in 
during the first three months of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Raise Tax Issue / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Philip Morris will hold meetings in  
Atlanta next week to outline what some tobacco growers believe may 
lead to the end of the auction system. 
</P>
<P>
	If the company, the nation's largest tobacco buyer with nearly  
half the U.S. cigarette market, pushes for a different system of 
sales, burley growers are threatening to support President 
Clinton's proposed 55-cent increase in the tax on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be fools not to pursue looking at what the administration  
has to offer,'' said Rod Kuegel, president of the Burley Tobacco 
Growers Co-operative Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette-makers have often relied on farmers to lobby  
Washington, and that has given farmers some leverage with the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuegel said that during talks earlier this year on the tax  
increase, White House policy makers indicated that some of the $8 
billion expected to be generated by the tax increase could go to 
provide economic help for tobacco growers. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Kuegel told the White House he could not support an  
increased tax on cigarette companies while negotiating for a trust 
fund for farmers hurt by the tobacco master settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the companies move to kill off the auction system, all  
bets are off despite language in both the $206 billion (Phase One) 
master tobacco settlement and the $5.15 billion (Phase Two) grower 
trust fund deal that links payments to consumption and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can get a nickel of excise tax, I'll take it over both  
Phase One and Phase Two,'' Kuegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	That nickel would be enough for a buy-out -- farmers who wanted  
to could get out of the business; those who stay face contract 
growing or selective buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris has invited burley and flue-cured tobacco growers  
to separate meetings in Atlanta next week to clarify the company's 
position on selling by auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear it's to announce a pilot project of non-auction sales  
for burley and flue-cured tobacco,'' Kuegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris spokesman Mike Pfeil said earlier this week that  
the company plans ``to explore options relative to the purchase of 
tobacco ... but we are clearly not moving away from the auction 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most farmers don't see it that way, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different from the beginning of the end of the  
auctions,'' Kuegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost all tobacco is sold at warehouses by what is  
ostensibly an auction, a system set up during the Depression. The 
tobacco is classified by USDA graders, and a minimum price is set 
for each grade. Buyers for tobacco companies walk down row after 
row of pallets of tobacco, indicating at each one how much more 
than the support price they are willing to pay. Tobacco they don't 
buy is eventually sold to the ``pool'' of surplus stock owned by 
the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
	Most burley growers support the auction system as a way of  
maintaining the guaranteed price. 
</P>
<P>
	But some farmers would support the idea of a more free and open  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ending the auction system has short-term appeal,'' Kuegel  
said, ``but it's a danger to the price-support system ... and a 
danger ultimately to the quota system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the companies develop relationships with large growers, he  
said, the cigarette-makers will persuade them to get rid of quotas 
so the farmers can grow as much tobacco as they want.

<HEADLINE> Media Frenzy Following Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Hours before what may have been Wayne  
Gretzky's final NHL game in his native Canada, Ottawa Senators 
goaltender Ron Tugnutt looked forward to perhaps being part of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a bench-clearing brawl during the warmup so I  
can go out and grab his stick,'' Tugnutt joked Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran goalie is among those who don't believe the  
38-year-old Gretzky will retire after the New York Rangers' final 
regular-season game on Sunday, but the commotion at the Corel 
Centre could not be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers opted not to have a game-day skate, keeping Gretzky  
well clear of the media mob that has begun to track his every move. 
Instead, the reporters invaded the usually tranquil Senators' 
dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	There, they found consensus on one issue -- if Gretzky opts to  
retire after 20 record-setting seasons, it won't be because he no 
longer contributes on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Gretzky's reasons are for pondering retirement -- a sore  
back, a losing team in New York, the stifling trap system of the 
1990s, having reached all the milestones -- they can't include no 
longer being able to help his team win. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hands are still there -- they haven't gone anywhere,'' said  
Tugnutt. ``It's strange to say, but he's more dangerous behind the 
net than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a talent no one else has.''  
</P>
<P>
	Behind the net -- Gretzky's ``office'' that he uses for pinpoint  
passes to wings and charging defensemen -- has been his favorite 
setup spot since he broke into the league in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gretzky went into the Ottawa game with only nine goals  
-- well below his 1981-82 record of 92 -- he had 52 assists, better 
than all but an elite handful in the 27-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the blue-line in, he's still one of the best at finding  
an open man and making things happen,'' said Senators wing Daniel 
Alfredsson. ``When I'm 38, I hope I can still walk. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't have the same speed, but he reads the game as well  
as anybody. Before he gets the puck, he knows what he's going to do 
with it. He's one of the few guys who can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Alfredsson first witnessed the magic when the  
Gretzky Tour - a pickup team of NHLers organized during the 1994-95 
NHL lockout -- visited his Frolunda club in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we lost 5-3, but that was a special game for me,''  
Alfredsson said. ``He's probably the best player ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope he plays another year. It's a treat just to watch  
him play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In agreement was Senators coach Jacques Martin.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still a factor in a game,'' Martin said. ``Look at his  
production with the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still an elite player with tremendous skill and  
anticipation. If you don't watch him, he'll hurt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz over Gretzky's possible retirement made the Senators  
the hottest ticket in Ottawa, clearly overshadowing the team's race 
with New Jersey for first place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senators did not feel slighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a game we remember forever,'' Alfredsson said.

<HEADLINE> Verdict May Hurt Malaysian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A landmark verdict against a  
former deputy prime minister may be galvanizing opposition to 
Malaysia's long-ruling leader rather than stifling it. 
</P>
<P>
	Political science professor Chandra Muzaffar said Thursday the  
six-year jail term given to former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim will come back to haunt his former mentor now political 
nemesis, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political actors in this conspiracy wanted to render Anwar  
totally impotent,'' the professor said. ``But this stiff sentence 
will further erode Mahathir's leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syed Husin Ali, head of the Malaysian People's Party, echoed  
similar sentiments, saying the political reform movement that Anwar 
represents will only be strengthened by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``His struggle for justice will go on, though, and now we are  
more determined than ever,'' Syed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand Malaysians took to the streets after Anwar was  
convicted of corruption Wednesday, staging the most violent 
demonstrations this placid Southeast Asian capital has seen in 
years. More than 200 people, mostly students, gathered in downtown 
Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to protest the verdict. Several were 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday in a  
decision that effectively bans him from politics for a decade, 
since Malaysian law bars him from office for at least five years 
after he is freed. 
</P>
<P>
	He had repeatedly declared his innocence, saying he was the  
victim of a political conspiracy to eliminate his challenge to 
Mahathir's 18-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in Thursday's edition of The New York Times,  
Anwar said he was seen as a threat because he refused to carry out 
Mahathir's ``business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I became dangerous ... I had widespread support for my work  
toward democracy and civil society. So I was accused of sex crimes, 
treason and corruption and expelled from government and party,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has fallen to Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to carry out her  
husband's crusade to rid Malaysia of corruption and Mahathir. 
</P>
<P>
	She has become a political beacon in her own right and drew some  
8,000 supporters to a late-night meeting shortly after saying 
good-bye to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I am more determined than ever,'' she said, ``to carry out  
my husband's struggle for justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Augustine Paul, who found Anwar guilty on all four  
corruption charges, had served as judge and jury during the 
sensational 7-month trial. He said of his ruling, ``In this 
judgment, I am answerable to God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some believe Paul answered only to Mahathir, who publicly  
condemned Anwar for corruption, sodomy and adultery even before any 
charges against Anwar were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Vice President Al Gore said he was ``profoundly  
troubled'' by Anwar's prison term and warned that his conviction 
could affect the Malaysian economy, as countries that allow dissent 
cope better with economic crises. The United States is Malaysia's 
largest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly, investors put their money and their faith in  
democracies, and pull it out of nations where decisions are rigged, 
where contracts are not honored, where governments use the power of 
the police to quiet the criticism that could create a more just, 
more prosperous society,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said the sentence raised ``doubts about the  
fairness of the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's 73-year-old prime minister, still recovering from a  
10-day hospital stay for a lung infection, has made no public 
comment on the conviction of the man he groomed for a decade to 
take his place until firing Anwar in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But an editorial in the government-backed New Straits Times on  
Thursday declared that Anwar was ``properly and fairly tried'' and 
deserved the severe sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the adage goes, the higher you are, the harder you fall,''  
it said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Scoured for Next Ronaldo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A budding teen-age soccer star is  
spotted by Dutch scouts and whisked away to Europe. But he balks at 
a multimillion-dollar transfer to the Ukraine and flees back to 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the storyline of a popular Brazilian TV soap opera, but the  
premise is real. Europe's top soccer clubs are racing to sign 
promising young Brazilians, in hopes they will become tomorrow's 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	Some clubs have contracts with local scouts and coaches,  
granting them priority for a potential diamond in the rough. 
</P>
<P>
	Feyenoord of the Netherlands thinks it found one in Alan Vicente  
do Rego. In January, it signed the 13-year-old after he was 
recommended by the director of a neighborhood soccer school linked 
to the Dutch club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alan now has a Brazilian `nanny,' who is a club employee,  
looking after him in Holland,'' says the director, Jose Joao. ``He 
phones me to tell me about the goals he scores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, the only country to win four World Cups, is the world's  
biggest exporter of soccer players. In 1998, some 530 players left 
to play abroad, up from 152 players in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely a decade ago, only established stars were signed by  
European clubs, usually for huge transfer fees. But today, many 
youngsters head overseas in their early teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo, twice voted FIFA player of the year, was only 16 when  
Cruzeiro acquired him in 1993 from second-division side Sao 
Cristovao for just $10,000. A season later, he was sold to the 
Dutch club PSV Eindhoven for $6 million. When he transferred to 
Internazionale of Milan, his value had tripled. 
</P>
<P>
	Inter is looking for more Ronaldos at the source. The club has  
just concluded a deal with the modest Madureira club of Rio, 
allowing the Italians to keep tabs on youngsters 11 to 13 from four 
soccer schools run by Madureira. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inter pays us $70,000 a year for the soccer school's coaches  
and uniforms and they come to look at players,'' says Madureira 
president Elias Duba. ``If they sign one when he reaches 16 or 17, 
we get 50 percent of his eventual resale price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duba says Internazionale is currently jostling with Italian  
first-division rivals AC Milan, Juventus and Udinese to sign 
Madureira's stars Leo and Souza, both members of Brazil's under-17 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
	The blossoming of young talent far from Brazil sometimes takes  
fans here by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Brazilians had never heard of Elber, star forward of  
Germany's Bayern Munich, until he was named to the national team 
last year. Now 27, Elber left to play abroad as a little-known 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a bitter pill to swallow. Rio sports daily Lance! is  
campaigning to stem the ``talent outflow brightening Sundays in 
other countries.'' If local clubs were better run and more 
profitable, the paper said, players wouldn't have to go abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Internazionale and Feyenoord have open and aboveboard  
links with local soccer schools, other clubs have more obscure 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many European clubs have representatives in Brazil who look  
for young players of 13 and 14, but they are pirates and don't care 
about boys they contract,'' says Leo Rabello, president of Brazil's 
Association of Soccer Agents, recognized by FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some clubs are happy if just one of 20 boys they sign makes it  
(as a professional),'' Rabello says. ``But the others lose 
confidence and jeopardize their careers or end up playing in remote 
places like Tunisia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the risk, Joao, the soccer school director, says  
youngsters from poor families should seize the chance to move to a 
wealthy foreign club. 
</P>
<P>
	``One ex-pupil of mine who is 16 and at Feyenoord is now the  
breadwinner in his family,'' says Joao. ``He has moved his family 
out of a shantytown and into Rio's smartest neighborhood and got 
his brother a job as his chauffeur,'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he had joined a Brazilian club, he says, the teenager might  
still be destitute. 
</P>
<P>
	``When young players start to train with a club in Brazil, they  
have to pay their bus fare to get there,'' Joao says. ``They don't 
get help with simple things like permission to miss school classes. 
Many tell me they have given up because it's not worth the 
effort.''

<HEADLINE> Drug-maker Pfizer Stock Plummets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc.'s stock skidded 10 percent Thursday  
after the drug company reported a drop in sales of Viagra and 
warned that profit growth would slow in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, which released its first-quarter results Thursday, said  
it will fall far short of the 35 percent profit growth it enjoyed 
last spring due to the explosive initial sales of the 
anti-impotence pill Viagra. Pfizer also hinted that overall 1999 
earnings would be slightly below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the just-ended quarater, Pfizer earned $815 million, or 62  
cents per share, up 27 percent from $692 million, or 53 cents a 
share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer revenues jumped 29 percent to $3.93 billion from $3.04  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings met analysts' expectations, according to surveys by  
First Call. Yet, many traders had quietly hoped the company would 
beat Wall Street's already rosy forecasts. Pfizer stock fell $14.63 
to $130 on Thursday in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Pfizer could have posted higher profits, but  
instead chose to spend more on research and building its sales 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very smart strategy for the long haul, but does not  
help the short term,'' said Steven Gerber, an analyst with CIBC 
Oppenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer, the world's fourth-largest drug company, has been a  
pharmaceutical dynamo the past three years. It owns or sells the 
three fastest growing new drugs in pharmaceutical history: Viagra; 
the cholesterol drug Lipitor, which it markets with Warner-Lambert; 
and the arthritis pill Celebrex, which it markets with Monsanto. 
</P>
<P>
	The three drugs combined are expected to generate more than $4  
billion in 1999 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	With such high expectations, analysts said Pfizer's stock was  
vulnerable to a big selloff, especially during a week when 
investors are moving from growth stocks to cyclical stocks, those 
that tend to rise and fall with the economy, and to smaller company 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said profit growth would be in the single digits in the  
second quarter, far below the 20 percent to 30 percent Wall Street 
has come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer posted $193 million in worldwide Viagra sales during the  
first quarter, down 18 percent from $236 million in the fourth 
quarter. In the second quarter of 1998, Viagra had $411 million in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Viagra sales rose slightly to $149 million in the first  
quarter of 1999, up from $131 million in the prior three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra sales should improve markedly in the second quarter with  
the drug's launch in Japan and Canada, Pfizer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weak Viagra sales in the United States were attributed to the  
leveling off of the curiosity factor related to the drug and to 
limits insurers have placed on coverage for it, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the demand for the first-ever impotence pill are  
startling. More than 9 million prescriptions have been written for 
4 million patients since its launch in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the Viagra problems, as far as overall sales and  
earnings growth, Pfizer is still a rising company,'' said Hemant 
Shah, analyst with HKS &AMP; Co. in Warren, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer's biggest-selling drug, Norvasc, a hypertension  
medication, posted a 24 percent increase in first quarter sales to 
$703 million. Sales of the antibiotic Zithromax rose 44 percent to 
$441 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues that Pfizer gets from marketing other companies' drugs,  
such as Lipitor and Celebrex, rose 168 percent to $403 million.

<HEADLINE> Unisys Profit Almost Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Unisys Corp. nearly doubled its  
first-quarter profit and easily beat Wall Street predictions, 
helped by strong demand for the company's computer services and big 
business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys reported on Thursday that it earned $111.2 million, or 32  
cents a share in the three months ended March 31. That was up from 
a profit of $62.7 million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew 10 percent to $1.81 billion from $1.65 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The profit greatly exceeded the 24 cents a share expected by  
analysts surveyed by First Call. Unisys stock closed down 31 1/4 cents 
at $29 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys partly cited strong sales of business computers called  
servers, which run networks of smaller machines, saying that more 
customers needed powerful computers to handle Internet 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Weinbach, Unisys' chief executive officer hired in  
September 1997, is overseeing a shift at the company from computer 
manufacturing to computer services. Unisys employs 33,200 people.

<HEADLINE> Gooden Hurt, Shocked by Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Dwight Gooden, perhaps better than anyone,  
understands the demons of addiction that may have gotten to his 
good friend, Darryl Strawberry, again. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Gooden learned Strawberry had been arrested on charges  
of possession of cocaine and soliciting a prostitute, his pain was 
masked by the special bond he shares with his former teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' Gooden said. ``I was hurt. I don't have all  
the results of what happened but I can feel for what he's going 
through right now. I've been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden was informed of Strawberry's situation at 2 a.m. Thursday  
morning when he received a call from Ron Dock, the drug aftercare 
sponsor he shares with Strawberry. Dock had been in Tampa, Fla., 
with Strawberry, who was attempting to come back from colon cancer 
surgery this season with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't get very much sleep last night after that,'' Gooden  
said Thursday before the Cleveland Indians game with the Kansas 
City Royals was postponed by rain. ``I was just tossing and 
turning. You try and stay away from asking yourself, why? You just 
try and wonder what happened. What led to that? I really don't have 
any answers but I feel for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden and Strawberry once owned New York as teammates in the  
1980s with the Mets, and later their friendship would grow stronger 
as each resurrected turbulent careers when they were reunited with 
the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, who said he speaks to Strawberry regularly, said he was  
unable to reach his friend Thursday afternoon to offer him support. 
He desperately wanted to talk with Strawberry to remind him he was 
there to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always there for me, and I'll always be there for  
him,'' Gooden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was first there for Gooden in 1984 when the pitcher  
arrived at spring training with the Mets as a shy, introverted 
rookie. Strawberry took Gooden under his wing and taught him how to 
walk and talk like a ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
	In his recent autobiography ``Heat'', Gooden recalled Strawberry  
telling him, ``Look at you. You got your head down all the time 
like you're embarrassed to be here. You can't even look anyone in 
the eye. I've seen you. I know how good you are. You just don't 
know it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two became fast friends and were part of the group of Mets  
who loved to play hard and live fast. It wasn't enough to beat the 
Astros on a Tuesday night, those Mets went out all night partying 
before coming to the ballpark and doing it all over again the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden and Strawberry stayed tight for years, and Gooden  
recalled that after he was suspended for the entire 1995 season for 
drug abuse, it was Strawberry who picked him up when he was 
discharged from the Betty Ford Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden considered Strawberry a brother then and now.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still the same,'' Gooden said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gooden said he didn't know all the details of Strawberry's  
arrest and wanted to learn more before rushing to any kind of 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very tough,'' he said. ``I feel it.''  
</P>
<P>
	While in Boston for the division series against the Red Sox last  
October, Gooden learned Strawberry had been diagnosed with colon 
cancer and would need surgery. The feeling of helplessness 
overwhelmed him, and he nearly broke down in tears while talking on 
the phone to Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's news was equally devastating but for a different  
reason, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year in Boston I felt real bad and I felt helpless  
because I don't have any knowledge with that (cancer) so there was 
nothing I could really do but let him know I was there for him,'' 
Gooden said. ``This situation here I can relate so there's more 
pain. Because I've been there.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Still Not Saying Who's No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Everyone seems to know what the Browns are  
going to do with their No. 1 pick. Everyone, that is, but the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Months of speculation, rumors and analysis on this year's NFL  
draft has been reduced to hours, and it won't be long before NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue officially puts Cleveland ``on the 
clock'' for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So, will the Browns use the overall No. 1 on Tim Couch? Akili  
Smith? Or Ricky Williams? Will they trade it and then trade it 
again? Can they punt? 
</P>
<P>
	Confused? Who isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm really in the dark,'' Smith, Oregon's  
rifle-armed quarterback said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really heard anything,'' said Couch, who will appear  
Thursday night on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticks down toward Saturday's draft, the Browns  
insist they still haven't decided what they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have them taking Couch with the first selection as long  
as a contract can be worked out with his agent, Tom Condon of 
Cleveland-based IMG, before Saturday. But the Browns maintain they 
haven't anointed the Kentucky quarterback the chosen one yet, and 
that it's still a three-man race for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually in continuing negotiations with agents for all  
three of the picks under consideration,'' Browns team spokesman 
Alex Martins said Thursday. ``The organization has not made a final 
determination as of this point as to which player we will select on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiating process will continue over the course of the  
next few days, and we don't anticipate making a decision on the 
pick until Saturday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same thing the Browns said last month, and again last  
week. So either they're still unsure of who to take or they're 
playing a mean game of poker, savoring every moment of holding an 
unbeatable hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Whomever the Browns take first will be a rich man. Condon is  
reportedly seeking a seven-year, $44 million deal plus a $12 
million signing bonus. Last year, the Indianapolis Colts gave the 
top pick, quarterback Peyton Manning, a six-year, $48 million 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Browns' No. 1 derby comes down to the wire, it appears to  
have become a two-man duel between Couch and Smith. Williams has 
apparently dropped from consideration and will probably be taken by 
Indianapolis with the No. 4 pick after the Colts traded running 
back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and Smith appear together on the cover of this week's  
Sports Illustrated with both wearing Browns No. 99 jerseys -- Couch 
in brown, Smith in white. They're sitting side-by-side as ``Big 
Dawg'', the leader of Cleveland's Dawg Pound stands behind them 
holding a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, director of football operations  
Dwight Clark and other Cleveland front office personnel have spent 
the week behind closed doors dissecting game films, scouting 
profiles and background checks on the pair of passers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a quarterback guru, is thought to favor the more mobile,  
more mature Smith over Couch, who was put through a rigorous, 
90-minute second workout by the Browns in Lexington, Ky., last 
weekend. Palmer was reportedly displeased with Couch's initial 
workout and wanted to see how Couch responded to some hands-on 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who drew wide criticism last year while in San Francisco  
for taking QB Jim Druckenmiller over Jake Plummer, has been a Couch 
proponent and thinks the 21-year-old's ``upside'' may be greater 
than Smith, who is 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever differences may exist, team president Carmen Policy  
promises the Browns will be of ``like mind'' when draft day 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he and Clark have been going over draft day  
scenarios for weeks and feels a difference in opinion is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwight and I have been on the same page since I started with  
the Cleveland Browns,'' he said. ``Every time I've started off in a 
different direction we've come back to the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs Phone Bill Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' monthly telephone bills may become  
easier to understand because of action taken Thursday by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies generally will have to reorganize bills to  
spotlight new charges and service providers, give clear 
descriptions of all charges and explain how to contest them. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, adopted 4-1 by the Federal Communications Commission,  
could take effect in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Local telephone and long-distance companies will have to abide  
by all the provisions, while cellular and other wireless companies 
must comply with just some. Violations could lead to fines or other 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Many big phone companies have begun, or plan to make, changes in  
phone bills to make them easier to understand. Ameritech, 
BellSouth, AT&AMP;T, US West and MCI WorldCom believe their bills meet 
many of the FCC's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to restore Americans' confidence in the charges that  
they are paying every month,'' said Bill Kennard, FCC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone dissenter, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said he believed the  
agency lacked the authority to take such action. He also wondered 
how the agency would judge whether companies' descriptions are 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials acknowledged that it would be subjective  
determination. Also, they could not offer examples of what might 
constitute a clear description for the line-item charges that have 
been appearing on some bills, under different names, for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those charges, which some consumers have said are confusing,  
come from a variety of sources: a FCC overhaul of phone fees; 
itemized charges for government-ordered subsidies once included in 
rates; and paying the costs of complying with other government 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies can recover these costs however they choose. AT&AMP;T, MCI  
WorldCom, Sprint, the nation's Bell companies and others have 
decided to do it through line items. The FCC does not force 
companies to spell out the charges in bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the FCC's new rules, descriptions of those line-item  
charges will have to be clear. Eventually, the labels will be 
standardized, with the wording determined later. If wireless 
companies include such line-items, they also would be subject to 
uniform labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a mischievous notion,'' AT&AMP;T said in a statement,  
adding it is concerned the government ``would seek to dictate how a 
company can describe to its own customers those government fees and 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Strickling, chief of the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau, said  
any company that now describes these line-item charges as 
``federally imposed'' or ``federally mandated'' will have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said they were not acting to avoid being  
associated with the line-items. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also will require local and long-distance companies to  
use clear descriptions about all other charges and provide 
information on when nonpayment could cause phone service to be cut 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the FCC will not apply this provision to wireless  
companies. The FCC does not specify the language for the 
descriptions but encourages the industry to come up with uniform 
wording. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and long-distance companies also will have to highlight --  
the FCC does not say how -- any new provider or charge not on 
previous bills. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the bills will have to show when a person's  
long-distance carrier was switched or the person is charged for 
calls to a hotline. Consumer advocates say this should make it 
easier for customers to spot fraudulent charges.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Long-Haired Stalking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Mich. (AP) -- A man with an apparent hair fetish was  
accused of stalking a long-haired 7-year-old girl and trying to 
break into her family's home in an attempt to cut off her locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philip Thackery, 46, was in jail on $100,000 bond, charged  
with stalking a minor and attempted home invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect approached the girl's mother at a garage sale at the  
family's home last July and offered her $100 for the girl's 
ponytail, Sgt. Jeff Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She, of course, freaked out and shooed him away,'' Turner  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the family -- whose name was withheld to protect the  
child -- reported seeing the man parked near their home at least 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 7, the girl's father was in his car when he noticed a  
man trying to open the front door to their home. His wife and 
daughter, who were inside, called police while the father 
confronted the man, who then left. 
</P>
<P>
	That evening, police arrested Thackery, who is being held  
pending an April 28 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stalking a minor carries a penalty of up to five years in  
prison. Attempted home invasion is punishable by up to 10 years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Avery To Enter NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM (AP) -- Duke guard Will Avery, against the wishes of coach  
Mike Krzyzewski, will join teammate Elton Brand in deciding to 
enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in favor of William's decision at this time,''  
Krzyzewski said in a statement released by the school Thursday. 
``We have done extensive research into the NBA for William and my 
conclusion was that entering the draft now would not be in his best 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, everyone is entitled to make their own decisions. I  
certainly wish him the ultimate success in his future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery told Krzyzewski of his decision late Wednesday night,  
hours after Brand's news conference announcing his decision to turn 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery has an unlisted campus telephone number, and could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski indicated during Brand's news conference that he  
expected Avery to stay at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 point guard, a native of Augusta, Ga., averaged 8.5  
points and 2.5 assists as a freshman backup. He improved to 14.9 
points and 5 per game as a sophomore starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference choice and an  
honorable mention Associated Press All-American.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Resumes Political Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaking in the nation's capital for the first  
time since his stunning resignation as House speaker, Newt Gingrich 
urged an end to the independent counsel law and cautioned the 
Republican presidential candidates to avoid attacks on each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Free from the responsibilities of leading a fractious House  
Republican majority, Gingrich reveled in his new freedom to once 
again offer ideas and suggestions, reverting to the visionary that 
helped the GOP in 1994 end 40 years of Democratic control of the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The occasion was Wednesday's ``Salute to Newt,'' a fund-raiser  
for Gingrich's new political action committee, the Friends of Newt 
Gingrich PAC. More than $500,000 was expected to be raised, with 
some of the proceeds going to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr told members  
of Congress that the law should expire, Gingrich offered a similar 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kill it,'' he said. ``Get rid of it. It has been a  
monstrosity. It criminalized and undermines the process of American 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mentioned as a potential future presidential candidate, Gingrich  
is sitting out the 2000 race, but urged the GOP hopefuls to adopt 
Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment of not criticizing a fellow 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's have a great presidential nominating process with no  
negative ads,'' he said. ``Let the person with the best ideas win 
the nomination. If we don't do that, we're going to have a 
bloodbath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich abruptly announced his resignation after the  
Republicans lost five seats in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to remain active politically, and the  
assembled crowd testified to the clout that the former speaker 
still wields. The entire House Republican leadership was there, led 
by Gingrich's successor as speaker, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, as 
well many of Washington's top lobbyists, including former House 
Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois and former Republican 
National Chairman Haley Barbour. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich was greeted with three standing ovations, and the  
speeches took place against a backdrop of two huge black-and-white 
photos of the former speaker. Guests also received a calendar with 
a different color photo of Gingrich for every month. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be around and be an influence in our party for  
years to come,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	One way Gingrich will remain a political player is through his  
new PAC, which will support Republicans who share the former 
speaker's desires to cap federal, state and local taxes at 25 
percent of a person's income, use some Social Security funds for 
private investment accounts and build a national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich also is setting up a consulting firm but is banned from  
lobbying his former colleagues until January.

<HEADLINE>  Dow Up 35.24; Nasdaq Down 37.32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices were mixed on Wall Street today, with  
blue chips in record high territory for the fourth day in a row but 
technology and consumer stocks dropping once again. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
35.24 at 10,446.90, after rising 16.65 Wednesday to its third 
consecutive closing high of 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 10.52 today to  
1,317.92, and the Nasdaq composite index, which has a high number 
of technology stocks, was off 37.32 at 2,469.96. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's gain in the Dow came at the expense of technology  
and consumer stocks, which investors sold mercilessly to make room 
for cyclical issues, manufacturing and basic-materials stocks that 
are especially sensitive to changes in the economic outlook. That 
trend was continuing this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrial stocks ``are rallying like crazy,'' said Charles  
White, portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``It feels like 
people who have been definitely underweighted in these sectors are 
coming in and buying. We're seeing some of these vast mutual fund 
complexes known for buying value stocks stepping up here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh blow to technology stocks was a warning from Storage  
Technology, a maker of computer storage equipment, that it wouldn't 
meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. Storage Tech 
shares were down 8 1/16 at 18, and they pulled ECM, another 
computer storage company, down 11 7/8 to 113 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical stocks were lower amid investors' rush out of  
consumer shares. Dow member Merck was down 2 9/16 at 75 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports helped some stocks but not others.  
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Boeing's earnings far exceeded expectations,  
sending its shares up 4 at 42. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ford Motor and General Motors posted first-quarter profits  
that surpassed analyst estimates. Ford down 1/2 62 1/4, but GM was down 
2 3/16 at 87 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta Air Lines was down 4 at 67 1/4, even after the company's  
earnings came in above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 504.95 million 
shares, up substantially from Wednesday's pace of 386.13 million.

<HEADLINE> Harlem Globetrotters May Visit Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The Harlem Globetrotters began talks Thursday  
aimed at returning the touring basketball performers to Cuba for 
the first time in nearly 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we started this three years ago it was pretty tough, but  
after the baseball exchange it has gotten a lot easier,'' team 
owner Mannie Jackson said Thursday. He felt the Baltimore Orioles 
had opened the way with their visit for an exhibition game last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really hoping to play here.'' said Jackson. ``We have  
always been ambassadors of goodwill, so this would be great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said that Cuban sports officials seemed very warm about  
his proposal to have the team visit later this year, play the 
national team in Havana and play exhibition games in three or four 
other cities outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is to have the Globetrotters stay for a full week and  
also hold basketball clinics for Cuban youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson had meetings scheduled with Cuban sports officials  
before returning to the United States on Saturday, but said one 
more trip could be necessary before agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hopes that a Cuban national team will be able to play  
the Globetrotters at Madison Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep it out of the political forum and keep it in the  
human forum I think that we'll be OK.,'' said Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Among issues still to be worked out is how to handle any  
proceeds from the games, such as television rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Globetrotters recently completed another U.S. tour and later  
this spring will embark on a swing overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The team has played in 115 countries since being formed by Abe  
Saperstein in the 1940s. Jackson has owned the team since 1993.

<HEADLINE> New Refugee Wave Hits Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLACE, Macedonia (AP) -- Telling authorities that thousands more  
are behind them, refugees poured across Kosovo's border with 
Macedonia on Thursday, driven out by what some called an 
intensifying Serb purge of ethnic Albanian communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in Macedonia's two-day influx of more than 5,500 refugees  
said they left because they heard the border was open and feared 
remaining in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs were shelling Kosovo's southern mountains, where the  
refugees had fled, Kosovo Albanians said. A Serb-controlled TV crew 
in Kosovo reported smoke rising from the mountains on Thursday, and 
villages around the southern city of Urosevac that appeared empty 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
	New arrivals said they had to pay bribes to be allowed to leave  
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took 200 German marks from us. We had to bribe them, or  
they wouldn't let us out,'' said Mimoza Aliu, 18. Others told 
similar stories, including 19-year-old Arbenita Asllani, who said 
Serb forces burned her home in the village of Sojevo, near 
Urosevac. 
</P>
<P>
	Aliaze Kajtaina, said she drove in from Pristina with her son on  
her own after Serb forces burned her house and killed her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarmed by the new influx, Macedonia asked foreign countries to  
accept more of the refugees, saying the world wasn't doing enough 
in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the burden can't fall on two economically weak states in  
the Balkans,'' President Kiro Gligorov said, asking for more aid 
and guarantees of his country's territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia took in more than 120,000 refugees over the past three  
weeks; Albania, more than 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo's conflict has sent more than a half-million refugees  
spilling across in borders in that time, many saying Serbs had 
forced them out. 
</P>
<P>
	After briefly stopping the expulsion for what it said was an  
Orthodox Easter truce, Serbia appears to be sending out steadily 
more refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are expecting more people, and it seems the number is  
increasing exponentially,'' said Paula Ghedini, spokeswoman for the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs were sending trains packed with refugees to a point near  
the border, then telling them to follow railroad tracks for the 
roughly one-hour walk to the border no-man's land between Kosovo 
and Macedonia, at Blace. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people had been waiting for a day at a crossing west  
of Blace, hoping to enter Macedonia. Another 3,000-5,000 were said 
to be behind them, still in Kosovo, Ghedini said, and another 1,000 
were expected at an unofficial crossing.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finished Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Aggressive selling of technology issues pushed  
Tokyo stock prices slightly lower today. The dollar dropped 
marginally against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 37.60 points,  
or 0.22 percent, to close the day at 16,727.08. On Wednesday, the 
average closed up 49.52 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.80 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.39  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 118.68 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Players said the weakness in technology stocks was partly  
prompted by a 76.22 point fall in the technology-rich Nasdaq 
Composite on Wednesday to 2,507.28 -- its fourth largest point 
decline of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also sold because of the recent  
strengthening of the yen, traders said. A weaker dollar reduces the 
value of export earnings when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshihiko Kuroichi, manager of the research department at  
Kankaku Securities, said that technology stocks were ripe for 
profit-taking after recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the decliners was NEC, 33 cents lower at $10.60. Sharp  
fell 13 cents to $11.08, and Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 13 
cents to $19.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo market lost steam after a strong morning, when bank  
shares rose and Sony Corp. issues soared after an announcement 
Wednesday that it will jointly develop and market digital editing 
systems for TV broadcasting with International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 5.42 points, or 0.40 percent, to 
1,337.93. The TOPIX closed up 11.61 points, or 0.87 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 634 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 719.5 million on 
Wednesday. Decliners beat out advancers 632 to 567 while 121 issues 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained early on a wave of  
buying from Japanese trust banks. But selling pressure mounted 
after the Nihon Keizai business newspaper reported Wednesday that 
Japanese life insurers would reduce their investment in U.S. 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 118.63 yen and 119.26 yen on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.27 yen, down  
from 128.74 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.585 percent from its close of 1.645 percent on 
Wednesday, driving its price up to 101.88 yen from 101.35 yen.

<HEADLINE> NFL Teams Want (Need) Quarterbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Ditka wants Ricky Williams so badly, he's  
willing to give up the New Orleans' Saints entire draft, maybe for 
two years, to get the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone else wants quarterbacks so badly that they're likely to  
go 1-2-3, with five and maybe six going into the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, it's the NFL draft, when coaches and general managers MUST  
have a player they can't quite seem to get. In fact, this could be 
the year when team officials don't spout the, ``We were amazed he 
was still there when we picked,'' cliche. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be my 27th draft, and the one thing I've always  
found is there is one less player than the pick you have,'' says 
Ernie Accorsi, general manager of the New York Giants, who, in 
fact, are likely to miss out on the premier offensive lineman they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we just list enough players to make sure we'll have one we  
like when we pick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players people like this year are the quarterbacks: Tim  
Couch of Kentucky, Akili Smith of Oregon, Donovan McNabb of 
Syracuse, Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida and Cade McNown of 
UCLA. Couch, McNabb and Smith are likely to go 1-2-3 in some order 
to expansion Cleveland, Philadelphia and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems to make this the best draft for quarterbacks since  
1983, which produced John Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly in the 
first round (as well as Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien and Todd 
Blackledge). 
</P>
<P>
	But it's those last three -- and the likes of Kelly Stouffer,  
Todd Marinovich, Dan McGwire, Dave Brown, Andre Ware, David 
Klingler, Kerry Collins and a dozen more first-round 
disappointments -- that make teams wary of risking a top pick on a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go by the averages, you would hope one or two of them  
would be successful for their particular team,'' says general 
manager Rich McKay of Tampa Bay, which might take a stab at 
Culpepper or McNown if they fall as far as 15, where the Bucs pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Adds the Colts' Jim Mora, who made the right move in taking  
Peyton Manning over Ryan Leaf last year: 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to look five years from now and say, `Boy,  
all these guys are great.' Down the road it might be just two of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves players who might go in the top three to teams  
picking lower. That group is led by Williams, the Heisman 
Trophy-winning running back, who set an NCAA rushing record at 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts, selecting fourth, traded their star running back,  
Marshall Faulk, to St. Louis on Thursday, opening the way for them 
to grab Williams. They're lucky, they got their QB last year in 
Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams may get lucky, too, because others take  
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be four, potentially five quarterbacks that go  
before we pick, and that's good for us,'' says Tom Donahoe, 
personnel director of the Steelers, who pick 13th and are sticking 
with Kordell Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The players who will drop a bit include Champ Bailey, a  
cornerback from Georgia who, like Deion Sanders, also plays wide 
receiver; linebackers Chris Claiborne of Southern Cal and Jevon 
Kearse of Florida; wide receiver Torry Holt of North Carolina 
State; cornerback Chris McAlister of Arizona; running back Edgerrin 
James of Miami; and offensive tackle John Tait of Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
	That also could lead to a lot of scrambling.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, which got the 11th pick by trading quarterback Brad  
Johnson to Washington, badly wants McAlister. The Vikings might 
have to trade up to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago would like McNabb, but probably won't get him and might  
be able to trade down a bit and still take Claiborne or Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	New England desperately needs a running back to replace Robert  
Edwards, badly injured in a beach flag football game at the Pro 
Bowl. It has the 20th and 28th picks overall, probably not enough 
to get up for James. So the Pats could go down a bit and get a back 
like LSU's Kevin Faulk or Mississippi State's James Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, back in the league as an expansion team to replace  
the franchise moved to Baltimore after the 1995 season, gets the 
first pick. Publicly, the Browns say they're considering Couch, 
Smith and Williams, but privately, most people expect them to 
choose a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	Then comes Philadelphia, which seems to be leaning toward  
McNabb. Cincinnati, No. 3, has four quarterbacks on the roster, but 
seems set to pick a fifth, even though Bailey would be a perfect 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a good quarterback, a team can ride on him for  
years,'' says team president Mike Brown, who used a the sixth 
overall pick on Klingler in 1992. ``If you look at the standings, 
almost always the teams with productive quarterbacks win; those 
whose quarterbacks are not productive don't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next comes Indianapolis, which seems set to take Williams now  
that they've traded Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	They also could bite at Ditka's offer to trade away all his  
draft picks this year and next year's No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Next comes Washington, which could end up with Bailey; St.  
Louis, which might be leaning toward Holt now that it has Faulk; 
and Chicago, which could go for Claiborne or Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 8 is Arizona (which also has the 21st pick), followed by  
Detroit; Baltimore; Minnesota (which has 11 and 29); New Orleans; 
Pittsburgh; Kansas City; Tampa Bay; Tennessee; Seattle; Oakland; 
the New York Giants; New England (20 and 28); Dallas; Buffalo; 
Miami; Green Bay; Jacksonville; San Francisco; Atlanta; and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets (as compensation for coach Bill Parcells), Carolina  
(for Sean Gilbert) and San Diego (as part of the deal to move up 
for Ryan Leaf,) have no No. 1s.

<HEADLINE> Dench Shines in 'Amy's View' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Judi Dench won an  
Academy Award for eight minutes of screen work. One wonders what 
Hollywood would give her for two-hours-plus on stage in ``Amy's 
View,'' the actress' London triumph that seems destined to repeat 
its West End success on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dench turns in a dazzling performance, a powerful, emotionally  
affecting portrait that doesn't overpower the play and makes its 
talky, more sober-sided moments richer and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amy's View,'' which opened Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore  
Theater, is an old-fashioned, sturdily constructed vehicle, built 
specifically around Dench's considerable talents. The play by David 
Hare, an author already represented in New York this season by 
``The Blue Room'' and the current ``Via Dolorosa,'' gives her ample 
opportunity to emote. 
</P>
<P>
	And, boy, does she! Dench rants and raves, coos and cries, all  
the while furiously smoking cigarettes as she paces designer Bob 
Crowley's English country manor setting. 
</P>
<P>
	In any other actress, these histrionics would seem excessive.  
With Dench, they don't. She favors the direct approach, 
straightforward and honest, delivering her lines in a husky, 
honey-coated voice that makes every syllable count. 
</P>
<P>
	Physically, the woman is unprepossessing. Yet Dench, sporting  
close-cropped hair and wearing matronly dresses, possesses a shy, 
crinkly smile which immediately disarms. You can't take your eyes 
off her -- which is exactly what Hare wants. 
</P>
<P>
	Set over a 16-year period from 1979 into the mid-1990s, ``Amy's  
View'' chronicles the ups and downs -- mostly the downs -- of a 
theatrical legend named Esme Allen. Esme is a stage actress of the 
old school -- grand, a bit snobby and strong-willed. She also can be 
quite funny, even when her professional and personal worlds are 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her private life focuses on daughter Amy, a child she seems  
determined to control or at least guide through life. These plans 
are wrecked with the arrival of Dominic, Amy's boyfriend and 
incipient husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominic is an up-and-comer. He starts as the editor of an  
obscure film magazine, eventually working his way up the arts-media 
chain to high-powered director of action movies. Disdainful of the 
theater, he is the ultimate networker. What's more, he succeeds in 
public, even as his marriage disintegrates. 
</P>
<P>
	Esme's life falls apart, too. Financially, she is wiped out by  
bad investments made by an old friend, beautifully played with 
embarrassed charm by Ronald Pickup. His betrayal of Esme is 
matter-of-factly revealed -- and accepted by Esme -- in a scene that 
contains some of Hare's most poignant writing. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, director Richard Eyre has made sure that Hare's play  
doesn't turn into a one-woman show. In the pivotal role of Amy, a 
forceful Samantha Bond matches Dench tempest for tempest. The two 
women even resemble each other physically, although philosophically 
they are very different. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Amy's view that everyone should try to get on,'' says  
unfaithful husband, Dominic. His wife's willingness to compromise, 
to find the good in people, dooms her to disappointment. In the 
evening's most dramatic moment, Amy admits that her mother may have 
been right about her ambitious helpmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate Donovan's Dominic delivers the dramatic goods, too,  
although he occasionally loses his British accent when things get 
heated. It's a difficult role -- part charmer, part cad, a man who 
goes after what he wants. Donovan walks the fine line with ease. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Pitoniak as Esme's ancient mother-in-law makes a strong  
impression as a character who hasn't much reason to be around 
except to suggest the passage of time. Yet Pitoniak manages to 
create a real person. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Amy believes in the redemptive power of love and  
loving unconditionally. Love conquers all, or so she would like to 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare, on the other hand, believes in the redemptive power of  
theater. Consider the play's final moments, a spectacular bit of 
stagecraft designed by Bob Crowley, that won't be revealed here. 
</P>
<P>
	By then Esme is alone, bereft of fortune and daughter. But what  
she still has is a new play, another chance to create magic for a 
new audience. And with Judi Dench stirring the elixir, it makes for 
a terrific ending for what is a heady theatrical brew.

<HEADLINE> Neeson Remembers First 'Star Wars' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite hype that had fans lined up to catch a  
two-minute trailer for the latest ``Star Wars'' installment, Liam 
Neeson says the movie isn't changing his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old Irishman told Movieline magazine he can remember  
braving a dangerous section of Belfast years ago to see the 
original ``Star Wars.'' Then a young theater actor, Neeson said he 
found the film ``breathtaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a simple story, yet with all the complexities of myth.  
The technology was so understated,'' Neeson said. ``I thought he 
(George Lucas) was an amazing director who had created this totally 
believable world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That memory was part of what made Neeson jump when offered the  
chance to meet Lucas in London two decades after ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's playing the part of Qui-Gon Jin, a Jedi master in the  
upcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' set for 
release May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether being part of another potential blockbuster  
has changed him, Neeson said simply: ``I'm 46 years of age. I'm 
married with two kids. I love to fly-fish. That will never change. 
At the end of the day, you know something? It's just a movie.''

<HEADLINE> Police Brutality Facts Are Scarce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In Boston, cries of police brutality are  
relatively rare. A beefed-up internal affairs division seems to be 
working, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, on the other hand, anyone who has ever heard of  
black immigrants Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo knows the nation's 
largest city has a problem when race and policing converge. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether these cities have the best and worst records in  
policing their police -- or whether police brutality is on the rise 
in American cities -- is difficult to say authoritatively. 
</P>
<P>
	No government agency keeps track, and few police departments  
collect information based on race. 
</P>
<P>
	In her longest speech to date on police conduct, Attorney  
General Janet Reno told a National Press Club luncheon today, ``No 
matter what the data show, the perception of too many Americans is 
that police officers cannot be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is national in scope and reaches people all across  
America,'' Reno said. ``Especially in minority communities ... 
residents believe the police used excessive force, that law 
enforcement is too aggressive, that law enforcement is biased, 
disrespectful, and that they are being treated unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno outlined steps she said were needed to restore trust  
between police and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged police departments to gather hard data on racial  
patterns of traffic and other police stops of citizens and 
announced that for the first time, this year the Justice 
Department's annual survey of crime victims would ask respondents 
if they had an encounter with police in which force was used. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she would convene a conference in the next couple of  
weeks of police executives, academic experts and community leaders 
to discuss the problem and try to develop standards for respectful 
police-citizen contacts that are not based on racial profiles. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said that rank-and-file police officers must ``make it  
unacceptable to keep silent about other officers' misconduct,'' 
that police departments should expand their recruitment in 
communities that have complained about police work and to provide 
citizens with a complaint procedure that eliminates their fear of 
speaking up while remaining fair to accused officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The question has taken on crucial dimensions. Police shootings  
have taken the lives of blacks in Pittsburgh and Riverside, Calif. 
In New Jersey, Maryland and Florida, state troopers have come under 
fire for conducting traffic stops based on a driver's race -- 
so-called racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	A picture can be cobbled together from hearsay and anecdotes but  
the lack of hard statistics riles civil rights advocates who 
believe black and brown people are more likely to end up unjustly 
facing a policeman's gun or billy club than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is frustrating to me in large part because white America  
has refused to acknowledge a problem exists,'' said Rep. Gregory W. 
Meeks, D-N.Y. ``Now in 1999, we are seeing some of the same police 
brutality we saw in the Jim Crow days, but white America just 
doesn't get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks, said the Congressional Black Caucus task force on police  
brutality, which he co-chairs, plans hearings in several cities, 
including Baltimore, Chicago and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least it will be a starting point,'' said Meeks, a former  
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Ron Daniels, head of the Center for Constitutional Rights,  
a New York-based civil rights group, ``We know we have a bad 
problem out there. We just don't know exactly how bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere I've gone in this country, 15 minutes into the  
conversation we are talking about some police brutality,'' Daniels 
said. He organized a national anti-police brutality march in 
Washington in early April after four officers from New York's elite 
street crimes unit fired 41 shots at Diallo, an unarmed West 
African immigrant, hitting him 19 times. The officers have been 
charged with second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, civil rights groups have urged the Justice Department  
to collect nationwide data on excessive force cases. The collection 
of data was authorized by the 1994 Crime Act but not funded. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far we only have anecdotal information,'' said NAACP  
President Kweisi Mfume. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., reintroduced a bill  
requiring the Justice Department to collect data on traffic stops 
by local police. ``Stopping our citizens to be searched on account 
of their race is an unacceptable activity on the part of law 
enforcement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego requires that police record the race of people they  
stop in order to assess whether officers rely on racial profiling 
in making traffic stops. Some of the 35 police chiefs and activists 
who met with Attorney General Janet Reno last week discussed 
adopting such a plan elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But, generally, police officials are wary.  
</P>
<P>
	``If passed into law, the (Conyers) bill would place a burden on  
the police and lengthen traffic stops,'' said Robert Scully, 
executive director of the National Association of Police 
Organizations, which represents 4,000 police unions and 
associations. He said officers are vulnerable to attack during such 
stops and pausing to collect data ``would make a dangerous 
situation worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ironic that in the quest for a colorblind society, some  
people want us to keep track of people by race,'' said Jim Pasco, 
executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's 
largest police labor organization, with 277,000 members. ``We're 
opposed to any kind of racial tabulation,'' he said, opposing 
proposals to accumulate data on police brutality cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasco said that police brutality hasn't been increasing. He  
notes the number of federal prosecutions of abusive cops has stayed 
at about 30 a year while the number of officers has sharply 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Available information hints that along with Boston, the police  
departments of Minneapolis and San Francisco have done the best 
jobs in curbing such abuses, according to a study last year of 14 
cities by Human Rights Watch, an international human rights 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans appear to have the  
most serious problems of abusive officers on their forces, 
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Franklin Exhibit Focuses on Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In revolutionary America, a small corps of  
earnest experimenters and observers of nature came to see 
themselves as citizens not just of a new nation but of a far more 
universal ``republic of science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the center was Benjamin Franklin, equally at ease in the  
roles of printer, writer, postmaster, philosopher, rebel, diplomat 
and statesman. But his scientific experiments with electricity made 
him an international legend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Franklin and His Friends, Portraying the Man of Science in  
18th Century America,'' opening Friday at the National Portrait 
Gallery, stitches together the many threads of the human network 
that comprised Franklin's scientific world. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, the product of more than four years of research,  
runs through Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Wherever possible, the show's curators match portraits of the  
fledgling American scientists with the brass telescopes, 
microscopes, electrostatic generators and other instruments they 
actually used. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of several portraits, Franklin is shown in 1762, seated  
in his study next to two metal bells attached by wires to an 
outside lightning rod. The bells rang, alerting their inventor, 
when a storm electrified the iron rod. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby is a bent and rusty but highly prized iron rod, dating  
from about 1756. It was attached to a Philadelphia house according 
to Franklin's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin's network included John Winthrop, a mathematician and  
astronomer famed for charting the course of Venus across the sun. 
Winthrop is painted with a treasured telescope. The actual 
London-made instrument is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	An engraved Thomas Jefferson displays the Declaration of  
Independence. But he is ready to turn immediately to a machine that 
generates electricity when a crank-turned glass plate is rubbed 
against a leather pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The show includes astronomer and instrument maker David  
Rittenhouse, botanist William Bartram, museum pioneer and painter 
Charles Wilson Peale, and physician and chemist Benjamin Rush. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most flamboyant member of Franklin's group was  
Harvard-educated physician John Jeffries, whom Franklin entertained 
repeatedly in Paris in 1785 after Jeffries made the first crossing 
of the English channel by hot-air balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffries is portrayed in flight, wearing a striking leopard-skin  
cap and clutching a large barometer. 
</P>
<P>
	The original barometer, in a nearby case, is prized as ``the  
world's oldest surviving flight instrument.''

<HEADLINE> Duke's Avery To Enter NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM (AP) -- Duke guard Will Avery, against the wishes of coach  
Mike Krzyzewski, will join teammate Elton Brand in deciding to 
enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in favor of William's decision at this time,''  
Krzyzewski said in a statement released by the school Thursday. 
``We have done extensive research into the NBA for William and my 
conclusion was that entering the draft now would not be in his best 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, everyone is entitled to make their own decisions. I  
certainly wish him the ultimate success in his future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery told Krzyzewski of his decision late Wednesday night,  
hours after Brand's news conference announcing his decision to turn 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery has an unlisted campus telephone number, and could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski indicated during Brand's news conference that he  
expected Avery to stay at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2 point guard, a native of Augusta, Ga., averaged 8.5  
points and 2.5 assists as a freshman backup. He improved to 14.9 
points and 5 per game as a sophomore starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference choice and an  
honorable mention Associated Press All-American.

<HEADLINE> Drug Errors Blamed on Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Celexa, Celebrex or Cerebyx: Which one is the  
popular new arthritis drug? 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and pharmacists aren't always sure -- federal regulators  
have received 53 reports of errors in the dispensing of the 
arthritis drug Celebrex. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of reports of such mixups is the most the Food and  
Drug Administration has received for any drug that has been on the 
market only four months, the FDA's Jerry Phillips said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the reports involve serious injury or death, but medical  
authorities said confusion with some other drugs is potentially 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it has happened in a short time since the drug  
was approved also has the office concerned,'' said Phillips, who 
heads the FDA's Office of Postmarketing Drug Risk Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is in talks with the drug's maker, Monsanto Co.'s  
Searle unit, about how to respond to the problem, Monsanto and FDA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the options Searle and the FDA are considering: changing  
the drug's name again, and launching an education campaign to curb 
confusion by pharmacists, doctors and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients received the wrong drug in 10 of the cases. The wrong  
drug was prescribed in 19 cases but caught before consumers 
received it. In 24 cases doctors and pharmacists reported that they 
found the name confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities say reports to the FDA generally represent a  
small proportion of the errors that occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Searle has already changed the drug's name once, from Celebra to  
Celebrex, after federal regulators said it sounded too much like 
other drugs. But doctors and pharmacists are still confusing 
Celebrex with the antidepressant Celexa and the seizure drug 
Cerebyx. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an issue that is unique to Celebrex,'' Monsanto  
spokeswoman Scarlett Foster said. ``We'll decide with (the FDA) 
what are the best steps for us to take and will work with them to 
make sure that people are careful and are appropriately giving out 
the prescribing information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths will occur if the name isn't changed, said Michael Cohen,  
chairman of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a 
Warminster, Pa., nonprofit group that tracks medication errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like we always have to wait until there is a death  
before something's done,'' said Cohen, whose group has successfully 
urged some drug makers to change sound-alike names. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the errors involved an 80-year-old woman who mistakenly  
received the antidepressant Celexa instead of Celebrex twice a day 
for a month. A pharmacy staffer confused the drug names when 
pulling the drug from the shelf, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	That error could have had serious consequences because the woman  
was already on drug similar to Celexa, which blocks the chemical 
serotonin in the brain, and might have suffered a serious overdose 
of the compound. Millions of Americans take serotonin-blockers such 
as Eli Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health systems are acting to avoid name confusion. Fairview  
Health Services of Minneapolis is asking doctors to write both the 
drug's generic name and its trade name on prescriptions and to list 
what ailment the drug is meant to treat, said Steven Meisel, 
assistant pharmacy director for the hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex has been extremely popular since it went on the market  
in January because it is as effective a painkiller as ibuprofen and 
other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is 
much less likely to cause severe stomach problems such as bleeding 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million prescriptions for Celebrex have been  
dispensed so far, making it the second-fastest selling new drug 
after Pfizer's impotence-treatment drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto and its co-marketer Pfizer are promoting Celebrex in  
all markets except in Japan. Additional approvals are pending in 
more than 30 countries.

journalists, a study says.

	The percentage of Asian American, black, Hispanic and American  
Indian newsroom employees rose to 11.55 in 1998 from 11.46 the 
previous year, according to findings presented Wednesday at the 
annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the survey also counted female journalists,  
finding they represent about 37 percent of news staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think there are a lot of editors who don't understand  
the importance of diversity,'' said Nancy Baca, president of the 
National Association of Hispanic Journalists and an assistant 
features editor at the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed declines for members of minority groups  
receiving internships and getting a first full-time journalism job. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalina Camia, president of Unity: Journalists of Color, an  
alliance of Asian-American, Hispanic, black and American Indian 
journalists, found one unchanged statistic particularly troubling -- 
9 percent of newsroom supervisors are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the positions of real decision-making,'' said Camia,  
a Washington correspondent for The Dallas Morning News. ``Looking 
at the big picture, these numbers tell us that incredible efforts 
need to be taken if we are going to get young people of color 
interested in journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Tuesday session, ASNE announced a series of initiatives,  
including creation of a national talent bank listing minority 
students looking for internships or their first jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the Associated Press Managing Editors ratified the  
list of initiatives. ASNE's goal is for newsrooms to reflect the 
racial and ethnic makeup of the general population by 2025. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sell newspapers to people if you don't reflect their  
communities,'' said N. Christian Anderson, publisher of the Orange 
County Register and incoming ASNE president. ``It's a simple 
business equation, as well as the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Girl's Conviction in Death Reversed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court on Thursday reversed the  
1996 conviction of an 11-year-old girl accused of beating to death 
a toddler, ruling police questioned her illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd District Court of Appeals said that the signed  
confession given by Lacresha Murray, now 14, was illegal because 
she was ``isolated and alone'' when she gave it. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, we cannot say that appellant's statements were  
not the product of fright and despair,'' the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha originally was charged with capital murder, making her  
the youngest person in Texas to face such a charge. After two 
trials, she eventually was convicted of injury to a child and 
sentenced to 25 years for the beating death of 2-year-old Jayla 
Belton. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was ordered returned to juvenile court. Lacresha will  
remain at a Texas Youth Commission facility unless prosecutors drop 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to assume that they're going to retry her a third  
time,'' said her attorney, Keith Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had no immediate comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Jayla died in May 1996 of massive internal injuries, including a  
ruptured liver. 
</P>
<P>
	During a two-hour interview, she denied killing Jayla at least  
40 times, but still signed a police-written statement saying she 
may have dropped and kicked the toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a juvenile taken into custody by police must go before  
a magistrate before being questioned. Prosecutors argued Lacresha 
wasn't officially in custody and could have left at any time. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Lee Yeakel, writing for the appeals court, disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was not, however, told that she was free to leave the  
interview room or the children's shelter, and she was never told 
she could call her grandparents or any other friendly adult,'' 
Yeakel said.

<HEADLINE> Verdict May Hurt Malaysian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A landmark verdict against a  
former deputy prime minister may be galvanizing opposition to 
Malaysia's long-ruling leader rather than stifling it. 
</P>
<P>
	Political science professor Chandra Muzaffar said Thursday the  
six-year jail term given to former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim will come back to haunt his former mentor now political 
nemesis, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The political actors in this conspiracy wanted to render Anwar  
totally impotent,'' the professor said. ``But this stiff sentence 
will further erode Mahathir's leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syed Husin Ali, head of the Malaysian People's Party, echoed  
similar sentiments, saying the political reform movement that Anwar 
represents will only be strengthened by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``His struggle for justice will go on, though, and now we are  
more determined than ever,'' Syed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several thousand Malaysians took to the streets after Anwar was  
convicted of corruption Wednesday, staging the most violent 
demonstrations this placid Southeast Asian capital has seen in 
years. More than 200 people, mostly students, gathered in downtown 
Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to protest the verdict. Several were 
detained. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday in a  
decision that effectively bans him from politics for a decade, 
since Malaysian law bars him from office for at least five years 
after he is freed. 
</P>
<P>
	He had repeatedly declared his innocence, saying he was the  
victim of a political conspiracy to eliminate his challenge to 
Mahathir's 18-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial in Thursday's edition of The New York Times,  
Anwar said he was seen as a threat because he refused to carry out 
Mahathir's ``business as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I became dangerous ... I had widespread support for my work  
toward democracy and civil society. So I was accused of sex crimes, 
treason and corruption and expelled from government and party,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has fallen to Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to carry out her  
husband's crusade to rid Malaysia of corruption and Mahathir. 
</P>
<P>
	She has become a political beacon in her own right and drew some  
8,000 supporters to a late-night meeting shortly after saying 
good-bye to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I am more determined than ever,'' she said, ``to carry out  
my husband's struggle for justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Augustine Paul, who found Anwar guilty on all four  
corruption charges, had served as judge and jury during the 
sensational 7-month trial. He said of his ruling, ``In this 
judgment, I am answerable to God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some believe Paul answered only to Mahathir, who publicly  
condemned Anwar for corruption, sodomy and adultery even before any 
charges against Anwar were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Vice President Al Gore said he was ``profoundly  
troubled'' by Anwar's prison term and warned that his conviction 
could affect the Malaysian economy, as countries that allow dissent 
cope better with economic crises. The United States is Malaysia's 
largest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Increasingly, investors put their money and their faith in  
democracies, and pull it out of nations where decisions are rigged, 
where contracts are not honored, where governments use the power of 
the police to quiet the criticism that could create a more just, 
more prosperous society,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union said the sentence raised ``doubts about the  
fairness of the trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's 73-year-old prime minister, still recovering from a  
10-day hospital stay for a lung infection, has made no public 
comment on the conviction of the man he groomed for a decade to 
take his place until firing Anwar in September. 
</P>
<P>
	But an editorial in the government-backed New Straits Times on  
Thursday declared that Anwar was ``properly and fairly tried'' and 
deserved the severe sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the adage goes, the higher you are, the harder you fall,''  
it said.

<HEADLINE>  Pinochet Faces Months of Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet  
faces the prospect of more months -- if not years -- under guard 
after Britain's top law enforcement official ruled Thursday that 
Spain can continue seeking his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old general must remain confined to his rented  
mansion outside London, guarded 24 hours a day, while his lawyers 
battle with Spanish prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new ruling, Home Secretary Jack Straw said even though the  
House of Lords drastically reduced the case against Pinochet last 
month, the remaining allegations are serious enough to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights groups immediately hailed the decision, saying the  
alleged victims of Pinochet's military regime are one step closer 
to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 25 years of impunity, this definitive decision hastens  
the day when Pinochet will have to answer for his terrible 
crimes,'' said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch, a participant in 
the case. ``Dictators the world over should take notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Fernando Barros, a close Pinochet associate, called Spain's  
case ``politically motivated'' and said Straw's decision was ``a 
blow to all those trying to achieve reconciliation in Chile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Chile, the government lamented the ruling and said it will  
continue to explore ``all the judicial and political alternatives 
still available'' to seek Pinochet's release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said there will  
be no reprisals. The government has sought Pinochet's release since 
his arrest, saying foreign courts have no authority to try the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrations for and against the decision went off peacefully  
Thursday in the Chilean capital of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish warrant  
alleging thousands of abuses committed during his 17-year regime. 
</P>
<P>
	An official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or  
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after he ousted the 
country's elected Marxist president, Salvador Allende, in a bloody 
1973 coup. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled  
that Pinochet enjoyed only limited immunity from arrest as a former 
head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	The court threw out the bulk of the case against him, saying  
most of the charges against the general had to be dismissed because 
they predated Britain's 1988 adoption of an international law 
against torture. 
</P>
<P>
	But enough charges were upheld -- including allegations that he  
tortured his opponents -- to keep the extradition request alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw already had granted permission in December for proceedings  
to go forward, but wanted to consider Spain's request anew in light 
of the sharply reduced case. 
</P>
<P>
	In his latest decision, Straw rebuffed arguments that Pinochet,  
arrested while recuperating from back surgery, was not fit to stand 
trial. He also said Spain's attempts to prosecute the general did 
not pose a threat to Chile's sovereignty or ``its future 
democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extradition case was adjourned until April 30 to allow  
Pinochet's attorneys time to study the decision to determine 
grounds for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said they expect prosecutors to prepare a fresh  
arrest warrant in the meantime, which probably will include some of 
the allegations Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon has added in recent 
months to bolster his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon had no immediate comment on the ruling. But it was  
cheered by victims' relatives in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we heard the news on the radio, we embraced in joy, we  
wept openly,'' said Viviana Diaz, representing a group whose loved 
ones disappeared during Pinochet's regime. ``At that moment, we had 
our missing loved ones in our hearts, and we held a candle for each 
of them.''

<HEADLINE>  Marquee Fight Pits Jones &AMP; Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he cannot resist a challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the WBC-WBA light heavyweight champion could get one when  
he fights IBF champion Reggie Johnson in a 175-pound title 
unification bout June 5 in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in 
Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of Roy's career, and it's the  
biggest fight of my career,'' the left-handed Johnson (39-5-1, 24 
knockouts) said Thursday. Jones has a 39-1 record, with 33 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the news conference were some students of PS72 in  
upper Manhattan, and one youngster had a question for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, in what round do you think you will knock Mr.  
Johnson down?'' the boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it I'll knock him down or not, but from round  
one to round 12, I'll be doing a job on him,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match will be the fourth in a string of HBO-televised fights  
that run will run through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Naseem Hamed of Britain retained the WBO featherweight  
title by stopping Paul Ingle of Britain in the 11th round April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The next fight will be Oscar De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title  
defense against Oba Carr on May 22 in Las Vegas. It will be 
followed by Felix Trinidad's defense of the IBF welterweight title 
May 29 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Jones-Johnson match, a 
heavyweight fight between Michael Grant and Lou Savarese on June 19 
at Madison Square Garden in New York and another bout featuring 
Hamed, on July 17, against an opponent to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, also said that a  
pay-per-view rematch between heavyweight champions Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis -- who fought to a disputed draw March 13 
-- would be held Nov. 6 or Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one meeting away,'' Abraham said when asked if the fight  
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson won the WBA light heavyweight title in  
1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round Feb. 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Starr Denounces Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Keeping silent about when he plans to leave  
the investigation of President Clinton and the first lady, 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says he has the authority to 
prosecute Clinton after he's out of the White House in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr, appearing Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live''  
program, said he anticipated returning to ``law practice and 
teaching,'' but he didn't say when he would depart the nearly 
5-year investigation of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was ready to step out of public life, he said,  
``Yes, very much,'' in a separate interview published in today's 
editions of USA Today. But, he added, ``I've never been able to say 
no to public service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was given ample opportunity to provide a timetable for an  
exit during the two media interviews and in an appearance Wednesday 
on Capitol Hill. But he offered none. 
</P>
<P>
	On another topic, though, Starr was clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you have jurisdiction to prosecute the president criminally  
after his term of office expires?'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., 
asked Starr at a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the independent counsel replied, going on to outline  
his court-authorized mandate to investigate possible lying and 
obstruction in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he felt ``compassion'' for the president in the  
Lewinsky controversy, Starr said he did. But he also said Clinton 
shouldn't have given the untruthful testimony in the Paula Jones 
case for which he was cited for civil contempt of court this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declined to discuss the matter further.  
</P>
<P>
	And as for the first lady, had Starr ever contemplated indicting  
her? He couldn't comment, the prosecutor said on the King show. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was called to the Senate hearing to give his views on the  
independent counsel law that gave him the power to investigate the 
president's Whitewater real estate dealings, the Lewinsky affair 
and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators appeared surprised by Starr's testimony that the  
statute should not be extended when it expires June 30. Starr's own 
ongoing, $40 million probe is protected by a provision in the 
current law that allows it to continue after the expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr made clear there still was much work to do.  
</P>
<P>
	In the CNN appearance, he referred to pending prosecutions of  
presidential friend Webster Hubbell. Also, Starr said he wanted to 
find out why jurors refused to convict the Clintons' former 
Whitewater partner Susan McDougal for criminal contempt of court 
and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbell is accused of concealing his and Hillary Rodham  
Clinton's work on a fraudulent Arkansas land development controlled 
by the Clintons' Whitewater partner Jim McDougal and Hubbell's 
father-in-law. Hubbell's June trial faces a likely delay while 
Starr's office appeals the dismissal of a major count in the case. 
Starr also has a tax evasion case pending against Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Mrs. McDougal, Starr said he is ``obviously  
disappointed'' at her acquittal on an obstruction charge this week 
and her mistrial over two criminal contempt counts. A retrial is a 
possibility, Starr said.

at Madison Square Garden in New York and another bout featuring 
Hamed, on July 17, against an opponent to be chosen.

<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, also said that a  
pay-per-view rematch between heavyweight champions Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis -- who fought to a disputed draw March 13 
-- would be held Nov. 6 or Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one meeting away,'' Abraham said when asked if the fight  
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson won the WBA light heavyweight title in  
1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round Feb. 6, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Michael D. ``Mickey'' Friedman, a limited  
partner in the New York Yankees ownership group, died of cancer. He 
was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman died Tuesday at University Hospitals and was buried  
Wednesday following services at Fairmount Temple in suburban 
Beachwood. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman, who co-founded Manchester Steel Inc., was one of 20  
limited partners in the Yankees organization. He was a member of 
the partnership headed by George Steinbrenner in 1973 when the 
group purchased the team from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman was a Cleveland native and earned a degree from Case  
Western Reserve University. 
</P>
<P>
	He started running his father's business, Momart Steel, in the  
1960s and in 1970 co-founded Manchester Steel. The steel service 
company evolved from warehousing steel to processing it for 
immediate use by manufacturing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman also was president of Northern Stamping Inc., a metal  
stampings supplier to the automobile industry.

<P>
	BENSALEM, Pa. (AP) -- A socialite and heiress to one of  
Philadelphia's largest fortunes, Katharine Drexel could have had or 
done anything. What she chose instead as her life's work shocked 
high society but has her poised to become the second American-born 
saint. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who lived a storybook youth of mansions, world travel  
and private tutors took a vow of poverty, entered the convent and 
used all of her $20 million inheritance to establish a missionary 
order dedicated to helping those treated the worst and regarded the 
least. 
</P>
<P>
	``She ... gave everything to God, including herself,'' said  
Sister Ruth Catherine Spain, who belongs to the Sisters of the 
Blessed Sacrament order founded by Mother Drexel and who lives in 
the order's motherhouse in Bensalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters began touting her cause almost immediately after her  
death in 1955 at age 96. And a pair of mysterious healings -- one 
confirmed, the other still being investigated -- are drawing her 
closer to sainthood. She would be the only American-born saint 
besides Sisters of Charity founder Elizabeth Ann Seton, canonized 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other people with U.S. ties have reached beatification,  
which is the last step before sainthood: Mohawk Indian convert 
Kateri Tekakwitha; Belgian-born priest Damien de Veuster, who cared 
for lepers in Hawaii; Spanish-born priest Junipero Serra, who 
founded nine California missions; and French-born nun Theodore 
Guerin, who founded the Sisters of Providence of St. Mary of the 
Woods in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother Drexel is the closest to canonization of America's 29  
candidates, most of whom are decades away from sainthood. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no white smoke yet,'' said Monsignor Alexander  
Palmieri, vice postulator, or official advocate, for Mother 
Drexel's cause for sainthood, referring to the plume that signals 
when a new pope is chosen. He said he hoped canonization could come 
by the end of this year. She was beatified in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Katharine Drexel was born in 1858 to a family of great wealth.  
Her father, Francis Drexel, was a banking magnate and business 
partner of J.P. Morgan. Her uncle, Anthony Drexel, founded Drexel 
University. Young Katharine was a world traveler and a debutante 
but also was taught the importance of charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drexels, devout Roman Catholics, believed their wealth  
belonged to God, who entrusted it to them to care for the poor. In 
addition to making monetary donations, the family distributed food, 
clothing and money three times a week from their mansion in 
Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	When Francis Drexel died in 1885, the family fortune was worth  
$15 million, the equivalent of about $250 million today. Though she 
and her two sisters were pursued by many suitors, Katharine was 
drawn to religious life. 
</P>
<P>
	After she joined the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh in 1889 at  
the age of 30, The Philadelphia Public Ledger ran the headline, 
``Miss Drexel Enters a Catholic Convent -- Gives up Seven Million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who once dressed in the finest fashions now stitched  
her torn shoelaces back together. 
</P>
<P>
	``She dedicated her life to ministering to African American and  
Native American people, which was by no means a popular thing to do 
at that time,'' Palmieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1891, she founded what was then called Blessed Sacrament  
Sisters for Indians and Colored People. The order's work was 
unpopular in the early years; undeterred, Mother Drexel urged the 
nuns to pray for those who opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ku Klux Klan once threatened to burn one of the order's  
Southern schools and its church if the sisters didn't leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lightning struck the (KKK) headquarters and burned it to the  
ground,'' Palmieri said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mother Drexel's lifetime, the order established 12 American  
Indian schools and more than 100 rural and inner-city schools for 
blacks, including New Orleans' Xavier University, the only 
historically black Catholic college in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	At its height, 550 women belonged to the order. Today there are  
about 260. 
</P>
<P>
	The road to sainthood is a rough one.  
</P>
<P>
	After an exhaustive scrutiny of the would-be saint's life, the  
case for sainthood is reviewed by the Vatican's Congregation for 
the Causes of Saints, which consists of about 25 cardinals and 
bishops. If the committee and the pope approve, the candidate is 
designated ``venerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the search begins for two miracles, which are confirmed  
through interviews with witnesses, theologians and medical experts. 
The first miracle earns the candidate the title ``blessed'' and the 
second, ``saint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Mother Drexel was declared ``venerable.'' In 1988, the  
Vatican confirmed Robert Gutherman was cured of deafness in one ear 
after praying to Mother Drexel. The church is investigating the 
case of an unidentified 6-year-old from the Philadelphia area whose 
hearing is said to have been similarly restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Mother Drexel's supporters are Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua  
of Philadelphia, a member of the Congregation for the Causes of 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Timing is a plus too: Pope John Paul II has canonized more  
people than all his predecessors in the 19th and 20th centuries 
combined, said Lawrence Cunningham, professor of theology at the 
University of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees the canonization of saints as an instrument of  
evangelization,'' Cunningham said.

<HEADLINE> Browns Still Not Saying Who's No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Everyone seems to know what the Browns are  
going to do with their No. 1 pick. Everyone, that is, but the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Months of speculation, rumors and analysis on this year's NFL  
draft has been reduced to hours, and it won't be long before NFL 
commissioner Paul Tagliabue officially puts Cleveland ``on the 
clock'' for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	So, will the Browns use the overall No. 1 on Tim Couch? Akili  
Smith? Or Ricky Williams? Will they trade it and then trade it 
again? Can they punt? 
</P>
<P>
	Confused? Who isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm really in the dark,'' Smith, Oregon's  
rifle-armed quarterback said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really heard anything,'' said Couch, who will appear  
Thursday night on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	As the clock ticks down toward Saturday's draft, the Browns  
insist they still haven't decided what they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports have them taking Couch with the first selection as long  
as a contract can be worked out with his agent, Tom Condon of 
Cleveland-based IMG, before Saturday. But the Browns maintain they 
haven't anointed the Kentucky quarterback the chosen one yet, and 
that it's still a three-man race for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are actually in continuing negotiations with agents for all  
three of the picks under consideration,'' Browns team spokesman 
Alex Martins said Thursday. ``The organization has not made a final 
determination as of this point as to which player we will select on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiating process will continue over the course of the  
next few days, and we don't anticipate making a decision on the 
pick until Saturday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same thing the Browns said last month, and again last  
week. So either they're still unsure of who to take or they're 
playing a mean game of poker, savoring every moment of holding an 
unbeatable hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Whomever the Browns take first will be a rich man. Condon is  
reportedly seeking a seven-year, $44 million deal plus a $12 
million signing bonus. Last year, the Indianapolis Colts gave the 
top pick, quarterback Peyton Manning, a six-year, $48 million 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Browns' No. 1 derby comes down to the wire, it appears to  
have become a two-man duel between Couch and Smith. Williams has 
apparently dropped from consideration and will probably be taken by 
Indianapolis with the No. 4 pick after the Colts traded running 
back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and Smith appear together on the cover of this week's  
Sports Illustrated with both wearing Browns No. 99 jerseys -- Couch 
in brown, Smith in white. They're sitting side-by-side as ``Big 
Dawg'', the leader of Cleveland's Dawg Pound stands behind them 
holding a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, director of football operations  
Dwight Clark and other Cleveland front office personnel have spent 
the week behind closed doors dissecting game films, scouting 
profiles and background checks on the pair of passers. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, a quarterback guru, is thought to favor the more mobile,  
more mature Smith over Couch, who was put through a rigorous, 
90-minute second workout by the Browns in Lexington, Ky., last 
weekend. Palmer was reportedly displeased with Couch's initial 
workout and wanted to see how Couch responded to some hands-on 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who drew wide criticism last year while in San Francisco  
for taking QB Jim Druckenmiller over Jake Plummer, has been a Couch 
proponent and thinks the 21-year-old's ``upside'' may be greater 
than Smith, who is 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever differences may exist, team president Carmen Policy  
promises the Browns will be of ``like mind'' when draft day 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he and Clark have been going over draft day  
scenarios for weeks and feels a difference in opinion is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dwight and I have been on the same page since I started with  
the Cleveland Browns,'' he said. ``Every time I've started off in a 
different direction we've come back to the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> HMattel Has Loss, Plans Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc. will lay off 3,000 workers  
and close a number of its plants as part of a restructuring that 
comes as the world's largest toymaker struggles to revive sales and 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel, which is best known Barbie and Hot Wheels, reported  
today a net loss of $17.9 million, or 7 cents per share, for the 
quarter ending March 31, compared to a net profit of $12.7 million 
for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $692 million, down 2 percent from  
$705 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs and closings are the latest attempt by Mattel chief  
executive Jill Barad to return the ailing toymaker to health. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced a management shakeup in March, which  
included the departure of president Bruce Stein. In addition, 
Mattel has been aggressively pursuing opportunities outside 
traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's purchase of software-giant The Learning Company is  
expected to close next month. Today, the company announced today 
that it would spend $50 million to launch an Internet venture, 
which a portion of which may eventually be offered to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel already sells some of its toys on its own Web sites, and  
plans to launch a Mattel.com site later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects the cutbacks to result in cost savings of  
$50 million this year and $400 over the following three years. 
Details about the job cuts or facility closings weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite core brand strength like Barbie -- sales were up 3  
percent worldwide and U.S. shipping was up 11 percent -- Mattel has 
been forced to rethink its business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Important retail customers like Toys R Us drastically cut back  
Mattel orders and asked for delivery of inventory closer to the 
time that they wanted to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Barad said the company's core Fisher-Price business returned to  
health with a 9 percent worldwide increase. But its Power Wheels 
line was down, still hurt by the 1998 recall of up to 10 million of 
the battery-run ride-on toys because they posed a serious fire 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Character brands were also down. A year ago, Tickle Me Elmo  
contributed approximately $60 million to first quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's earnings topped Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock was up $1.25 to $27.18 3/4 in midday trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rams Get Faulk From Colts for Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Until Thursday morning, running back was the  
St. Louis Rams' top draft-day priority. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes before the team's scheduled pre-draft news conference,  
everything changed when the Indianapolis Colts agreed to trade 
three-time Pro Bowl running back Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, perhaps the best all-purpose back in the league, rushed  
for 1,319 yards, caught 86 passes and scored 10 touchdowns last 
year. He was expendable because he wanted to renegotiate his 
contract, and cost the Rams only two draft picks, a second- and 
fifth-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm worth more,'' Faulk said. ``But if you can get  
anything cheaper or for less the price, you do it. That's the 
American way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, 26, was the No. 2 overall pick of the 1994 draft by the  
Colts, and he had four 1,000-yard rushing seasons in his five years 
there. He had a bit of a parting shot for Colts general manager 
Bill Polian. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a lot of players on the Colts that have  
a relationship with him,'' Faulk said. ``He's a business guy and he 
makes business decisions. Everyone harps on loyalty and before you 
know it, you're out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts are expected to take Ricky Williams, the Heisman  
Trophy winner, with the fourth selection, or trade up to make 
certain they get him. Many draft observers expect quarterbacks Tim 
Couch, Donovan McNabb and Akili Smith to be the first three picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Bill Polian and Jim Mora, they have a pretty good feel  
for what's going to go on before then,'' Vermeil said. ``There's 
only a few people ahead of them, and I think they've probably got a 
good pulse on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colts owner Jim Irsay issued a statement that read, in part,  
``Marshall was a very productive player for the Colts, as evidenced 
by his three Pro Bowl nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the Colts have decided to take a different  
direction as preparations continue for the 1999 season. We wish 
Marshall continued success in his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This deal appears to be as lopsided for the Rams as their fire  
sale of running back Jerome Bettis to the Steelers was for the 
other side on draft day in 1996. The Steelers gave up second- and 
fourth-round picks and got a third-rounder in return for a back who 
ran for 1,431 yards his first year in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Faulk deal, St. Louis had for bait two second-round  
picks, including one acquired from New Orleans in an offseason deal 
for disappointing wide receiver Eddie Kennison. They gave up their 
own pick, the 36th overall, instead of the Kennison pick, which is 
No. 41. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the deal, the Rams appeared to be zeroing in on Miami  
running back Edgerrin James with the sixth pick of the draft. The 
running game was the weakest link on a 4-12 team with the top 
rusher, June Henley, getting only 313 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil has said Greg Hill, who had 240 yards and averaged 6.0  
yards per carry in two early starts before seriously injuring his 
ankle, would be the starter next season. But the Rams are worried 
about his durability. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard for a lot of people to come back from injuries, but  
I'm not one of those people you have to worry about,'' Hill said. 
``My ankle is fine. I don't even remember which one it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams haven't had much success lately drafting running backs.  
Robert Holcombe, a second-rounder last year, was a disappointment 
with a 2.3-yard average and only 230 yards. Then there was the 
failed Lawrence Phillips experiment in 1996, with that year's No. 6 
pick now out of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk is the latest upgrade on offense, joining free-agent  
pickups Trent Green at quarterback and Adam Timmerman at guard. Now 
the team is leaning toward defensive help in the first round, with 
Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing like a shutdown corner,'' Vermeil said.  
</P>
<P>
	Faulk has two years to go on the original seven-year contract he  
signed with the Colts. He wants to renegotiate a deal that will pay 
him $2.2 million in base salary this year, and Vermeil said the 
Rams wouldn't be opposed to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the teams were made well-aware that it was going to take a  
new contract with Marshall,'' said Rocky Arceneaux, Faulk's agent. 
``I don't think they would have done it without intending on 
redoing the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk had his best year in 1998. He led all NFL running backs in  
receptions and yards, and his 2,227 total yards from scrimmage was 
the sixth-highest total in NFL history. He was second to Terrell 
Davis in yards rushing, third in receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams -- Baltimore, the New York Giants and Oakland --  
reportedly were interested in acquiring Faulk.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Census Review Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation designed to improve the accuracy  
of the census by letting local officials challenge the count before 
it is finalized faces an uncertain future in the Senate after its 
passage by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the bill will prevent a repeat of the  
error-plagued 1990 census, because local officials know their 
communities best and can find the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats argued Wednesday that the true intent was to block  
the Census Bureau from using a scientific method known as 
statistical sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 223-206 in favor of the bill. Four Democrats  
joined 219 Republicans in support of the measure. Rep. Constance 
Morella, R-Md., voted against the bill, along with 204 Democrats 
and one independent. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the Constitution  
requires that every person be counted, ``not estimated, not guessed 
at and not eliminated because you didn't fit in somebody's 
statistical model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The census, conducted every 10 years, has become politically  
volatile in recent months between Republicans, who hold a slim 
222-211 edge in the House, and Democrats, who are angling to win it 
back. There is one vacancy and one independent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 435 House seats are redistributed based on population growth  
and shifts detected by the census, which also is used to direct the 
flow of billions of dollars in federal funds to congressional 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that we allow communities to add people if  
they were mistakenly missed,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., 
chairman of the House census panel. ``That's all that this is 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the nine-week local review program would cut into  
the time census officials plan to spend using sampling to adjust 
for undercounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the 1990 census missed 8.4  
million people -- mostly minorities and poor people living in urban 
and rural areas -- and counted 4.4 million people twice, most of 
whom were white suburbanites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what the last census gave us,'' she said. ``We should  
let the Census Bureau correct the undercount and give us an 
accurate count.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said the review program,  
used by some local governments in the 1990 count, would do little 
to improve the census. Local officials are helping the bureau 
update its address files before the count begins on April 1, 2000, 
which he said will be more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Prewitt's boss, Commerce Secretary William Daley, said Wednesday  
he would recommend that President Clinton veto the bill if it 
passes the Senate. Senators aren't affected by the census; each 
state gets two senators, regardless of its population. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration had hoped to use statistical sampling  
to improve the count. But congressional infighting led to a Supreme 
Court ruling in January that a count based on sampling cannot be 
used to reallocate House seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, however, said a figure produced by sampling could be  
used by states to redraw congressional district lines and determine 
federal aid levels. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the bureau plans to produce two census numbers  
based on: 
</P>
<P>
	--A traditional door-to-door counting of heads, to determine how  
many House seats each state gets for the next decade. The deadline 
for completing this is Dec. 31, 2000. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Probe of Cops' Traffic Stops Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by complaints that drivers are being  
stopped because of their skin color, lawmakers on Wednesday renewed 
the push for a Justice Department study of police practices. 
</P>
<P>
	A national police officers' organization countered that such a  
study would burden law enforcers and lengthen traffic stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the lead House sponsor of a bill  
introduced Wednesday, said the available data indicate a problem 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stopping our citizens to be searched on account of their race  
is an unacceptable activity on the part of law enforcement,'' he 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the prime Senate sponsor, said  
such practices are a ``national insult to our minority community.'' 
He noted that the Justice Department now is investigating the New 
Jersey State Police for such allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill by Conyers passed the House last year but died in  
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Traffic Stops Statistics Act of 1999 would require the  
attorney general to analyze existing data on the issue and then 
collect statistics from select areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The statistics include the driver's race, ethnicity and age;  
whether a search was conducted; a warning or citation issued; 
whether there was an arrest; and length of the stop. 
</P>
<P>
	A report would be due within two years of the bill's enactment.  
</P>
<P>
	Conyers, the House Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat, cited  
a finding by a Florida newspaper, The Orlando Sentinel, that 70 
percent of those pulled over on the state's stretch of Interstate 
95 were black although they represent less than 10 percent of all 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	A court-ordered study in Maryland also found that more than 70  
percent of drivers stopped along a stretch of the same highway in 
that state were black, but that they made up only 17.5 percent of 
the drivers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Scully, executive director of the National Association of  
Police Organizations, which represents 4,000 police unions and 
associations, said officers often do not know beforehand the race 
or ethnic background of the individuals they stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``If passed into law, the bill would place a burden on the  
police and lengthen traffic stops,'' Scully said. He said such 
stops are one of the most vulnerable times for officers and that 
the study ``would make a dangerous situation worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, who endorsed the previous bill,  
said she wants to deal with the issue. Last week, she called on 
police departments to begin collecting the information needed to 
assess the situation and some have begun doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Police chiefs from some of the nation's largest cities also  
pledged last week to develop a national policy for traffic stops in 
an effort to alleviate the concerns.

<HEADLINE> 3Com Founders Endow Chair at MIT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- The founders of 3Com Corp. gave $2  
million Wednesday to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 
a chair at the Laboratory for Computer Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The first holder of the chair will be LCS researcher Tim  
Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the 
World Wide Web Consortium. 
</P>
<P>
	The chair is a first for MIT because it supports researchers,  
rather than professors in the institute's academic departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came one day after Microsoft mogul Bill Gates  
gave $20 million to the institute for a new computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The chair was established to commemorate the 20th anniversary of  
the founding of 3Com, the Santa Clara, Calif., data communications 
equipment maker. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift was organized by Robert M. Metcalfe, an MIT alumnus and  
3Com founder now with International Data Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recommend to successful company founders everywhere that  
they take on similar projects for their alma maters,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Union Fined $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge fined the American Airlines pilots  
union more than $45 million -- nearly all of its net worth -- for an 
illegal sickout that led to the cancellation of more than 6,700 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Joe Kendall had previously held the  
union in contempt after they refused his back to work order. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings were held this week to determine compensatory damages  
for the 10-day sickout, during which American Airlines claimed it 
lost $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had disputed the claim, saying the sickout cost the  
air carrier less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall sided with American, however, fining the union $45.51  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said this particular ruling makes ``me sick to my  
stomach, because I know what's going to happen is some very fine 
men and women pilots are going to be hurt badly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's ruling could devastate the Allied Pilots Association,  
which has about $48 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	APA president Rich Lavoie said, ``We're obviously disappointed  
by the judge's award. We think we're a long way from this being 
fully adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've very disappointed the judge would come up with this  
number. If we're going to go forward, this is not the way to 
resolve the problems. It is a shame that we've come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said it took no ``particular pleasure'' in the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're victims of this as are we,'' said airline spokeswoman  
Andrea Rader. ``We went to court to get the sickout to stop. We 
want to close this chapter and get on with labor peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said both the union and its top two officials -- Lavoy  
and vice president Brian Mayhew -- were liable for the fine, which 
will be paid to the air carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	He scheduled a hearing Monday to discuss how the payments should  
be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had previously placed $10 million, or one-quarter of  
its assets, with the court in preparation for paying a fine. LaVoy 
placed $10,000 with the court and vice president Brian Mayhew 
remitted $5,000 for their roles in the job action. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one union member said the ruling was justified. ``I  
think the judge was right,'' said Captain Carmen Villani, who flies 
out of Washington D.C. ``I personally was very embarassed what I 
experienced in the courtroom over the last two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of about 2,500 pilots called in sick during the job  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots were angered over the integration of recently purchased  
Reno Air, which has resulted in disparities in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall held the APA in contempt on Feb. 12 for failing to  
encourage its members to return to their cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive for American testified during a hearing before  
Kendall Thursday that the airline could have resumed normal 
operations more quickly and would not have canceled 2,279 more 
flights had pilots returned to the cockpits soon after a judge 
ordered them back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have recovered the airline two days earlier,'' Tim  
Ahern, a vice president in scheduling at American, told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during the hearing, Kendall commented that work  
rules allowing pilots to call in sick allowed those who 
participated in the job action to be paid, while those who showed 
up for work lost salary because their flights were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the abnormally high number of sick calls was  
a rational response to the stress the labor dispute created for 
individual pilots. The union noted that safety regulations require 
pilots to stay home if they consider themselves under too much 
stress to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall appeared to mock the claim during the hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of the sudden I'm scratching my head saying, ``Hmm, maybe  
I'm feeling stressed today,''' the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts for the pilots' union have testified that the losses  
they had calculated range between $1.4 million and about $4.5 
million, depending on the time period considered. 
</P>
<P>
	That's compared to the $58.7 million estimate made by American's  
parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	American and the union have yet to resolve the assimilation  
issue involving the purchase of Reno Air. The union contends that 
Reno pilots should be integrated into American from the Dec. 23 
purchase, raising salaries for those affected from that date. The 
airline says it will pay the higher rates as the pilots are 
retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled, but are 
expected to resume.

<HEADLINE> Tests Lead to Release of Okla. Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ADA, Okla. (AP) -- Two inmates who served 12 years in prison on a  
murder conviction were freed today after a judge dismissed charges 
against them. Recent DNA tests from the crime scene did not match 
either man. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Fritz, 49, and Ron Williamson, 46, have said all along  
that they had nothing to do with the killing of a woman in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz had been serving a life sentence and Williamson was  
sentenced to death, though a federal appeals court ruled in 1997 
that he should get a new trial because of inadequate defense at his 
first trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say I'm angry at this point,'' Fritz said at an  
impromptu courthouse news conference where he sat in the arms of 
his mother and daughter. ``I was angry at one time, very bitter. I 
am upset to the point I would like to do everything I can to 
prevent this from happening to someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation now centers on one of the men who testified  
against Williamson and who escaped from a prison public works crew 
in Purcell on Wednesday, District Attorney Bill Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Gore, 38, was implicated in the same DNA tests from the  
crime scene that exonerated Fritz and Williamson. No charges have 
been filed against Gore, who was serving three 40-year sentences 
for burglary, kidnapping and shooting with intent to injure. 
</P>
<P>
	District Judge Tom Landrith ordered a new trial for Fritz as a  
procedural matter but then immediately dismissed the murder charges 
against both men in the slaying of Debra Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can never replace the 12 years the defendants have been  
incarcerated, nor can we forget Debra Carter. All we can do is go 
forward,'' Landrith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said there was a moral, ethical and legal obligation to  
dismiss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it is incumbent based on the evidence that this case  
should be dismissed against them,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Landrith gave the order releasing both men, Fritz stood  
quietly while Williamson replied ``Thank you, judge.'' There was 
little emotion in the packed courtroom initially, but the two 
returned to applause after picking up their belongings at the 
county jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a little bit of animosity in my heart toward  
everyone on this earth for sending me to death row, but I 
eventually found a reason in my heart to forgive,'' said 
Williamson, who was joined by his two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carter's death in her apartment was attributed to  
asphyxiation from a washcloth stuffed down her throat and a 
ligature, possibly an electric blanket cord, pulled around her 
neck. She also was sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were dismissed after Mary Long, a criminologist with  
the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, testified that hair and 
semen samples submitted for DNA testing did not match either man. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case should have never been prosecuted,'' Fritz told The  
Ada Evening News this week. ``The evidence they had against me was 
insufficient and if the police had done an adequate investigation 
of all the suspects, this may have never happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hair-comparison tests, testimony from jailhouse informants and a  
dream recounted by Williamson helped persuade jurors to sentence 
him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson suffers from manic depression and has been  
hospitalized for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal was set in motion four years ago, when Fritz  
contacted the Innocence Project, an organization that reviews 
hundreds of cases of people who claim they have been falsely 
convicted, usually of rape or murder, and helps arrange for DNA 
tests that were unavailable until recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	O.J. Simpson attorney Barry Scheck, who co-founded the Innocence  
Project, became his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissals today were the 61st and 62nd cases where  
prisoners in the United States had been exonerated after 
post-conviction DNA testing, Scheck said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Brosius Likely To Go on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius has  
an acutely sprained right ankle and will not accompany the team to 
Detroit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius, the MVP of last year's World Series sweep over San  
Diego, likely will go on the disabled list, general manager Brian 
Cashman said before Thursday night's game against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	While X-rays showed there wasn't a break, an MRI Thursday  
confirmed the ankle was sprained -- an injury sustained during 
Tuesday night's game while rounding first base on a popup. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees interim manager Don Zimmer intends to use rookie Clay  
Bellinger and Luis Sojo at third until Brosius returns. Bellinger 
made his first major league start Wednesday night and was 1-for-5 
with a double in New York's 14-7 win over the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bellinger is a great third baseman,'' Zimmer said. ``Sojo is  
good no matter where you put him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Andy Pettitte due to come off the disabled list and start  
Saturday at Detroit, putting Brosius on the DL would enable New 
York to activate Pettitte without another roster move. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Cashman said he might bring up a player from the minors  
on Friday so that the Yankees don't go into their weekend series a 
player short. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Yankees news, Zimmer said Hideki Irabu will remain in  
the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where he was yesterday when the game started. That's  
where he'll be tonight,'' Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu, called a ``fat ... toad'' by owner George Steinbrenner  
during spring training, got just one out Wednesday night, allowing 
five runs as Baltimore closed to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramiro Mendoza will continue to fill Irabu's spot in the  
rotation, starting Sunday against the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cashman wouldn't address a report that he discussed trading  
Irabu to Seattle for Jeff Fassero, but made it sounds like rumors 
of a trade are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing hot going with any club,'' Cashman said. ``Not  
even lukewarm.''

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Finishes Her Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- After three days of grueling questioning,  
Jenny Jones stepped off the witness stand and in front of cameras 
to defend her talk show and herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys had portrayed her as a liar, Ms. Jones said.  
``After these three days, I think I've proven I am not,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones completed nearly 12 hours of testimony Wednesday in  
the trial of a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit against ``The 
Jenny Jones Show'' and its producer, Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is not being sued, insisted that she and her show  
were not responsible for the 1995 shooting death of Scott Amedure, 
a gay man who had described his crush on fellow guest Jonathan 
Schmitz during a show taping. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual and was humiliated, was  
found guilty of second-degree murder in the death. The conviction 
was overturned because of an error in jury selection, and his 
retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In their lawsuit, Amedure's family accuses the show of tricking  
a mentally troubled Schmitz into appearing on the program and 
leading him to believe his admirer was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones disagreed, saying ``I don't think we exploit people.''  
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, she said, ``was an adult. He knew the person with the  
crush could be a man or a woman. He was given enough information to 
make an informed choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, asked Ms. Jones, ``You  
knew the show could cause people to have regrets and 
disappointment, didn't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She responded, ``This particular show, it could go either way.''

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs Phone Bill Reorganization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' monthly telephone bills may become  
easier to understand because of action taken Thursday by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies generally will have to reorganize bills to  
spotlight new charges and service providers, give clear 
descriptions of all charges and explain how to contest them. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, adopted 4-1 by the Federal Communications Commission,  
could take effect in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Local telephone and long-distance companies will have to abide  
by all the provisions, while cellular and other wireless companies 
must comply with just some. Violations could lead to fines or other 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Many big phone companies have begun, or plan to make, changes in  
phone bills to make them easier to understand. Ameritech, 
BellSouth, AT&AMP;T, US West and MCI WorldCom believe their bills meet 
many of the FCC's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to restore Americans' confidence in the charges that  
they are paying every month,'' said Bill Kennard, FCC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lone dissenter, Harold Furchtgott-Roth, said he believed the  
agency lacked the authority to take such action. He also wondered 
how the agency would judge whether companies' descriptions are 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials acknowledged that it would be subjective  
determination. Also, they could not offer examples of what might 
constitute a clear description for the line-item charges that have 
been appearing on some bills, under different names, for the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those charges, which some consumers have said are confusing,  
come from a variety of sources: a FCC overhaul of phone fees; 
itemized charges for government-ordered subsidies once included in 
rates; and paying the costs of complying with other government 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies can recover these costs however they choose. AT&AMP;T, MCI  
WorldCom, Sprint, the nation's Bell companies and others have 
decided to do it through line items. The FCC does not force 
companies to spell out the charges in bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the FCC's new rules, descriptions of those line-item  
charges will have to be clear. Eventually, the labels will be 
standardized, with the wording determined later. If wireless 
companies include such line-items, they also would be subject to 
uniform labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a mischievous notion,'' AT&AMP;T said in a statement,  
adding it is concerned the government ``would seek to dictate how a 
company can describe to its own customers those government fees and 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Strickling, chief of the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau, said  
any company that now describes these line-item charges as 
``federally imposed'' or ``federally mandated'' will have to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC officials said they were not acting to avoid being  
associated with the line-items. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC also will require local and long-distance companies to  
use clear descriptions about all other charges and provide 
information on when nonpayment could cause phone service to be cut 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the FCC will not apply this provision to wireless  
companies. The FCC does not specify the language for the 
descriptions but encourages the industry to come up with uniform 
wording. 
</P>
<P>
	Local and long-distance companies also will have to highlight --  
the FCC does not say how -- any new provider or charge not on 
previous bills. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the bills will have to show when a person's  
long-distance carrier was switched or the person is charged for 
calls to a hotline. Consumer advocates say this should make it 
easier for customers to spot fraudulent charges.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Moves To Keep Nixon Off Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for President Nixon's estate want to  
put his daughter on the witness stand to convince a federal judge 
that the government should pay millions of dollars for confiscating 
presidential papers and secret White House tapes when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Justice Department moved on Wednesday to stop Julie  
Nixon Eisenhower from testifying in the case. It also argued to 
block the Nixon legal team's attempt to have one of its attorneys, 
R. Stan Mortenson, take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony from these two rebuttal witnesses would force delays  
in the final stages of the trial, which is in its 69th day, said 
government attorney Neil Koslowe. The Justice Department would have 
to take new depositions, possibly recall witnesses and collect 
other information needed for cross-examinations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are seeking to call brand-new witnesses in the guise of  
rebuttal witnesses,'' the Justice Department argued in a motion to 
exclude testimony from the two witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn has not decided whether to  
let the witnesses testify. 
</P>
<P>
	If Mrs. Eisenhower is permitted to take the stand, she is  
expected to testify that her father planned to put his papers in a 
traditional presidential library, so long as the government funded 
it and allowed him to restrict access to certain materials, 
Mortenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That never happened. In 1974, Congress, fearing that evidence of  
criminal wrongdoing might have been destroyed or tampered with, 
seized the materials, including some 42 million papers, 3,700 hours 
of secretly recorded tapes and thousands of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	If Nixon had known the government was not going to set up a  
presidential library, his plans would have changed, Mortenson said 
after the hearing. Mrs. Eisenhower might have sold some items to 
ensure proper funding for a private library, Mortenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government contends that if anything must be paid to  
compensate the Nixon estate, a fair market value for the materials 
would be no more than $2.2 million. The Nixon estate places the 
value at $30 million or more -- and with interest, compensation 
could total $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
	As a witness, Mortenson would dispute testimony of the  
government's chief appraiser, Charles Sachs, who testified that the 
presidential materials are worth about $1.5 million. That's much 
lower than the $35 million Sachs told the Nixon estate they were 
worth during a meeting in 1992, says Martin Minsker, a colleague of 
Mortenson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government pointed out that Sachs testified he didn't  
remember the appraisal figure he gave the Nixon estate in 1992. 
``Mr. Mortenson is not in a position to impeach a witness for 
saying 'I don't remember,''' Koslowe said.

<HEADLINE> Honda Might Expand to North America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co. plans to  
build a new manufacturing plant in the United States or Canada by 
2001, a newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which would employ more than 1,000 workers, would  
produce mainly sports-utility vehicles, a report in the Nihon 
Keizai business daily said, citing unnamed company sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda spokesman Yuzuru Matsuno denied the report, saying that  
his company had made no decision to build another North American 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that Honda is planning to boost its  
production capacity in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda currently has two factories in North America-- one in the  
United States and one in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	If the reported new plant becomes operational, Honda would have  
a production capacity of 1.1 million vehicles in the U.S. and 
Canada -- almost on par with its domestic capacity of between 1.2 
million and 1.3 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant's location is still under discussion, with the  
southeastern U.S. as the leading candidate for the site, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Honda's existing North American plants have a capacity of one  
million vehicles, which the automaker is aiming to increase to 1.01 
million in 2001, Matsuno said.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Urge Minorities Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Newspapers must increase diversity among  
their staffs and on their pages if they are to turn a profit, two 
executives told the American Society of Newspaper Editors on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Mirror Co. CEO Mark Willes and San Jose Mercury News  
Publisher Jay T. Harris said improved coverage of minority 
communities has enabled them to expand readership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a moral commitment to do all we can to encourage  
respect, tolerance and diversity,'' said Willes. 
</P>
<P>
	More Hispanics are reading the Los Angeles Times and more women  
are reading the Hartford Courant because of efforts to attract 
those groups, Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing what we're doing because it's right, but also  
because it's essential for us to grow,'' he said. ``Our papers are 
better because those stories are there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mercury News has launched two papers, one catering to  
Hispanics and the other to Vietnamese living in Silicon Valley, 
because the paper had trouble reaching those groups, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People of this unfolding community will have some primary form  
of information. The question is whether it will be us or some other 
medium,'' Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Associated Press Managing Editors and the  
American Society of Newspaper Editors announced a project designed 
to make the pages of newspapers mirror the racial and ethnic mix of 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, called ``The National Time-Out for Diversity and  
Accuracy,'' asks reporters and editors to meet during the week of 
May 17-21 to discuss ways that race and ethnicity affect choices of 
what is covered and who is assigned to cover it.

<HEADLINE> NFL Europe League To Start Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawrence Phillips gets another chance at pro  
football when his Barcelona Dragons open the NFL Europe league 
season this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows he has to get through a lot in the next few months,  
but so far I have been 100 percent pleased with everything,'' said 
Dragons coach Jack Bicknell, who took Phillips in the 10th round of 
the league draft after he was cut in training camp last summer by 
the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never sat down and told him this is his last chance. If  
he can't figure that out, he doesn't need to hear it from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the No. 6 overall pick in the 1996 NFL draft, has had  
a turbulent career with various run-ins with the law since his days 
at Nebraska, including 23 days of jail time during his 19 months 
with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicknell described Phillips as ``everything you want in a  
football player and a teammate. He's in great shape -- 208 pounds 
and zero percent of fat'' with only a niggling hamstring injury 
slowing him. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who feels he has been treated unfairly by the media,  
has declined interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a great kid here and you can see he's been burned by  
what's happened,'' Bicknell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also trying to resurrect his career will be Heisman Trophy  
winner Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are a lot of people like me who would like to  
see those guys do well, because it's probably their last chance,'' 
league president Oliver Luck said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware has a profitable computer business in Houston, which he  
terms his ``B plan.'' Now it's back to work on the ``A plan'': 
making it as an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does seem a long way away, but this is where it begins,''  
said Ware, who starts for the Berlin Thunder this weekend in a 
league designed to groom young talent and give guys like Ware and 
Phillips another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ware says he's never been in the right place at the right time  
since winning the Heisman at Houston in 1989 and calls his four 
years as a backup with the Detroit Lions a ``continual setback with 
three different offenses in four years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to right himself in the Canadian Football League, ``but  
it was a similar thing with three teams in three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Ware stepped away from football and worked as an  
active partner in a computer consulting business in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer I was away from it (football) last year the more I  
missed it,'' he said. ``The juice started to flow about midseason 
and I knew I wanted to see about getting back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders signed Ware as a free agent and expect him  
to compete with Rich Gannon, Wade Wilson and Pat Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to starting here this weekend,'' Ware  
said. ``And I like my chances of being No. 1 when the season kicks 
off for the Raiders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Frankfurt Galaxy play the Thunder in an  
all-German clash in Frankfurt, while the Amsterdam Admirals travel 
to Barcelona. On Sunday, the defending champion Scottish Claymores 
are home for the Duesseldorf Rhein Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams after the 10-game regular season will meet in  
the World Bowl in Duesseldorf on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The major change this season is the closure of the one-time  
``flagship'' franchise, the London/England Monarchs, which has been 
replaced by a third German team -- the Thunder, coached by Wes 
Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	As a developmental league, NFL Europe has been a rousing  
success, with 139 NFL Europe veterans playing last season in the 
NFL. About 150 players have been allocated this season from the 
NFL, up 97 from last year.

<HEADLINE> House Studies Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members on Thursday discussed ways to  
attack money laundering, examining the roles played by larger 
financial institutions and small check-cashing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money laundering is the Achilles' heel of organized crime,''  
said Rep. Marge Roukema, chairwoman of the House Banking and 
Financial subcommittee on financial institutions. ``Fighting money 
laundering is about fighting drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department estimates that some $48 billion in  
drug-linked money alone is laundered overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	One growing trend, involving ``money services business,'' has  
attracted congressional scrutiny, but no consensus on how to crack 
down. In this scheme, money is laundered in relatively small 
amounts through check-cashing companies and sellers of traveler's 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Roukema, R-N.J., said 160,000 such companies do about $200  
million in business every year. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of tighter reporting requirements on transactions said  
the changes would represent an invasion of privacy, needless 
regulation and an impediment to immigrants aiding families 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more interested in the big boys'' of the money-handling  
world, said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., also said he opposes regulating the  
smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are legitimate tools already available to law  
enforcement to handle money laundering,'' said Barr, a former U.S. 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	One case mentioned involved Citibank and Raul Salinas, the  
brother of Carlos salinas de Gortari, Mexico's president from 1988 
to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	A report for Congress in December said Citibank officials  
violated their own money laundering controls in helping Raul 
Salinas move as much as $100 million in alleged drug money out of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report by the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, said it remained unclear whether the 
nation's second largest bank broke any laws in moving the funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A Citibank spokesman said at the time that the report contained  
``errors of fact and interpretation'' but said the bank would 
cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said neither it nor the Federal Reserve could determine  
whether Citibank broke any laws, and the Comptroller of the 
Currency found the bank's actions ``did not result in civil 
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Salinas has denied wrongdoing and said most of the money he  
moved came from sale of a construction company.

<HEADLINE>  Seven Die As Plane Crashes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- A Korean Air cargo plane crashed and  
exploded in a migrant worker community minutes after leaving 
Shanghai's busy airport today. At least five people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seoul-bound plane, a 7-year-old McDonnell Douglas MD-11,  
crashed into an industrial development six miles southwest of 
Hongqiao airport, Korean Air and Chinese officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, carrying 68 tons of cargo, then plowed into housing  
for migrant workers, said employees with Shanghai's Minhang 
district fire department who saw the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air said there was ``a high possibility'' explosives  
destroyed the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	All three members of the flight crew and four others on the  
ground were killed, said Moon Chang-boo, the South Korean consul in 
Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
	However, at a news conference in the South Korean capital of  
Seoul, Korean Air said five people died and the fate of the three 
crew members was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	Moon said 25 people were injured, some seriously. A doctor with  
Minhang Central Hospital who refused to give his name described 37 
people as critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air said the plane reached an altitude of 15,000 feet  
before crashing at 4:10 p.m., six minutes after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plane had a normal takeoff, and ... there is little  
possibility that it could crash because of mechanical 
malfunctions,'' Korean Air Vice President Shim E-taek told a news 
conference in Seoul, explaining why explosives might have been 
involved. He added that witnesses heard two explosions on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's transport ministry dispatched two investigators to  
Shanghai, and Korean Air said it had also sent a team. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash scattered pieces of the plane along the ground and  
blew out car windows for several blocks, said a local resident and 
a Minhang district rescue worker who would only give his surname, 
Gu. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the injured was a road crew working in the industrial  
development zone where the crash occurred, said a fire department 
worker who identified herself as Ms. Zhang. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was the second in eastern China in less than two  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	All 61 passengers and crew aboard a China Southwest Airlines jet  
died when it slammed into a cabbage field outside the city of 
Wenzhou, 250 miles south of Shanghai, on Feb. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	For Korean Air, the crash was the first major accident since  
Korean Air Flight 801 slammed into a Guam hillside in 1997, killing 
229 people. 
</P>
<P>
	After several Korean Air planes slipped off runways and were  
involved in other minor accidents, the South Korean government late 
last year ordered the carrier to cut back domestic flights by 15 
percent for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction, scheduled to end April 25, was said to have  
cost Korean Air about $30 million in lost revenues.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Earnings Set Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s earnings climbed 31  
percent in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations on 
continued strong profits in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	GM reported today it earned a record $2.1 billion, or $3.04 a  
share, in the first three months of the year compared with $1.6 
billion, or $2.27 a share, during the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of analysts by First Call Corp. estimated GM would earn  
$2.88 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the world's largest automaker totaled $42.4 billion, up  
6 percent from $40 billion a year ago. Revenue figures exclude the 
sale of Delphi Automotive Systems, the big parts unit that GM is in 
the process of spinning off. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings including Delphi were a company record for any  
quarter, narrowly surpassing the $2.09 billion it earned in the 
second quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're particularly pleased with the strong performance of GM  
North America and General Motors Acceptance Corp. in the first 
quarter,'' GM Chairman Jack Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's North American operations earned $1.4 billion,  
up 67 percent from the $841 million it earned in the first three 
months of 1998. Profits of GM's European operations increased 76 
percent to $174 million, compared with $99 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those performances offset losses of $60 million in Asia-Pacific  
and $25 million in Latin American operations. In the first quarter 
of 1997, GM earned $6 million in Asia-Pacific and $53 million in 
Latin America. Automakers have been struggling with the depressed 
economies in both regions during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	GMAC, the company's financial subsidiary, earned $392 million,  
up 13 percent from $349 million in the comparable quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial results reflect our continued efforts to improve  
product quality and increase manufacturing efficiency,'' GM 
President G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said. ``Combined with our 
unrelenting cost-reduction activities, these factors allowed us to 
meet the intense competitive price pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter marked the first time GM had back-to-back quarterly  
earnings increases since the first two quarters of 1997. It was the 
best quarter for GMAC since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's total automotive-related income, excluding Delphi, was $1.5  
billion, compared with $1 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said GM's automotive operations benefitted from several  
new, highly profitable models in the North American market, led by 
the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, twin full-size 
pickups. The big truck is GM's most popular model. 
</P>
<P>
	Although GM's U.S. vehicle sales were up 6 percent in the  
quarter, its market share declined to 28.8 percent from 30.2 
percent in the first quarter of 1998 -- an indication of the 
strength of demand for new vehicles industrywide. 
</P>
<P>
	Market share in Europe was down slightly to 9.6 percent from 9.8  
percent a year ago. Wagoner said GM was expecting gains with the 
recent introduction of the new Opel and Vauxhall Zafira minivan and 
the new line of Opel Vectra sedans.

<HEADLINE> Airport Fire Safety Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Firefighting rules for the nation's airports  
are inadequate because they do not require crews to rescue 
passengers and put out fires inside airplanes, the nation's largest 
firefighter union argues in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules specify only how many trucks should be operating, how  
fast they should respond to an accident and how much water and 
firefighting agent, such as foam, they must carry. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Association of Fire Fighters, writing in  
conjunction with a coalition including the Air Line Pilots 
Association and the Association of Flight Attendants, said the 
practical effect is that airports maintain a minimal staffing 
level, so low that the responding firefighters merely clear a path 
from a burning airplane, but do not fight the fire inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions argue that safety would be improved by hiring more  
firefighters and mandating an expanded role for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today many airports across the United States are completely  
unprepared to respond in the first few vital minutes after an 
airplane crashes and fires ignite, when lives hang in the 
balance,'' reads the opening sentence of the report, which was 
being released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Federal Aviation Administration, which writes airport  
safety regulations, and the Airports Council International-North 
America, which represents airports handling 90 percent of domestic 
airplane travel, disputed the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to deal with the worst-case scenarios, whether it  
is an aircraft disaster, an airport disaster or a natural 
disaster,'' said airports council spokeswoman Bonnie Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said they are deploying equipment that pierces an  
aircraft's skin and injects firefighting agents. The agency also 
provides firefighting training at regional centers around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very emotional subject, whenever you're dealing with  
people's lives. But overall, over the long run, based on accidents 
that have occurred and incidents, we have played a good role and 
continue to do so,'' said Bob David, manager of the FAA's airport 
safety and operations division. 
</P>
<P>
	While the most memorable airline accidents involve catastrophic,  
unsurvivable failures such as the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off 
Long Island or the plunge of ValuJet Flight 595 into the Florida 
Everglades, the majority of crashes occur near airports on takeoff 
or landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition examined 60 crash reports written by the National  
Transportation Safety Board between 1970 and 1995. It found that 78 
percent of fatalities occurred after an impact. Nearly 96 percent 
of those were caused by smoke inhalation or burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA addresses airport fire safety with several rules that  
outline the equipment airports must provide, the training they must 
offer and the response times they must meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions contend that because the rules do not specify  
staffing levels -- only the amount and type of equipment needed -- 
airports can fulfill the requirements with highly automated trucks 
that have few operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport and FAA officials say many airports exceed the equipment  
minimum and also allow for interior firefighting. Those who keep 
smaller crews believe flight attendants and the airplane flight 
crew can help passengers get out of a plane, so firefighters should 
concentrate on delivering them to safety.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Posts Losses, Plans Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel is learning that playtime isn't always  
fun. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest toymaker announced Thursday that it will cut  
3,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its total workforce, and close some 
plants as part of an ongoing reorganization effort to revive its 
slumping sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street cheered the news of the restructuring, sending  
Mattel's stock up $2.31 1/4, nearly 9 percent, to $28.25 in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a  
smaller-than-expected loss of $17.9 million, or 7 cents per share, 
for the quarter ended March 31, compared to a net profit of $12.7 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $692 million, down 2 percent from  
$705 million. Mattel noted the first quarter is traditionally the 
smallest of the year, amounting to about 10 percent of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs and closings, expected to result in $50 million in  
savings this year and $400 million over the next three years, are 
the latest attempts by Mattel chief executive Jill Barad to return 
the ailing toymaker to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has been forced to rethink its business after important  
retail customers like Toys R Us drastically cut back their orders 
and asked for delivery of inventory closer to the time they wanted 
to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the company announced a management shakeup, which  
included the departure of president Bruce Stein and the 
reconfiguration of the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the layoffs and plant closures, which will be  
worldwide, weren't disclosed. Pink slips will go out next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very unfair to tell you before we notified them,''  
Barad said during a conference call Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has been aggressively pursuing opportunities outside  
traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets. Mattel's 
purchase of software-giant The Learning Co. is expected to close 
next month, and it recently announced a new line of toys developed 
with chipmaker Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	A free CD-ROM will soon be included with every Barbie purchase,  
Barad said, adding she was determined to get girls on computers and 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel also announced Thursday it would spend $50 million to  
launch an Internet venture. Mattel already sells some of its toys 
on its own Web sites, and plans to launch a Mattel.com site in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restructuring is the right way to go for Mattel,'' said Tucker  
Anthony analyst Margaret Whitfield, who raised her rating on Mattel 
stock to a ``strong buy.'' ``The industry has changed to a more 
technology-oriented business at the expense of basic toys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will be very powerful for the company,''  
Whitfield said, noting it will give Mattel greater independence 
with the ability to ship directly to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the earnings decline in the first quarter was attributed  
to expenses from Mattel's purchase of the Pleasant Co., which makes 
the American Girl line of dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Barbie, Mattel's core brand, were up 3 percent  
worldwide and U.S. shipping was up 11 percent. The company's 
Fisher-Price business returned to health with a 9 percent worldwide 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But its Power Wheels line was down, still hurt by the 1998  
recall of up to 10 million of the battery-run ride-on toys because 
they posed a serious fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of some toys based on TV characters were also down. A year  
ago, Tickle Me Elmo contributed approximately $60 million to 
first-quarter earnings. Sales had shrunk to near nothing in the 
first quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Long-Haired Stalking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Mich. (AP) -- A man with an apparent hair fetish was  
accused of stalking a long-haired 7-year-old girl and trying to 
break into her family's home in an attempt to cut off her locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Thackery, 46, was in jail on $100,000 bond, charged with  
stalking a minor and attempted home invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect approached the girl's mother at a garage sale at the  
family's home last July and offered her $100 for the girl's 
ponytail, Sgt. Jeff Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She, of course, freaked out and shooed him away,'' Turner  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, the family -- whose name was withheld to protect the  
child -- reported seeing the man parked near their home at least 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 7, the girl's father was in his car when he noticed a  
man trying to open the front door to their home. His wife and 
daughter, who were inside, called police while the father 
confronted the man, who then left. 
</P>
<P>
	That evening, police arrested Thackery, who is being held  
pending an April 28 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stalking a minor carries a penalty of up to five years in  
prison. Attempted home invasion is punishable by up to 10 years in 
prison and a $10,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices extended Wednesday's strong showing, with reports of poor  
weather in the Plains states and in South America providing 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures benefited from the continued reports of cold  
weather in Argentina and U.S. growing regions, analysts said. 
Forecasts show that cold weather could reach as far south as Texas, 
damaging crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were limited as market participants were concerned that  
there also may be some beneficial moisture that could help the 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices followed a similar pattern, rising at the open  
and then moderating, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were up on reports that wet weather may delay  
planting. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, wheat for May delivery was up 3 3/4 cents to  
$2.62 1/2 a bushel; May corn rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; May 
oats rose 3 cents to $1.19 3/4 a bushel; and May soybeans were up 1/4 
cent to $4.89 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .43 cent to 63.17 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .50 cent to 71.40 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .32 cent to 53.60 cents a pound; and May pork bellies rose .65 
cent to 52.62 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Ally Sentenced for Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A powerful ally of Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu was sentenced to prison Thursday for taking bribes, 
capping a drama likely to affect the tight Israeli election race. 
</P>
<P>
	Arieh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox ethnically based  
Shas party, received four years in prison -- a tough sentence that 
could rally Shas supporters among Jews of Middle East background to 
the May 17 polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas leaders have said the actions against Deri and charges  
brought against other party leaders are part of an effort by 
Israel's political establishment to keep Shas from gaining more 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moroccan-born Deri has backed Netanyahu's re-election  
campaign -- and a fresh outpouring of support could help Netanyahu 
in his race against opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak. Polls 
show the race is now a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu is appealing to Israelis who feel marginalized by what  
he describes as the `elites,' including judges. Shas appeals to 
``outsider'' constituencies that also lend strong backing to 
Netanyahu's campaign for prime minister: ultra-Orthodox Jews and 
Sephardi Jews -- Jews of Middle Eastern origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has struggled, though, to maintain his support among  
Sephardi Jews, many of whom live in small factory towns that have 
been affected by Netanyahu's privatization policy and are hard hit 
by unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has centered his campaign on economic issues, promising to  
cut joblessness in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Shas has a core of several hundred thousand followers, but can  
count on backing from hundreds of thousands more when tensions 
between Ashkenazi Jews of European descent and Sephardi Jews are 
exacerbated. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more they persecute us, the better we do in the polls,''  
said Shas lawmaker David Tal. 
</P>
<P>
	Deri, who was convicted March 17, has said he will appeal the  
verdict to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's drama was heightened when Deri failed to show up on  
time for his sentencing. He was paying a bedside visit to Rabbi 
Ovadia Yosef, the Shas spiritual leader who hand-picked Deri as his 
right-hand man. Yosef suffered a mild heart attack earlier this 
week and had undergone an angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Deri scrambled to the sentencing more than 90 minutes late, his  
white stretch limo screeching to a halt in front of the court. 
Hundreds of black-garbed Shas followers scattered to the sides. 
</P>
<P>
	They broke into a defiant show of singing and dancing when the  
verdict was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerusalem District Court Judge Yaakov Tzemach said the sentence  
reflected the gravity of the crime. Deri's three co-conspirators 
all received sentences of a year or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Tzemach said Deri, 40, took bribes throughout his five years in  
public service, first as the director-general of the Interior 
Ministry and then as Interior Minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribe-taking, Tzemach said, ``presented an extreme danger to  
the nation and the people ... too much mercy would be cruel to 
society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tzemach -- who, like Deri, is Sephardi and Orthodox -- carefully  
enunciated the luxuries purchased with the $155,000 taken in bribes 
-- most prominently, a new apartment fitted with a Jacuzzi. The list 
clearly riled Deri, who often expresses humility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt ... as though a Biblical punishment was being meted --  
really -- stoning, burning, etc.,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Marrow for Breast Cancer Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four major studies found no difference in  
survival for advanced breast cancer patients who underwent arduous 
and costly bone marrow transplants instead of less rigorous 
therapy. But positive results from a fifth trial raise hope that 
the treatment might still help some women. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is an aggressive treatment reserved for the most  
advanced breast cancer: ultrahigh doses of chemotherapy followed by 
a bone marrow transplant to repair the immune system destruction 
caused by such high-dose therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women have demanded the procedure, believing it is  
their last chance even though there has been no scientific proof of 
its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary research results announced this morning, from  
long-awaited studies of 2,100 women in the United States, 
Scandinavia, South Africa and France, proved a bitter 
disappointment for many doctors and patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the South African study found a benefit: More than five  
years after treatment, fewer women who got the high-dose 
chemotherapy plus a transplant had suffered cancer relapses. 
Seventeen percent of the aggressively treated women had died vs. 35 
percent of women who received standard therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Believers in the transplant therapy were quick to note that the  
other four studies are not yet completed and thus the findings 
could change -- they may show a longer-term benefit, or point to 
subgroups of women who do better with aggressive treatment. Also, 
they noted that the positive South African results could be because 
those doctors used different chemotherapy drugs and thus should not 
be disregarded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Cancer Institute, which is funding numerous  
studies of bone marrow transplants for breast cancer, stressed that 
the overall findings are bleak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope was that the more aggressive approach would prove  
clearly superior,'' said Dr. Richard Klausner, NCI's director. 
``But based upon these studies, high-dose therapy has not yet been 
shown to be superior to lower-dose treatment. These studies do 
suggest it is at least equivalent in terms of overall survival, but 
the added toxicity and costs ... require it to be superior if it is 
to become a standard of care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When breast cancer spreads to other organs, called metastatic  
disease, only 22 percent of patients survive five years. Some 
43,000 U.S. women will die of it this year. Given such statistics, 
many patients have demanded the ultrahigh dose therapy and bone 
marrow transplant, which doctors refer to as HDC/BMT. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some doctors are trying the more aggressive therapy  
in women whose cancer already is very advanced at diagnosis, having 
spread to 10 or more lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's studies include two in metastatic disease, and the  
high-dose/transplant treatment proved equivalent to easier therapy, 
said Dr. Edward Stadtmauer of the University of Pennsylvania, who 
led the U.S. study. The French study, however, did suggest that 
transplant therapy slowed the time to cancer relapse. 
</P>
<P>
	For high-risk women, the South African study found a survival  
benefit that two others didn't. But in the U.S. study, transplant 
therapy did lead to 25 percent fewer relapses. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some patients, being alive without disease has a much  
improved quality of life,'' that may make aggressive therapy 
worthwhile, noted Dr. Allen Lichter, president of the American 
Society of Clinical Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer specialists have been bracing for the findings to cause  
new confusion and controversy -- and fears about whether insurance 
companies will continue to cover the $50,000-to-$150,000 procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real dilemma we're in is, what happens now,'' said Dr.  
Harmon Eyre of the American Cancer Society. ``We think it's 
important that women still have the procedure covered until we have 
absolutely definitive studies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's studies have flaws: They started 10 years ago, and both  
standard chemotherapy and bone marrow transplants have improved 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, ``It's too early to draw conclusions,'' stressed  
Dr. William Peters of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in 
Detroit, who led the largest of the five studies and said three 
more years of research is required. 
</P>
<P>
	Many insurance companies won't make coverage decisions pending  
more in-depth data from the studies, scheduled to be released next 
month at a major cancer meeting and then published in medical 
journals, said Dr. Don Young of the American Association of Health 
Plans.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Arrested for Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry  
was charged with possession of cocaine and soliciting a prostitute 
Wednesday night, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry allegedly solicited an undercover officer for sex for  
$50, said Sgt. M. Hamlin of the Tampa Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon being searched by officers K. Daniel and B. Holder, 0.3  
grams of powder cocaine was found inside of Strawberry's wallet, 
the police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was released on $6,000 bond shortly after 1 a.m. EDT  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder, an eight-time All-Star, has been in  
Tampa at the Yankees' extended spring training camp while he works 
back into shape following colon cancer surgery last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees won the World Series without him, New York  
City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised Strawberry ``for the 
comeback he's made as a baseball player and the comeback he's 
making in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in New York last weekend to receive his World Series  
ring, then returned to Tampa. He was not expected to rejoin the 
Yankees until next month, until after a stint with Columbus of the 
Triple-A International League. The Yankees did not want him to join 
Columbus until after he completed chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's list of substance abuse problems is lengthy.  
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball suspended him for 60 days in 1995 after he  
tested positive for cocaine. The previous year, he entered the 
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and spent four weeks 
undergoing treatment of a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, while with the New York Mets, he entered the Smithers  
Center in New York for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to substance abuse, Strawberry also ran afoul of tax  
laws. In April 1995, a federal court ordered him to repay $350,000 
in back taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement. 
But the order allowed him to leave home for practice and games, and 
to travel to road games. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who came to prominence with the Mets in the early  
1980s and won the NL Rookie of the Year award in 1983, also has had 
off-and-on problems in Los Angeles, where he was accused of failing 
to make timely payments to his ex-wife Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	He rebounded after signing with the Yankees in June 1995 and had  
remained drug free, with regular testing by major league baseball. 
Strawberry had his best season in seven years in 1998, hitting .247 
with 24 home runs and 57 RBIs in 295 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, because of complicated rules involving baseball's  
luxury tax, shifted him to a minor league roster during the 
offseason, fearing he would not be healthy enough to play by 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, the No. 1 pick in baseball's June 1980 amateur  
draft, joined with Dwight Gooden to help lead the Mets to the 1986 
World Series title. Gooden also has had cocaine problems and 
currently is with the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has a .250 career average with 332 homers and 994  
RBIs in 16 major league seasons with the Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
San Francisco Giants and Yankees. He led the NL with 39 homers in 
1988 and topped 100 RBIs three times with the Mets from 1987-90.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defends NATO Air Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- President Clinton said today that a united  
NATO is determined ``to maintain and intensify attacks'' against 
the Serbs to save Kosovo and to guarantee the security of its 
ethnic Albanians with an international force. He invited Russia to 
join such an effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the  
NATO air war will be waged until Slobodan Milsevic's forces are so 
weakened they yield their grip on the province or permit ethnic 
Albanian refugees to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering editors' questions, Clinton said the mistaken bombing  
that the Yugoslavs said killed 75 refugees near the Albanian border 
was regrettable and tragic, but no reason to change the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot have this kind of conflict without some errors like  
this occurring,'' he said. ``This is not a business of 
perfection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Clinton said the refugees would not have been in harm's way  
had not Milosevic's forces driven them from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot simply watch as hundreds of thousand of people are  
brutalized, murdered, raped, forced from their homes ... all in the 
name of ethnic pride,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked how he would respond to radio talk show  
critics who question whether he has the moral authority to be 
commander in chief and how he would answer to an Air Force pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't have to. ``I am his commander in chief,'' and  
U.S. pilots are performing admirably. ``They don't deserve to hear 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Raising the possibility of Russian aid in protecting ethnic  
Albanians once the bloodshed ends, Clinton it is ``the kind of 
mission I hope Russia can join as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, bitter opponents of the current air campaign,  
joined the peacekeeping force that settled ethnic strive in Bosnia 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The president began by saying that the forum itself was striking  
evidence of the difference between a free press and a closed press. 
He said the government run press in Yugoslavia ``has created an 
alternative reality'' based on propaganda about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness our press and the press around the world have  
tried to get at and get out the truth,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Long term, he said, NATO is fighting for the future and  
stability of multiethnic democracies in southeastern Europe, the 
historically troubled Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and our NATO allies are in Kosovo today because we want to  
stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic's aim was to drive the Albanian majority from  
the province even if it means turning Kosovo ``into a lifeless 
wasteland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Yugoslav leader also sought to divide NATO, but  
after three weeks, the alliance is solid. He said ``NATO is more 
united today than when the operation began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned  
and long premeditated attack on an entire people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said NATO will end it, and will at the same time increase  
efforts to help the more than 500,000 refugees driven from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One editor told Clinton that he had heard the Pentagon had  
intelligence that Milosevic's forces had chemical weapons. He asked 
what the U.S. response would be to use of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said it would be ``swift and overwhelming. ... I think  
they are well aware of the dangers of overly escalating this. ... 
That's all I should say right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Clinton's staff signaled an end to the  
question-and-answer session, but the president said he would go on. 
``They think the longer I stay up here, the greater my chances of 
screwing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the lack of information released by the military  
about bombing attacks, Clinton explained that there were problems 
with weather and with coordinating the response with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware this is a difficulty, I am working on it, and trying  
to get NATO to do more as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he feels ``the more information we can get out  
there quickly, the better off we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the convention hotel, several hundred protesters chanted  
``No war, no bombs, no new Vietnam.'' A smaller group demonstrated 
in support of the NATO campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Has Loss, Plans Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mattel is learning that playtime isn't always  
fun. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest toymaker announced today that it will cut  
3,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its total workforce, and close some 
plants as part of an ongoing reorganization effort to revive its 
slumping sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street cheered the news of the restructuring, sending  
Mattel's stock up nearly 16 percent to 4 1/8 to 30 1/16 in afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the El Segundo, Calif.-based Mattel reported a  
smaller-than-expected loss of $17.9 million, or 7 cents per share, 
for the quarter ended March 31, compared to a net profit of $12.7 
million for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $692 million, down 2 percent from  
$705 million. Mattel noted the first quarter is traditionally the 
smallest of the year, amounting to about 10 percent of its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The layoffs and closings, expected to result in $50 million in  
savings this year and $400 million over the next three years, are 
the latest attempts by Mattel chief executive Jill Barad to return 
the ailing toymaker to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has been forced to rethink its business after important  
retail customers like Toys R Us drastically cut back their orders 
and asked for delivery of inventory closer to the time they wanted 
to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the company announced a management shakeup, which  
included the departure of president Bruce Stein and the 
reconfiguration of the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the layoffs and plant closures, which will be  
worldwide, weren't disclosed. Pink slips will go out next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be very unfair to tell you before we notified them,''  
Barad said during a conference call Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has been aggressively pursuing opportunities outside  
traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets. Mattel's 
purchase of software-giant The Learning Co. is expected to close 
next month, and it recently announced a new line of toys developed 
with chipmaker Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	A free CD-ROM will soon be included with every Barbie purchase,  
Barad said, adding she was determined to get girls on computers and 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel also announced Thursday it would spend $50 million to  
launch an Internet venture. Mattel already sells some of its toys 
on its own Web sites, and plans to launch a Mattel.com site in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	``Restructuring is the right way to go for Mattel,'' said Tucker  
Anthony analyst Margaret Whitfield, who raised her rating on Mattel 
stock to a ``strong buy.'' ``The industry has changed to a more 
technology-oriented business at the expense of basic toys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet will be very powerful for the company,''  
Whitfield said, noting it will give Mattel greater independence 
with the ability to ship directly to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the earnings decline in the first quarter were  
attributed to expenses from Mattel's purchase of the Pleasant Co., 
which makes the American Girl line of dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Barbie, Mattel's core brand strength, were up 3 percent  
worldwide and U.S. shipping was up 11 percent. The company's 
Fisher-Price business returned to health with a 9 percent worldwide 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	But its Power Wheels line was down, still hurt by the 1998  
recall of up to 10 million of the battery-run ride-on toys because 
they posed a serious fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Character brands were also down. A year ago, Tickle Me Elmo  
contributed approximately $60 million to first quarter earnings. 
Sales were nil the first quarter this year.

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Union Fined $45M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday fined the American  
Airlines' pilots union more than $45 million -- an amount that 
exceeds the union's assets -- for an illegal sickout that led to the 
cancellation of more than 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-day sickout this February stranded hundreds of thousands  
of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge Joe Kendall had previously held the  
union in contempt after it initially refused his back-to-work 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of about 2,500 pilots called in sick during the job  
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots were angered over the way American was integrating its  
purchase of Reno Air, a small western carrier, which resulted in 
disparities in pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings were held this week to determine compensatory damages  
for the sickout, during which American Airlines claimed it lost $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had disputed the claim, saying the job action cost the  
air carrier less than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall sided with American, however, fining the union $45.51  
million. The fine will be paid directly to AMR Group, the parent of 
American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's ruling could devastate the Allied Pilots Association,  
which has about $38 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	APA president Rich LaVoy hinted at an appeal would be made. ``We  
think we're a long way from this being fully adjudicated,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've very disappointed the judge would come up with this  
number. If we're going to go forward, this is not the way to 
resolve the problems. It is a shame that we've come to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines said it took no ``particular pleasure'' in the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're victims of this as are we,'' airline spokeswoman  
Andrea Rader. ``We went to court to get the sickout to stop. We 
want to close this chapter and get on with labor peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said both the union and its top two officials -- LaVoy  
and vice president Brian Mayhew -- were liable for the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	He scheduled a hearing Monday to discuss what percentage of the  
fine the two officials would have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had previously placed $10 million, or one-quarter of  
its assets, with the court in preparation for paying a fine. LaVoy 
placed $10,000 with the court and vice president Brian Mayhew 
remitted $5,000 for their roles in the job action. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall expressed sympathy for the three-quarters of the  
American pilots who didn't call in sick, saying that imposing the 
fine makes ``me sick to my stomach, because I know what's going to 
happen is some very fine men and women pilots are going to be hurt 
badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the Allied Pilots Association, however, for its  
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flying public in this instance had zero notice and that's  
why it wreaked such havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines, which originally claimed it had lost $58.7  
million due to the sickout, reduced the estimate to $50 million on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he reduced the amount further in case of error and  
on the likelihood that passengers were booking flights on other 
airlines because of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts for the pilots' union had testified that the losses they  
had calculated range between $1.4 million and about $4.5 million, 
depending on the time period considered. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one union member said the ruling was justified. ``I  
think the judge was right,'' said Captain Carmen Villani, who flies 
out of Washington D.C. ``I personally was very embarrassed what I 
experienced in the courtroom over the last two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An executive for American testified during a hearing before  
Kendall Thursday that the airline could have resumed normal 
operations more quickly and would not have canceled 2,279 more 
flights had pilots returned to the cockpits soon after a judge 
ordered them back to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would have recovered the airline two days earlier,'' said  
Tim Ahern, a vice president in scheduling at American. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has said the abnormally high number of sick calls was  
a rational response to the stress the labor dispute created for 
individual pilots. The union noted that safety regulations require 
pilots to stay home if they consider themselves under too much 
stress to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	American and the union have yet to resolve the assimilation  
issue involving the purchase of Reno Air. The union contends that 
Reno pilots should be integrated into American from the Dec. 23 
purchase, raising salaries for those affected from that date. The 
airline says it will pay the higher rates as the pilots are 
retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled, but are 
expected to resume.

<HEADLINE> Ex-All-Star Cafe Employees Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three former All-Star Cafe employees were  
charged Thursday in connection with the theft of valuable baseball 
cards on loan from actor Charlie Sheen at the theme restaurant's 
Times Square location, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged were Gregory Corden, the cafe's maintenance manager;  
Thomas Gartland, a fellow employee; Michael Hess, the cafe's 
assistant chef; and Benjamin Ramos, who handled resale of the 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	All four have been charged in federal court with conspiracy to  
commit interstate transportation of stolen property and sale or 
receipt of stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 27 cards stolen last year was a Honus Wagner, a sheet  
of 25 unseparated 1934 cards and a 1933 Napoleon LaJoie. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wagner card is considered one of the rarest of baseball  
cards; one sold last year for $222,500 at Christie's. All but two 
of the stolen cards have been recovered.

<HEADLINE> Ford, GM Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s earnings climbed 31  
percent in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations, 
on continued strong profits in North America. Ford Motor Co. 
profits also were up. 
</P>
<P>
	GM reported today it earned a record $2.1 billion, or $3.04 a  
share, in the first three months of the year compared with $1.6 
billion, or $2.27 a share, during the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of analysts by First Call Corp. estimated GM would earn  
$2.88 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the world's largest automaker totaled $42.4 billion, up  
6 percent from $40 billion a year ago. Revenue figures exclude the 
sale of Delphi Automotive Systems, the big parts unit that GM is 
spinning off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, said today it had a 20  
percent increase in operating earnings during the first quarter, 
earning $1.81 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with $1.51 
billion, or $1.22 a share, for the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $38 billion at Ford, compared with $36.6 billion a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As with GM, Ford's earnings were higher than Wall Street  
analysts' expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed 
by First Call was $1.39 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings including Delphi set a company record for any  
quarter, narrowly surpassing the $2.09 billion it earned in the 
second quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American operations earned $1.4 billion, up 67  
percent from the $841 million it earned in the first three months 
of 1998. Profits also were up in European operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, GM was  
down $1 at $88.75 a share and Ford was up $1.25 at $64.

<HEADLINE> Homes Destroyed by Florida Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- A wind-driven fire burned between 20  
and 30 homes and was threatening dozens more in a sparsely 
populated area in southeast Florida as several blazes ravaged other 
parched areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port St. Lucie fire was spreading in three directions and  
grew to 1,500 acres by dusk, moving towards an area that has about 
200 homes, according to the St. Lucie County Emergency Operations 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it took was one fire and with the wind blowing as hard as  
it is blowing and as dry as it is'' said spokesman Donny Elder. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze forced about two dozen school buses to turn back to  
the schools, and 300 students were temporarily unable to get home, 
police said. Schools were closed for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Port St. Lucie, with a population of nearly 80,000 and home to  
the New York Mets baseball training camp, is 105 miles southeast of 
Orlando on Florida's Treasure Coast and home to many retirees from 
the Northeast. Early last month, brush fires caused minor damage to 
some homes here. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was believed to be out Wednesday night but was whipped  
up again by strong winds and gusts. Firefighters drew water from 
canals already depleted by a drought that has left Florida under a 
state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are probably going to have a couple thousand acres burned  
all told,'' said Matt Winnell, spokesman for the state Division of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were under evacuation orders in Osceola and Polk  
counties in central Florida, and Collier County in the southwest. 
Residents of Polk County were allowed to return home once the fire 
was contained. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Collier County, up to 60 residents took shelter in a  
county building outside Naples, while firefighters reported 
substantial progress against a huge blaze that had burned about 
1,650 acres by Thursday evening, county emergency management 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A wildfire near Lakeland in central Florida canceled an air show  
and sent some spectators scurrying to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is perfect weather for erratic fire behavior,'' said Lori  
Stone, a forestry spokeswoman. ``The wind is pushing it right 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fire officials have cautioned that conditions are ripe for fires  
similar to the ones that happened last year, when 100,000 residents 
fled their homes as nearly 500,000 acres were scorched. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fires, which started Memorial Day weekend and lasted into  
mid-July, destroyed 350 residences or businesses and caused $400 
million in damage. Over 50,000 acres already have burned this year.

<HEADLINE> McGraw-Hill Profits Rise 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The McGraw-Hill Cos. reported a 21 percent  
increase in first-quarter earnings Thursday due largely to a strong 
showing in its Standard &AMP; Poor's credit rating subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also publishes Business Week and other  
magazines, earned $24.4 million in the first three months of the 
year compared to $20.1 million in the same period a year ago. 
Per-share earnings rose to 12 cents from 10 cents, just exceeding 
Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 1.9 percent to $716.5 million from $703.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a slight decline in U.S. bond issues, for which Standard  
&AMP; Poor's provides ratings, the credit assessment unit posted solid 
gains amid increased demand for credit ratings in Europe and other 
financial transactions in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	Standard &AMP; Poor's also benefited from increased trading in  
financial products based on its widely-used S&AMP;P 500 index of major 
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine had solid results, reporting higher  
revenues and profits due to an 11 percent increase in advertising 
pages. But the company's other publications covering the 
construction business and trade didn't fare as well, leading to a 
12 percent decline in operating profits at its information and 
media group. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill's educational and professional publishing unit  
continued to run a loss due in part to another poor showing at the 
Continuing Education Center, which the company has decided to phase 
out. A seasonally slow quarter and investments in ramping up 
education publishing also weighed down the division's results. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McGraw-Hill fell $1.25 to $55.50 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to ASNE-8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	Central Europe is in very good shape: Hungary, Poland, the Czech  
Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, a lot of other countries, Slovenia, 
are doing better than most people would have imagined they would 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Balkans are in trouble, and the trouble in the Balkans  
has exacerbated the tensions with Russia, at least in the short 
run, and all I can tell you -- I don't know whether we could have 
done more before. And I always prefer to look to tomorrow. I'm not 
blaming anybody for what happened before. I can't do that. I don't 
know enough to know. Everybody had their hands full, and there were 
so many changes going on at once, I'm not sure anyone could have 
figured out more to do. 
</P>
<P>
	But I can tell you that -- if you want to think about what you  
want your children to live like, you imagine -- what do you want to 
happen in Asia? How are we going to work out our relationships with 
China and deal with the remaining security threat in North Korea, 
and try to bring, help Japan and the other countries to come back? 
How are we going to have the strongest possible alliance in Latin 
America? What kind of new partnership can we have with Africa? 
</P>
<P>
	But it all could come a cropper unless we have a united,  
democratic and free Europe, and the three things of what I said: 
our relationship with Russia, what happens in the Balkans and 
southeastern Europe, and how -- will Islam and Christianity be able 
to coexist in a positive way in the underbelly of Europe? 
</P>
<P>
	And so I would say, maybe it could have been -- maybe more could  
have been done. I don't know. I just know now -- right now, all 
those people are fighting over smaller and smaller pieces of land. 
It's like life is a zero-sum game. You kick me out of my village, 
I'll kick you out of your village. 
</P>
<P>
	If, the Bible says wisely that where there is no vision, the  
people perish. We need to have an alternative vision. They need to 
be brought into the vision of a prosperous Europe. They need to 
have more to gain by working together than they do by having 
constant fights with one another. They need to have -- and we need 
to reach out and lift up there. 
</P>
<P>
	So, however this conflict ends, or whenever it ends -- I think I  
know how it's going to end -- but whenever it ends, we have some 
building to do. They have to have something to live for. 
</P>
<P>
	You just can't tell people what they can't do. They've got to  
have something to be for, something to dream of, a future to build. 
And we ought to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Derby Winner Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Oaklawn Park officials asked state  
racing authorities Thursday to investigate whether jockey Billy 
Patin used an electrical device to make his horse run faster when 
it won the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol had not won in two outings before last Saturday's  
$500,000 Arkansas Derby and was a 30-1 shot when the horses left 
the gate. He paid $62.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn President Charles J. Cella told a hastily called meeting  
of the state Racing Commission that he wanted the commission to 
investigate. He said an employee found a device on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the commission to order the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse to the owner of the winner and to Patin. 
He said the commission's racing stewards, who left Oaklawn shortly 
after the meet ended Saturday, should be brought back together so 
they can investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted unanimously to go along with both requests.  
When the motion to suspend the purse came up for a vote, Cella 
intervened to make certain the purse suspension applied to the 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella also said that, if the commission decides the rules of  
racing were violated, ``those involved should be dealt with in the 
appropriate and severe manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol owner James D. Jackson of Rockdale, Texas, said he was  
``absolutely distraught'' about the situation. He told The 
Sentinel-Record in Hot Springs that legal action would be ``very 
shortly under way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He denied use of an electrical device by the trainer or jockey.  
He also said the first he heard about the investigation was from 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, at a Grand Prairie, Texas, motel for the races at Lone  
Star Park, called the investigation a ``witch hunt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patin was scheduled to ride Dixie Gem in Thursday night's second  
race at Lone Star Park, but he was not available and replaced on 
the horse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I swear to God that I never did that,'' Patin, 36, told the  
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Patin rides primarily in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't take the win away from the horse,'' said Keen, the  
leading trainer at Lone Star Park since it opened in 1997. ``The 
horse won it legit, won it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've claimed horses before that I could tell somebody had  
raked them with a machine or something. They had marks on them. 
This horse doesn't have a mark on him anywhere like a horse that 
had been plugged in or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-place check for the race was to be $300,000.  
Withholding those earnings would put Valhol's status in question 
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. If there are more than 20 3-year-olds 
entered at Louisville, preference goes to the top 20 in graded 
money earned. The Arkansas Derby is a Grade II race and the 
first-place check would easily qualify Valhol for a spot in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing Commission Chairman Cecil Alexander said he hoped the  
situation would be resolved before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials first became aware of possible  
irregularities in the running of the Arkansas Derby shortly after 
the race was declared official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately informed the stewards and the local  
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau -- the investigative branch of 
the thoroughbred racing industry,'' Cella said. ``By Monday night 
and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered additional evidence 
regarding the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence also was turned over to the national office of the  
TRPB in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties have concurred that the evidence is substantial  
enough to warrant further investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said an Oaklawn employee found an electronic device on  
the racetrack sometime after the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen it and I think, at this time, it's best for us  
to not comment,'' Alexander said. ``All the evidence will come out 
at a later time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about the evidence, Alexander said the commission had  
been aware of Oaklawn's investigation for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to have hard cold facts to start an investigation,'' he  
said. ``If we did not feel there was an infraction, we would not be 
having this meeting today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Valhol stayed just off the right flank of  
pacesetter Saint's Honor and then moved to the lead in the far 
turn. He quickly opened his advantage to four lengths. Patin used 
his whip on Valhol twice at the eighth pole and twice more at the 
sixteenth pole.

<HEADLINE> GM, Ford Post Higher Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Record U.S. demand for the most profitable  
vehicles -- pickups and sport utilities -- combined with ongoing 
cost-cutting to drive up earnings at General Motors Corp. and Ford 
Motor Co. in the first quarter, even as their losses continued 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit reports Thursday from the world's largest automakers  
exceeded analysts' expectations, but shares of GM slumped 3.6 
percent while Ford barely managed to gain ground on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, they were excellent results because of the powerful  
market in the United States, with very strong volume for both 
companies,'' said analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. 
``But every place outside of North America was weak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 1 GM earned $2.1 billion, or $3.04 a share, setting a  
company record for any quarter and exceeding by 31 percent its 
year-ago performance of $1.6 billion, or $2.27 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had a 20 percent increase in operating earnings at $1.81  
billion, or $1.46 a share, vs. $1.51 billion, or $1.22 a share, a 
year earlier. Ford's results compare continuing operations, 
excluding a one-time gain of $165 million from the sale this year 
of its share in the AutoEuropa joint venture in Portugal and last 
year's $15.9 billion gain from the spinoff of its Associates First 
Capital finance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks -- a category that includes pickups, SUVs and  
minivans -- continued to boost profits. Through the first quarter, 
truck sales amounted to a record 49 percent of the U.S. market, up 
from 48 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM finance chief J. Michael Losh credited the strong North  
American market, a big improvement in the mortgage operations of 
the GMAC finance subsidiary, and a turnaround in Europe as the 
major factors in GM's record gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker narrowly surpassed its previous quarterly profit  
record of $2.09 billion set in 1997's second quarter. A big 
contributor was cost-cutting: Losh said GM saved about $1 billion 
worldwide in the first quarter, on track with its goal of reducing 
costs by $4 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, however, out-earned GM in their biggest market. The  
Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker posted a $1.59 billion profit in 
North America, up 57 percent from a year ago. Ford said its 
high-profit truck sales were up 20 percent in the quarter, while 
car sales were up 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	GM earned $1.4 billion from its North American operations, up 67  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we have more to do to improve our cost-competitiveness  
in North America,'' Losh said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM also was hurt because it couldn't make enough of its  
hot-selling and highly profitable Chevrolet Silverado to 
immediately meet demand for the full-size pickup, which was 
redesigned for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Though GM's U.S. vehicle sales were up 6 percent in the quarter,  
its market share declined to 28.8 percent from 30.2 percent in the 
first quarter of 1998 -- an indication of the robust demand for new 
cars and trucks industrywide. GM is pushing to get its share back 
up to over 30 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With an additional 14 new product launches in 1999, we expect  
to build momentum in the market,'' president G. Richard Wagoner Jr. 
said. ``We have also announced plans to further increase our 
production capacity for full-size trucks to meet the strong and 
growing demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford enjoyed its 12th straight quarter in which operating  
earnings improved. Analyst John Casesa of Schroder &AMP; Co. said the 
company benefitted from an excellent product mix in North America, 
with a wide array of popular light trucks and increased retail 
sales over less-profitable fleet sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they could run the whole company like they run North  
America, you wouldn't be able to stop these guys,'' Casesa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's automotive operations earned $1.49 billion, up 20 percent  
from a year ago, with surging sales in North America making up for 
a break-even quarter in Europe and losses in South America, where 
Ford does not expect a profit this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Ford's losses in South America were particularly  
troubling, widening to $165 million from $45 million a year ago. 
Casesa termed the showing ``disastrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM had a loss of $25 million in Latin America compared with a  
$53 million profit a year earlier. But some analysts had expected 
even wider losses. 
</P>
<P>
	European operations contributed $174 million to GM's bottom  
line, up 76 percent from a year ago. Ford broke even in Europe 
after excluding the one-time gain from the sale of its AutoEuropa 
interests. A year ago, it earned $230 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford completed its purchase of Volvo AB's car business for $6.45  
billion on March 31 and will include Volvo results beginning in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	German-American automaker DaimlerChrysler AG plans to report its  
first-quarter earnings April 28. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, GM dropped  
by $3.18 3/4 to close at $86.56 1/4 a share, while Ford was up 6 1/4 cents 
to $62.81 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bradley, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., said  
GM's drop appeared to have been partly due to disappointment among 
traders who had speculated in advance of the release of the figures 
that the automaker's results were going to be even stronger.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Sign Ismail to $21.5M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- After a month of reported signings, the  
Cowboys made a real deal with the Rocket on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas signed free agent wide receiver Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail  
to a seven-year, $21.5 million deal that includes a $5 million 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of a deal had been rampant since March, and Cowboys owner  
Jerry Jones said the signing makes the Cowboys a little faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the speed, the run after the catch, he really knows  
how to make something happen after he catches the ball,'' Jones 
said. ``We've been criticized internally, as well as externally, 
about our speed situation, and he addresses that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past three seasons, Ismail has played for Carolina, and  
he has been working out at the Panthers' facility this offseason. 
He recently acquired a new home in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Ismail will help take pressure off receiver Michael  
Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't be able to double- or triple-team Michael like they  
did at the end of last season,'' Jones said at a news conference 
Thursday, which Ismail did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Cowboys re-worked Troy Aikman's contract.  
Aikman's new deal will pay him $85.5 million through 2007, making 
him the highest paid player in the NFL -- again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aikman deal, which included a $20 million signing bonus,  
freed up room under the Cowboys' salary cap, which reportedly had a 
mere $400,000 to spare beforehand. That gave Jones the money to 
strike deals with three players on his wish list. 
</P>
<P>
	In signing Ismail, Jones got his second wish.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Cowboys signed center Mark Stepnoski to a  
five-year, $10.5 million contract, plus a $3.5 million signing 
bonus. Stepnoski spent six years with the Cowboys until signing 
with Houston after the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said Thursday that the Cowboys were in negotiations with  
linebacker Quentin Coryatt and hoped to have a deal done by Friday. 
Coryatt played in 78 games for the Indianapolis Colts over six 
seasons before he was released after last season to make room under 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys reportedly have had verbal agreements with  
Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt for several weeks but couldn't 
finalize the deals until they had the salary cap room to sign them. 
The NFL is investigating whether that happened and if the team 
violated league rules.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 2525; Nasdaq Down 20.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed again today with blue  
chips rallying while technology stocks continued their slide. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 25.25 at 10436.91 after changing directions several times. On 
Wednesday, it had its third straight closing high, rising 16 points 
to 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes fell as investors continued to unload  
technology shares. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 9.84 at 
1,318.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 20.19 at 2,487.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors began the day by continuing Wednesday's strategy of  
selling technology and consumer shares and buying economically 
sensitive issues such as manufacturing and basic materials. As the 
session wore on, they keyed into the fact that bond yields were 
rising on heavy new supply in the bond market and a report that 
manufacturing in the Philadelphia area strengthened considerably 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although that does indicate manufacturers are seeing their  
business improve, it also caused concerns that the growing economy 
could reignite inflation, said Jack Shaughnessy, market strategist 
at Advest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market ``has been driven (higher) in the last three  
years by rapidly expanding money supply and falling interest 
rates,'' Shaughnessy noted. Now, ``the market is becoming 
apprehensive that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates 
because of concerns about inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the bond market was paring its losses by late afternoon. The  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was 5.52 percent, up only 
slightly from from 5.51 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the shares of industrial companies, which had  
performed well since Tuesday afternoon, were still higher. The Dow 
components were led higher by Boeing, up 5 at 43; DuPont, up 4 1/8 at 
69 3/8; and International Paper, up 3 1/4 at 55 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks were still struggling, with Johnson &AMP; Johnson  
down 1 9/16 at 93 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh blow to technology stocks today was a warning from  
Storage Technology, a maker of computer storage equipment, that it 
wouldn't meet analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations. 
Storage Tech shares were down 7 3/16 at 18 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 9 to 7 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at 1.05 billion 
shares, up substantially from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Tax-Mania Sweeps Post Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- As much as Americans despise paying taxes,  
Thursday brought music and back rubs to the nation's post offices, 
along with a spirit of camaraderie among last-minute filers jammed 
into lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got it done. I've just got to figure out where to send the  
money that I owe,'' said 21-year-old Steve MacIntyre as he rooted 
through a mountain of forms at Boston's main post office. 
</P>
<P>
	His paperwork was creased and grubby from being in the back  
pocket of his jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aargh! No envelopes!'' he shouted, pounding the wall.  
</P>
<P>
	MacIntyre's was just one of 126 million tax returns the Internal  
Revenue Service expected to receive this year. The agency said it 
had already received more than half by late last month. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the procrastinators, the forgetful and the flummoxed who  
took in the festive atmosphere at the nation's mailrooms on the 
final day of filing. Some post offices were open as late as 
midnight, with parties until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	A piano player was set to play in Boston's main post office  
Thursday. Outside, an actress dressed as Mother Nature was hired by 
a vitamin company to hand out free packets of kava root, which is 
supposed to ease stress. 
</P>
<P>
	A party at the Springfield post office included four bands and  
food donated from eight restaurants. Taxpayers also had a chance to 
get even with IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have two dunk tanks this year, not just one,'' boasted  
Postmaster Flossie Paluszec. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,000 miles away, a Seattle radio station sent an anti-tax  
message by re-enacting the Boston Tea Party on an old sailing ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Other post offices around the country tried to rub out the  
anxiety of tax filing with free back and neck massages. 
</P>
<P>
	In Phoenix, fans going to Thursday night's Los Angeles  
Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks game could bring their tax returns out 
to the park where a mobile post office was being set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspiring actors and actresses might have wanted to pay their  
taxes in Newport Beach, Calif. The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
was capitalizing on the crowds at the post office by conducting 
screen tests for its ``Got Milk'' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will give you a milk mustache and a screen test,'' said  
postal spokesman David Mazer. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who didn't want to deal with stamps and envelopes,  
electronic filing was increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Don Roberts said 17 percent more people paid their  
taxes either online or by telephone this year than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the postal service hadn't noticed its business declining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same number that we see every year,'' said Bob  
Cannon, a Massachusetts postal service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In Springfield, Va., the certified public accountants of  
Crutchley, Marginot &AMP; Tosi P.C. closed the office early. Like 
accountants around the country, they planned to celebrate an end to 
80-hour work weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shut down at noon, we start our party at 2 p.m. and it goes  
through the night,'' said accountant Mary Ann Dougherty.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Mormon Library Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two people were killed and four others  
were shot today by a gunman who entered the Mormon church's Family 
History Library and began firing before being fatally wounded by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police SWAT teams were combing the building to determine whether  
another gunman was inside the building more than two hours after 
the 10:30 a.m. shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty people remained on the second floor and it was feared  
they were being held by a second gunman. But they later told police 
by telephone they had locked themselves in a room, said Salt Lake 
police Lt. Phil Kirk. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Deedee Corradini told reporters that a library security  
guard and a female patron had died of their wounds and the 
unidentified suspect had also died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the shooting victims received ``very serious injuries  
for a few of them, life-threatening injuries,'' Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, who had exchanged gunfire with police, was taken out  
of the building to a Gold Cross ambulance parked in front of a 
nearby restaurant, but paramedics believed he might be wired with 
an explosive and the area was evacuated. He died in the ambulance 
and police Sgt. Ken Hansen said he had no explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyman Platt of St. George, a genealogist, said a gunman entered  
the library and quickly fired off a dozen rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in the lobby and shot a lady in the head and two or  
three other men,'' Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard a pop and somebody said `everybody get down.' There  
were 10 or 12 pops and somebody yelled somebody's shooting,'' said 
Jaqueline Nelson, a researcher who was working on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw one fellow's legs doing that thing like you do on TV  
(twitching) and then the shooting started again,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen said the dead suspect did not match the description of a  
man who entered the building Wednesday evening and was ``very upset 
about something and left the building very unhappy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired as much as 45 minutes after officers arrived on  
the scene, at first leading police to believe there might be a 
second gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	LDS Hospital spokeswoman Christa Powell said a total of seven  
people were shot and the hospital was told to prepare for 13 others 
who had received lesser injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was in critical condition at LDS Hospital with a gunshot  
wound to the chest, said spokesman Richard Nash. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman who had been shot in the head was transported to  
University of Utah Hospital and was being evaluated, said spokesman 
John Dwan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Regional Medical Center was treating two women,  
both in stable condition. A woman in her 80s was being treated for 
a facial wound, a woman in her mid-40s was being treated for a 
shoulder wound, said spokesman Doug Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The library, one of the world's top centers for genealogical  
research, is directly across the street from Temple Square, site of 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Salt Lake Temple 
and Tabernacle. 
</P>
<P>
	An international genealogical convention had attracted heavy  
traffic to the library, which has two floors below ground level and 
three above. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Russell of the church's public affairs department said that  
at 9:45 a.m., the two alleged suspects went into the building and 
talked to missionaries Lynette Kim and Jamie Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The two women were being debriefed in the Tabernacle.  
</P>
<P>
	A KSL employee, Tamara Orr, said a man matching the description  
of a suspect asked her for directions to the Family History Library 
earlier this morning. The bearded man appeared to be in his late 
50s, with gray hair and wearing disheveled clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	The man drove a yellow moving truck, which KSL Television  
reported was being investigated by a police bomb squad early this 
afternoon. The truck was parked near the station, three blocks west 
of the history library. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb squad was searching the three-block area between the  
Triad Center, where KSL is located, and the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-five elementary school students inside the building when  
the firing erupted were all safe and accounted for, police said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: U.S. Media Biased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Americans sharply criticized newspapers in  
a national survey released Thursday that accuses the media of 
chasing sensationalist stories in order to sell papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, delivered at the American Society of Newspaper  
Editors' annual meeting, found that 78 percent of the public 
believes there is bias in the media. Another 42 percent thinks 
there is bias in TV news, 23 percent in newspapers and 17 percent 
in magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, nearly 50 percent of the respondents believe  
editorial decisions are made by executives who want to sell more 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised,'' said Jan Schaffer, executive director of  
the Pew Center for Civic Journalism in Washington. ``I think it 
echoes other research. It suggests that what we're doing is 
ineffective and even hurtful to our credibility long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey by Urban &AMP; Associates also found that:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Newspaper stories include too many factual errors and spelling  
or grammar mistakes, which are blamed on deadline pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Newspapers fail to consistently show respect or knowledge of  
readers and their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Values of journalists and their editors sometimes conflict  
with the priorities for their newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reporter biases influence what stories are covered and how.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Those most critical of the media were members of the public  
interviewed by a reporter or the subject of a story.

<HEADLINE> Incontinence Suffered in Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``You know one of the secrets no one tells you  
about childbirth?'' a woman rocking her new baby in the doctor's 
waiting room reluctantly confided. ``Incontinence. I couldn't 
believe nobody warned me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the American Urological Association would have loved  
to hear that complaint, because it backs up their contention that 
urinary incontinence is one of those embarrassing conditions that 
millions, mostly women, suffer in silence. 
</P>
<P>
	That's sad, says Dr. Alan Wein of the University of  
Pennsylvania, because a lot of treatments work very well if only 
women, and their doctors, knew about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Pregnancy and childbirth aren't the only causes. So is aging:  
Some 40 percent of women over age 60 experience incontinence, the 
involuntary loss of urine. It can be a result of weakened muscles 
that control urination, radiation therapy, pelvic injury or 
surgery, urinary tract infections or neurological diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Urologists estimate that 17 million Americans, 85 percent of  
them women, suffer incontinence. Yet just one in five sufferers 
seeks a doctor's help -- even though 80 percent of patients can be 
cured or significantly improved. 
</P>
<P>
	So the urology association is conducting a national campaign to  
teach patients and doctors about incontinence therapies and offer 
referrals to patients seeking a specialist near where they live. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't necessarily need a urologist, Wein said, acknowledging  
his candor might upset urology colleagues. ``A good primary care 
physician can start you on the way to diagnosis and treatment.'' If 
you're not helped, then seek a specialist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For healthy bladder control, strong pelvic floor muscles must  
hold up the bladder, sphincter muscles must keep the urethra closed 
and nerves must properly signal those muscles to work. 
</P>
<P>
	When patients complain of incontinence, doctors first must  
determine the type and whether it's temporary -- like many women's 
experience after childbirth -- or chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	Stress incontinence is leakage caused by physical stress to the  
abdomen, such things as coughing, sneezing or laughing, or lifting 
a heavy object. It's a frequent problem for female athletes, 
especially during exercise that causes abdominal pressure, such as 
jogging. 
</P>
<P>
	Urge incontinence involves the sudden, uncontrollable urge to  
urinate, sometimes called ``overactive bladder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people have both types -- mixed incontinence.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every treatment regimen ought to begin with the simplest type  
of therapy,'' Wein said -- behavior therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Top of the list: Perform ``Kegels,'' pelvic exercises named  
after the Los Angeles physician who in the 1940s first proposed the 
therapy to tighten bladder-control muscles. Simply tense pelvic 
muscles, so that it feels like you're inwardly lifting and 
squeezing, and then release. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing excess pounds that put pressure on the bladder also can  
help. 
</P>
<P>
	Other behavior therapy includes such commonsense steps as  
voiding frequently, so the bladder is never too full, and drinking 
less, Wein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding medication to behavior therapy can significantly help  
some incontinence, mostly by blocking the enzyme that causes 
bladder contractions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are devices other than bulky pads or diapers: tiny foam  
``plugs'' that form temporary seals over the urethra, and 
tampon-like barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Collagen injections can bulk up the area around the urethra, so  
that sphincter muscles have an easier time keeping the urethra 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	If those steps aren't enough, surgical treatments are highly  
effective, but Wein stressed that they're reserved for severe cases 
because surgery is risky. 
</P>
<P>
	An implanted nerve stimulator can send tiny electric shocks to  
the nerve that controls the bladder. Doctors can stitch tissue in 
ways to hold up the bladder so it's not under pressure to leak, or 
in drastic conditions they can even enlarge the bladder. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IBM, Sony Collaborate on Net Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- IBM and Sony Corp. will collaborate on a new  
joint venture aimed at protecting recording industry artists from 
having their music illegally copied and distributed over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, announced Thursday, Sony would configure its  
audio-player recorders, such as the ``Memory Stick Walkman,'' to 
receive content purchased and downloaded over the Internet using 
IBM's Electronic Music Management System. 
</P>
<P>
	All music content downloaded with the IBM or Sony products would  
be recorded and played back using copy-control settings selected by 
the artist. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an electronics company with strong commitments to the  
entertainment industry, Sony respects the rights of artists and 
other copyright holders,'' said Sunobu Horigome, president of Sony 
Corp.'s Digital Network Solutions Company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share this vision with IBM, and we look forward to working  
together to propose to the music industry the technology solutions 
essential for establishing a secure platform that will offer 
consumers quick, convenient access to digital music content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM reached a deal earlier this week with broadcast software  
company RealNetworks Inc. to test a system this summer that will 
deliver music online. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital music sales represent just a tiny fraction of the $12  
billion music industry. But revenue is expected to grow 
dramatically as technology makes it easy for computer users to 
listen to music from Web sites 
</P>
<P>
	The music industry is battling increasingly popular technology  
that lets people make illegal copies of music distributed online. A 
main target of the industry is MP3, an increasingly popular 
technology allowing for rapid transfer of music over the Web. This 
format has helped fuel the popularity of the Rio, a Walkman-like 
device that plays MP3 music files.

<HEADLINE> Reds Limited Partners Sue Schott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds' limited partners sued  
Marge Schott on Thursday for trying to sell her controlling 
interest to a group led by her cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners contend they have the right to buy her  
shares because they matched an earlier offer from a group headed by 
Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit means that the team's future will be decided in part  
by a Hamilton County Common Pleas judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners contractually have the right to match any  
offer that Schott receives for her shares in the club. Schott 
agreed last November to sell rather than face another suspension 
from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan's group offered $65 million for all but one of Schott's  
shares in February, and the limited partners notified Schott that 
they intended to match. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott told the partners on Monday that she intended to sell for  
more money to a group headed by Stephen Schott, a cousin of her 
late husband. The limited partners asked the court Thursday to 
block that proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Steve Schott agreement was a transparent, legally invalid  
attempt to extract an additional $12 million from the limited 
partners and obtain a $2.68 million `commission' for Steve 
Schott,'' the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners asked Judge Robert Ruehlman to rule that  
Dolan's offer was binding, giving the partners a chance to buy out 
Schott by matching it. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners filing the lawsuit are the Great American  
Insurance Co. owned by Carl Lindner; American Laundry Machinery 
Inc. owned by George and Anthony Strike; and William J. Reik. 
</P>
<P>
	Marge Schott could not be reached for comment Thursday at her  
home or office. A message was left at the Lansing, Mich., office of 
her lawyer, Frank Kelley. His home telephone nunber was unlisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has final say over whatever sales  
agreement emerges. Baseball is waiting for Schott to reach a final 
sales agreement before getting involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati auto dealer has controlled the Reds since  
December 1984, when she paid an estimated $25 million for her 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000, at  
which time the limited partners can oust Schott if she hasn't 
already sold control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 shares in the team, including the two that  
make her the managing partner. The limited partners own the other 
8 1/2 shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners and their approximate holdings are Louise Nippert  
(2 1/4), Lindner (1 3/4), Strike and Reik (1 1/4 each), and the estate of 
Carl Kroch and The Gannett Co. (1). 
</P>
<P>
	``The limited partners are most interested in ensuring an  
orderly transition and the prosperity of the Reds organization, as 
well as ensuring that the legal rights under the partnership 
agreement are complied with,'' said James Burke, lawyer for the 
limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke said no hearing date has been set in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati Reds managing executive John Allen declined comment  
Thursday. Allen is running the Reds while Schott attempts to sell 
her shares.

<HEADLINE> Ad Firm Sells Space on Balloons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- After giving directions to his business,  
Don Hall adds confidently: ``You can't miss it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	A 30-foot parrot marks the site of Advertising Innovations, a  
fast-rising business that rents inflatable advertisers, from King 
Kong and Godzilla to cartoon characters such as Popeye, and 
brightly colored balloons. 
</P>
<P>
	In this era of increasingly complex special effects and  
multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns, the concept behind 
Advertising Innovations is simple. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's eye-catching,'' says Tim Hall, company president. ``If  
you see that parrot, you'll take a look. 
</P>
<P>
	``People commuting get used to seeing the same thing every day,  
and then one day you look up and see a giant balloon and you think, 
'I never realized there was a tire store there.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Hall, 30, was a professional water skier five years ago when  
he decided he needed another occupation for the long term. He had 
worked with a company that used a balloon for advertising, and 
talked with his father about starting a business. 
</P>
<P>
	Don, retired after three decades at AT&AMP;T, was intrigued, and got  
together with Sandy Jones, a longtime business associate, to help 
Tim start the company. 
</P>
<P>
	From a single, used balloon bought for $400, the company has  
swelled to include more than 100 inflatables and a 
remote-controlled blimp often rented for sporting events or 
concerts in places such as the Georgia Dome, where it can be used 
to drop T-shirts or fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the costs of the inflatables, which sell new for $4,000  
and up, the Halls do suffer some losses from vandalism -- among the 
balloon-killers has been a crossbow-firing vandal -- and theft. 
There also are pranksters, some who climb inside the balloons to 
party, while others have moved inflatables to school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	While Advertising Innovations, a closely held company, doesn't  
disclose its finances, the Halls profess they're doing very well. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Weldon, who runs Events Spectacular in Walnut Creek,  
Calif., and is president of the Inflatable Advertisers trade 
association, said the industry is growing at a time when a strong 
U.S. economy means many new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The definition of a grand opening has come to mean having a  
big balloon on your roof,'' Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses small and large find the inflatables an efficient,  
effective way to complement other advertising campaigns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes advantage of the local market -- in most cases, people  
do their shopping within five or 10 miles of their home,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike radio or television advertising, which blankets an  
audience that might never come near a business, balloon advertising 
reaches the most likely customers, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Black's giant automobile dealership in Kennesaw often  
sports an Advertising Innovations inflatable on weekends, from a 
``lady King Kong'' in a pink bikini to seasonal characters such as 
a snowman or Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rotruck, a general sales manager, said the dealership uses  
only about 5 percent of its ad budget on the inflatables, which it 
rents for $500 to $750 per weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's head-turning,'' he said. ``People kind of recognize us  
that way; it's not unusual for kids to try to guess what we're 
going to do next.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies Bench Slumping Gant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The way Phillies manager Terry Francona sees  
it, the best thing for Ron Gant at this point is a day off. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, who has started his Philadelphia career in a 2-for-29  
slump with 11 strikeouts, will sit Friday night against Florida 
knuckleballer Dennis Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked with Ron earlier today, and he completely  
understands,'' Francona said Thursday night after the Braves and 
Phillies were postponed by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Gant, acquired in an offseason trade with St. Louis, was booed  
loudly at home Wednesday night while going 0-for-4 and stranding 
five runners. He struck out with two on in the fourth and popped up 
with the bases loaded in the fifth inning of a 10-4 loss to the 
Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	A streaky hitter throughout his career, Gant agrees with  
Francona's decision to give him a day off rather than let 
Springer's knuckleball mess up his swing even more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the best type of pitcher to try to get your groove on  
against,'' Gant said. ``It'll be a good day for me to work and 
gather myself and work on whatever. It gives me another day to get 
back in there and go to war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rainout, announced shortly before game time, canceled the  
second matchup this season between Curt Schilling and Tom Glavine. 
The Phillies won the first one 7-4 on opening day in Atlanta. The 
game was rescheduled as part of a doubleheader July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``The funny thing is, I've never been rained out before,''  
Schilling said. ``After a couple of innings, but never right at the 
start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also moves everyone in the rotation back a day, meaning  
Schilling will miss facing Randy Johnson in Arizona by one day. 
Schilling starts Friday night against Springer, followed by Chad 
Ogea and Carlton Loewer. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Byrd pitches Monday at Arizona, with Paul Spoljaric facing  
Johnson and Schilling matching up with Todd Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also move their rotation back a day, with Glavine  
pitching in Colorado against John Thomson Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Cox said there was there was no news on the Mark Wohlers  
front. General manager John Schuerholz has until Friday to trade 
the troubled reliever or release him. ``All I can tell you is that 
John's working on it,'' Cox said. ... Kevin Sefcik will start in 
left field for Gant on Friday, and Francona also plans another 
lineup change against Springer. Alex Arias will start at shortstop 
in place of Desi Relaford.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Storms Hit Mississippi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Powerful storms rolled across the South early today after  
damaging homes and downing power lines in southeastern Mississippi. 
One person was killed and more than two dozen were injured, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at South Central Regional hospital in Laurel said  
early today that they had treated 25 to 30 people for cuts suffered 
in Wednesday night's storms. Laurel is 30 miles north of 
Hattiesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	A 71-year-old man was killed near Soso, according to Jones  
County authorities, but no details were immediately available. The 
storms were accompanied by very strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain and windy conditions were reported throughout  
Mississippi, but the majority of the damage appeared to be in 
northern Jones County and southern Jasper County, a region about 60 
miles southeast of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jones County sheriff's dispatcher said deputies going into  
storm-damaged areas reported numerous downed trees and power lines 
and widespread damage.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Hit Three-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing applications  
for unemployment checks rose, for the second consecutive week, to 
the highest level in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	A seasonally adjusted 316,000 unemployed people claimed  
benefits, the highest since mid January and up from 302,000 the 
week before, the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Through nine weeks during late January, February and March, the  
number of initial claims had hovered just under 300,000, the 
longest stretch below that threshold since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest increase wasn't expected by analysts, but weekly  
claims data are volatile and it's too soon to tell if it presages 
any weakening in the very strong labor market, which in March cut 
the nation's unemployment rate to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-week moving average of claims, which evens out weekly  
fluctuations, rose by 4,250 to 300,500.

<HEADLINE> Delta Earnings Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines reported its third-quarter  
earnings rose 11 percent as its passenger load rose 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said today its net income for the three months ending  
March 31 was $216 million or $1.42 per share, up from $195 million 
or $1.23 per share in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-share figure is about 13 percent higher than analysts  
had predicted. The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First 
Call Corp. was $1.26 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta said its operating revenue for the quarter rose 3 percent  
to $3.5 billion from $3.4 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported it flew 25 million passengers during the  
quarter, up 2 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	President Leo F. Mullin credited Delta's efforts at improved  
customer service, in part, for the results. The company also 
continued to upgrade its fleet during the quarter, refurbishing 
plane interiors and agreeing to sell some of its older planes. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, Delta reported net income  
of $737 million or $4.80 per share. That's an increase of 15 
percent from the same period last year, when net income was $639 
million or $4.06 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues were $10.75 million, up nearly 4 percent  
from $10.38 million a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Earnings Set Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s earnings climbed 31  
percent in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations on 
continued strong profits in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	GM reported today it earned a record $2.1 billion, or $3.04 a  
share, in the first three months of the year compared with $1.6 
billion, or $2.27 a share, during the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent survey of analysts by First Call Corp. estimated GM  
would earn $2.88 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like very solid, good results, with a  
stronger-than-expected performance in most business units,'' said 
analyst David Bradley of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But GM stock was down $1 at $88.75 a share in early trading  
today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the world's largest automaker totaled $44.05 billion,  
up 6 percent from $41.6 billion a year ago. Excluding sales of 
Delphi Automotive Systems, the big parts unit that GM is in the 
process of spinning off, GM earned $42.4 billion, compared with $40 
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings including Delphi were a company record for any  
quarter, narrowly surpassing the $2.09 billion it earned in the 
second quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're particularly pleased with the strong performance of GM  
North America and General Motors Acceptance Corp. in the first 
quarter,'' GM Chairman Jack Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's North American operations earned $1.4 billion,  
up 67 percent from the $841 million it earned in the first three 
months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company benefitted from extremely strong demand in North  
America,'' said analyst John Casesa of Schroder &AMP; Co. ``It's the 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Profits of GM's European operations increased 76 percent to $174  
million, compared with $99 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Those performances offset losses of $60 million in Asia-Pacific  
and $25 million in Latin American operations. In the first quarter 
of 1997, GM earned $6 million in Asia-Pacific and $53 million in 
Latin America. Automakers have been struggling with the depressed 
economies in both regions during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said GM's $25 million loss in Brazil was far less than  
expected. He had estimated a loss of $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
	GMAC, the company's financial subsidiary, earned $392 million,  
up 13 percent from $349 million in the comparable quarter of 1998. 
It was the best quarter for GMAC since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The financial results reflect our continued efforts to improve  
product quality and increase manufacturing efficiency,'' GM 
President G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said. ``Combined with our 
unrelenting cost-reduction activities, these factors allowed us to 
meet the intense competitive price pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quarter marked the first time GM had back-to-back quarterly  
earnings increases since the first two quarters of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's total automotive-related income, excluding Delphi, was $1.5  
billion, compared with $1 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wagoner said GM's automotive operations benefitted from several  
new, highly profitable models in the North American market, led by 
the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, twin full-size 
pickups. The big truck is GM's most popular model. 
</P>
<P>
	Although GM's U.S. vehicle sales were up 6 percent in the  
quarter, its market share declined to 28.8 percent from 30.2 
percent in the first quarter of 1998 -- an indication of the 
strength of demand for new vehicles industrywide. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's U.S. sales to business and government fleets, which  
generally are less profitable than retail sales, were up to 23 
percent in the quarter from 21 percent a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Market share in Europe was down slightly to 9.6 percent from 9.8  
percent a year ago. Wagoner said GM was expecting gains with the 
recent introduction of the new Opel and Vauxhall Zafira minivan and 
the new line of Opel Vectra sedans.

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Republicans in Congress, Thursday's income  
tax deadline brought a chance to renew their promises for tax 
relief and cast symbolic votes on a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would make it tougher to raise future taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become an annual April 15 exercise, the GOP-led  
House failed to approve the amendment, which would require that 
most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress instead of a 
simple majority. The amendment itself required a two-thirds 
majority, and the 229-199 vote was short by 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax  
rally featuring top GOP leaders, enabled Republicans to remind 
voters that tax relief tops their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day when people are particularly sensitized, and they  
need to know which party wants to cut their taxes,'' said Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also chose Thursday to rush through legislation  
giving tax breaks to troops involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
Sponsors said the measure extends the relief to more support 
personnel than a nearly identical executive order signed by 
President Clinton this week for soldiers in the combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pointed out that five of the  
GOP's top 10 priority bills deal with tax relief and that 
Republicans in the House and Senate have adopted a budget blueprint 
promising an unspecified $778 billion tax cut using projected 
government surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's an overcharge to the American people, they ought  
to get a refund,'' Hastert said at the rally. ``We need to hold 
down the tax burden on the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans are having a tough time deciding which taxes  
to cut. They have already backed away from a proposed 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut and face a money crunch that will 
likely allow for only modest relief in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment to limit tax increases  
went down to defeat for the fifth straight year. All but a handful 
of Republicans voted for the measure, while most Democrats were 
against it and derided it as little more than an April 15 stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a gimmick,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
top Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``This 
annual attempt to tinker with the Constitution will never provide a 
penny of tax relief to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents, noting that 14 states have similar laws,  
promised they would not give up and that it was worthwhile to have 
the debate each April 15, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other tax-related hearings and events in the  
Capitol, including introduction of a bill to abolish the income tax 
entirely -- it was created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment -- and 
replace it with a 15 percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	One other annual announcement came from the Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, which said May 11 was this year's 
``Tax Freedom Day.'' The foundation calculates it would take until 
then -- a day later than last year -- for the average American to 
earn enough to pay his or her share of all federal, state and local 
individual and corporate taxes.

<HEADLINE> Accused JFK Forger Goes on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rumors about John F. Kennedy and Marilyn  
Monroe, the mob and J. Edgar Hoover seemed real when a Connecticut 
man first produced letters between his late father and the slain 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lawrence X. Cusack III now sits in a federal courtroom in  
Manhattan, accused of swindling investors out of $7 million by 
forging Kennedy's name on phony letters about scandalous subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents nearly became the basis for a chapter in Seymour  
Hersh's book, ``The Dark Side of Camelot,'' after the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning author saw documents alleging that Kennedy set up a 
trust for Miss Monroe's mother to buy her daughter's silence about 
the alleged affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hersh deleted the chapter before publication after their  
authenticity was challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cusack's mail fraud trial opened Wednesday, Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Paul A. Engelmayer explained how Cusack, 48, came up with 
the documents after befriending a Stamford, Conn., autograph 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Engelmayer said the collectibles dealer, John Reznikoff, told  
Cusack that documents confirming a presidential affair with Miss 
Monroe would sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, Cusack told Reznikoff he had found correspondence between  
the president and his late father, a lawyer, confirming Kennedy's 
payment of hush money to Miss Monroe to cover up an extramarital 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Other letters described Kennedy's battles to prevent FBI  
director Hoover from blackmailing him and even Kennedy's paralyzing 
addiction to pain killers, Engelmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Reznikoff's help, Cusack sold documents and began making  
millions and enjoying the riches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luxury stores, luxury cars, luxury clothes,'' he said. ``It  
was a great life and it was built entirely upon the documents. But, 
as the evidence will show, it was also a life built upon fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding publicity brought with it increased scrutiny, and the  
1997 revelation that Cusack created the documents himself, 
Engelmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack's father, Lawrence Cusack, had been a lawyer for the  
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Miss Monroe's estate 
after her death, but only in a routine manner, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``To make himself rich, Cusack exploited his father's accidental  
brush with celebrity,'' Engelmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack claimed to have found 700 documents relating to the  
Kennedy family, Miss Monroe and Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana in 
his father's files. 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack's lawyer, Robert Katzberg, told the jury that it was  
irrelevant to the mail and wire fraud charges whether the documents 
were fake. He said the case hinged on whether the jury concluded 
that his client knew the documents were fake when he sold them. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzberg said several experts on signatures and Kennedy  
memorabilia had examined the materials and found them to be real. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of this case, you will be left with more questions  
about the Kennedy papers than answers,'' Katzberg said.

	NATO Strikes After Convoy Accident  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A day after its bombs hit a convoy  
of refugees in Kosovo, NATO pressed ahead with its air campaign 
today, hitting military installations, TV transmitters and bridges 
throughout Yugoslavia. NATO expressed regret over the ``tragic 
accident,'' saying its planes had been targeting Serb forces when 
they struck a column of ethnic Albanians fleeing the province. A 
Yugoslavia judge claimed 69 bodies had been identified. Alliance 
jets late today pounded military targets around Montenegro in the 
strongest attack on the smaller Yugoslav republic in two weeks. 
Yugoslav media also reported attacks in Belgrade and Novi Sad, 
Serbia's second largest city.

	US: Yugoslavia Has Chemical Agents  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials said today that Yugoslavia has  
stockpiled chemical agents that are ready for use as weapons. 
President Clinton promised a ``swift and overwhelming'' response to 
any chemical attack. Yugoslavia, however, has made no threats to 
use deadly chemical weapons and Pentagon officials said they have 
no intelligence indicating that Belgrade has any such plans. NATO 
strike planners have specifically avoided ordering raids on three 
known chemical agent storage facilities in Yugoslavia to avoid 
sending a deadly plume into the atmosphere, according to one senior 
Pentagon official.

	American Pilots Union Fined $45M

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A federal judge today fined the American Airlines  
pilots union more than $45 million -- nearly all of its net worth -- 
for an illegal sickout that led to the cancellation of more than 
6,700 flights. U.S. District Court Judge Joe Kendall had previously 
held the union in contempt after they refused his back to work 
order. American claimed the 10-day sickout in February cost the 
airline $57 million.

million-plus price tag for the five-month congressional proceedings 
that ended with President Clinton's acquittal, expense records 
show. Adjusted to annual salary, both Republican investigator David 
Schippers and Democratic counsel Abbe Lowell were being paid at a 
rate of more than $200,000 per year. In contrast, staff lawyers for 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr earn between $66,563 and $118,400

	NATO Strikes After Convoy Accident  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets pounded military targets  
around Montenegro and struck at military and industrial sites in 
Belgrade and other cities late Thursday and early Friday. The 
attacks came a day after the alliance's bombs mistakenly hit a 
convoy of refugees in Kosovo. Vojislav Seselj, a Serbian deputy 
prime minister, accused NATO of killing civilians on purpose. He 
said NATO knew it could ``accomplish nothing by striking military 
targets'' and was therefore ``taking revenge by bombing 
civilians.'' Meanwhile thousands of ethnic Albanians crossed over 
into Macedonia and Albania, fleeing what they described as a 
methodical Serb push to empty towns and villages in Kosovo.

	Conflict May Cost Over $1B Monthly  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional budget analysts said Thursday  
that the U.S. share of NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia could 
cost more than $1 billion a month to sustain. The first three weeks 
of the air strikes have already cost the U.S. about $600 million, 
according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The estimates do 
not include humanitarian aid or certain procurement costs, such as 
replacing the F117 ``stealth'' fighter that was lost. That aircraft 
is no longer being manufactured. And sending in ground troops -- an 
option the administration says is not currently considering -- could 
cost another $200 million a month.

federal director for disaster response. After weeks of torrential

	GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Republicans in Congress, Thursday's income  
tax deadline brought a chance to renew their promises for tax 
relief. In what has become an annual April 15 exercise, the GOP-led 
House failed to approve a constitutional amendment that would 
require that most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress. 
Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax 
rally, enabled Republicans to remind voters that tax relief tops 
their agenda.

<HEADLINE> Income Tax Deadline Is Here </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the millions of Americans rushing to meet  
tonight's income tax deadline, consider this: Many middle-class 
people are actually paying slightly less in federal taxes than they 
did in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Congressional Budget Office, taxpayers with the  
median family income -- about $39,000 in 1999 -- will pay 18.9 
percent of their income in all federal taxes this year. That 
compares to 19.7 percent four years ago, and is about $400 less. 
</P>
<P>
	That might provide some small comfort as people rush to one of  
the hundreds of larger post offices that will stay open late, many 
until midnight local time, to handle the crush of up to 40 million 
state and federal tax returns to be dispatched today. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was depressing news as well. The Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, said today ``Tax Freedom Day'' would 
be May 11, a day later than last year. The foundation calculates it 
would take an average worker until that date to earn enough to pay 
his or her share of all federal, state and local individual and 
corporate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	A reminder: If you can't finish in time, file for an extension  
using Form 4868 and pay the Internal Revenue Service as much of 
your estimated bill as possible to avoid interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	You can also pay by MasterCard, American Express or Discover  
card by calling 1-888-2PAYTAX -- for a 2.5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expects to receive 126 million individual income tax  
returns this year, with total income taxes projected at $828.6 
billion. That's just under half the $1.7 trillion in overall 
federal tax collections used to pay for everything from cruise 
missiles to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Working people pay more in U.S. taxes than more than 40,000  
foreign-controlled corporations operating in this country. The 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
reported Wednesday that tax loopholes allowed a majority of 
foreign-based companies to escape any taxes in 1995 -- a loss to the 
government estimated at $35 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of citizenship here, but these corporations are  
getting by in many cases with a free ride,'' said Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., who released the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mainly because of new child and education credits,  
Americans are enjoying much larger refunds -- $1,563 on average, 15 
percent above last year. And they've used computers to 
electronically file 21.1 million returns, almost 24 percent more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury is still out on whether the much-publicized IRS  
reform law is making the agency treat taxpayers better. Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, whose hearings last year 
helped spark the reforms, said he believes only about 20 percent of 
all IRS employees support the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, a bureaucracy will say, 'We'll just wait it out,'''  
said Roth, R-Del. ``We're talking about changing attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, however, told the Finance  
Committee on Wednesday that key changes include a new 
service-oriented mission statement, ways to rate employees that 
don't include enforcement quotas and a reorganization to create 
four separate operations aimed at individual taxpayers, small 
businesses, large corporations and tax-exempt entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little doubt that real change is occurring,''  
said Rossotti, who has been in his position 17 months. ``We have 
only just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who cannot pay, the IRS has relaxed its  
``offer-in-compromise'' program to let more taxpayers negotiate a 
lower settlement of their tax bills. Rossotti promised the new 
rules would prevent a duplication of last year's 80,000 rejections 
out of 105,000 offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Installment agreements are also easier to get. In almost all  
cases, the IRS will automatically accept a request for an 
installment plan -- attach Form 9465 to your return to request one -- 
as long as the amount owed is $25,000 or less and the taxpayer 
agrees to pay within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more people are depending on professional tax preparers  
to do their taxes -- an estimated 61 million returns this year. One 
big reason is the tax code's complexity, which Congress increased 
the past two years with more than 1,200 tax law changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether taxpayers will have to deal with more  
changes next year. Congressional Republicans are pushing through 
budget blueprints that call for some $800 billion in tax relief 
over the next decade, but there is very little money for tax cuts 
in fiscal 2000 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet anti-tax sentiment continues to run high on Capitol Hill.  
Coinciding with the tax deadline, the House today was planning to 
debate for the fifth year in a row a proposed constitutional 
amendment requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to pass most tax 
increases. The measure has no chance of passing.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Arrested for Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's turbulent baseball career  
took a downward turn when he was charged with possession of cocaine 
and soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder, in a gold-colored 1999 Ford  
Explorer, solicited an undercover officer for sex for $50, Sgt. M. 
Hamlin of the Tampa Police Department said after Wednesday night's 
arrest about three miles from the team's training complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon being searched by officers K. Daniel and B. Holder at 10:10  
p.m. EDT, 0.3 grams of powder cocaine wrapped in a $20 bill was 
found inside of Strawberry's wallet, the police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The powder was tested and proved positive for cocaine, according  
to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was booked at 12:22 a.m. today at the Hillsborough  
County Jail. After he had his fingerprints taken and was 
photographed for a mug shot, he was released on $6,000 bond shortly 
after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old outfielder, an eight-time All-Star, has been in  
Tampa at the Yankees' extended spring training camp while he works 
back into shape following colon cancer surgery last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Yankees won the World Series without him, New York  
City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised Strawberry ``for the 
comeback he's made as a baseball player and the comeback he's 
making in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was in New York last weekend to receive his World Series  
ring, then returned to Tampa. He was not expected to rejoin the 
Yankees until next month, until after a stint with Columbus of the 
Triple-A International League. The Yankees did not want him to join 
Columbus until after he completed chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's list of substance abuse problems is lengthy.  
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball suspended him for 60 days in 1995 after he  
tested positive for cocaine. The previous year, he entered the 
Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., and spent four weeks 
undergoing treatment for a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, while with the New York Mets, he entered the Smithers  
Center in New York for alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to substance abuse, Strawberry also ran afoul of tax  
laws. In April 1995, a federal court ordered him to repay $350,000 
in back taxes and sentenced him to six months of home confinement. 
But the order allowed him to leave home for practice and games, and 
to travel to road games. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who came to prominence with the Mets in the early  
1980s and won the NL Rookie of the Year award in 1983, also has had 
off-and-on problems in Los Angeles, where he was accused of failing 
to make timely payments to his ex-wife Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	He rebounded after signing with the Yankees in June 1995 and had  
remained drug free, with regular testing by major league baseball. 
Strawberry had his best season in seven years in 1998, hitting .247 
with 24 home runs and 57 RBIs in 295 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, because of complicated rules involving baseball's  
luxury tax, shifted him to a minor league roster during the 
offseason, fearing he would not be healthy enough to play by 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, the No. 1 pick in baseball's June 1980 amateur  
draft, joined with Dwight Gooden to help lead the Mets to the 1986 
World Series title. Gooden also has had cocaine problems and 
currently is with the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has a .250 career average with 332 homers and 994  
RBIs in 16 major league seasons with the Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, 
San Francisco Giants and Yankees. He led the NL with 39 homers in 
1988 and topped 100 RBIs three times with the Mets from 1987-90.

<HEADLINE> Mock Trial Probes 1871 Chicago Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- For Daniel ``Peg Leg'' Sullivan, exoneration came  
more than 127 years after the fact Thursday in a mock trial to 
determine whether he lied when questioned about the Great Chicago 
Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, staged at the John Marshall School of Law, was  
conceived by a staff law professor in an attempt to implicate 
Sullivan in one of the Chicago's greatest mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe Sullivan started the disastrous blaze accidentally  
in Catherine O'Leary's barn the night of Oct. 8, 1871, but tried to 
cover it up by claiming he had first seen the flames while siting 
outside a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire leveled a third of Chicago and left more than 100,000  
people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of two conflicting accounts Sullivan gave authorities  
during the investigation, he -- or at least an actor taking his 
place -- was tried on two counts of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense attorneys, all of them lawyers who  
graduated from John Marshall, spent 2 1/2 hours arguing the case 
before a prominent group of jurors that included Ray Meyer, the 
former Depaul University basketball coach, and Terry Hillard, 
superintendent of the Chicago Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for about 15 minutes before returning their  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Justice prevails, because the truth prevails,'' chirped  
Sullivan, in the person of actor Andrew White. He was one of the 
members of the Lookingglass Theatre Company who played witnesses in 
the mock trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Said juror Bennie Crane, a retired Chicago fire department  
chief: ``The witnesses were especially convincing on the stand, but 
I thought they (pros) fell short of convincing us beyond a shadow 
of a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, legend had it that Mrs. O'Leary's cow was the  
culprit, staring the fire by kicking over a lantern in the barn. 
But in 1997, Chicago's City Council cleared her and her cow. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Sullivan was built by John Marshall students  
largely with research conducted by Dick Bales, a lawyer and author 
of a history of the fire. He said he was disappointed by the 
verdict but stands behind his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think he did it,'' said Bales, who joined other  
participants at a post-trial dinner party. ``Granted my evidence is 
circumstantial, but there is no question that there are 
discrepancies between the two statements he gave about what 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merilyn Brown, the lead defense attorney, said even she is  
puzzled about just what Sullivan was doing at the time of the fire. 
He testified that he was sitting outside near the barn when he saw 
a glowing light before heading toward the barn. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan also said he yelled ``fire'' as he ran toward the barn.  
But witnesses said they didn't hear him. 
</P>

	``Maybe it was arson,'' Brown said. ``Of course it could have  
been nature. Historical records show that there were at least 20 
fires in town earlier that year because it was so dry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one fact that remains is that we'll never know for sure.''

<HEADLINE>  Arkansas Derby Winner Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Oaklawn Park officials asked state  
racing authorities Thursday to investigate whether jockey Billy 
Patin used an electrical device to make his horse run faster when 
it won the Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Valhol had not won in two outings before Saturday's $500,000  
Arkansas Derby and was a 30-1 shot when the horses left the gate. 
He paid $62.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Oaklawn president Charles J. Cella told a hastily called meeting  
of the state Racing Commission that he wanted the commission to 
investigate. He said an employee found a device on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked the commission to order the track to suspend  
distribution of the purse to the owner of the winner and to Patin. 
He said the commission's racing stewards, who left Oaklawn shortly 
after the meet ended Saturday, should be brought back together so 
they can investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission voted unanimously to go along with both requests.  
</P>
<P>
	Cella also said that, if the commission decides the rules of  
racing were violated, ``those involved should be dealt with in the 
appropriate and severe manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Valhol won the Arkansas Derby by 4 1/2 lengths.  
</P>
<P>
	The first-place check for the race was to be $300,000.  
Withholding those earnings would put Valhol's status in question 
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby. If there are more than 20 3-year-olds 
entered at Louisville, preference goes to the top 20 in graded 
money earned. The Arkansas Derby is a Grade II race and the 
first-place check would easily qualify Valhol for a spot in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cella said Oaklawn officials first became aware of possible  
irregularities in the running of the Arkansas Derby shortly after 
the race was declared official. 
</P>
<P>
	``We immediately informed the stewards and the local  
Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau -- the investigative branch of 
the thoroughbred racing industry,'' Cella said. ``By Monday night 
and Tuesday, Oaklawn management uncovered additional evidence 
regarding the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evidence also was turned over to the national office of the  
TRPB in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parties have concurred that the evidence is substantial  
enough to warrant further investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Valhol stayed just off the right flank of  
pacesetter Saint's Honor and then moved to the lead in the far 
turn. He quickly opened his advantage to 4 lengths. Patin used his 
whip on Valhol twice at the eighth pole and twice more at the 
sixteenth pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Dallas Keen, Valhol was making the third start of his  
career. He was second in a maiden race in New Orleans in February. 
A month later, he was fourth in the Louisiana Derby, beaten only 2 1/2 
lengths despite some traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Arkansas Derby, Keen said anyone who saw the colt's  
troubled trip in the Louisiana Derby should not have been shocked 
by his performance at Oaklawn. ``Normally, you don't want to throw 
a maiden to the wolves. This colt showed us so much talent, we 
thought we'd take a shot,'' Keen said.

<HEADLINE> El-Amin Gets Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut point guard Khalid El-Amin  
pleaded guilty today to misdeameanor possession of marijuana and 
was sentenced to one day of community service. The judge also 
ordered the stocky sophomore to warn schoolchildren about the 
dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old El-Amin appeared in Hartford Community Court  
before Judge Raymond Norko, who gave him a stern lecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is aware of who you are, where you are from and what  
you have done,'' Norko said. ``The citizens of this state love you 
and have adopted you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norko reminded El-Amin of his jubilant claim after the Huskies  
upset Duke in the NCAA championship game March 29: ``We shocked the 
world!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The epilogue to that is: `I disappointed the world,''' Norko  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did not respond, except to reply, ``Yes, your honor'' to  
questions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The player was stopped for a traffic violation Tuesday evening  
and a small amount of marijuana was discovered during a search, 
Hartford police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest may not have been an unlucky coincidence, according  
to a published report. The Hartford Courant, citing police 
documents and sources it did not identify, said today an informant 
had tipped police about El-Amin's trip to an area of Hartford known 
for drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving the tip, detectives arrived at the parking lot  
before El-Amin and saw him making what appeared to be a drug 
transaction, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	UConn scoring leader Richard Hamilton was a passenger in the car  
but was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was charged with possession of less than 4 ounces of  
marijuana, a misdemeanor. His sentence was the typical punishment 
given to first-time offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory parade for the Huskies is scheduled in Hartford for  
Saturday, but organizers said Wednesday they did not know whether 
El-Amin will take part. 
</P>
<P>
	A disappointed coach Jim Calhoun said he was standing by his  
player and would ensure El-Amin understands his position as a 
highly visible student athlete and role model. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every player in our program has responsibilities, on and off  
the court,'' Calhoun said.

<HEADLINE> 'Airplane' Director Reveals Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Jim Abrahams, who co-directed ``Naked Gun''  
and ``Airplane,'' is ready to reveal his secrets to making people 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Rule No. 1? ``Be funny.''  
</P>
<P>
	Another rule is: ``There are no rules.''  
</P>
<P>
	``What makes one person laugh doesn't make another person  
laugh,'' Abrahams said. ``Even with the rules, all you're doing is 
taking your best guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abrahams, a Milwaukee native and University of Wisconsin-Madison  
graduate, will speak Sunday at the Great Wisconsin Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrahams said he's working on a couple of new scripts -- his  
favorite part of the movie-making process. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a bad day writing, nobody cares. You push a button  
and it all goes away,'' he said. ``That's really when the ideas 
first happen, and the rest of the time is the battle to get them up 
on the screen.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Renews Tax Relief Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Republicans in Congress, Thursday's income  
tax deadline brought a chance to renew their promises for tax 
relief and cast symbolic votes on a proposed constitutional 
amendment that would make it tougher to raise future taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	In what has become an annual April 15 exercise, the GOP-led  
House failed to approve the amendment, which would require that 
most tax increases gain a two-thirds vote in Congress instead of a 
simple majority. The amendment itself required a two-thirds 
majority, and the 229-199 vote was short by 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the three hours of floor debate, along with an anti-tax  
rally featuring top GOP leaders, enabled Republicans to remind 
voters that tax relief tops their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a day when people are particularly sensitized, and they  
need to know which party wants to cut their taxes,'' said Rep. 
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also chose Thursday to rush through legislation  
giving tax breaks to troops involved in the war in Yugoslavia. 
Sponsors said the measure extends the relief to more support 
personnel than a nearly identical executive order signed by 
President Clinton this week for soldiers in the combat zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pointed out that five of the  
GOP's top 10 priority bills deal with tax relief and that 
Republicans in the House and Senate have adopted a budget blueprint 
promising an unspecified $778 billion tax cut using projected 
government surpluses over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there's an overcharge to the American people, they ought  
to get a refund,'' Hastert said at the rally. ``We need to hold 
down the tax burden on the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans are having a tough time deciding which taxes  
to cut. They have already backed away from a proposed 10 percent 
across-the-board income tax cut and face a money crunch that will 
likely allow for only modest relief in fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment to limit tax increases  
went down to defeat for the fifth straight year. All but a handful 
of Republicans voted for the measure, while most Democrats were 
against it and derided it as little more than an April 15 stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only a gimmick,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,  
top Democrat on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``This 
annual attempt to tinker with the Constitution will never provide a 
penny of tax relief to anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But proponents, noting that 14 states have similar laws,  
promised they would not give up and that it was worthwhile to have 
the debate each April 15, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	There were numerous other tax-related hearings and events in the  
Capitol, including introduction of a bill to abolish the income tax 
entirely -- it was created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment -- and 
replace it with a 15 percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	One other annual announcement came from the Tax Foundation, a  
nonprofit tax research group, which said May 11 was this year's 
``Tax Freedom Day.'' The foundation calculates it would take until 
then -- a day later than last year -- for the average American to 
earn enough to pay his or her share of all federal, state and local 
individual and corporate taxes.

<HEADLINE> NFL Draft Booming With Berman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Seventeen hours of name after name, most of them never heard  
before and never to be heard again. Why, then, do so many people 
watch the NFL draft on ESPN? 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Berman is one reason. The Fred Flintstone-lookalike  
sportscaster has found a way to give viewers expert analysis and 
witty entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Berman will be the host of ESPN's 17 hours of draft  
coverage beginning Saturday at noon EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the guy hasn't played, he knows as much or more  
than guys who have played or coached. He's a jack of all trades,'' 
said former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who makes his NFL draft 
debut Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Things may have changed since ESPN first televised the event 20  
years ago, but its most famous face and voice has not -- and that's 
partly why he's become a sports icon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't changed at all,'' said George Grande, who anchored  
ESPN's first seven NFL drafts. ``Chris, along with most of us who 
started with ESPN, is just like the fans out there. He's one of 
their own and I think everyone portrayed it like he was one of them 
sitting up there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1979, after the NFL owners unanimously rejected the idea of  
allowing ESPN to televise the draft, the fledgling cable network 
eventually persuaded the league to go ahead with a cut-down 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: An audience too small to be measured.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, the event grew to an 0.6 rating and was watched in  
178,000 homes. Last year, it had a 3.1 rating and was seen in more 
than 2.3 million households. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Berman will be the traffic cop once again, making  
certain that everything goes smoothly from the 27 teams the network 
hooks up with cameras or reporters. He'll also find ample 
opportunities to poke fun at draft guru Mel Kiper Jr., and make his 
own predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I dread it in some ways because it's the hardest thing I do in  
the course of the year,'' Berman said. ``I'm not talking about the 
10 hours on Saturday, I'm talking about getting up to speed. It's 
like cramming for an exam, or announcing a game that goes into 10 
overtimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berman is more surprised by his personal rise to success than  
that of the draft telecast. Even though the network began airing 
the event at 8 a.m. EDT for the first few years, he wasn't 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not shocked at all that it's grown like it has  
because this was a happening waiting to happen,'' he said. ``Pro 
football is just that big. ... For me, it's just sports. I didn't 
do a liver transplant or something important. I'm just delivering 
sports and trying to enhance the enjoyment of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berman can't really imagine being anywhere else except at the  
NFL draft this time of year. But the man who few in the business 
utter a bad word about says he does have a game plan for when he 
leaves the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to own the concession and drive the beverage cart at  
Pebble Beach,'' he said. ``I could see myself doing that in 10 
years -- But I'd have to get free tee times.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT IN MY CLASS:* Kelly was one of the quarterbacks in the  
famed 1983 draft that also included John Elway and Dan Marino. But 
it's not fair to compare this year's rich QB crop to that group -- 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to judge these guys right now, but the Class of '99  
has better athletes,'' Kelly said. ``Most of us were pocket 
passers. In terms of pure talent, there is no comparison. There 
will never be a class like that again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly has been studying tapes of each of this year's quarterback  
candidates and has his own rating system based on footwork, reading 
coverages, passing accuracy and arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to rate the quarterbacks overall, Donovan McNabb  
would be No. 1,'' he said. ``Then I like Cade McNown, Tim Couch and 
Akili Smith. I don't think anyone will go wrong picking Couch, but 
he doesn't have a very strong arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* CNBC begins the inaugural American Le Mans Series  
Sunday from Road Atlanta at 3 p.m. EDT. ... ESPN will televise up 
to 64 NHL playoff games beginning with a Wednesday doubleheader on 
ESPN2. ... Fox Sports Net will air a high school national title 
football game in December of 2000, based on season-long rankings 
compiled along with Student Sports, Inc. ... HBO's ``Real Sports'' 
examines the $4 billion trade in counterfeit golf clubs in the 
United States, Tuesday at 10 p.m. ... Lawrence Taylor is No. 40 on

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Settle Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA and its players accomplished what the  
NBA and its players couldn't do, avoid a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA and the newly formed players union assured a smooth  
start to their season by agreeing to a four-year collective 
bargaining agreement Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long process, but well worth it,'' said Pam  
Wheeler, the chief negotiator for the WNBA Players' Association. 
``It's a milestone for women's sports. We wanted to ensure whatever 
foundation we lay can catapult women's professional basketball for 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides compromised on the most contentious issues -- salaries  
and health benefits, incoming players from the defunct ABL, and 
guaranteed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very much our desire not to disrupt what we had  
created,'' WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman said. ``What we produced 
together reflects a spirit of compromise so we can continue to 
build on the incredible foundation and fan base we've developed 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary agreement, expected to be ratified by the 122  
players on Monday, included increases in the minimum salary from 
$15,000 to $30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for rookies. Those 
figures rise to $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits package includes year-round health and dental  
benefits, pension, maternity benefits and life insurance. The 
contract is expected to be formalized by April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting year-round health insurance was huge and made up for  
not getting a bigger starting salary,'' said Washington, a lawyer 
and guard on the New York Liberty. ``These are minimums, and 
players can negotiate their salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Player salaries had been determined by where they landed in the  
draft. Now players can negotiate increases based on merit. In 
addition, their contracts, which were not guaranteed, will be 
secure at the midpoint of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 current WNBA teams will be limited to three players from  
the ABL, while the expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota will be 
allowed five ex-ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	The restriction will be in effect for only one year.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington said ABL limit was a ``loyalty issue,'' meant to  
reward WNBA players who passed up the channce at substantial ABL 
salaries to sign with the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no animosity toward the ABL players,'' she said. ``A  
number of them are Olympians or All-Americans. They will help make 
the WNBA a more competitive and stronger league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league plans to add four new teams in 2000 with no limits on  
ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington said the turning point in negotiations came on Sunday  
when the league decided to bend on two issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The league came up on the salary -- that was huge -- and was  
willing to compromise on the ABL issue. Once we hammered out those 
two issues ... it had a snowball effect, and we compromised on the 
other issues,'' said Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although they did not receive a percentage of the league's  
basketball related income, players will receive a percentage of 
royalties from merchandise that use their name and likeness. The 
percentage is 40 percent the first year, with increases to 50 
percent in years three and four of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington thanked Billy Hunter, the executive director of the  
NBA players union, Patrick Ewing, Mitch Richmond and Juwan Howard 
for their support during the bargaining process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They provided valuable assistance,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sue Wicks of the New York Liberty said the minimum salary will  
continue to be an issue at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a small step forward and we have a lot of years to take  
steps forward,'' Wicks said in a telephone interview from 
Strasbourg, France, where top American players earn six-figures for 
playing on a pro team. ``I'm sure in five years it will be a great 
place to play and it will be very lucrative for the WNBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pre-draft camp opens Friday in Chicago, a day later than  
originally scheduled. The 10-week season begins June 10.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Gets More Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The government's corporate watchdog  
rejected Philippine Airlines' revised rehabilitation plan on 
Thursday, saying it was ``fraught with generalities'' and its 
earnings forecasts were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Securities and Exchange Commission gave the ailing  
airline until May 4 to improve the plan, extending Thursday's 
deadline for SEC approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In a highly critical assessment, the SEC said the plan was  
``substantially lacking'' in detail on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the new deadline was final, and warned that the airline  
will close if it cannot find investors to provide $200 million in 
exchange for new stock in the airline company -- a key element of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay said PAL failed to identify any new  
investors by the Thursday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL, which owes more than $2.2 billion to around 9,000  
creditors, said it was surprised by the SEC's decision and remains 
convinced it will find someone to provide the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in very serious discussions with potential investors,''  
said Peter Foster, the airline's chief adviser. ``We believe we're 
on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could not disclose the names because of  
confidentiality agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has set its own deadline of June 4 to come up with the fresh  
equity, which would give the new investors a 90 percent stake in 
the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL submitted a revised rehabilitation plan to the SEC last  
month. The plan has already been conditionally approved by the 
airline's major creditors -- a consortium of European financial 
institutions and the U.S. Export-Import Bank -- owed two-thirds of 
the total debt.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Beats Earnings Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. earnings rebounded to $469 million  
during the first quarter as the company's commercial aircraft 
division showed healthy returns for the first time in more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results announced Thursday were well above financial  
analysts' estimates and boosted Boeing's stock price by nearly 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had per-share earnings of 50 cents during the quarter,  
compared with a profit of just $50 million, or 5 cents a share, a 
year earlier, when the company was struggling with massive 
production problems and aircraft delays and took a $219 million 
loss on its new-generation 737 jetliner program. 
</P>
<P>
	The results surpassed the 43 cents predicted in a survey of  
analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $14.39 billion from  
$12.95 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing lost $178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of  
$1.1 billion last year. Boeing chairman and CEO Phil Condit, who 
caught much of the fire for Boeing's poor performance, said it was 
gratifying to see his company doing better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had two quarters now that show improving results,'' said  
Phil Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive officer. 
``Everything I see says we are turning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Peter Jacobs with Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle said,  
``considering how bad the problems have been, this quarter 
certainly demonstrates that at least the worst of the problems are 
behind them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results sent Boeing stock up $3.69 to $41.69 a share on the  
New York Stock Exchange and helped the Dow Jones industrial average 
reach its fourth-straight closing high, 10,462.72. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit said all three operating units -- commercial airplanes,  
military aircraft and missiles, and space and communications -- 
contributed to a solid first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The commercial airplane segment had operating earnings of $382  
million, up from just $23 million a year earlier, when Boeing was 
struggling with production line snarls, parts shortages and delays 
in bringing out the new 737s. Revenues from commercial jets were 
$9.8 billion, up $1.7 billion from first-quarter 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing delivered 148 commercial jets during the quarter, 40 more  
than the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said that  
while commercial aircraft managed an operating margin of 3.9 
percent in the first quarter, that figure is expected to fall to 
between 2 percent and 3 percent for the rest of 1999 and 2000 
because of the models of aircraft being delivered and the deals 
struck with airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened that our first quarter had a very rich mix of  
products as well as deals that had less concessions than in the 
second, third, and fourth quarters'' of 1999, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta Air Lines announced Thursday it would indefinitely defer  
deliveries of four new Boeing 777 jets because of labor problems, 
taking instead smaller 767-300s. Although 767s sell for around $30 
million less than 777s, Condit said the change would not 
significantly affect Boeing's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	The military aircraft and missile segment had operating revenues  
of $3 billion in the first quarter, about the same as last year, 
while space and communications had $1.5 billion, $300 million lower 
than a year earlier, due in part to fewer deliveries of Delta II 
rocket boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing plans to deliver 620 jetliners in 1999, and projects  
overall profits for the year at $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion on 
revenues of $58 billion. For 2000, it forecasts 480 jetliner 
deliveries and revenues of about $49 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit said he believes the worst of the Asian financial crisis  
is over and that deliveries could be ``flat to potentially slightly 
higher'' in 2001.

	Man Arrested for Fake News Report  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An employee of California-based PairGain  
Technologies Inc. was arrested today in North Carolina on federal 
charges of fabricating a Bloomberg news service report and posting 
it on the Internet, driving up the company's stock. The FBI 
arrested Gary Dale Hoke, 25, at his Raleigh, N.C., home on charges 
of securities fraud for allegedly disseminating false information 
about the company, whose stock is publicly traded, the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles said. Hoke was arraigned in North 
Carolina, ordered to report to California at an unspecified date 
and released on $50,000 bond, said Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Christopher Painter. The prosecutor described Hoke as a middle- 
level employee. There is no allegation that any higher-ups in the 
company were involved, Painter said.

	GM, Ford Earnings Up  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s earnings climbed 31  
percent in the first quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations, 
on continued strong profits in North America. Ford Motor Co. 
profits also were up. GM reported today it earned a record $2.1 
billion, or $3.04 a share, in the first three months of the year. A 
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. estimated GM would earn 
$2.88 a share. Ford, the world's No. 2 automaker, said today it had 
a 20 percent increase in operating earnings during the first 
quarter, earning $1.81 billion, or $1.46 a share, compared with 
$1.51 billion, or $1.22 a share, for the first three months of 
1998. As with GM, Ford's earnings were higher than Wall Street 
analysts' expectations. The average estimate of analysts surveyed 
by First Call was $1.39 a share. GM stock was down 2 9/16 at 87 
3/16. Ford was down 1 1/8 at 61 5/8.

on Thursday in an attempt to compete against pricier European 
sports cars in a crowded niche market. The eye-catching two-seater, 
which will hit U.S. showrooms in the fall, sells in Japan for about 
$28,000 -- far more affordable than upper-end import roadsters like 
the $41,000 Mercedes-Benz SLK and the $51,000 Porsche Boxster. The 
S2000 meets Japanese exhaust emission standards that go into effect

stock price. Schwab's earnings totaled $143 million, or 34 cents a 
share, beating analysts' estimates by a penny. The financial 
services firm earned $68 million, or 16 cents a share, in the first 
quarter last year. Schwab had told investors to expect stronger 
growth, and its stock price had risen by more than 70 percent in

company reported today it had per-share earnings of 50 cents during 
the quarter, compared with a profit of just $50 million, or 5 cents 
a share, a year earlier, when the company was struggling with 
massive production problems and aircraft delays. Boeing's results

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators approved a plan today  
designed to make all those charges on your monthly phone bill 
easier to understand. The Federal Communications Commission's plan, 
which is backed by the Clinton administration, generally would have 
phone companies reorganize bills to flag new charges and service 
providers, give clear descriptions of all charges and information 
about how to contest them. The plan, adopted in a 4-1 vote, could 
take effect in a few months. Local telephone and long-distance 
companies would have to abide by all of the FCC's provisions, but 
cellular and other wireless companies would have to comply with 
just some. Violations could trigger fines or other penalties.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed pitcher Wilson  
Alvarez on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with inflamation in 
his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez, who signed a $35 million, five-year contract before  
last season, missed six weeks with tendinitis in his rotator cuff 
last year. The left-hander is 6-15 since signing the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	While throwing in-between starts on Wednesday, Alvarez said he  
felt a twinge in his shoulder. He threw Thursday to see test it but 
immediately felt a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even raise my arm now,'' Alveraz said. ``Its  
painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Jamie Reed said the injury is not serious, but Alvarez  
will get a second opinion when the team returns to Tampa next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because I want to show these people I can do  
the job,'' Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was retroactive to April 12.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan's Bhutto Gets Jail Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A Pakistani court today found former  
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto guilty of corruption and sentenced 
her to five years in jail, the state-run news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Bhutto was also fined $8.6 million and disqualified from  
politics, the Associated Press of Pakistan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bhutto and her imprisoned husband, Asif Ali Zardari, were  
convicted of taking kickbacks on government contracts. Asif also 
received a five-year jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``What (the judge) has done against me is a crime,'' Ms. Bhutto  
said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. in 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying she believed the government would arrest her upon her  
return to Pakistan within the next week, Ms. Bhutto said it would 
only strengthen her Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to eliminate me from politics ... (but it will) make  
the Pakistan People's Party workers even more determined to 
overcome the odds and succeed,'' she said in the BBC television 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto is expected to appeal her conviction by the  
Rawalpindi branch of the Lahore High Court. 
</P>
<P>
	At home in Pakistan, her supporters were outraged by the  
conviction and sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is totally unfair and the murder of a trial,'' said Naeed  
Khan, Ms. Bhutto's close personal friend and party worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto was abruptly dismissed from power in 1996 on charges  
of rampant corruption, economic incompetence and sanctioning police 
hit squads in her home town of Karachi in southern Sindh province. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Ms. Bhutto has held several news conferences to  
complain she was not receiving a fair trial. She accused the judge 
of being biased against her and denying her lawyers an opportunity 
to present her defense. 
</P>
<P>
	She took her complaint to the Supreme Court, which ordered the  
lower court to hear Ms. Bhutto's defense. Ms. Bhutto also 
complained that she and her lawyers have been harassed by police 
and intelligence agents and that her car was routinely searched. 
</P>
<P>
	The government denies the charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, who has been criticized even by her supporters as  
corrupt, has been in jail since Ms. Bhutto's government was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto, who had been the first and only female prime  
minister of the country, faces five other charges of corruption, 
all stemming from her term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bhutto's earlier term in power also came to a sudden end in  
August 1990 after only 20 months. Then too, Ms. Bhutto and her 
husband were charged with abusing their power, corruption and 
economic mismanagement. No charges were ever proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Party workers were being mobilized to demonstrate against the  
verdict, said Wasif Syed, a worker for Ms. Bhutto's party. 
</P>
<P>
	``People from every city will come out on the street to  
demonstrate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Tobacco Targeting the Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Tobacco companies are still trying to get  
young people hooked on cigarettes, Vice President Al Gore charged 
at an anti-smoking forum. 
</P>
<P>
	A study commissioned by the Department of Health and Human  
Services said the most heavily advertised cigarette brands -- 
Marlboro, Newport and Camel -- are the most popular among teen-agers 
who smoked last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate study for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said  
children are two and a half times more likely than adults to have 
seen tobacco advertising in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual spending on tobacco ads is about $5 billion -- 100 times  
what is spent on anti-smoking messages, Gore said Wednesday at a 
middle school in northeast Ohio. As long as that's the case, ``this 
problem is going to continue to get worse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee accused Gore of hypocrisy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gore gobbled up at least $16,440 from the tobacco companies'  
PACS just from 1979 until 1990,'' said committee Chairman Jim 
Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pfeil, a spokesman for Marlboro-maker Philip-Morris, said  
the company has never marketed its products to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal study found that 88 percent of 12th-grade smokers  
used the three heavily advertised brands in 1998. Tobacco-Free Kids 
said 75 percent of children and 31 percent of adults indicated they 
had seen tobacco advertising in the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore highlighted the studies in the gymnasium of Roswell Kent  
Middle School. About 100 students wore red and white Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen-year-old Heather Slusher agreed that Gore's  
anti-smoking message would have a positive effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was just like a teacher, they wouldn't listen to him,''  
she said. ``But it's the vice president.''

<HEADLINE>  Marquee Fight Pits Jones &AMP; Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he cannot resist a challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the WBC-WBA light heavyweight champion could get one when  
he fights IBF champion Reggie Johnson in a 175-pound title 
unification bout June 5 in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in 
Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of Roy's career, and it's the  
biggest fight of my career,'' the left-handed Johnson (39-5-1, 24 
knockouts) said Thursday. Jones has a 39-1 record, with 33 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the news conference were some students of PS72 in  
upper Manhattan, and one youngster had a question for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, in what round do you think you will knock Mr.  
Johnson down?'' the boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it I'll knock him down or not, but from round  
one to round 12, I'll be doing a job on him,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match will be the fourth in a string of HBO-televised fights  
that run will run through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Naseem Hamed of Britain retained the WBO featherweight  
title by stopping Paul Ingle of Britain in the 11th round April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The next fight will be Oscar De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title  
defense against Oba Carr on May 22 in Las Vegas. It will be 
followed by Felix Trinidad's defense of the IBF welterweight title 
May 29 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Jones-Johnson match, a 
heavyweight fight between Michael Grant and Lou Savarese on June 19 
at Madison Square Garden in New York and another bout featuring 
Hamed, on July 17, against an opponent to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, also said that a  
pay-per-view rematch between heavyweight champions Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis -- who fought to a disputed draw March 13 
-- would be held Nov. 6 or Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one meeting away,'' Abraham said when asked if the fight  
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson won the WBA light heavyweight title in  
1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round Feb. 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE>  Marquee Fight Pits Jones &AMP; Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roy Jones Jr. says he cannot resist a challenge.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, the WBC-WBA light heavyweight champion could get one when  
he fights IBF champion Reggie Johnson in a 175-pound title 
unification bout June 5 in the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in 
Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest fight of Roy's career, and it's the  
biggest fight of my career,'' the left-handed Johnson (39-5-1, 24 
knockouts) said Thursday. Jones has a 39-1 record, with 33 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the news conference were some students of PS72 in  
upper Manhattan, and one youngster had a question for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, in what round do you think you will knock Mr.  
Johnson down?'' the boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it I'll knock him down or not, but from round  
one to round 12, I'll be doing a job on him,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The match will be the fourth in a string of HBO-televised fights  
that run will run through July. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince Naseem Hamed of Britain retained the WBO featherweight  
title by stopping Paul Ingle of Britain in the 11th round April 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The next fight will be Oscar De La Hoya's WBC welterweight title  
defense against Oba Carr on May 22 in Las Vegas. It will be 
followed by Felix Trinidad's defense of the IBF welterweight title 
May 29 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Jones-Johnson match, a 
heavyweight fight between Michael Grant and Lou Savarese on June 19 
at Madison Square Garden in New York and another bout featuring 
Hamed, on July 17, against an opponent to be chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Abraham, president of Time Warner Sports, also said that a  
pay-per-view rematch between heavyweight champions Evander 
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis -- who fought to a disputed draw March 13 
-- would be held Nov. 6 or Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're one meeting away,'' Abraham said when asked if the fight  
was made. 
</P>
<P>
	There hasn't been an undisputed light heavyweight champion since  
Michael Spinks relinquished the title in 1985 to successfully 
campaign for the IBF heavyweight championship against Larry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Jones, a former IBF middleweight and super  
middleweight champion, won the WBC light heavyweight title in 1996, 
lost on a disqualification to Montell Griffin in 1997 and regained 
the title with a first-round knockout of Griffin later that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones added the WBA title by outpointing Lou Del Valle last July  
18. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old Johnson won the WBA light heavyweight title in  
1992 and lost it in 1993. After failing twice to regain it, he 
became IBF champion by knocking out William Guthrie in the fifth 
round Feb. 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Schwab Earnings Rise 110 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Charles Schwab Corp. posted a 110 percent  
jump in first-quarter profits Thursday, slightly beating Wall 
Street expectations, but profit-takers drove down the company's 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab's earnings totaled $143 million, or 34 cents a share,  
beating analysts' estimates by a penny. The financial services firm 
earned $68 million, or 16 cents a share, in the first quarter last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab had told investors to expect stronger growth, and its  
stock price had risen by more than 70 percent in the month before 
the results. In trading Thursday, Schwab closed off $14.25, or 10 
percent, at $124 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based company credited record trading volume,  
both at Schwab and in the markets in general, boosted by online 
trading by individual investors. Schwab now has 2.5 million active 
online accounts with $219 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at these numbers, that sucking sound you're  
hearing is more assets being gathered by Schwab,'' said Michael 
Freudenstein, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York. ``Nobody's 
out there cold-calling clients. People are bringing them their 
assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With 298 branch offices as well as an Internet trading operation  
that can easily handle more volume with only minimal additional 
expenses, Schwab is taking customers away from Wall Street firms 
that haven't adapted to e-commerce, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For Schwab, the e-strategy is paying off.  
</P>
<P>
	The company raked in revenues of $952 million for the quarter  
ended March 31, up from $604 million the year before. This 
quarter's revenue and net income were the highest in Schwab 
history, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the past three months our customers brought a record  
$28 billion in net new assets to the firm and opened 388,000 new 
accounts,'' chairman and co-CEO Charles R. Schwab said. ``After 
reaching the $500 billion milestone during January, we ended the 
quarter with $542 billion in customer assets held in 5.9 million 
active accounts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And those individual investors make a lot of trades -- 160,000  
during the quarter, which is 90 percent more than a year ago. That 
doubled profits from stock transactions, and commissions rose by 59 
percent, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo could cost US $1 billion a month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. share of NATO's air campaign against  
Yugoslavia cost roughly $600 million in the first three weeks and 
could run over $1 billion a month to sustain, congressional budget 
analysts said as the Clinton administration worked to complete a 
multibillion-dollar emergency request. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders told the administration to make the package  
more than the $4 billion that the Pentagon has suggested to pay for 
the war and for humanitarian relief through September. 
Congressional officials close to the process said they expected the 
administration request to be at least $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a stretching thin of our overall capacity,'' House  
Appropriations Committee Chairman Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., 
told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at a hearing Thursday. 
``We have to do more than just replace the bullets and the 
missiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the final cost, it appears likely that Congress will  
agree to take it out of the new-found budget surplus rather than 
tap into other hard-pressed accounts 
</P>
<P>
	The Congressional Budget Office said its report that the air war  
had cost $600 million so far and would cost $1 billion for each 
additional month it is sustained did not include humanitarian aid, 
or certain procurement costs, such as replacing the F117 
``stealth'' fighter that was lost. That aircraft is no longer being 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
	CBO Director Dan Crippen said that sending in ground troops -- an  
option the administration says it is not currently considering -- 
could cost another $200 million a month, assuming a force of one 
heavy division with support, or about 27,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens,  
R-Alaska, and other congressional leaders met later Thursday with 
White House budget director Jack Lew to discuss the 
administration's request, but no final figures were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very close,'' Lew told reporters after the session.  
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said he had hoped to be able to take the administration  
request with him to study this weekend when he and other 
congressional leaders fly to the Balkans to speak to U.S. troops 
and to NATO headquarters in Brussels. But he suggested that now 
seemed unlikely. The congressional delegation leaves Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what the final price tag on the administration request  
would be, Stevens said, ``it depends on whether they take our 
advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, clearly, the GOP advice was for more, not less.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans suggested they might try to amend the measure to  
provide for longer-term needs for the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., even suggested that  
the Senate might attach to the measure the across-the-board 4.8 
percent military pay increase that was approved but not funded by 
the Senate in February. The pay and benefit increase would cost $7 
billion over the next five years, more than a smaller pay increase 
planned by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., urged the administration  
to make a ``realistic appraisal of what this is going to cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young and other Republicans told Albright they were afraid that  
in moving aircraft and even an aircraft carrier away from the 
Korean peninsula, the administration was making U.S. troops there 
uneasy, as was moving aircraft to the Balkans region from the 
Persian Gulf area. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the administration would do nothing to jeopardize  
troops in South Korea or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 19 House members complained in a letter to the  
administration that the Pentagon was doing little to replenish 
cruise missiles used in the war.

<HEADLINE> Polaroid Losses Nearly Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Polaroid Corp. reported its  
first-quarter loss nearly doubled to $30.8 million as its sales 
declined in several overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of self-developing cameras and film said Thursday its  
loss translated to 70 cents per share and compared with a loss of 
$17.4 million, or 39 cents per share, in the same quarter a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales declined to $379 million from $391 million in the first  
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which said the first quarter is traditionally its  
weakest period for revenues and profits, said its operating loss 
narrowed to $6.9 million from $13 million due to cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	Polaroid has lost money in five of the last six years amid  
declining sales. The company attributed the latest decrease in 
sales principally to a drop in orders from Europe and lower sales 
in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	But Polaroid said sales were strong in Japan, and it reported  
gains in North and South America. U.S. sales rose to $227 million 
from $212 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we focus on revitalizing core business profitability, we're  
gratified to see strong leading indicators for growth from our new 
products,'' said Gary T. DiCamillo, the company's chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock was off 18 3/4 cents at $20.93 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange today.

<HEADLINE> Restaurants Try Guidelines for Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- That $40 entree got you down? Or the  
appetizer that costs as much as a meal? 
</P>
<P>
	Well, here's something else unsettling: Some upscale restaurants  
are adding ``gratuity guidelines,'' to their checks, a 
not-so-subtle suggestion to make the voluntary tip a little more 
obligatory. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lula in Santa Monica, for instance, checks come with a  
recommended tip of 15, 18 or 20 percent of the meal's cost. 
Customers, properly encouraged, can then check a box, once they get 
over the surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's rude,'' said Catherine Marin, a doctor in Los  
Angeles who dined recently at Lula. ``It shouldn't be up to the 
restaurant. It should be up to the person receiving the meal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Express developed a feature on its  
electronic credit card processor that will automatically calculate 
from the bill a gratuity selected by the restaurant. After the 
machine validates your card, it prints out the suggested tip on 
your receipt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason is tipping is not consistent. It can vary from $5  
to $25 for the same meal,'' said Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman for 
the 37,000-member National Restaurant Association in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has suggested a more subtle approach. It is  
distributing its own credit card-size sheets to help diners 
calculate 15 and 20 percent tips. 
</P>
<P>
	While there's no indication tipping guidelines are sweeping the  
restaurant community, ``we are seeing more experimentation with 
ways to provide more customer convenience,'' Ms. Kraushaar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some waiters, bothered by bad tips, like the idea.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people just don't know what to do,'' said Brett Neal,  
who waits tables at Alegria, a trendy restaurant in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, anyone who's traveled to Europe may not be shocked by  
the tip suggestions. In France and many other countries, the 
gratuity is already part of the meal's cost and tipping beyond that 
is not customary. 
</P>
<P>
	It's mandatory, too, in many American restaurants for parties of  
six or more. A tip of 15 percent to 18 percent is automatically 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	David Stockman, chairman of the California Restaurant  
Association, said he doesn't believe the idea is catching on -- nor 
will it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be insulted if they brought it to me,'' he said. ``You  
don't have a way of voicing your dissatisfaction if they don't 
deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tips stand for ``To insure proper service,'' said Stockman,  
who's also senior vice president of Pasadena-based Lawry's 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	If the gratuity guidelines get substantial negative feedback,  
``they will be dropped in a heartbeat,'' Ms. Kraushaar said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they should, says bicoastal restaurateur Michael McCarty.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason to buck tradition. It seems the wrong way to  
go,'' said the owner of Michael's restaurants in New York City and 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	For 20 years, McCarty's restaurants added a 15 percent service  
charge to checks. They returned to the optional tipping system last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The typical tip left now is closer to 20 percent,'' McCarty  
said.

<HEADLINE> Earth-Imaging Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) -- NASA's Landsat 7  
satellite was launched today on a $770 million mission to monitor 
global conditions ranging from soil moisture and snowpacks to the 
effects of flood, fire, earthquakes and volcanos. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-stage Boeing Delta II booster with nine strap-on solid  
rockets roared off the launch pad at 11:32 a.m. PDT, carrying the 
4,400-pound satellite toward polar orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	All went well through the first phase of the flight, ending with  
cutoff of the second stage and the rocket and satellite coasting at 
17,000 mph, launch control reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The second stage was to restart 57 minutes after liftoff and  
burn briefly before separating from the satellite at an altitude of 
434 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Landsat series dates to 1972. Landsat 5, launched in March  
1984, is still operating. The Landsat 7 mission, with updated 
technology, was designed to maintain the flow of Earth observation 
data gathered over the past quarter century. 
</P>
<P>
	Project scientist Darrel Williams said the orbit was designed to  
have Landsat 7 to repeat coverage of any given area every 16 days. 
Combined with Landsat 5's data, each area will be covered every 
eight days. 
</P>
<P>
	The data can be used to determine the health of crops and other  
vegetation by monitoring water content of the soil, keeping tabs on 
natural disaster impacts, and monitoring population changes in 
metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Geological Survey data center in Sioux Falls, S.D., will  
be the primary receiving station and data distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite was built by Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space of  
Valley Forge, Pa. The science instrument came from Hughes Santa 
Barbara Remote Sensing of Santa Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delta II was manufactured in Huntington Beach, Calif., and  
assembled in Pueblo, Colo.

<HEADLINE> FCC Sells Communications Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government auction of licenses to deliver  
mobile phone, fax and other communications services ended Thursday, 
generating nearly $413 million from 57 companies for 302 licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission's auction began March 23  
and closed after 78 rounds. A total of 347 licenses were on the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook Inlet/Voice Stream PCS was the biggest winner, in terms of  
the total amount of money bid, pledging $192.3 million for 28 
licenses. A subsidiary of Omnipoint Corp. was second with $45 
million for 34 licenses, and Viper Wireless Inc. ranked third with 
$32.2 million for six licenses, the FCC said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the second time the FCC has auctioned the licenses. They  
were either unsold the first time around or returned to the 
commission by cash-strapped companies that couldn't pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago winners in an airwaves auction reserved for  
small businesses pledged $10.2 billion for licenses for the next 
generation of wireless communications, known as personal 
communications services, or PCS. After the auction, some of the 
winners said they couldn't pay for the new wireless licenses, some 
asked the FCC for relief and some filed for bankruptcy protection.

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan Conducts 2nd Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan tested a second  
nuclear-capable missile today, again upping the ante in the arms 
race with its uneasy neighbor India. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile tested was the Shaheen 1, the first in a new series  
of surface-to-surface missiles, military and government officials 
said. The missile's range of 450 miles was considerably less than 
the Ghauri II ballistic missile tested by Pakistan on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flight tests have strengthened national security and  
will help in maintaining a strategic balance in South Asia,'' said 
a foreign ministry statement issued after the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier test of the Ghauri II, which has a range of 1,200  
miles, was carried out in apparent response to a trial launch of an 
advanced version of India's Agni missile last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ghauri II, like the new Shaheen missile can carry a nuclear  
or conventional payload of 2,200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Since India and Pakistan exploded nuclear devices last year and  
declared themselves nuclear powers, the international community has 
been trying to avert a regional arms race. The countries have 
fought three wars in the past 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, China and Russia called on the two countries to take  
steps to prevent an arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides should ``seek concrete avenues to avoid the  
acceleration of an arms race in South Asia so that peace and 
stability can prevail,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun 
Yuxi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia called on Pakistan and India ``to stop the arms race,  
which may result in the destabilization of the situation not only 
in the Asian region but also on a large scale,'' a Foreign Ministry 
official said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wednesday's test, both countries had moved to allay fears  
the race would escalate. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said today's six-minute test was conducted at the  
Sonmiani naval base, about 30 miles from Pakistan's southern port 
city of Karachi in southwestern Baluchistan province on the Arabian 
Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Official sources indicated a second, more advanced Shaheen  
missile, with a range of 1,430 miles, was ready and waiting to be 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was no announcement of when or if their would be  
a trial of the advanced Shaheen, a foreign ministry statement said 
today's test ``concludes, for now, the series of ... flight tests 
involving solid and liquid fuel rocket motor technologies, which 
started yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In comments published today in the English-language newspaper,  
The News, Qadir Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear program, 
dismissed allegations that Pakistan's missile technology has been 
purchased from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan also is accused of buying ballistic missiles capable of  
carrying nuclear warheads from China, a charge both countries deny. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (western countries) have always been underestimating and  
underrating our capability,'' Khan was quoted as saying. ``All the 
time whatever we do there is always a blame that we got things from 
here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the test, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated  
Pakistan's scientists ``on this great achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	But some businessmen in Karachi worried that an arms race would  
cripple Pakistan's already troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arms race is not good for either country,'' said S.M.  
Inam, a businessman who is pressing for increased trade between 
Pakistan and India. ``We must negotiate with India. ... Pakistan's 
economy cannot sustain an arms race and even these tests are too 
costly.''

tested. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was no announcement of when or if their would be  
a trial of the advanced Shaheen, a foreign ministry statement said 
today's test ``concludes, for now, the series of ... flight tests 
involving solid and liquid fuel rocket motor technologies, which 
started yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In comments published today in the English-language newspaper,  
The News, Qadir Khan, the architect of Pakistan's nuclear program, 
dismissed allegations that Pakistan's missile technology has been 
purchased from North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan also is accused of buying ballistic missiles capable of  
carrying nuclear warheads from China, a charge both countries deny. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (western countries) have always been underestimating and  
underrating our capability,'' Khan was quoted as saying. ``All the 
time whatever we do there is always a blame that we got things from 
here and there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the test, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated  
Pakistan's scientists ``on this great achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	But some businessmen in Karachi worried that an arms race would  
cripple Pakistan's already troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arms race is not good for either country,'' said S.M.  
Inam, a businessman who is pressing for increased trade between 
Pakistan and India. ``We must negotiate with India. ... Pakistan's 
economy cannot sustain an arms race and even these tests are too 
costly.''

<HEADLINE> Rams Get Faulk From Colts for Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams got three-time All-Pro  
running back Marshall Faulk cheap Thursday, because the 
Indianapolis Colts wanted to clear the decks for Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, 26, the best all-purpose back in the league, rushed for  
1,319 yards, caught 86 passes and scored 10 touchdowns last year. 
He was expendable in part because he wanted to renegotiate his 
contract and cost the Rams only two draft picks, a second and a 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an outstanding move for our organization,'' coach  
Dick Vermeil said. ``Players like this make offensive coordinators 
and head coaches a lot smarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was surprised his price tag was so low.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm worth more, I really feel and believe that I am,''  
Faulk said after arriving in St. Louis on a late-afternoon flight. 
``But that's what happens. If you can get anything cheaper or for 
less the price, you do it. That's the American way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was a bit disappointed that the trade doesn't change his  
home field situation, which is playing on artificial turf under a 
dome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something I didn't want to do,'' Faulk said.  
``Sometimes you can't get everything you want in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts are expected to take Williams, the Heisman Trophy  
winner, with the fourth selection, or trade up to make certain they 
get him. Many pre-draft observers expect quarterbacks Tim Couch, 
Donovan McNabb and Akili Smith to be the be the first three picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Knowing Bill Polian and Jim Mora, they have a pretty good feel  
for what's going to go on before then,'' Vermeil said. ``There's 
only a few people ahead of them, and I think they've probably got a 
good pulse on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colts owner Jim Irsay issued a statement that read, in part,  
``Marshall was a very productive player for the Colts as evidenced 
by his three Pro Bowl nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, the Colts have decided to take a different  
direction as preparations continue for the 1999 season. We wish 
Marshall continued success in his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis had two second-round picks, including one acquired  
from New Orleans in an offseason deal for disappointing wide 
receiver Eddie Kennison, to use as bait. They used their own pick, 
the 36th overall, instead of the Kennison pick, which is No. 41. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal fills the Rams' biggest pre-draft need. Their top  
rusher last year, June Henley, had 313 yards. Greg Hill had 240 
yards and averaged 6 yards in two early starts, but missed most of 
the season with an ankle injury. The Rams are worried about his 
durability. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was the second overall pick on the 1994 draft, and Hill  
was the second back taken that year, by the Kansas City Chiefs late 
in the first round. Hill isn't conceding anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one of the guys you want to have on your team when you  
want to go and win a Super Bowl,'' Hill said. ``Unfortunately, if 
you look at my stats vs. his stats, of course they look a little 
bit better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill has 2,676 career rushing yards in his career, and has  
started 21 games. Faulk has four 1,000-yard seasons and has 5,320 
yards rushing and 2,804 receiving. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams took a running back in the second round last year, and  
Robert Holcombe was a disappointment with a 2.3-yard average and 
only 230 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year didn't go as well as I would have liked, and I know  
it's not as well as they would have liked,'' Holcombe said. ``But I 
don't think there's a loss of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, 26, has two years to go on the original seven-year  
contract he signed with the Colts at the second overall pick of the 
1994 draft. He wants to renegotiate a deal that will pay him $2.2 
million in base salary this year, and Vermeil said the Rams 
wouldn't be opposed to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the teams were made well-aware that it was going to take a  
new contract with Marshall,'' said Rocky Arceneaux, Faulk's agent. 
``I don't think they would have done it without intending on 
re-doing the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk is coming off his best year. His 2,227 total yards from  
scrimmage was the sixth-highest total in NFL history. He was second 
to Terrell Davis in rushing yards. He was third in the NFL in 
receptions. He led all NFL running backs in both receptions and 
reception yards.

<HEADLINE> Md. Libraries To Censor Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICK, Md. (AP) -- Frederick County librarians will censor  
the Internet for small children only. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Libraries Director Darrell Batson said Tuesday that  
filtering software will be installed on computers in children's 
sections when county libraries go online this summer. Computers in 
the young adult and adult sections won't contain the filtering 
program, which is supposed to block access to pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	Limiting information is contradictory to the library's role as  
an information hub, Batson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be thought police,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Censoring the Internet has been a contentious issue across the  
nation and across Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	In neighboring Carroll County, all computers with Internet  
access are filtered. Librarians can remove the filter if requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allegany County Library Board voted last October to filter  
one computer in each county library, prompting director Jane 
Rustin, who opposed any censorship, to quit.

<HEADLINE>  Ottawa Crowd Roars for Gretzky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- If this was Wayne Gretzky's final game in  
Canada, Ottawa fans made sure it was memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	The volume started building during warmups before Thursday  
night's game between Gretzky's New York Rangers and the Ottawa 
Senators at the Corel Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the crowd roared when his name was announced in the  
starting lineup moments before the Canadian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has said he'll decide by Sunday final Rangers game at  
Madison Square Garden whether he will retire. If he is indeed 
hanging up his skates, then Thursday night's Rangers-Senators game 
was the last in his native land. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators took a 1-0 lead on Nelson Emerson's goal with 55  
seconds left in the first period, but even that didn't produce the 
buzz the Great One did every time he stepped on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	They could afford to be generous -- the Senators have a playoff  
spot locked up while the Rangers are hopelessly out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	With his parents and his wife and children looking on, Gretzky  
skated eight first-period shifts, logging just over seven minutes 
of ice time. Clearly, he was giving no hint the end might be near. 
His skating, as always, was fluid and strong, the trademark wispy 
smile playing across his face during each shift. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours before the game, Ottawa goaltender Ron Tugnutt said he  
looked forward to perhaps being part of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for a bench-clearing brawl during the warmup so I  
can go out and grab his stick,'' a laughing Tugnutt told The 
Canadian Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran goalie is among those who don't believe the  
38-year-old Gretzky will retire after the Rangers' final 
regular-season game on Sunday, but the commotion at the Corel 
Centre could not be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers opted not to have a game-day skate, keeping Gretzky  
well clear of the scores of reporters tracking his every move. 
Instead, they invaded the usually tranquil Senators' dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	There, they found consensus on one issue -- if Gretzky opts to  
retire after 20 record-setting seasons, it won't be because he no 
longer contributes on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever Gretzky's reasons are for pondering retirement -- a sore  
back, a losing team in New York, reaching all the milestones -- it's 
not that he can no longer help his team win. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hands are still there -- they haven't gone anywhere,'' said  
Tugnutt. ``It's strange to say, but he's more dangerous behind the 
net than anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a talent no one else has.''  
</P>
<P>
	Although Gretzky went into the Ottawa game with only nine goals  
-- well below his 1981-82 record of 92 -- he had 52 assists, better 
than all but an elite handful in the 27-team league. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the blue-line in, he's still one of the best at finding  
an open man and making things happen,'' said Senators wing Daniel 
Alfredsson. ``When I'm 38, I hope I can still walk. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz over Gretzky's possible retirement made the Senators  
the hottest ticket in Ottawa, clearly overshadowing the team's race 
with New Jersey for first place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senators did not feel slighted.  
</P>
<P>
	``It might be a game we remember forever,'' Alfredsson said.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks to ASNE-7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks to the American Society of  
Newspaper Editors on Thursday in San Francisco, as transcribed by 
the Federal Document Clearing House: 
</P>
<P>
	I can only tell you what I have tried to do. I have tried to  
lead America into a new century and into a whole new era in the way 
we work and live and relate to each other and the rest of the 
world. And I have tried to help build a world that was more 
peaceful, more prosperous and more secure. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that among the things that people will say this  
administration did and made progress on was we gave the United 
States a modern economic policy and got out of 12 years of horrible 
deficit spending during which we quadrupled the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that the work we did to support the solution to social  
problems in reducing the welfare rolls by half and reducing the 
crime rate and putting 100,000 police on the street will be 
important. I think the work we did in education will be important. 
I think the systematic effort we made to promote reconciliation 
among people of different racial groups will be important. 
</P>
<P>
	I think the work we have done from the Middle East to Northern  
Ireland in promoting peace will be important. I think the work 
we've done in Latin America through the Summit of the Americas and 
the work we've done with our other allies in Central America will 
be important. I think there are a lot of things that will 
altogether add up to preparing America for the 21st century, 
building a stronger American community, and repairing the social 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	And let me just say one thing. I just left -- when I got off the  
airplane today, there were a bunch of young people who are 
AmeriCorps volunteers. That's a program, you know, we started back 
in the second year of my presidency. And one young woman said to 
me: I'm 30 years old. You're the first president I ever voted for. 
I've kept up. You did what you said you'd do. And it's worked. 
</P>
<P>
	And her saying that to me meant more than just about anything  
any American could say. When I was in New Hampshire for the seventh 
anniversary of the New Hampshire primary, there were schoolchildren 
along the highway waiting in the cold rain. 
</P>
<P>
	And person after person said to me: You had to come to these  
little town meetings in 1991 and we listened to you, and you've 
done what you said. So what I think will also happen is people will 
see Americans can solve their problems, government has a role to 
play and it can produce. 
</P>
<P>
	So I think there's a sense of possibility, a sense of optimism,  
a sense of eagerness about the future that the present difficulties 
in Kosovo cannot begin to overshadow. And I think the country is 
clearly better off than it was six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Part of -- a little known function of this convention is to  
help train young journalists. There are some journalists here who 
produce the ASNE Reporter. I'd like to ask them to stand because 
they gave me this question. If you all would stand, please? 
</P>
<P>
	Their question was, and you made an indirect reference to this  
in your speech. You didn't mention the Marshall Plan by name, but 
that seemed to be what you were talking about as a way to resolve 
this later. And their question was: Could a greater effort have 
been made after the fall of the Berlin Wall to do more along the 
lines of a Marshall Plan, particularly in the Balkans? And might 
that have prevented something like we're facing today? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Perhaps. I don't know. You know, I wasn't president  
then. And I don't know -- I don't say that in a blameworthy sense. I 
just wasn't. And I don't think it's fair for me to make judgments 
that I, where I don't have all the facts and I can't say. I don't 
mind saying that, you know, that I missed the boat somewhere if I 
know it or if I know enough about somebody else to say that, but I 
don't know the answer to that. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me say it in another way. I'm convinced that after communism  
fell, that the work that -- we had -- we had a chance after the 
Berlin Wall fell, after the end of communism, to build a Europe 
that was united, democratic and at peace for the first time in 
history. You go back since the rise of nation-states on the 
continent of Europe, that had never been true before. There had 
always been some conflict, there had always been some division, 
there had always been some absence of democracy. Never before 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	At that moment, there were three great challenges, I would  
argue, to that vision. One is, what happens to Russia? Does Russia 
become a democracy? Does it become stable? Can it be prosperous 
enough in the painful transition? The other was, what happens to 
all the states around that were communist -- the non-Russian 
states, which is basically the Balkans and central Europe and 
southeastern Europe? Second question. 
</P>
<P>
	Third question is, would there be a conflict between Islam and  
the orthodox branch of Christianity manifest most obviously in the 
tension between Greece and Turkey, but also up in the Balkans? 
</P>
<P>
	If those three things could be resolved in a satisfactory way,  
then we could build a Europe that was united, democratic and at 
peace. Now what happened? The Germans took on East Germany in an 
act of patriotism and generosity and costliness of staggering 
proportions. They are still paying the economic price today, but it 
was a brave and good and generous thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	The major countries in Europe supported the European Union. NATO  
took in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. There was a massive 
effort made to try to deal with Russia. The United States put a lot 
of money into the denuclearization program and other things. 
</P>
<P>
	After that's said and done, where are we? And we dealt with the  
Balkans in a more halting way. I think everyone would have to admit 
that. And we've continued without great success to resolve the 
difficulties between Greece and Turkey, but they haven't gotten 
worse either. And we may have some Americans of both heritages here 
today that could have some ideas about that. 
</P>
<P>
	So where are we today? Today we're concerned that Russia has  
maintained its democracy, but its economy has been so burdened it's 
caused all kinds of other problems, and that takes a lot of time 
for us. We're working on that, and we're trying to maintain our 
strategic partnership with them, even as disagree about the 
conflict in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> European Telecom Cos. Talk Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom has reportedly entered merger  
talks with Telecom Italia, a move that could save the Italian 
company from a hostile takeover by Olivetti and create a European 
telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussions are being held between the two companies' chief  
executives and have entered advanced stages, the London-based 
Financial Times reported in Friday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the aim of such a deal, if completed, would  
be to create a powerful European-wide operator that could compete 
globally with U.S. telecommunications giants such as AT&AMP;T and MCI 
WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would likely be reached quickly, the newspaper  
said, due to Telecom Italia's urgent need to stave off Olivetti's 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti unveiled its $58 billion proposed bid in February, and  
later sweetened it to $65.2 billion. Telecom Italia, a former 
state-owned company, tried last Saturday to encourage its 
shareholders to approve a stock conversion plan that would have 
made a takeover far too expensive for Olivetti. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting of shareholders fell short of a quorum, making  
the situation even more urgent for Telecom Italia. 
</P>
<P>
	No one from Telecom Italia or the German-based Deutsche Telekom  
could be reached for comment late in the evening European time 
Thursday. Deutsche Telekom was quoted as telling the Financial 
Times that it ``would not take part in any speculation'' on the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Any possible deal would have to be approved by the Italian and  
German governments and the European Commission's antitrust 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal may include the German government selling its  
74 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom over a defined period and the 
German company abandoning its alliance with France Telecom, the 
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Mistaken Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia sharply condemned a NATO strike on a  
civilian convoy in Kosovo and welcomed a German peace proposal 
involving a 24-hour halt to the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Ministry expressed its ``utmost indignation''  
Thursday about the mistaken attack on a convoy of ethnic Albanian 
refugees, calling it ``yet another crime evincing the alliance's 
gross violations of international humanitarian norms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's newly appointed envoy for Yugoslavia, former Prime  
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, also condemned the attack but said he 
hoped it would motivate NATO and Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic 
to settle their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``These tragic events have demonstrated to the whole world the  
need for a rapid, peaceful resolution of the existing problems,'' 
Chernomyrdin said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	Chernomyrdin, named Wednesday to head Russia's efforts to find a  
political solution, said he plans talks with Milosevic to press for 
a settlement. He said the German proposal made Wednesday could 
clear the way for progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany said NATO should offer to temporarily halt its bombing  
campaign if Yugoslav forces agree to withdraw from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only peaceful means to settle the conflict should be sought  
and Germany's proposal for a 24-hour halt to the bombing and a 
search for compromise deserve attention,'' Chernomyrdin said after 
meeting with the German ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is eager to find a political solution, but it apparently  
lacks sufficient power or influence with either side to achieve a 
breakthrough at this stage. The United States has hoped that Russia 
can pressure its Yugoslav ally to accept a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow's proposals so far have been based on first halting the  
airstrikes and then resuming negotiations. NATO insists the 
airstrikes will continue until Yugoslav forces pull out of Kosovo 
and meet other demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt that any agreement can be reached while NATO continues  
its airstrikes against Yugoslavia,'' Chernomyrdin said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin said he was confident that Chernomyrdin  
could use his ties with Milosevic to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chernomyrdin knows Milosevic well and can talk with him like  
no one else,'' Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has tended to side with Milosevic in his dispute with  
NATO. At the same time, it has been critical of Milosevic's 
``ethnic cleansing'' campaign against Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is studying sending additional humanitarian aid to  
Yugoslavia, possibly by road via Romania and also by air, Emergency 
Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said after talks with Yeltsin.

<HEADLINE> Rojohn Wins 1 Meter Diving National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Michelle Rojohn on Thursday held off  
Rachelle Smith and Erica Sorgi in the women's 1-meter event to win 
the first final of the U.S. Spring National Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first national victory for Rojohn, whose highest  
previous finish was second in the 1997 Spring Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I was hungry. I think there's more pressure if you had  
won before and everybody is viewing you as a favorite,'' Rojohn 
said. ``It's great to be an underdog. I surprised myself with the 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rojohn earned a spot on the national team, joining Smith, Sorgi  
and Jenny Lingamfelter. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Keim placed first in the quarterfinals and semifinals, but  
finished fifth, one spot shy of a national team berth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's platform semifinals, Mark Ruiz distanced himself  
from the competition, following up a top qualifying finish in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz, diving before his home crowd, was awarded the first  
perfect 10 score of the competition in the quarters, then followed 
with another in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my best event. I treat the preliminaries like a  
practice round, so I just went out and relaxed and did my thing,'' 
Ruiz said. ``It did surprise me that I ended up so far ahead, but 
the overall goal was to get into the finals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Dumais qualified second, more than 36 points behind  
Ruiz's 659.07. Troy Dumais qualified fourth, just behind David 
Pichler, who placed first in the 3-meter preliminaries.

<HEADLINE> Target Plans 35 New Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Target Stores will open 35 new stores in 18  
states in October, boosting its total number of stores to 916, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the new stores will be in Pennsylvania. Only one of the  
new stores will be in Minnesota, Target's home state. That will be 
in Hutchinson. Two will open in Wisconsin, in Hudson and Grafton. 
</P>
<P>
	With the opening of the new stores on Oct. 10, the upscale  
discount retailer will have 916 stores in 44 states. Last year, 
Target added 59 new stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Target is the largest division and the fastest-growing arm of  
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., which reported $31 billion 
in revenues last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Wisconsin, Target will open two new stores Oct.  
10 in Florida (Fort Lauderdale, Orlando), Virginia (Richmond, 
Winchester), North Carolina (Greensboro, Jacksonville), New 
Hampshire (Concord, Nashua), New York (Greece, Penfield), Georgia 
(Buford, Newnan), Ohio (Elyria, Polaris), Arizona (Gilbert, 
Goodyear) and California (Irvine, Walnut Creek). 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Minnesota, six states will get one new store: New  
Jersey (Bridgewater), Maryland (Salisbury), Indiana (Indianapolis), 
Missouri (O'Fallon), Montana (Bozeman) and Nevada (Carson City). 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the Pennsylvania stores will be in the Pittsburgh area  
(Greensburg, McCandless, Monroeville, North Fayette, Washington); 
two in the Philadelphia area (Warrington, Montgomeryville) and one 
in York.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Delays Web Marijuana Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Concerns about free speech have  
persuaded a state senator to delay action on a bill that restricts 
using the Internet to transmit information about marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation makes it a misdemeanor to use the Internet to  
discuss marijuana or other controlled substances ``knowing that the 
information will be used in furtherance of illegal activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But an anti-crime group and a pro-marijuana group both  
criticized the bill as an intrusion on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate sponsor, Republican Duane Noland of Blue Mound, said  
the measure is meant to apply only to people with criminal motives. 
But he acknowledged concerns about ``the vagueness of some 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to do a little work on my bill -- which might be a  
polite way to say I'm not certain about the future of it,'' Noland 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois House has approved the measure 114-0, and it awaits  
action in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The private anti-crime group Illinois State Crime Commission  
fears the bill could be used to interfere with legitimate efforts 
to provide information about drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like gray areas when it comes to the First Amendment  
because I don't want to be the first test case,'' said Jerry 
Elsner, the commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	What if an ill person were considering smoking marijuana to  
relieve pain, he asked -- would a group break the law by providing 
information about the drug's potential medical benefits? 
</P>
<P>
	Or what if a drug-awareness group listed the latest trends in  
drug use as a service to parents and police? Would the group be 
prosecuted if a teen-ager got the idea to experiment? 
</P>
<P>
	The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or  
NORML, also criticized the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need for this bill,'' said Paul Armentano, the  
group's director of publications. ``It seems blatantly 
unconstitutional. It seems impossible to enforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is HB792.

<HEADLINE> Huntsman Now the Chemical King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Huntsman Corp. became the largest private  
chemical company in the world Thursday with its $2.8 billion 
purchase of four chemical businesses from Imperial Chemical 
Industries of London. 
</P>
<P>
	The family-owned company, which Jon Huntsman founded in Salt  
Lake 1982, nearly doubles its revenue with the acquisition from the 
struggling British company. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman expects revenue to grow from $4 billion to $7.5 billion  
per year. The deal gives the Huntsman 7,000 more employees, 
bringing the total to 16,000, and a presence in 34 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman will buy ICI's polyurethanes, titanium dioxide,  
aromatics and petrochemical businesses, and has exclusive rights to 
the future purchase of ICI's $800 million acrylics business. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal satisfies one of the Huntsman's long-held goals: to  
build as big a petrochemical empire as possible so he can give it 
away to charity. Listed third among Huntsman's corporate spending 
priorities is: ``Give relief to human suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman, 61, is a philanthropist who gave $100 million to  
create a cancer institute at the University of Utah and $40 million 
to his alma mater, Wharton Business School, last year. He has 
survived lip and prostate cancer this decade and lost both parents 
to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman, a native of Idaho who is perhaps best-known for having  
developed stryrofoam hamburger holders in the 1970s, has built his 
company by buying plastics and petrochemical companies that are 
struggling during down cycles. 
</P>
<P>
	That's also the case with ICI, which had revenues of $15 billion  
in 1998 but has struggled lately in the face of a slipping 
chemicals market. The company had $6.8 billion in debt, but the 
deal with Huntsman knocks that down to $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with trouble, ICI made plans to restructure and move into  
special chemicals -- which stalled last year, when three major deals 
fell through because agreements could not be reached with the 
Federal Trade Commission. ICI had tried to sell its titanium 
dioxide business to DuPont and NL Industries for $1 billion, and 
its Crosfield unit to W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. for $455 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the past three weeks, ICI has managed to sell its  
German-based equipment specialty company to PPG Industries of 
Pittsburgh and its Chase &AMP; Hunt supply enterprise to a management 
buyout team backed by Close Investment Management Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	ICI's U.S.-listed shares rose $1.12 per share to $42.18 on the  
New York Stock Exchange Thursday afternoon after rising 6 percent 
the day before on the rumor of the impending sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``The businesses which we are selling have leading market  
positions, good management and a strong record of achievement,'' 
said ICI Chief Executive Charles Miller Smith. ``We couldn't be 
more confident about this transaction and strongly believe the 
customers and employees will prosper under Huntsman ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will also be Huntsman's first foray into polyurethane, which  
is used for building insulation, furniture cushioning, carpet 
backing and bedding, and titanium dioxide, a white pigment used to 
make paint, paper and plastics. ICI's titanium dioxide business has 
about a 14 percent share of the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Huntsman will own 70 percent of a new company, Huntsman ICI  
Holdings, being set up to complete the acquisitions. ICI will own 
30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Trade  
Commission, but no problems are foreseen and it is expected to be 
completed this summer, said Huntsman spokesman Don Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale also gives Huntsman ICI's position in global joint  
ventures in Japan, South Africa and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Huntsman is headquartered in Salt Lake, it has no  
production facilities here. Six of Huntsman's sons and three 
sons-in-law all work for the company.
