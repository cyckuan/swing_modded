<HEADLINE> BMW Threat to Close Rover Longbridge Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) - BMW, the owner of Rover, is
considering closing the Longbridge plant in Birmingham, unless
workers there consider a radical reform of their working
practices.
</P>
<P>
The blunt warning came from Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of
BMW, the German carmaker which acquired Rover in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the British International Motor Show in Birmingham
Tuesday, Pischetsrieder said a sweeping review of Rover's cost
structure was under way.
</P>
<P>
"Options under investigation include further job cuts, the
reduction of employment costs and increased working flexibility,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder complained that there was a 30 percent
productivity gap between Longbridge and BMW's German plants,
mainly because of exchange rates and pay levels.
</P>
<P>
He ordered an all-out drive to bridge the productivity gap,
saying that "short term actions are required for the long-term
future for Rover Group".
</P>
<P>
Pischetsrieder confirmed that he had briefed British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, and the Secretary for Trade and Industry,
Peter Mandelson, on the plight of the Longbridge plant and was
seeking a response by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
His statement overshadowed what should have been Rover's big
day at the Motor Show, with the launch of its first all-new model
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair gave his backing at the same day to BMW's
efforts to make the company profitable, hoping that the new 75
model would be a "world-beater".

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Faces Food Crisis: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho is facing
shortage of food with more than 35,000 children living in
communities going hungry unless they are supplied with food soon,
a United Nations official said in Maseru Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Department of Education has appealed to the U.N.
for emergency food supplies for the most vulnerable children,
South African Press Association quoted U.N. official Peter Lassig
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lassig, representative of the U.N. World Food Program (WFP),
said that food aid cover was requested to cover a period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said earlier it would mobilize international donors to
alleviate Lesotho's food woes which were resulted from political
crisis in the mountain kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties claimed since August that the May
23 general election was rigged in favor of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy. In mid-September, social unrest and
political turmoil, including looting and arson, occurred in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the military intervention by South Africa and
Botswana, the situation in Lesotho has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Last week France said it would provide Lesotho with emergency
food aid worth 300,000 Francs (about 56,000 U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Schroeder Agree on Moscow Summit in Mid-November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and German chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday agreed
to meet in Moscow on November 16-17, the presidential press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a telephone conversation
between the two, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Yeltsin and Schroeder discussed a
number of issues concerning bilateral cooperation and interaction
with international financial organizations, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
denied reports that Yeltsin's health was worsening.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely wrong," Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Yeltsin had had a planned medical examination
at Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest bout of rumors surrounding Yeltsin's health came
after his visit to central Asia earlier this month, when a cold
and subsequent bronchitis forced him to cut short his trip to
Kazakhstan by one day.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks in 1996 in the wake of the
June 16 presidential election. He also had quintuple heart bypass
surgery in November that year.

<HEADLINE> Euro Central Bank Predicts Downward Rate Move in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
has indicated that countries adopting the single European currency
euro is set to reduce their interest rates to a level similar to
that of Germany ahead of the euro debut in January.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Domingo Solans, a member of the ECB director board,
said Tuesday evening that Germany's current short-term rate of 3.3
percent has been viewed as the target for the required convergence
of interest rates in the euro zone ahead of the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the international club of economic journalists in
Frankfurt, Solans also noted that it was up to the national
central banks of the countries adopting the euro to decide whether
to make a one-time big cut or rather to take a gradual approach to
bring their interest rates to a same low level until the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The current average lending rate across the 11 countries in the
euro zone is about 3.8 percent, with a gap of up to three
percentage points between the highest and lowest rates.
</P>
<P>
With the ECB now indicating at a downward rate convergence,
money traders in Frankfurt said that they did not expect the
German central bank, the Bundesbank, to still cut the country's
interest rates as the U.S. Federal Reserve did recently.
</P>
<P>
Germany's incoming government to be formed by the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens has been calling for a rate
cut in order to spur economic growth and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, however, said recently
that the interest rate convergence in the euro zone would be
equivalent to a rate reduction for the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Solans on Tuesday also said that the ECB will adopt a
stability-oriented monetary policy similar as that of the German
Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
To defend price stability, the ECB would monitor the amount of
money supply combined with a secret inflation target.

<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said Wednesday afternoon that U.S. President Bill
Clinton should be judged politically, not according to his
private life.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the comment at the press conference at State
House here when asked about Clinton's alleged affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"Our assessment of Clinton is political, not private,"
Museveni told reporters, adding, "when he bombed Sudan, we are
very happy."
</P>
<P>
Europe and America have different cultures with Africans, so
it is quite difficult to judge by our cultural and ethical
standards, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, he also answered questions on
Uganda's attitude to the nine-week-long Congo (K) conflict,
security in the country and local economy.

<HEADLINE> Panel Set up for Nigerian Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
up a ministerial team to ensure timely completion of the railway
rehabilitation project undertaken by China Civil Engineering
Construction Company (CCECC).
</P>
<P>
The 3,505-kilometer railway rehabilitation project which was
scheduled to be completed last September was delayed due to the
unavailability of the track materials including steel rails,
fittings, screws and turnout.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian paper said Wednesday that the Nigerian government
was uncomfortable with the delay which was believed to be caused
by senior ministry officials who have allegedly politicized the
project.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that while the Nigerian Finance Ministry
wanted the supply contract awarded to competent firms, senior
officials in Transport Ministry had allegedly frustrated such
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Transport Minister Rear Admiral Festus Porbeni put
the blame in the execution of the project on Nigerian contractors
who he stated failed to perform when he visited Lagos last month.
</P>
<P>
Porbeni said that he had ordered the contractors to perform or
get their contracts revoked, adding that he had given an October
ending deadline to supply materials.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Nigerian capital Abuja told the paper that the
government decided to set up the team to ensure that the right
materials are bought for the rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that members of the team had traveled with the
contractors to Vienna in Austria for the purpose of evaluating
the materials being purchased.
</P>
<P>
CCECC Deputy General Manager Chen Xiaoxing was quoted as
saying that "at the moment, we are almost doing nothing because
the materials are not available."
</P>
<P>
Chen added that the firm's job has almost ground to a halt
over the non-availability of the track materials.
</P>
<P>
The contract for the rehabilitation of the railway lines which
in the last two decades has witnessed tremendous decadence was
signed in December 1995 at a cost of 528 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contract profile includes reduction of gradient covering a
distance of 80 kilometers, elimination of curves covering a total
of 380 kilometers, and maintenance of tracks by reballasting,
leveling and tampering to cover 3,233 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The contract also covers the rehabilitation of 50 locomotives,
150 coaches, 400 wagons, 100 guard vans, design and survey works,
and man-power training.

<HEADLINE> Israel Threatens to Leave Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel Wednesday threatened
to walk out of a Middle East summit in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, where the summit runs into a seventh day.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the U.S. mediators had retreated from previous
understandings, the Palestinians were avoiding clear commitments,
a senior Israeli official said, "There is a serious crisis. The
Israeli delegation is threatening to leave."
</P>
<P>
Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, also suddenly talked tough about the Wye Plantation
negotiations. "The Palestinians are acting in a zigzag."
</P>
<P>
"Without a specific guarantee to change the (Palestine
National) Charter... there can be no agreement. And likewise with
the extradition of terrorists," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side said they and the Israelis had
moved closer to a deal on land and security, reaching agreement on
many details of a complicated package.
</P>
<P>
In response to Israel's threat to withdraw from the talks, a
senior Palestinian official said it would not be in the interests
of Israel to leave the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have no information of any crisis. If they want to leave
now, it would look bad for them and we are not in trouble," the
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States had no immediate comment but a spokesman for
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has spent five of the last six
days nursing the talks along, earlier dismissed media reports that
full agreement was imminent.
</P>
<P>
"I would dissuade you from the sense that there is some deal on
the table," said spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said that some progress has been achieved in the
talks on Tuesday and leaders are expected to sign an agreement on
Thursday at the White House.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Elaborates Stance on Congo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni
elaborated Uganda's stance on the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Wednesday, defending its military
presence in the eastern part of Africa's third largest state.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at the State House Nakasero here
Wednesday evening, Museveni said Ugandan troops are deployed in
eastern Congo (K) because of the uncertainty of the situation
there.
</P>
<P>
They are mainly to defend the national interests from there
where rebels fighting the Ugandan government have bases, said the
Ugandan president.
</P>
<P>
The deployments are a precautionary measure the country has
taken so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Ugandan army there is involved in fighting
in the war-torn country, Museveni said that they are not involved
in major fightings there.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had advised Congolese President Laurent
Kabila to have a wide political base in his country, but the
latter turned a deaf ear to his suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Building a cadre is very important to a country, he noted, and
the armed uprising againore troops there than two battalions as reported by
some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government does not have plans to send
reinforcements there, Museveni said, adding that Uganda will pull
out its troops as soon as the region works out a lasting solution
to the conflict in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused of backing the rebellion in the DRC
since its eruption on August 2, but Museveni denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 8,000 foreign troops including
Zimbabweans, Angolans, Chadians and Namibians are fighting
alongside Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
Museveni had just exchanged views with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa Sunday before
going on to Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day working visit to South Africa, Museveni
held day-long confidential talks with his South African
counterpart Nelson Mandela on how to remove the Congo crisis.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Russia Start Talks on Delayed Payment of Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
mission and ranking officials from Russia's key economic
ministries started talks here Wednesday on the next tranche of IMF
loans.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda in the talks between the IMF mission and
officials of Russia's Finance Ministry, the Economics Ministry and
the State Tax Service would be an overdue payment of 4.3 billion
U.S. dollars out of the Fund's bailout package, originally
scheduled for September, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
IMF experts would study Russia's budgets for the fourth quarter
of this year and for next year, Interfax quoted a source close to
the talks as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to discuss with the Russian officials
structural reforms concerning the social sphere, monopolies in
natural resources and reform of the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
As the IMF sees it inevitable that the Russian central bank
would print "a certain amount" of money to finance the budget
directly, the IMF would now try to keep down the amount of money
printed, Interfax quoted a Russian expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Tuesday that the
government will not print more than 20 billion rubles in the
fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission is expected to stay in Moscow until the middle
of next week. On Thursday the IMF experts will meet with Russian
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday, Zadornov told the local Ekho Moskvy radio that
Moscow expects to receive part of the 4.3 billion dollar tranche
from the IMF before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"This is obvious, as time has run out," Zadornov said, noting
that Russia would have to 17.5 billion dollars on its foreign
debts next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli university students
held demonstrations in the major cities on Wednesday to protest
against high tuition fees, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal city of Tel Aviv, the students blocked a highway
and also scuffled with police. Thirty-one demonstrators were
arrested during the clash.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, police dispelled a group of demonstrating
students to keep the major roads from being blocked. No clash was
reported.
</P>
<P>
The students are demanding that tuition fees, currently about
9,500 shekels (about 2,200 U.S. dollars) a year, be reduced by
half.
</P>
<P>
They also threatened to launch a nation-wide school boycott on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Ministry has turned down the demand, noting
that the tuition level was set by a joint commission established
after a student strike in 1996, which also included student
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Education Minister Yitzhak Levy is scheduled
to meet students' leaders later on Wednesday in an effort to forge
an agreement to prevent the strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Vadim Gustov on Wednesday denied allegations that Moscow
was behind Monday's military rebellion in western Georgia.
</P>
<P>
"It's a search for nonexistent enemies," Gustov said of the
allegations by some Georgian politicians. "Why should Russia need
this? Russia has a lot of problems of its own."
</P>
<P>
Georgian officials, including President Eduard Shevardnadze,
have said Russia might have played a role in the rebellion, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gustov, on a visit to Vladimir, a city 176 kilometers southeast
of Moscow, said he plans to visit Georgia soon.
</P>
<P>
"We must live like good neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Early Monday morning about 200 Georgian servicemen led by Akaki
Eliava, a supporter of former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, took
10-13 tanks and armored vehicles from the Senaki motorized
infantry brigade in an anti-government mutiny.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, most of the rebels, and the seized tanks and
armored vehicles, have returned to the Senaki base and the Defense
Ministry regained full control over the the Senaki motorized
infantry brigade, although Eliava and and some supporters remain
hiding in the forests.
</P>
<P>
One government soldier was killed and two others wounded in the
mutiny.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Regional leaders held a
one-day summit in Harare Wednesday to discuss the crisis in
Democratic Congo, a report of the Pan-African News Agency (PANA)
from the Zibabwean capital said.
</P>
<P>
Embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila did not appear at
the meeting which is attended by Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos, Namibian President Sam Nujoma and Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe, said PANA.
</P>
<P>
But Kabila has sent his senior minister Victor Mpoyo to
represent him, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo was quoted as saying at the Harare International Airport
upon arriving that he is representing Kabila because the
president is not feeling well.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the summit disclosed that Angolan President
Dos Santos had pressed for the meeting after the Tutsi-led rebels
took over the strategic town of Kindu in east Congo (K) recently.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe have deployed troops in Congo to
help President Kabila crush the rebellion which started in early
August.
</P>
<P>
The summit came ahead of a high-level meeting of ministers of
defense and foreign affairs of the 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) scheduled to take place in Zambian
capital Lusaka next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to bring the two-month-old Congo
crisis a step closer to a peaceful solution.

TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal

</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remark in a meeting with visiting
U.N. Secretary General's special envoy for Afghan affairs Lakhdar
Brahimi, who arrived here on Tuesday on the mission to defuse the
tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has done its utmost for the realization of the
international community's resolve and "we hope that the current
trend will lead to the desired results."
</P>
<P>
Following the tension between Iran and the Taliban triggered

Afghanistan in August, the U.N. Security Council passed the
resolution 1193, condemning the killing of Iranian diplomats and

<P>
Representatives from six neighbors of Afghanistan as well as
Russia and the United States also held a so-called "6+2" meeting
on Afghanistan in New York last month. The meeting called for
U.N. efforts to defuse the tension between Iran and Afghanistan
and to investigate the killing of Iranian diplomats.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece to Conduct Joint War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A joint search and rescue
operation by Cyprus' National Guard and Greek Armed Forces will be
conducted on Friday as part of Cyprus' on-going military exercises.
</P>
<P>
An official statement said here Wednesday that the operation to
be held some 30 nautical miles west of the western coastal town of
Paphos will be participated by the Greek Air Force and Navy units
as well as Cyprus' Search and Rescue Center, the air and navy
rescue units of the National Guard, the police and the Port Police.
</P>
<P>
The operation is aimed at training the forces involved in
real-life conditions within the Nicosia Flight Information
Region, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus began Tuesday the six-day military exercises, code-named
"Nikiforos '98," with the participation of the Greek Armed Forces
amid tensions on this Eastern Mediterranean island following the
Cypriot government's decision to buy Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will strike the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that at the same time, one frigate, one
destroyer, a submarine and two torpedo boats of the Greek Navy
will dock at Limassol and Larnaca ports on south and southeast
coast of the island. The warships will be open to the public over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises will be concluded with a parade of
the participating units in Larnaca on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Greece and Cyprus signed a joint defense
pact in November 1993, under which Greece will provide Cyprus with
air, sea and land cover in case of a fresh Turkish offensive
against Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to protect
the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only
by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Economy Running Well: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said here Wednesday that Uganda's economy is running
well and it is growing at a very high rate.
</P>
<P>
Commented on the economy at a press conference Wednesday
evening, the president said road conditions in Uganda's
infrastructure have improved because 39 of the 45 districts have
road maintenance units.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the weakening Ugandan Shilling against the
U.S. Dollar, Museveni said that this is maybe due to the fact
there are fewer Dollars in the market.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the depreciation of Shilling against the
Dollar is somewhat good to Uganda's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Strong Shilling is more dangerous to the economy than the
weak Shilling. Weak Shilling is not bad for the economy at all.
It encourages exports and discourages imports," the president
said confidently.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ugandan Shilling is in a free fall against the
Dollar. The exchange rate dropped from 1,200 Shillings to one
Dollar to the present 1,350 to one and it continues falling.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts here attribute the depreciation to the shrinking
coffee exports and the volatile situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Many investors have withdrawn their money out of the country
because of Ugnada's alleged involvement in the 11-week-long
conflict in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here Wednesday that his government is determined to
promote exports in order to reshape the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on national drive to promote exports,
Khatami said the promotion of exports is one of the pivotal
policies of the government in shaping the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that preparing the ground for promoting exports would
remain one of the top priorities of his administration, the
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation and consensus of all strata of people are a
prerequisite for economic order and realization of such a
sublime objective demands national determination, the Iranian
president said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the country's economy is suffering from both
structural and infrastructural problems and it is a challenge for
the government to pinpoint the weaknesses and remove them.
</P>
<P>
The main problem for Iran's economy is its dependence on oil,
Khatami said, adding that such a divine valuable asset like oil
belongs to the generations to come and thus should be used
wisely.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of international trade as means
to revitalize national economy and a guarantor to a broad-based
national development, calling for a basic change in the country's
export-import regulations.
</P>
<P>
If sound planning is made for promotion of exports, it will be
turned into a dynamic, effective trend, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma on
Wednesday issued a statement denouncing Western pressure on
Moscow's cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the lower house of parliament described as
"illegal and inadmissible" attempts by third nations "to interfere
in mutually advantageous cooperation between Russia and Iran in
the economic, scientific-technical, and other fields," the
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The legislators called for stronger bilateral relations in the
political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is intended to "strengthen peace and security,
enhance the non-proliferation regime, develop equal interaction
between our states, and create favorable conditions for their
economic growth on the basis of respect for sovereignty and
prevention of hegemony and any forms of diktat in the
international arena, and eradication of all forms of international
terro[ism," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the document also called for stronger cooperation
with other Caspian nations in determining the legal status of the
Caspian Sea and preventing what it called "the predatory
plundering of its resources."
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers also urged the government to use Russian-Iranian
military cooperation more extensively in the interests of Russian
manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army Chief Meets U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Angola will send a military
delegation to the United States, Angolan Chief of the General
Staff Joao de Matos said here Wednesday after meeting with the
U.S. ambassador to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
De Matos said he discussed with Ambassador Donald Stembeirg on
the military cooperation between the two countries and the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said the meeting was significant and that
it will surely push forward the bilateral cooperation in the
military field.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the faltering peace process in the southern
African country, the army chief noted that he could smell war
coming in the war.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Angolan government is seeking for a final
solution to the prolonged crisis, assuring that his troops will
fulfill their duty so as to "bring peace to Angola again."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador disclosed that he met with President Jonas
Savimbi of the opposition National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) on September 12, urging the UNITA to implement
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process has fallen into stalemate because
the UNITA refused to demilitarize all of its troops and surrender
major areas formerly controlled by it into the hands of the
government.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Angolan government changed its stance,
cutting off links with the UNITA led by Savimbi. It declared that
it only recognizes the breakaway UNITA Renovation Committee as
the sole legal dialogist in the peace process, thus bringing the
United Nations mediation to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The widening crisis in the Great Lates region was also on top
of the talks between the Angolan army chief and the U.S.
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said the international community is concerned
over the tension in southern Africa, hoping that the warring
sides can sit down at the table to negotiate for a peaceful end
to the conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Have Closer Ties with Lebanon: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iranian Minister of
Housing and Urban Development Ali Abdolalizadeh Wednesday
expressed hope that his country will establish closer ties with
Lebanon, especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
Abdolalizadeh said that under Hrawi's nine-year tenure, the ties
between the two countries have witnessed great improvement,
citing Lebanon's support for Iran over the killing of eight
Iranian diplomats and a reporter by Afghan Taliban militia in
August.
</P>
<P>
Last month, when meeting with visiting Iranian Minister of
Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani, Hrawi strongly
condemned Taliban's behavior, saying it was a manoeuvre aimed at
averting Iran's attention from the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdolalizadeh stressed that Iran intended to boost cooperation
with Lebanon, particularly in the economic and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
A series of agreements will be signed between the two
countries on Thursday, he said, adding that they include
agreements to avoid double taxation and open direct flight between
Beirut and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister disclosed that officials from both
countries are also looking into Iran's proposal to help in the
rehabilitation of oil refinery in northern Lebanon's Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The refinery, the largest one in the country, stopped operating
in 1993 due to shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Abdolalizadeh, accompanied by a large high-level Iranian
economic delegation, arrived here on Tuesday. He has held talks
with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and other senior
officials on bilateral ties and regional affairs.

ADDIS ABABA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
resident coordinator's office held a model assembly meeting here
Wednesday afternoon on poverty eradication for hundreds of
Ethiopian secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized here for the U.N. celebrations on
the theme of poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Per Engebak, resident representative of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), said the model assembly
is important to young people who represent the very future of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the topic of poverty eradication discussed at the
model assembly is very important because over 40 percent of
inhabitants in sub-Saharan Africa live below the poverty line of
one Dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Students discussed "poverty reduction through social
perspectives" and "increasing least-developed country
self-sufficiency and decreasing foreign aid in order to eradicate
poverty in Africa". The model assembly lasted two hours.
</P>
<P>
After the model assembly, U.N. resident coordinator Sam Nyambi
presented 38 computers to 38 secondary schools in Addis Ababa on

Wednesday 24,548 metric tons of wheat has arrived at the port of
Djibouti and is now being off loaded for transport to Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Marine Corps General
Anthony Zinni, the commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf, Wednesday
criticized a plan approved by the U.S. Congress to help Iraqi
opposition topple President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he saw no unified, viable opposition to Saddam in
Iraq, Zinni warned that Saddam's abrupt overthrow under such
conditions could split Iraq and destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these questions have been thought through or
answered. If they have, no one's asked me about it," he told a
group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest with you, I don't see the parts that make it
sensible," he said. "I think a weakened, fragmented, chaotic Iraq
-- which could happen if this isn't done carefully -- is more
dangerous in the long run than a contained Saddam is now."
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Congress voted to permit the Clinton
administration to spend 97 million U.S. dollars on military aid
for opposition groups in Iraq with the goal of removing him from
power.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding "Iraq Liberation Act of 1998" does not require
the administration to change the U.S. policy of containment of
Iraq. It also allows two million U.S. dollars in funding to
opposition groups for radio and television broadcasts into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The danger here is that I don't see a lot of viability in the
opposition groups. I see the potential for Kurds going one way,
Shiites going another way, the center going some way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The general worried that the U.S. move could create internal
turmoil in there that could lead to an Afghanistan-like situation
in the end.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Massive Turnout in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Wednesday called for a massive turnout of the people
on Friday to elect the third Experts Assembly, which has the right
to determine the country's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Iranians, Khamenei said that the
people's massive turnout in the election would "carry a special
weight in disappointing the enemies of the Islamic Republic" of
Iran, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that "over the past year, the enemies have been trying
to discourage people's active presence at the polls so as to make
the Experts Assembly an institution without popular support."
</P>
<P>
A suitable reaction for the nation is to turn out in huge
numbers at the polls, which will also be a display of national
maturity and dynamism, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the election atmosphere prevailing in the country, the
Iranian leader said that beyond any doubts, the people, by their
huge turnout at the Experts Assembly polls, would inject a new life
into the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian constitution, the 86-seat Experts
Assembly is responsible for determining the country's supreme
leader and to review his performances. It also has the right to
dismiss the leader if he fails to carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
Some left-wing factions have gradually cooled on the election
of the Experts Assembly after some of their prominent candidates
were rejected by the conservative-dominated Guardians Council,
which is empowered to screen the qualifications of candidates for
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of left-wing candidates also withdrew from the
election campaigns in a protest to the Guardians Council's
screening policy, while several leading left-wing groups refused
to announce their lists of candidates.

<HEADLINE> IMF Expresses Welcome for U.S. New Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said Wednesday a decision by U.S. Congress to approve
17.9 billion U.S. dollars in new financing for the institution is
"essential and most welcome."
</P>
<P>
Shailendra Anjaria, the IMF Director of External Relations,
said in a statement that the other 181 IMF members are now voting
to ratify an increase in funding quotas that will flow from the
release of funds by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution will help increase IMF resources by 90
billion dollars when other nations make their shares.
</P>
<P>
"The scene is now set for the full ratification of the IMF's
quota increase by the membership and for the IMF to continue to
transform itself in a way that ensures its continuing relevance to
the... globalized world economy," Anjaria said.
</P>
<P>
As for some conditions attached by the U.S. Congress, the IMF
is "still studying the details," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Initial impressions and reports suggest that many of the
ideas, particularly in the areas of greater transparency of the
IMF and the terms of IMF lending, are in accord with the broad
directions being taken by the IMF membership," Anjaria said.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF's executive board will now consider ways the
"reforms will be implemented" and how "to further improve the
effectiveness of the IMF."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the U.S. conditions on the IMF financing would also
limit the length of certain loans, require higher interest rates
and open the often-secretive organization to more public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Approval by at least 85 percent of the membership is required,
with the U.S. holding 17 percent of all voting rights.

<HEADLINE> Starr Trying to Restore Charges against Clinton's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr suggested Wednesday he is still investigating Webster
Hubbell for obstruction of justice as he asked a federal appeals
court to revive tax-evasion charges against the former
presidential confidant.
</P>
<P>
Starr told the court a judge erred earlier this year when he
dismissed the tax charges against Hubbell, his wife, accountant
and tax lawyer. The judge ruled that the prosecutor had exceeded
his authority in bringing the charges.
</P>
<P>
Starr had been investigating whether more than 700,000 dollars
in payments Hubbell received from President Bill Clinton's
supporters in 1994 was designed to buy his silence in the
Whitewater investigation. Instead, Hubbell was charged with
failing to pay taxes on some of that money.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell, who resigned the No. 3 Justice Department job in 1994
and later pleaded guilty to defrauding the Arkansas law firm where
he and Mrs. Clinton worked, quietly observed Wednesday's arguments
from a seat in the courtroom. His wife, Suzy, an Interior
Department employee, sat next to him.
</P>
<P>
When Judge David Tatel asked why Hubbell was charged with tax
violations and not obstruction, Starr suggested the latter issue
remained under investigation.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the court should indulge the presumption there
is no evidence of obstruction," Starr said. He then offered to
secretly show the judges some of the grand jury evidence regarding
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
That drew an immediate objection from the defense lawyers.
Attorney Chris Todd, who represents Hubbell's accountant, told the
appeals court that "to put in this case the specter (of an)
ongoing obstruction investigation" would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
Hubbell's lawyer, John Nields, reiterated his arguments that
the prosecution of client was too far from Starr's original
mandate to prosecute Hubbell on charges of bilking his law firm
and clients.
</P>
<P>
Making his appeal, Starr argued in court documents that the
money Hubbell received from Clinton supporters may be related to
his "noncooperation with respect to Whitewater and Madison-related
matters."
</P>
<P>
Whitewater was the Clintons' Arkansas real estate investment
with Jim and Susan McDougal, the owners of the failed Madison
Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan that was the original focus of Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge James Robertson ruled on July 1 that Starr
should have gotten Attorney General Janet Reno's approval before
prosecuting Hubbell. In addition, he ruled that the prosecutor's
use of Hubbell's financial records violated the defendant's Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
Starr "investigated Mr. Hubbell's fees to determine whether
they were paid to influence his testimony," Hubbell's lawyers said
in court papers. "Finding nothing," the attorneys wrote, the
prosecutor "embarked on a tax investigation straying far beyond
those fees."
</P>
<P>
Starr did not charge Hubbell with obstruction, but rather
brought a 10-count conspiracy indictment alleging an attempt to
"evade and defeat the payment of a large part of the income tax
due" by the Hubbells in 1989-1992 and 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said Starr should have gone to Reno to
seek an expansion of Starr's investigation. The department opposed
Hubbell on the Fifth Amendment issue, saying Starr was entitled to
use Hubbell's financial papers to prosecute him.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The functions and role
of the United Nations Security Council should be strengthened,
China stressed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session of the General Assembly on the the
work of the Security Council, Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang said the
Security Council shoulders major responsibility for the
maintainance of world peace and security in accordance with the
Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Shen said as an important organ of the United Nations, the
Security Council should listen to the views of the vast number of
member states so that its actions would truly reflect the will of
the entire membership of the Organization.
</P>
<P>
Shen said practices over the past year had shown that the
leading role of the Security Council in maintaining world peace
and security was irreplaceable, and it should follow strictly the
stipulations of the Charter and act upon the will of the majority
of member states in carry out its duties so as to retain its
authority.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Has Not Suspended Operation in DRC, Statement Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to an earlier
published news report, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
on Wednesday issued a statement here, saying it is continuing its
relief operations in rebel-held areas of the Democratic Republic
of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"UNICEF has not suspended operations in any area of DRC," the
statement said, "However, it is true that operations in rebel-held
eastern DRC have been severely hampered as a result of widespread
looting and pilferage."
</P>
<P>
"Over 1 million U.S. dollars in transport and communications
equipment have been lost, in additional to medical supplies,
educational equipment and food for children that had been stored
in UNICEF warehouses," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
These losses, combined with lack of staff security and
humanitarian access to people in need, obviously limit efforts by
UNICEF's local staff to go about their vital work, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNICEF programs continue normally in other areas of
the central African country, the statement said, "They are focused
on meeting the health, nutrition, water, sanitation and
educational needs of children and women."
</P>
<P>
In Bascongo, in the southwestern part of the country, 135
health workers have been refurbished and restocked with essential
drugs and medicines thanks to a recent agreement between UNICEF
and the Government of the DRC, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, a development agency working in the country for many
years, began its presence since the outbreak of conflicts in the
eastern part of the country, said an official, reached on the
telephone by Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Sentenced in Angola for Aiding Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Three South Africans have
been sentenced to 23-year jail terms in an Angolan court for
flying missions in support of UNITA rebels, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted sources as saying that the three, Charter Flight
Company owner Johnny Parreira, pilot Peter Bitzker and flight
engineer Mark Geoffries, were not in court Tuesday to hear their
sentences.
</P>
<P>
Co-pilot Antoine Sterrenberg, who is a foreign national with
South African resident status, also received a 23-year sentence
in absentia.
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested with four other South Africans in
January when their aircraft was intercepted by the Angolan Air
Force over Menongue in southeastern Angola.
</P>
<P>
The group included construction workers Rudi Swanepoel and
Willem Steyn, pilot Marnix van der Eecken and Martin Steyn, whose
occupation was not known. The two Steyns are brothers.
</P>
<P>
On January 23, the men apparently departed from South Africa
and landed at Jamba, the venue of a former National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) base.
</P>
<P>
They left shortly afterward and were on their way to either
Andulu or Bailundu, headquarters of UNITA, when they were
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
The eight men were taken to a Luanda prison. After about a
month, Bitzker, Geoffries and Sterrenberg were released and
charges against them were withdrawn. Angolan authorities
apparently later claimed they escaped, and the case was
re-opened.
</P>
<P>
The remaining five men were taken to a Menongue jail about
four months after their arrest, from where Parreira managed to
escape about two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Swanepoel and Willem Steyn were sentenced to two years in prison,
while van der Eecken and Martin Steyn received 10-year prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Parreira's wife claimed her husband had not made contact with
her since his escape. The whereabouts of Bitzker, Geoffries and
Sterrenberg were also not known.
</P>
<P>
No extradition treaty exists between South Africa and Angola.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Save Mideast Summit Out of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday that it expected to give new proposals to Israel and
Palestine Wednesday despite an Israeli threat to walk out of the
Middle East summit in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and expect during the course of the day to be able to
provide a text of what we will think will help the two sides reach
the agreements necessary to put the peace process back on track so
that we can advance the security and situation of both peoples,"
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't happened yet, but we expect to be able to share
such a text with both sides during the course of the day," said
Rubin at the Wye Plantation, which is 110 km east from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to provide all the assistance, the creativity
and the persuasive powers that we can but we can't make decisions
for them. We are not holding people here against their will," said
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't call it a treaty. It's a text designed to put the
current business and the old business of the interim agreement
into effect so that we can move on to the permanent status talks,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton is returning to the
talks for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
Rubin at first declined to be drawn on the Israeli threat to
pull out but later said the U.S. mediators had been asked what
preparations would be needed before departure.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have information at this time that any of the
relevant parties are leaving. I mean, there are logistical
issues," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Israeli delegation threatened to walk
out of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the U.S. mediators had retreated from previous
understandings, the Palestinians were avoiding clear commitments,
a senior Israeli official said, "There is a serious crisis. The
Israeli delegation is threatening to leave."
</P>
<P>
Aviv Bushinsky, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, also suddenly talked tough about the Wye Plantation
negotiations. "The Palestinians are acting in a zigzag."
</P>
<P>
"Without a specific guarantee to change the (Palestine
National) Charter... there can be no agreement. And likewise with
the extradition of terrorists," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side said they and the Israelis had
moved closer to a deal on land and security, reaching agreement on
many details of a complicated package.
</P>
<P>
In response to Israel's threat to withdraw from the talks, a
senior Palestinian official said it would not be in the interests
of Israel to leave the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have no information of any crisis. If they want to leave
now, it would look bad for them and we are not in trouble," the
Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States had no immediate comment but a spokesman for
Clinton, who has spent five of the last six days nursing the talks
along, earlier dismissed media reports that full agreement was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
"I would dissuade you from the sense that there is some deal on
the table," said spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Reports had said that some progress had been achieved in the
talks Tuesday and leaders were expected to sign an agreement
Thursday at the White House.

<HEADLINE> Syria Confirms Deal With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Syria has confirmed its
promise made to Turkey not to let an outlawed Kurdish party
operate on its territory.
</P>
<P>
The promise was contained in a deal signed with Turkey Tuesday,
the official Arab News Agency reported on Wednesday in the first
official confirmation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal has apparently defused the weeks-long tension between
the two countries. Turkey has accused Syria of supporting the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). Damascus denied the charge
while Ankara unleased a threat of war.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day bilateral talks held in Turkey's southern
province of Adana, the Syrians termed the PKK, which is fighting
for independence in southeast Turkey, as an outlawed party, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Syrian officials told their Turkish counterparts that the PKK
is not allowed to operate in Syria or launch actions against
Turkey's security from its territories.
</P>
<P>
But the Syrian side denied there is any PKK military bases or
camps in Syria as claimed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on setting up a joint mechanism to
exchange information via a hot-line between the security officials
of both countries and their respective embassies.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the meeting was held in a satisfactorily
positive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was initiated by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
in his capacity as the chairman of the last Arab summit and
Iranian President Mohammed Khatami in his capacity as the chairman
of Organization of Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Drops in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
dropped slightly to 0.7 percent in September, its lowest since
last December, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The last time a lower annual price increase was recorded was in
May 1962, except the period between February 1994 and January 1995
when the increases were artificially low due to tobacco tax
reduction.
</P>
<P>
Canada's annual price increase has slowed since this Summer,
the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The tiny increase in September was due primarily to higher
fresh fruit prices and hotel rates.
</P>
<P>
But Lower gasoline and computer prices, as well as lower
electricity rates offset those increases, the agency said.

CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Wednesday opened the Economic and Trade Conference of Egypt
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), calling for
activating economic cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between Egypt and the CIS, he said, should
bring about effective measures to overcome obstacles in
transportation and communication, and set up a mechanism to
serve mutual interests and investment protection.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to the cooperation of their private
sectors, chambers of commerce and joint pioneer projects, Moussa
told the opening session of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference is jointly organized by the Egyptian
Fund for Technical Cooperation with CIS, the Islamic Development
Bank and the U.N. Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The participants will pore over obstacles facing investors,
commodities and trade in general between Egypt and the CIS,
according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
A number of Egyptian pharmaceutical firms will hold an
exhibition on medicines on the fringe of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are the ministers of economy and foreign
trade, central banks officials as well as businessmen from Egypt
and the CIS countries.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- White supremacist Joseph
Paul Franklin was convicted Wednesday in Cincinnati of the United
States of murdering two black teen-agers in 1980 as part of a
multistate killing spree aimed at igniting a race war.
</P>
<P>
The Hamilton County Common Pleas Court jury deliberated less
than an hour on the third day of a trial in which the defense
presented no witnesses or closing arguments. Prosecutors relied on
a taped confession that they said showed Franklin had intimate
knowledge of the crime scene, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
He could receive two consecutive life prison terms. Ohio had no
death penalty at the time of the June 8, 1980 shootings of cousins
Darrell Lane, 14, and Dante Evans Brown, 13.
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who had previously been convicted of seven murders,
is awaiting execution in Missouri for the murder of a Jewish man
who was leaving a synagogue.
</P>
<P>
He also has admitted to wounding civil rights leader Vernon
Jordan, who went on to become a leading Washington lawyer, and
Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt, who enraged Franklin by
publishing pictures of interracial couples.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-party Talks Back on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's main political parties
have worked out an agenda here Wednesday for a meeting to be
attended by party presidents, signaling the start of the
inter-party talks.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Michae Sata, co-chairmen
of the inter-party talks and national secretary of the ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD), said the meeting will
be held within a month and the ruling party proposed the summit
be chaired by MMD President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, Sata said political parties are free to meet for
consultations and decide who will chair the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairmen Mainza Chona of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) said at the briefing that Wednesday's
meeting to amend the agenda went on smoothly and there were free
discussion among leaders of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairmen Guy Scott of Lima party said he is happy at
Wednesday's meeting and it is encouraging to see some top MMD and
government officials at the meeting, which indicated the
government is serious with the inter-party talks.
</P>
<P>
Scott expressed his hope that the ruling party will continue
with the political dialog.
</P>
<P>
Early last December, 31 political parties worked out an agenda
at preliminary meetings for the inter-party dialog.
</P>
<P>
However, as the party leaders were preparing to participate in
the dialog, UNIP leader and former president Kenneth Kaunda was
arrested for alleged involvement in the October 28 failed coup.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Kaunda's arrest, many parties announced
their withdrawal from the planned dialog.
</P>
<P>
After his release from under house arrest early last June,
Kaunda called for the resumption of the inter-party dialog.

<HEADLINE> Second Mobile Phone Operator Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Mobile Telephones Network
(MTN), a South African company, came into operation here
Wednesday and became the second national mobile operator in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The coming of MTN ushered in a new era of telecommunications
in Uganda along with Celtel, a British company which came here in
1993.
</P>
<P>
To attract potential subscribers, the newcomer offers much
lower service charge, lower monthly subscription, wider coverage
and better service.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of their business, hundreds of people
thronged the company to apply for mobile service.
</P>
<P>
Allen Muller, the subscriber operations manager, said they
have so much business for the first day that all the staff have
to be engaged.
</P>
<P>
Having more than 90,000 lines open to customers, MTN now has
network coverage extending from greater Kampala through to
Entebbe (45 kms south of Kampala), Jinja (80 kms east of the
capital) and the eastern district of Iganga, to be immediately
followed by coverage in Bombo and Mpigi surrounding the capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, its service will further extend to
more distant districts of the country. Their roll-out strategy is
aimed to cover all major towns and cities and many rural areas in
the country within five years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the Ugandan government has been carrying out an
ambitious reform program of public enterprises. In the
telecommunications sector, two key aspects of reform were used:
privatization and competition.
</P>
<P>
In August 1997, Parliament passed the Uganda Communications
Act which provides the legal framework for the introduction of
competition in the telecommunications sector and later the
privatization of Uganda Telecom Limited.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, the Privatization Unit organized a two-day
Investors Forum. Later, MTN beat all the other four bidders.

UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the Untied Nations should strictly adhere to the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations in dealing with
internal conflicts of countries, China stressed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the General Assembly on the work

Shen said China was not in favor of interference in the
internal affairs of a country in the name of alleviating
humanitarian crisis, or the use of military threat or intervention
with willful invocation of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said China was also opposed to putting all the
problems in the conflict areas on the agenda of the Council, which
did not conform to the principles guiding the division of work
among the various organs of the United Nations, nor did it
facilitate the effective functioning of other organs of U.N.,
especially the General Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Wednesday that it
hopes the Palestinians and Israelis will reach an acceptable and
balanced agreement at their ongoing summit in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Cypriot
counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said his country supports the efforts exerted by the two
sides in a bid to strike a West Bank accord.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have
been holding intensive talks since last Thursday in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
They are reportedly moving closer to overcoming differences
over a U.S. proposal demanding Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab countries to sign a peace treaty with
the Jewish state in March 1979.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides expressed confidence that any progress
in the peace process would reflect favorably on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said his country backs all efforts to find a
settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis, hoping their
current talks would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Egypt and Cyprus signed an agreement on
encouraging and protecting investment and avoiding double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will pave the way for more cemented bilateral
economic cooperation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also praised Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
efforts to defuse the recent Turkish-Syrian tensions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria of supporting Kurdish rebels seeking
independence in southeastern Turkey and recently massed troops
along its border with Syria, sparking fears of a regional armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The tensions have been eased as shuttle diplomacy of Egypt and
some other countries helped Ankara and Damascus reach an agreement
Tuesday under which Syria, admitting Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party a terrorism organization, promises to ban the group
on its territories.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister arrived here Tuesday for a
three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Henney Confirmed as FDA Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- New Mexico cancer specialist
Dr. Jane Henney was confirmed Wednesday as the first woman
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voice vote to approve Henney came a day after
Senator Don Nickles, a Republican and Senate Majority Whip, said
he supported the nomination. Nickles had delayed final action to
dramatize his dislike of past FDA policies.
</P>
<P>
Henney succeeds Dr. David Kessler, who clashed with some
Republicans over his aggressive efforts to stem underage smoking.
Kessler left the post last year to become dean of the Yale
University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
Henney, 51, nominated in June to replace Kessler is vice
president of the University of New Mexico's Health Sciences
Center. She served as Kessler's deputy from 1992 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, foods and cosmetics
that make up 25 percent of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton said in a statement, "The nation now has
an FDA commissioner who is committed to assuring that Americans
have safe food, safe and effective drugs and medical devices and
improved public health."
</P>
<P>
Nickles, in a Tuesday speech on the Senate floor, announced the
lifting of his opposition because he said he had assurances from
Henney and Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Donna Shalala
that the FDA and HHS would not take advocacy positions on
contentious issues such as tobacco and abortion.
</P>
<P>
A 1973 graduate of Indiana University's medical school, she was
a senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) by
1977. She went on to become the NCI's deputy director and, in the
late 1980s, was running the University of Kansas medical school.
</P>
<P>
At New Mexico, Henney supervises a medical school, college of

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches 22 in Texas Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The death toll has risen to
22 Wednesday as flooding across central and southern Texas has
worsened since torrential rains over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
As 60 counties, one-fourth of the state, were flooded, Governor
George W. Bush Wednesday asked President Bill Clinton to declare
20 of the counties disaster areas, freeing up access to aid.
</P>
<P>
Scattered light rain and drizzle were expected across much of
Texas Wednesday amid speculation that the cost of the damage could
reach 400 million U.S. dollars. In Comal County alone, officials
estimated 266 million dollars in home losses and another 27
million dollars for businesses.
</P>
<P>
In Wilson County, along the San Antonio River, homes sustained
an estimated 140 million dollars in damage, with another 7.5
million dollars to public infrastructure. Other counties were
still compiling dollar estimates.
</P>
<P>
Victoria, 160 kilometers south of San Antonio, met the worst
flooding in 60 years. Up to 600 homes had water damage and about
100 people were staying in five shelters.
</P>
<P>
In Cuero, 40 miles to the northwest and upstream,
three-quarters of the town was under water. The Guadalupe River
crested at nearly 15 meters, well over its six-meter flood stage.
At least 2,000 people in the community of 7,000 were homeless.

<HEADLINE> Police to Interrogate Tanzania Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam-based
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court allowed Wednesday a suspect
involved in the bombing of U.S. embassy to be handed back to
police custody for further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the ruling, Principal Resident Magistrate Projestus
Lugazia told the court that the issue of interrogating the
suspect, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, an Egyptian, is to make sure
the prosecution is correct.
</P>
<P>
However, Defense Counsel Abdul Mwengera objected the ruling
said he will file an application of appeal to the High Court.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Leonard Mashaka, the prosecutor and assistant
commissioner of police (ACP), requested the court to have Ahmed
who is at Segerea Remand Prison, sent back to the Central Police
Station for seven days of further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
But his request was objected by Mwengera who said no law can
be found to give power to the court to transfer the accused
person from remand prison back to police custody for
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Eleven people were killed and more than 70 others were
injured in the bomb blast of U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam on

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Economy Growing at High Rate: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said Wednesday evening at a press conference that the
national economy is running well and is growing at a very high
rate.
</P>
<P>
As for infrastructure in the country, the president said road
conditions in the country have improved because 39 of the 45
districts have road maintenance units.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the weakening Ugandan Shilling against U.S.
Dollar, Museveni said this is maybe due to the fact there are
fewer Dollars in the market.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the depreciation of Shilling against the
Dollar is somewhat good to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Strong Shilling is more dangerous to the economy than the
weak Shilling. Weak Shilling is not bad for the economy at all.
It encourages exports and discourages imports," he said
confidently.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Shilling is in a free fall against the Dollar
recently. The exchange rate has dropped from 1200 Shillings to
the present 1350 Shillings to the Dollar and the downfall is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts attribute the depreciation to the shrinking
coffee exports and the volatile situation in the region. Many
investors have withdrawn money from Uganda because of its alleged
involvement in the 11-week-long conflict in Congo (K).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's rural industries
believe that they can reach this year's economic growth target of
18 percent, according to China Information News.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, Chinese township and village
enterprises had 1.4 trillion yuan in added value output, up 15.6
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the next few months, it said, rural industry will fare even
better as the central government plans to inject more funds into
water resources and other infrastructure projects to increase
domestic demand and speed up economic development.
</P>
<P>
The disaster relief measures and reconstruction after the
severe floods in southern and northeastern parts of China in the
summer also mean an increased demand for rural industry, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Rural industry produces 95 percent of the country's bricks and
tile, 40 percent of its cement, and has a sizable share of the
construction, machinery and garment industries.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural ministry, which supervises rural industry,
told the newspaper that rural industry is certain to develop well
in the coming months and reach the annual growth target.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Puts Forward New Tasks for Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Thursday put forward seven measures for the
current government to free itself from being the hostage of
minority politicians and continue to fulfill its work in a good
manner.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen proposed the measures in a lengthy important speech he
made at Chaktomuk Hall to celebrate King Norodom Sihanouk's 76th
birthday, the Independence Day and the 7th anniversary of the
signing of the Paris Peace Accord on Cambodia, which was signed on
October 23, 1991 by 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, although we are still optimistic that the new
government will likely come into being in the near future, in a
sense of (the) responsibility of the current government, I think
that we have wasted a lot of valuable time," Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, he has the historic duty to run the country
till a new government is set up, and it is also for the sake of
the nation and the suffering and hardship of the people.
</P>
<P>
The measures put forward by him include:
</P>
<P>
-- To continue implementing in strict manner the eight-point
security measures defined by him earlier last year;
</P>
<P>
-- The current government fulfills its tasks in a good manner,
and not abandon any tasks while waiting for the new government to
be formed;
</P>
<P>
-- To put forward immediately new measures for combating
corruption and other negative activities which create difficulty
to investors and businessmen, such as kidnapping, drug trafficking
and armed robbery;
</P>
<P>
-- New policy regarding the water issue be implemented in an
urgent manner without delay. The management of forest, which was
the weakest point of the Royal Government, be strengthened in a
strong manner;
</P>
<P>
-- Strong encouragement be made toward the investors and all
businessmen in the country;
</P>
<P>
-- To strengthen the management of budget and fiscal affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- To speed up the reform in the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hun Sen reviewed the achievements made by the
Royal Government in the past seven years but also pointed out the
problems the Cambodian people are still facing now in economy,
social stability, and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen condemned the opposition for using violent illegal
demonstrations in implementing a dangerous plan, such as inciting
uprisings in part of the armed forces, expanding the anarchy to
various places and attempting to kill leaders of the government.
</P>
<P>
On the summit among the country's three major parties, Hun Sen
said that the outstanding problem is that the elected political
parties and the elected parliamentarians have to do the work for
the sake of the people who voted for them.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the results of the summit meeting on September 22,
1998 in Siem Reap under the chairmanship of the King, if these are
strictly respected, there seems no need to hold another summit,"
he said. However, he warned that if going against the spirit of
these results, even though the meeting is held several times, in
any venue, "no results will be achieved."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen expressed his hope that the political parties and the
elected parliamentarians will not create new obstacles but
actively take part in solving the problem for the sake of the
nation and people.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia held the National Assembly election on July 26, this
year. The ruling Cambodia People's Party (CPP) won the most seats,
followed by the FUNCINPEC Party and the Sam Rainsy Party, but the
CPP did not secure enough seats to govern alone under the
Constitution.

TEHRAN, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Publisher of the banned
moderate daily Tous, Mohammad Javad Hessari, and another staff
member Ebrahim Nabavi were released on bail, the official news
agency IRNA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources told IRNA that Hessari and Nabavi were
released on Wednesday, but they did not say why.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the daily's editorial board were arrested last
month on charges of publishing materials against national
security and the state, after Tous was ordered to close down on
September 16.
</P>
<P>
Tous, named after an ancient Iranian city, was accused of
publishing material of defamatory character against the late
spiritual leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomenei.
</P>
<P>
Tous, which strongly supported moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, vowed to fight for the freedom of expression in the
country. This angered the powerful conservatives who dominate the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
One of the four arrested, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, was released
on bail last week in the wake of the petition by his mother to the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Suspends Indonesia's Visa-Free Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
has suspended Indonesia's visa-free status to block hundreds of
asylum-seekers from the country.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Thursday quoted
Immigration Minister Tuariki John Delamere as saying that New
Zealand Government's suspension of Indonesia's visa-free status is
based on the fact that his country has seen a "dramatic increase
in the number of Indonesians seeking asylum in the past six
months."
</P>
<P>
The visa-free system had been set up to encourage tourism, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Delamere noted that the rise in asylum seekers from Indonesia
coincides with deepening economic turmoil in the country.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that more than 300 refugee applications have been
received in the past four months from Indonesian nationals who
have traveled to New Zealand on three-month visitor permits and
then claimed refugee status.
</P>
<P>
"By suspending the visa-free status for Indonesian nationals we
are better placed to manage the risk of people seeking refugee
status once they arrive here," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Immigration Minister announced that an
immigration office would be opened in Jakarta to manage visa
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Television New Zealand Thursday quoted Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Don McKinnon as saying that the visa-free status
is not permanent and the suspension has nothing to do with the
violation of human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive the
largest ever credit worth 273 million U.S. dollars from the World
Bank (WB) for its road rehabilitation maintenance project, an
English daily newspaper here reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement in this regard between the Bangladeshi government
and the International Development Association (IDA), the WB's soft

</P>
<P>
"This largest credit from the World Bank, which is also the
largest credit for Bangladesh to receive from any agency, will
help Bangladesh to build and maintain 1,800 kilometers of roads
throughout the country," WB country director in Bangladesh Pierre
landell-Mills said after signing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The IDA credit is provided at a concessional rate of 0.75
percent which is repayable in over 40 years with a grace period of
10 years.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is estimated at 528.5 million U.S.
dollars, of which IDA will provide 273 million dollars and the
Department for International Development of Britain will provide
22.8 million dollars and the Bangladeshi government 232.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh will further expand and upgrade its most-traveled
roads and bridges, improve highway safety, and revamp its Roads
and Highways Department to make it more efficient with the help of
this IDA credit.
</P>
<P>
The project funds will also be allocated to help repair roads
that were damaged in this year's devastating floods as part of the
World Bank's broad post-flood assistance program.
</P>
<P>
The Roads and Highways Department under the Ministry of
Communications will be responsible for implementing the project.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Oil Companies Report Losses in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Big U.S. oil companies
Wednesday reported a steep decline in their third-quarter earnings
and attributed it to the lowest oil prices since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Occidental, whose third-quarter net income
fell over 75 percent to 38 million dollars from 157 Million the
same period last year, was the worst losser. Its avenues fell to
1.7 billion dollars from last year's 2.0 billion dollars in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Texaco Inc.'s third-quarter earnings fell by more than 56
percent to 215 million dollars from last year's 490 million
dollars, with its revenues dropping to 7.71 billion dollars from
11.09 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Income of the Amoco Corp. fell 49 percent to 295 million
dollars from 635 million dollars last year, with its revenues
dropping to 7.5 million dollars from almost 9.0 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest oil company Exxon Corp. also reported its
profits tumbled 23 percent down to the lowest in four years, with
a net income of 1.4 billion dollars, down from 1.82 billion
dollars in the same period last year. The company's revenue slid
to 28.8 billion dollars from 32.75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
All the big oil companies attributed their lower earnings to a
slump in crude oil and natural gas prices and continued economic
instability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the average quarterly crude oil prices
were at the lowest since 1986, and natural gas prices fell 11
percent from a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Statistics of macroeconomic
index show that the Hungarian economy developed well this year,
said the National Bank President Suranyi Gyorgy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate of this year may drop to 12
percent from 18.4 percent last year, two percentage points lower
than the 14 percent target. This figure may drop further to 9
percent by the end of 1999, Suranyi said at a meeting of the
National Commission of Budget.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by about 5.1 percent
in the first half of 1998 and exports grew by 20 percent in the
same period, Suranyi said.
</P>
<P>
As the growth of imports is slower than that of exports, the
foreign trade deficit is estimated to be 2.5 percent of the year's
GDP, and the budget deficit may account for 4.4 to 4.6 percent of
the GDP, both lower than the planned targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Suranyi also said that the foreign currency reserve of the
country reached 8 billion dollars. It can offset the indirect
impact of the Russian economic crisis.

NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite the deregulation and
privatization of infrastructure industries, benefits of better
service quality and lower costs are really not visible in the
sector, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a paper "Report on Issues Facing India's Infrastructure
Development," CII said that in certain sectors like power, radio
paging and cellular telecom where the output is highly marketable,
private sector interest has been high. But in segments like urban
infrastructure, where services like water supply, sewerage are
seen as public goods with little or no direct user charges being
levied being the norm among customers, the "progress has been
limited."
</P>
<P>
The CII report paper has also put forward some proposals for
development of the country's infrastructure in the fields of
power, telecom, building of ports, airports as well as industrial
parks. Private sector should be encouraged to participate in
infrastructure projects, said the report.

BUDAPEST, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic Wednesday called for
resuming cooperation among the Visegrad Group.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after their meeting here, Hungarian
Prime Minister Orban Viktor and his Polish and Czech counterparts
Jerzy Buzek and Milos Zeman decided to meet every six months to
discuss cooperation, which started in 1991 but stopped afterwards,
among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the prime ministers reaffirmed their
responsibility for maintaining traditional European values of
democracy and safeguarding human rights.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the three countries had made great
progress in joining the security, political and economic systems
of the West.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) before its summit in April next year, they
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
They said they are also very optimistic about their talks on
joining the European Union, pledging to continue their cooperation
in various areas.
</P>
<P>
On February 15, 1991, presidents or prime ministers of Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia met in Hungary's Visegrad and decided to
coordinate their efforts to establish multi-party parliamentary
systems in their own countries, exchange experiences on switching
to the market economy and joining the European Community.
</P>
<P>
The three countries were later referred as the Visegrad
Group. After the breakup of Czechoslovakia, the group also

<HEADLINE> 100 Hurt in Refugee-Police Clash in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 100 people, including 11
policemen, were injured on Wednesday in a clash between police and
Rohingya refugees at a refugee camp in southeastern Bangladesh's
Cox's Bazar district.
</P>
<P>
The incident began at about 1 p.m. when a group of refugees at
the Nayapara refugee camp attacked the policemen who were trying
to stop a clash between two rival refugee groups, press reports
here said Thursday, quoting police sources.
</P>
<P>
The clash between the two rival groups took place when some
refugees of one group went to rescue one of their fellowmen from
the clutches of their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The refugees fired rubber bullets and hurled brick-bats at the
police, injuring 11 of them. Some 100 Rohingya refugees were also
injured, most of them were women and children.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 33 refugees from the camp and took control of
it.
</P>
<P>
They also recovered an official vehicle of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which the refugees took
possession in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
To fend off further trouble, four police teams have been
deployed in the camp, housing 12,712 refugees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 250,000 Rohingyas crossed Bangladesh border in 1991,
and about 230,000 of them have been repatriated under the joint
supervision of the Bangladeshi and the Myanmar governments and the
UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Repatriation of the refugees to Myanmar has been suspended
since July 1997 reportedly as result of the refugees' refusal to
return, and to date about 21,000 Rohingya refugees are still
staying in two camps in Cox's Bazar.

government troops. Most of the abductions are in areas controlled
by the LTTE at some places in the Batticalao District of the
Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has stepped up its conscription campaign following a
depletion of its ranks with heavy casualties in recent battles
with the government forces in the North of the country, the
sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE told a United Nations representative in May this year
that it will not recruit children in its war with the government's
armed forces. This promise was given to a senior UN representative
who visited the uncleared Wanni in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, police believed that over 3,000 fresh fighters from
among children were recruited recently by the LTTE rebels who have
been fighting a 15-year war against the government for a separate
Tamil state in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Lifts Threat to Quit Mideast Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday night withdrew his threat to quit
the Middle East peace summit as the Clinton administration
scrambled to keep the talks going.
</P>
<P>
"Israel wishes to achieve an agreement and hopes there is a
similar desire on the Palestinians' side," Netanyahu said in a
statement after a lengthy meeting with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton followed the developments from the
White House as U.S. and Israeli officials worked on revising the
security provisions that would be part of any land-for-peace
swap. Presidential spokesman Lockhart said Clinton's schedule
Thursday was open for possibly returning to the talks.
</P>
<P>
"These are serious and difficult issues that we're still
working on," Lockhart said, "What we need -- and hope we'll see --
are serious efforts to make progress on these issues."
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians said they would reject any new Israel
demand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a statement from Netanyahu's office said, "The Israeli
government has packed its bags, including the prime minister.
Take off is scheduled for 10 p.m. (0200 GMT)."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and key U.S.
administration officials have been staying in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, for seven whole days to break the 19-month deadlock in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement on Wednesday evening, Israel side
identified the two stumbling blocks as the Palestinian Charter,
which contains several anti-Israel provisions, and whether
terrorist suspects would be extradited to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel asked Palestine to convene a session of Palestine
National Council, or the Parliament, whose 700 members live in
exile, to remove anti-Israel provisions in the charter. Palestine
insists it is unnecessary since the provisions were canceled in
1996 and only need the approval of the Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
Israel further demands that the Palestinians extradite 30
Palestinians accused of killing Israelis.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian parliament, the
People's Assembly, on Wednesday approved a draft new constitution
on which the Albanians will vote in a referendum next month.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which had been deliberated in the parliament,
controlled by the ruling coalition, for nearly two weeks, was
carried with 115 votes for and one abstention. The opposition
Democratic Party boycott the deliberation and the voting.
</P>
<P>
Under a decree issued by Albanian President Rexhep Meidani
Wednesday night, a referendum will be held on November 22 to
decide the fate of the new basic law.
</P>
<P>
The old constitution was abolished in the early 1990s after the
fall of the government led by the Albanian Party of Labor. And
Albania has been running without a constitution since.
</P>
<P>
A previous draft constitution, worked out by the government led
by former president Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party, was
rejected by a referendum in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaeologist Discover Ashes of Early Buddhist Monks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered 10 pieces of bone ash of eminent Buddhist monks in
a bronze coffin in the Fawang Tower in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The light grey to slightly yellow relics, or Sariras in
Sanskrit, were wrapped in silk in a 4.6-cm-tall glazed bottle.
</P>
<P>
The bronze coffin was in a newly discovered underground chamber
of Fawang Tower in Zhouzhi County, about 80 kilometers from the
provincial capital of Xi'an. The 30-meter-tall tower was built in
601 by Yang Jian, an emperor of the Sui Dynasty (581-618 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Han Wei, the head of the Shaanxi Institute of Archaeology, said
that according to history, Yang Jian received 31 of these relics
from a nun named Zhi Xian.
</P>
<P>
In 601 he issued an imperial edict to build a tower to house
the bone ashes and to have them put in it at precisely 12:00
o'clock on October 15 the same year.
</P>
<P>
Han said that these are the first relics of eminent Buddhist
monks from the Sui Dynasty archaeologists have found and that they
will do further research on the mystery surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
The relics were discovered when the local government decided to
move the tower 2.8 kilometers away to make way for a water
project.

<HEADLINE> hke102213 -Registration of Myanmar Refugees at Thai Border Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has began registration this week
of the Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps under a mutual
agreement which will see the U.N. agency playing a greater role in
overseeing the camps, The Nation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The week-long work of UNHCR and Thai Interior Ministry
officials commenced on Monday at the camps in Tak and Mae Hong Son
provinces, Northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was endorsed by Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai earlier this year, heralds a change in the long-time
policy of the Thai authorities who have still now kept foreign
agencies from observing the Myanmar camps.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand decided to permit the UNHCR to step in mainly
because Thailand has been hit hard by the economic crisis, making
it difficult to single-handedly look after the 100,000 Myanmar
refugees in 12 camps along the border.
</P>
<P>
The camps were set up for Myanmar people who fled inland
fighting. The UNHCR will set up an office in each province where
camps are located, and mobile units will oversee them.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the UNHCR will be provided with free and
early access to the camps, contrary to the past when they were not
permitted to work there. Previously, they had to notify the camp
authorities in advance if they wanted to travel to the camps, a
well-informed source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR will provide money for constructing buildings and
procuring the items necessary to administer the camps.
</P>
<P>
But, the UNHCR and the Thai authorities have not yet reached a
conclusion on the money to be provided, the source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Brunei will
cooperate in the field of education as part of their efforts to
strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Brunei Minister of Education Abdul Aziz Umar, who is currently
here at the invitation of his Myanmar counterpart U Than Aung, is
due to meet Myanmar education officials later Thursday and discuss
the proposed cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah paid a state
visit to Myanmar, during which the two countries agreed to set up
a Joint Commission for Bilateral Cooperation to further strengthen
and expand their ties particularly in economic, trade, social,
cultural fields of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
U Than Aung attended in Brunei in February the meeting of the
Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO),
chaired by Umar, who is also president of the Southeast Asian
Ministers of Education Council of the SEAMEO.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has planned to revise its education curriculum to
conform to the education standards in other member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), aiming to turn out
skilled workers and technicians in the process of human resources
development.
</P>
<P>
A committee in the education sector is also being formed in
Myanmar for the participation in the activities of ASEAN along
with other committees in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Both Myanmar and Brunei are ASEAN members.

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Aircraft Manufacturer (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's first and only private
aircraft maker, the Beijing Keyuan Light Aircraft Industrial Co.,
Ltd., started with a dream and was founded on a shoestring.
</P>
<P>
Its 42-year-old founder, Yuan Yongmin, a native of Beijing,
explains that it was the reforms and opening up that helped him
realize his my dream.
</P>
<P>
The dream started early. "When other kids were collecting
badges with the portrait of Mao Zedong, I was busy making model
planes," he recalls, and made the models out of paper, earth, or
wood, whatever materials were at hand.
</P>
<P>
After he finished middle school, Yuan was sent for two years as
a "re-educated youth" to a village. In 1978, he was assigned to
work as a pastry cook at a state-run food company, making 19.08
yuan a month. But, he kept his childhood dream alive, spending all
his spare time making more models, this time out of metal and with
tiny motors that could fly a few meters high.
</P>
<P>
But, he kept asking himself, "When can I ever afford to build
a real aircraft?" The chance came in 1986, when Beijing began
auctioning off some small, money-losing state firms at the start
of its enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
So Yuan, whom his wife calls an adventurer, left the food
company and bought a snack bar with 140,000 yuan in loans from
relatives and a local bank. The small business turned out to be a
success and soon allowed him to open a larger restaurant in the
downtown area that now brings him more than a million yuan in
profits a year.

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Aircraft Manufacturer (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1992, he found out that a university in Nanjing, the capital
of Jiangsu Province, had developed a multipurpose light aircraft,
the AD-200, and decided that it was high time for him to combine
his hobby with his career.
</P>
<P>
With his wife's backing, he mortgaged the restaurant for about
20 million yuan to buy the patent and 8 hectares of land to build
his aircraft manufacturing company.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Yuan got a license from the Civil Aviation
Administration of China, and this simple move marked the end of
the decades-old state monoply of China's civil aviation
industry. That company can now employs more than 50 people and can
make 500 light planes a year.
</P>
<P>
Its AD-200 has a top speed of 150 km per hour and a maximum
altitude of 3,000 m. and is used for aerial spraying, patrolling,
and sport flying.
</P>
<P>
His company is the only manufacturer of this kind of aircraft
outside the United States, says Yuan, confident of the viability
of his products, which sells for 250,000 yuan (30,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The restaurateur even sees a similarity between his two
completely different businesses. Both of them demand knowhow and
good timing, he explains, but admits that aircraft do not exactly
sell like cakes. In the company's first two years, not a single
plane sold.
</P>
<P>
This year, things have taken a turn for the better after he
launched a promotion drive and orders have come in from and
inquiries from as far away as Saudi Arabia, Canada, and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The company has sold 6 AD-200s to date and another 20 are on
order and Keyuan is even branching out into hot-air balloons.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is looking at a 70 percent share of the domestic market
and a footing in the international market and says that flying a
private plane could be a hobby for the new rich in the new century.
</P>
<P>
And, he's now trying to groom his 15-year-old son as a
successor, while preparing to open a private air sports
club.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Seizes Over 2,000 Kg of Drugs in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized a
total of 2,143 kilograms (kg) of narcotic drugs, including 25.21
kg of heroin and 342.81 kg of opium, in September, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Army units, police and the customs also seized three liters of
phensedyl, 37.42 kg of marijuana and 2.11 million tablets of
stimulant drug.
</P>
<P>
During the month, the authorities took action against 366
persons including 313 men and 53 women involved in 251
drug-related cases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the first six months of
this year, Myanmar seized a total of 4,927 kg of narcotics
including 219 kg of heroin and 4,471 kg of opium, destroying 15
heroin refineries and over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations and
taking action against 2,300 people in drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities also confiscated nearly 9 million
stimulant drug tablets in the first nine month of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar claimed in a report issued last week by the
Office of Strategic Studies of the Defense Ministry that it has
prevented 45 billion U.S. dollars worth of heroin from reaching
the streets of the United States since 1988 despite U.S. cut in
assistance to the country.

SHIJIAZHUANG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north

982,000 tons more than the record high in 1996, an official of the
provincial statistics bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
The bountiful harvest comes in spite of a smaller summer
harvest as a result of a drought in the southern part of the

<P>
The bureau estimated the province's autumn harvest at 16.22
million tons, an increase of 2.17 million tons over last year.
</P>
<P>
The increased grain output was made possible by expanded
growing areas and the wider and more effective application of

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Bares Opposition Conspiracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
was trying to sabotage the government's effort in the war against
the rebels, the official Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting Wednesday organized by the Sri Lankan
Women's Congress in Moratuwa of the Western Province, she charged
that through a "despicable, conspiratorial" campaign, the UNP had
sought to come to power.
</P>
<P>
She said that the UNP's conduct at this crucial stage of the
ethnic crisis is deplorable and treacherous. She said the UNP had
formed a group to sabotage the government effort in the civil war
in connivance with certain figures in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
When in government, the UNP had not conducted the war properly
but was now advising the government that its war strategy is
wrong, she said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said the UNP has a duty to support the government
to seek peace at this stage as it is directly responsible for the
escalation of the conflict following the gruesome riots in July
1983.
</P>
<P>
The UNP, if it has any desire to end the war, has only to
support the government to pass the proposed constitutional reforms
in Parliament which are aimed at solving the war, she said. But
they refused to do so, because "their aim is crystal clear. They
want to prolong the war," the president pointed out.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- NBA star Greg Anderson has
pleaded guilty to a federal drug trafficking charge Tuesday in
Mississippi, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a free agent center who charged with one count of
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, made his plea
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Biloxi. He faces a maximum four

</P>
<P>
Two other counts of possession and a count of trafficking and
forfeiture were dropped.
</P>
<P>
On June 25, federal authorities accused Anderson and three
other men of making deals for cocaine and carrying the drugs from
Houston to Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
Anderson was detained but not arrested on May 20 at a hotel
during an FBI sting operation.

<HEADLINE> Peru Rejects Ecuador's Initiative on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Peru's president Wednesday
rejected an Ecuadoran initiative on forming a "binational park"
along his country's unmarked border with Ecuador to end their
aging border dispute.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori told reporters that Peruvian law
would not allow both countries sharing a single park on an
undefined border but he would not rule out the possibility of "two
parks" along a clearly demarcated border.
</P>
<P>
"Demarcation is what we need," he said after the two presidents
held separate meetings with Argentine President Carlos Menem and
between themselves, apparently trying to reach a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran President Jamil Mahuad said here Wednesday that he
was negotiating with his counterpart in good faith and hoped for a
settlement that would allow them to move on to other issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue building the foundations for a definitive
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talks between President Fujimori and his Ecuadoran counterpart
Mahuad had given high rise to hopes for a quick agreement to end
the two countries' half-century feud.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said during the
Ibero-American summit in Portugal last weekend that a final
settlement might be expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador agreed before their talks in Buenos Aires to
accept any settlement proposed by the four guarantor nations of a
1942 treaty including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador have fought three wars in 1941, 1981 and 1995,
with the last two over their border dispute, which claimed at
least 35,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The disputed region along the two countries' 79 kilometer
unmarked border in a mountainous jungle region, is believed to be
potentially rich in petroleum and minerals.

MEXICO CITY, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is the second
largest oil supplier to the U.S. in the first eight months of this
year, with 322.6 million barrels of crude worth 3.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mexico closely followed Venezuela - the United State's top OPEC
oil supplier -- which exported 349.2 million barrels worth 3.6
billion dollars in the same period, it was reported here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canada was the United States' second most important non-OPEC
supplier in that period with 316.8 million barrels worth 3.9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia ranked second among U.S. suppliers from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with 346.9 million
barrels worth 3.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Total U.S. oil imports in that period reached 2.7 billion
barrels from OPEC and non-OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC countries like Mexico, Canada, Angola and China among
others sold the U.S. 1.1 billion barrels of crude, 52.2 percent of

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges Continued Pressure on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Wednesday in Skopje that Britain would play its part in
maintaining international pressure on Yugoslavia to ensure that
Belgrade keep its promises on Kosovo, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, Prime
Minister Branko Crvenkovski and Foreign Minister Blagoj Handziski,
Cook said the international community would not make any
concession to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He said the Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement did not mark the end
of problems but only the beginning of the international
community's efforts to build a stable and peaceful Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic should not make the mistake of imagining
that the international community is going to go away and forget
about his commitment," Cook noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will be watching very carefully to make sure that he sticks
to the agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary also called for a speedy
deployment of the 2000 monitoring personnel in Kosovo to verify
the withdrawal of the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
Cook thanked Macedonia for permitting the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to deploy on its soil unarmed aircraft and
pilotless spy planes to watch over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said the NATO move represented "another commitment to
Macedonia's territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian leaders expressed support for the international
community's efforts to settle the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Handziski said out of historical reasons, Macedonia was unable
to join in the United Nations' actions aimed at monitoring the
implementation of the UN resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian foreign minister again ruled out the possibility
of allowing its territory to be used for military actions over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Cook arrived in Skopje Tuesday on a two-day visit following his
trip to Bulgaria. This is the first visit to Macedonia by a
high-ranking British official. Cook is scheduled to leave the
Macedonian capital for Romania Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Laudrup Warns Before Copenhagen Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Brian Laudrup has warned his
Chelsea team-mates not to fall foul of complacency as they bid to
continue their defence of the Cup Winners' Cup against FC
Copenhagen at Stamford Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The Blues struggled to beat another Scandinavian side
Helsingborgs in the first round, an unconvincing 1-0 home win
followed by a 0-0 draw in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Danish star Laudrup is well aware that Gianluca Vialli's side
will need to improve to beat a Copenhagen side he rates far
higher than the Swedish part-timers.
</P>
<P>
"I have played with some of the players and I've said to the
boys here that in my opinion they are certainly a stronger side
than Helsingborgs so we know it's not going to be an easy game to
play in," Laudrup said.
</P>
<P>
"They will make it difficult for us. For them it's a
tremendous draw to play Chelsea and if they get something out of
the game on Thursday it will be a tremendous result for FC
Copenhagen and Danish football in general.
</P>
<P>
"They're a typical Scandinavian side. They're very strong,
they can run all day and put a lot of pressure on their opponents.
</P>
<P>
"They will hope we will look at them and think it's going to
be an easy game and Chelsea are favorites for the game.
</P>
<P>
"But they have some good experienced and talented players and
we'll have to be aware they can do a lot of damage. I think
Bjarne Goldbaek and Peter Nielsen are the two main threats, " he
said.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President to Run in Coming Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev Tuesday announced he would run in the presidential
election to be held on January 10, 1999, the kazakhstan Telegraph
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said in a statement that he would do his best to
safeguard national independence, stability and concord, and let
the people feel happier and more secure.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the face of grave testing of the international
financial crisis, especially that of Russia's political and
financial crises, he is taking emergency measures to alleviate the
negative effects on the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
When the parliament decided on October 8 to hold the
presidential election ahead of time, Nazarbayev said he had not
decided whether to run or not.
</P>
<P>
He made the campaigning decision after being urged by his own
Party of National Unity, the Democratic Party and some other
political parties and social groups.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Nazarbayev and former prime minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin will be the two main rivals in the campaign.
Serikbolsyn Abdildin, first secretary of the Kazakhstan Communist
Party, will also contest.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill to Stay with Leicester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Leicester chairman John Elsom
has confirmed that Martin O'Neill will be staying at Filbert
Street, ending weeks of speculation that the Foxes boss would be
installed as manager at Leeds.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Wednesday morning, Leicester announced
that O'Neill's future at the club was guaranteed, following Leeds
chief Peter Ridsdale's revelation that the former Wycombe and
Norwich boss was no longer in their plans.
</P>
<P>
City manager O'Neill had been strongly linked with the Elland
Road hot seat, vacated by George Graham on September 30, and was
United's first choice.
</P>
<P>
But Leicester denied them permission to speak to the
ex-Northern Ireland international.
</P>
<P>
Leeds are to hold a board meeting and the appointment of a new
manager, expected to be current caretaker David O'Leary, is set
to be made on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill said there were "a number of reasons" why he had
decided to stay at Filbert Street.
</P>
<P>
"The alternative of walking out on a contract was not too
palatable," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Monday night's reaction of the crowd was very
influential and I have to say as well that the players played a
part in it too, " he said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's future had been plunged into doubts for the second
time in four months when Leeds made it clear they wanted him to
replace Graham, now in charge at Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
The Ulsterman, who took over at Filbert Street following Mark
McGhee's departure in December 1995, was targeted by Everton in
June.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill was believed to be unhappy after Leicester undermined
his position as manager but after much discussion, he pledged him
future to the club.
</P>
<P>
After an uncertain start as Fox's boss, O'Neill has become a
popular figure with fans and players alike, leading them to
promotion to the Premiership in his first season and then the
Coca-Cola Cup - their first major trophy in 33 years - in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Real Madrid, Manchester United Score Big Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- European champions Real Madrid
and Manchester United gained big wins in their European
Champion's League campaign on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid trounced Austrians Sturm Graz 6-1 while Manchester
United demolished Brondby 6-2 in Copenhagen, a new away goals
record in the six-year history of the Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Those results evoked memories of European glory days gone-by
for both Real and United -- while Brazilian striker Ronaldo
reminded everyone that he is still a force to be reckoned with
after his recent injury woes.
</P>
<P>
He scored Inter Milan's second in their 2-1 defeat of Spartak
Moscow which ended the last 100 per cent record in the
competition and left Real Madrid, Spartak and Inter all level
with six points in Group C.
</P>
<P>
Serhiy Rebrov of Dynamo Kiev stunned more than 70,000 Arsenal
fans at Wembley Stadium with a last-minute equalizer for a share
of the points in a 1-1 draw in Group E, while Juventus's bid to
reach the final for the fourth successive season became further
derailed when they drew 0-0 at Athletic Bilbao -- their third
successive draw in Group B.
</P>
<P>
That section is topped by Norwegians Rosenborg Trondheim who
beat Galatasaray 3-0 thanks to a memorable second-half hat-trick
from Sigurd Rushfeldt.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich won the clash of the giants against Barcelona
with Steffen Effenberg scoring the only goal of their Group D
match on the stroke of halftime.
</P>
<P>
There was also an impressive win for HJK Helsinki of Finland,
who pulled off the shock result of the night beating former
European champions Benfica of Portugal 2-0 at home with first
half goals from Mika Lehkosua and Mikka Kottila.
</P>
<P>
Helsinki, widely believed to be nothing more than the whipping
boys in Group F, moved to second in the table on four points,
three behind Kaiserslautern of Germany, who won 2-1 at PSV
Eindhoven. Benfica prop up the group with the Dutch side, both on
three points.
</P>
<P>
Porto had an impressive win in Group A defeating Croatia
Zagreb 3-0 with Zlatko Zahovic scoring twice and Doriva Junior
once in Group A, but that section is surprisingly topped by
Olympiakos Piraeus who beat Ajax Amsterdam 1-0 at home. They have
seven points from three matches, three more than Ajax and Porto.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- A 10-year-old American
girl, whose hand was injured when a baseball bat fragment struck
her during a 1994 game, won her 1 million U.S. dollars suit in
Detroit, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Alyssia Benejam was sitting in a stand when the Texas Rangers'
Jose Canseco's bat smashed and a piece of it flew to her,
piercing her left hand. She was only 6 at the time.
</P>
<P>
The Wayne County Circuit Court jury Tuesday awarded Alyssia
and her parents $1,008,700 for pain and suffering, medical
expenses and lost economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Since the injury, the girl's left middle finger won't grow,
and the ring finger is growing at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
"I still play the piano and the flute, but it's tough for me
because I can't bend my fingertips," Alyssia said.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Take Active Part in Monitoring Kosovo Deal: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain will take an active part
in monitoring the implementation of the latest Kosovo peace deal,
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in the Macedonian
capital city of Skoplje on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cook, currently on a visit to Skoplje, said this during a
working lunch with a Kosovar Albanian delegation headed by chief
negotiator Fehmi Agani, Macedonia's Mak-press reported.
</P>
<P>
Britain upholds its position for a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo issue, Cook said, noting that the agreement between
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic marked the beginning, not the end, of resolving the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain would play a major role in the implementation
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Warning that the international community was closely watching
Milosevic's actions, Cook urged the Yugoslav leader to fulfill his
obligations under the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
According to other reports, the Kosovar Albanian delegates
called for a referendum on the future of Kosovo -- Serbia's
secessionist province where ethnic Albanians account for 90
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Agani said after the meeting that his delegation asked Britain
to continue its efforts to help resolve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman for the delegation Etita Tahiri said a referendum
on Kosovo's future would be the most practical and feasible way to
settle the Kosovo conflict, from both the historical and present
points of view.

<P>
SAO PAULO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks in Sao Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro Wednesday closed with nearly 5.5 percent up on news of
an anticipated International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package
which buoyed optimism for investment.
</P>
<P>
The Bovespa index shot up 5.40 percent at the close of the Sao
Paulo stock exchange -- the largest in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that investors' confidence had resumed on news
that the government had reached an agreement with the IMF to run a
budget surplus equal to 2.6 percent of the GDP in 1999, the
condition for an IMF 30 billion U.S. dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
In Rio, stocks closed up 5.3 percent despite a low trading
volume.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, reportedly the latest victim of the financial crisis
which started last year in Asia, had lost 25 billion dollars in
foreign exchange reserves since August, when Russia's decision to
default on its debts triggered investment crises in many emerging
markets.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Output Expected to Drop This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Statistics has estimated that Indonesia's unhulled dry rice output
in 1998 will total 46.44 million tons, down by 5.94 percent from
the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
The drop would be attributable to a decline in rice fields'
productivity by 2.31 quintals per hectare nationwide, the agency
said in a press release published by Antara News Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total area of paddy fields is expected to shrink by 85,000
hectares or 0.76 percent this year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unhulled dry rice output last year stood at 49.39
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Rice productivity is affected by the fact that farmers only
used urea fertilizer during the planting season, the agency said,
adding that most farmers did not use triple superphosphate
fertilizer because of their higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Pest attacks on rice plants could not be optimally dealt with
as many farmers could not afford highly-priced pesticides, the
agency added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel said Wednesday it has
decided to postpone a deadline for the current Middle East summit
under way in Washington, averting a breakoff of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously set the
deadline of 10 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Late on Wednesday night, Netanyahu renewed the threat by saying
that Israel will quit the summit at 6:00 a.m. EDT Thursday unless
the Palestinians meet Israel's demands.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and key U.S.
administration officials have been staying in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, for seven whole days to break the 19-month deadlock in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement on Wednesday evening, Israel identified
the two stumbling blocks as the Palestinian Charter, which

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister on Rupiah Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita
hopes the rupiah exchange rate would not be lower than 5,000
rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the rupiah exchange rate will not be lower than 5,000
rupiah to the U.S. dollar, because it would make our export
commodities to lose competitiveness," Ginandjar told reporters
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been advancing significantly during the past
couple of weeks, touching the 7,000 level at one point during the
Wednesday trading session. The rupiah fell back to 7,400 before
closing at 7,150 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday afternoon,
compared to Tuesday's close at 7,870.
</P>
<P>
The currency was hovering at a range between 10,000 and 11,000
against the U.S. dollar last month.
</P>
<P>
Because other currencies in the region had also depreciated by
between 35 percent and 40 percent during the past year, a very
sharp appreciation in the rupiah would be harmful to the
competitiveness of the country's export products, national
newspapers Thursday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the appreciation of the rupiah against the
greenback was caused by both internal and external factors.
</P>
<P>
The external factor was the development of the U.S. dollar
exchange rate as the result of the lowering of interest rate by
the U.S. central bank.
</P>
<P>
"The internal factors, particularly the various efforts made to
solve the current crisis, were responded to positively by the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The appreciation of the rupiah also reflected increasing
confidence in this nation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Reject White House Lawyers' Effort to Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- White House lawyers were
rebuffed on Wednesday in their effort to limit a House panel's
impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and charges arising out of it.
</P>
<P>
In the first meeting between the lawyers from the White House
and the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives,
Republicans made clear they are not dropping any evidence already
referred to them by prosecutors and are open to receiving more.
</P>
<P>
"If other matters are referred to us," either by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr or another source, "we reserve the right to
consider those issues," Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the panel's
Republican majority said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
White House lawyer Gregory Craig told reporters he was rebuffed
on most of the issues he raised, ranging from an accounting of the
charges against Clinton to limiting the inquiry to the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship.
</P>
<P>
McNulty accused the White House of seeking a scholarly
discussion of legal standards in an effort to divert attention
from Clinton's truthfulness under oath and stop the inquiry "dead
in its tracks."
</P>
<P>
The closed door meeting, however, was described as cordial,
despite the sharp differences. "There was no banging fists on the
table," Craig said.

<HEADLINE> EU Economy Not Isolated From Negative Impact, Forecasts Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- External events have clearly a
negative impact on the European economy, according to the Autumn
Economic Forecasts of the services of the European Commission,
which were published here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts said turbulence in Asian markets and the crisis
in Russia have provoked a slowdown in world growth and in
international trade and have led to downward revisions in the
European Union's growth figure for 1999.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, the growth is forecast to be 2.4 percent in the
15-member EU area and 2.6 percent in the euro zone. Both figures
are revised downwards by 0.6 percentage points on the spring
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The most significant downward revisions, at the level of
individual countries, are in Italy, Britain, Denmark and
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts attributed the downward revision to three main
factors. Firstly, the forecasts reflect progressively weaker
external demand for EU exports following a strong year in 1997;
secondly, the decline in the level of the dollar, if maintained,
will erode the competitive position of EU exporters; finally,
recent turbulence on financial market and the high volatility of
stock market risk undermining the confidence of investors.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU's 1998 economic growth rate is now expected to
be 2.9 percent, slightly above its spring forecasts, despite the
effects of events in Asia and more recently in Russia, according
to the latest forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts also gave an overall favorable picture: economic
growth in the EU area is expected to remain strong over the period
1998-2000, driven essentially by internal consumption and
investment. The EU said its growth should pick up again to 2.8
percent in 2000 on a scenario of unchanged policies.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the EU economy is expected to outperform the other
major industrialized economies of the world throughout the
forecast period because of major positive factors including
expected monetary stability, well-controlled inflation and
well-improved employment situation, according to the forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Southern China Island Province Increases Fixed Assets Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan in
south China has reversed its economic downward trend by increasing
investment in fixed assets, local officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the first three quarters of this year, fixed assets
investment increased 8.7 percent year on year to 7.56 billion yuan
(about 900 million U.S. dollars), becoming a force in provincial
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the growth in the fourth quarter will
speed up and this year's investment target of 18 billion yuan will
be reached.
</P>
<P>
The island province, which is also the country's largest
special economic zone, has been carrying out large-scale
construction of infrastructure projects, with total investment
estimated at 55 billion yuan, the officials said, adding that
investment in the once overheated real estate sector is now under
strict government control.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997, the province's fixed assets investment added
up to 96.5 billion yuan, an average annual growth of 27.8 percent
and accounting for 54.8 percent of the province's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Galileo Detects Evidence of Water on Jupiter's Moons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists have
detected new evidence of underground oceans on Europa and
Callisto, two moons of Jupiter, thus bringing hopes of finding
life there and other world in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Writing on Thursday's Nature, a team of scientists from
University of California, the California Institute of Technology
and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said they have come to the
conclusion after analyzing data collected by Galileo spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
They said Galileo measured strong disturbances to Jupiter's
magnetic field as the spacecraft flew over Europa and Callisto.
But the moons lack strong magnetic fields of their own that could
exert such a force. So they suggested that Jupiter's magnetism
must be giving rise to secondary fields within some powerful
electrical conductor on each moon, a phenomenon called
electromagnetic induction.
</P>
<P>
The scientists indicated that the strong conductor on the moons
must be huge bodies of salt water or underground oceans. They
would be within about 60 miles (97 kilometers) of the frozen
surface, and kept from icing over by heat within the interior of
the moons. The researchers assume the water as salt as Earth's
oceans, they hence would be about six miles (9.7 kilometers) deep.
</P>
<P>
Heat and water in liquid form are considered fundamental
requirements for life, they said, if we could find such water on
the moons, we may well expect life forms in such water on the
moons.

<HEADLINE> Ince Charged with Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Midfielder Paul Ince was
charged with misconduct by the English Football Association on
Wednesday for his behavior in an international game against
Sweden last month.
</P>
<P>
Ince was sent off in the 67th minute of that opening European
championship qualifier on September 5, which England lost 2-1,
for his second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
The Liverpool player was subsequently given a three-match ban
by European governing body UEFA for remarks he made to Italian
referee Pierluigi Collina as he walked off.
</P>
<P>
He also reportedly made a V-sign gesture and an F.A. spokesman
said the charges referred specifically to this.
</P>
<P>
Sources explained the long interval between the offense and
the charges by saying that the F.A. had waited until UEFA had
completed their disciplinary procedures before taking action.
</P>
<P>
Ince, who will not be eligible to play again for England in a
competitive match until they entertain Sweden next June, has 14
days to respond the F.A. charges.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, he could be ruled out of England's coming
friendly matches in November and February as well.

CHANGSHA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China is deepening reform of
investment system as part of the effort to transform the role of
the government, according to Li Rongrong, vice-minister in charge
of the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Li told participants in the just-concluded Changsha fair on
foreign economic and technological cooperation in central and
western China that the ongoing reform will alter the existing
practice under which the government is responsible for approving
all investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The new system will allow investors to proceed with projects,
with the exception of large-scale projects, once they register
with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government will also refrain from interfering in the loan
approval procedures of banks, with related institutions enjoying
greater independence in assessing risks and granting loans.
</P>
<P>
The reform measures are designed to reduce the government
interference in microeconomic activities and allow enterprises to
make internal investment decisions, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted that vigorous measures will be adopted to expand
the stock market and to develop additional investment funds in
order to increase direct financing for enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Market regulations will be further strengthened, he added.

WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel set a ultimatum for
the Middle East summit Wednesday, threatening to walk out of the
talks if Palestine does not meet its key demands while the U.S.
crafted fresh security proposals to try to salvage the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his delegation
will go home if there was no substantial progress on two key
issues.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said an Israeli
break-off would be "unfortunate" since "there is a sufficient
basis for peace."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and key U.S.
administration officials have been staying in the Wye Plantation,
Maryland, for seven whole days to break the 19-month deadlock in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Israel identified the two
stumbling blocks as the Palestinian Charter, which contains

would be extradited to Israel.

Israel further demands that Palestinians extradite 30
Palestinians accused of killing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government has packed its bags, including the

said the statement from Netanyahu's office.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister says: 'If there is substantial progress, we
will stay. If not, we will go,'" the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"Without implementation of Palestinian obligations, without a
solution to the issues of extradition of terrorists and amendment
of the (Palestine National) Charter by the Palestine National
Council, there will not be an agreement," it said.
</P>
<P>
"After the meeting, the Americans left to check if the
Palestinians will respond to these demands and change the draft
accordingly," the Israeli statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis said they had already put some of their equipment
on their plane.
</P>
<P>
With the atmosphere souring on the seventh day of the talks,
Israel and the Palestinians exchanged accusations on which side
was responsible for the slow progress in concluding a
land-for-peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Arafat telephoned 49th birthday congratulations to Netanyahu
and urged him to stay on and complete the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, a close adviser to Arafat, said he had delivered
flowers to Netanyahu on Arafat's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused the Palestinians of failing to respond to their
security demands.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, in turn, accused the Israelis of "political
blackmail" and of introducing new, last-minute demands.

Internet marketing company.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide e-commerce is currently estimated at about 10 billion
U.S. dollars and is expected to reach 500 billion dollars by 2002.
</P>
<P>
Researchers involved in this joint project said in a news
release that e-commerce studies need to move beyond mere numbers
and focus on how companies can actually put together e-commerce
solutions. E-commerce is no longer a question of if but of how,
and end-users now want to get the answers to the question of how,
they said.
</P>
<P>
To provide broad coverage of industry-specific development
trends and business strategies in e-commerce, the report by the
two companies will include a dozen industries segments including
banking, manufacturing, mortgage, telecommunications, retail, real
estate, insurance, publishing, health care, oil and gas and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The research firms said that findings about the successes and
failures of visionary industry-specific organizations will help
companies considering e-commerce determine the costs of an
e-commerce implementation and evaluate e-commerce strategies that
are relevant to their situation.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study based on surveys on European business
executives conducted by a global consulting organization, Andersen
Consulting, found that privacy, security and lack of regulatory
framework were key barriers for the growth of e-commerce. But
most executives in Europe believe e-commerce will have a strategic
impact on their businesses.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes U.N. Funding Bill Over Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday vetoed a Congress-passed bill to provide nearly one
billion U.S. dollars it owes to the United Nations because of an
unrelated anti-abortion provision.
</P>
<P>
"I've made it clear many times that I will veto such
provisions," Clinton said in a statement, "Congress sent me the
bill to fund our arrears to the United Nations knowing full well I
would do so. So today, I did."
</P>
<P>
In his veto message to Congress, Clinton said that current law
"already prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion
abroad and for lobbying on abortion issues."
</P>
<P>
"This bill would go beyond those limits," he said, by denying
U.S. support to non-governmental organizations that use their own
funds to perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said: "In the past few days, the Congress persisted in
tying our United Nations dues to unrelated and controversial
social provisions which endanger the health of women and deny them
even basic information about family planning, even though studies
show that countries where women have access to strong family
planning actually have fewer abortions."
</P>
<P>
The vetoed legislation would have authorized the payment of 926
million dollars in back dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 1998 bills, the United Nations estimates
Washington owes 1.3 billion dollars in arrears.
</P>
<P>
With the United States faced with possible loss of its General
Assembly voting rights in the coming weeks, the Clinton
administration has made backup plans this month to pay the bare
minimum in dues, from other accounts, to keep that seat intact.
</P>
<P>
It paid the United Nations 50 million dollars earlier Wednesday
which U.N. officials said will help Washington keep its vote in
the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Congress included an additional 197 million dollars in separate
legislation for U.N. accounts. That, along with the 50 million
dollars and another already appropriated 100 million dollars,
should save the U.S. vote in the 185-member assembly, U.N.
officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam considers the sixth
summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
scheduled for mid-December in Hanoi as a most important diplomatic
event this year, Vietnam news agency Wednesday quoted a senior
diplomatic as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Tam Chien noted that
this will be the first time Vietnam hosts an ASEAN summit and that
 the Hanoi meeting will be the last summit of the 30-year old
organization before the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
The sixth ASEAN summit will be an opportunity for member
countries, including Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, to strengthen
their solidarity and further enhance intra-regional cooperation,
as well as to regain trust and support from the international
community for Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia once was considered one of the most dynamic
regions for economic development in the world.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister, who is also general secretary of
the National Committee for ASEAN summit, said the sixth summit is
expected to approve the "Hanoi Declaration" and the "Hanoi Plan of
 Action".
</P>
<P>
The "Hanoi Plan of Action", which will be carried out between
1999-2005, is a step toward implementing the ASEAN vision 2020.
</P>
<P>
The "Hanoi Declaration" will provide assessment on the current
situation of the region, suggest measures to overcome the on-going
 financial-monetary crisis in Asia and affirm ASEAN member
countries' commitment to maintaining political stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been accelerating its efforts to make comprehensive
 preparations for the summit.

JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie said he will attend the summit of the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) scheduled for November 17 in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"God willing, I will attend," the president said in an
interview with Indonesian television stations TVRI and RCTI on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the meeting was crucial because APEC leaders would
be able to exchange views on increased economic cooperation in
Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Indonesian delegation to the Kuala Lumpur
meeting would likely be different from those to the previous APEC
meetings.
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the Indonesia had no vice president, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the past, if the president traveled to other cities or
countries, the vice president remained in Jakarta and the other
way around.
</P>
<P>
"Now the problem is that we have no vice president. Therefore,
I will leave (for Malaysia) after I perform the Subuh (early
morning) prayers and return home before the Magrib (early evening)
prayers," he added.

<P>
HANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has already begun the largest water and soil conservation project
it has ever undertaken at the upper and middle reaches of the
Qiantang River.
</P>
<P>
The project costs 60 million yuan and is expected to control
600 square kilometers of soil-erosion areas in 23 counties and
cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion in the year 2004 and is
expected to benefit future generations.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion areas in the province now exceed 25,000 square
kilometers, accounting for a quarter of the local land
acreage. The province also has more than 533,000 hectares of
cultivated sloping fields and wasteland now suffering from soil
erosion to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
Serious soil erosion in the Qiantang River Valley is the major
contributing cause of the annual flooding in the province.

JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most
active volcano in Central Java, has resumed spewing hot gasses
this week, Antara News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The hot gasses in the direction of River Lamat's lower reaches
covered a distance of up to 1.3 kilometers, which prompted the
authorities to call on villagers in the area to stay alert.
</P>

On the basis of the results of visual as well as instrumental
observations, Mount Merapi was still considered a threat to its
surroundings, head of the volcanic technology research and
development institute Mas Atje Purbawita said.
</P>
<P>
Mount Merapi, 2,968-meter high and one the most active
volcanoes in Indonesia, last erupted on July 11, spilling out hot
fumes and ashes.
</P>

Three major eruptions have been recorded in the past, one of
which occurred in 1930 when 1,300 people were killed. The other
two eruptions were in 1994 and 1997, when a total of 88 people
died.

<P>
SANTIAGO, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Eduardo Frei
called Wednesday for calm following the arrest of more than 170
people demonstrating over the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the capital's international airport, Frei told
reporters he would make a statement on Pinochet's arrest after
meeting with cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Frei was in Portugal attending a summit of Latin American heads
of state when General Pinochet was arrested in London last
Friday. He could be extradited to Spain to face charges of
murder, torture and genocide.
</P>
<P>
Santiago police detained 177 people Tuesday night following
clashes between supporters and opponents of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Opposition conservative congress members from the Independent
Democratic Union protested Pinochet's arrest in Santiago by
boycotting sessions, while businessmen called for a boycott of
Spanish and British products.
</P>
<P>
Protesting Chilean congressmen held posters saying "Freedom Now
-- No to the Official Kidnapping." Some of the senators included
former high-ranking officers who served during Pinochet's 17-year
rule.
</P>
<P>
Opposition lawmakers gathered an estimated one hundred women
who hurled eggs, sticks and garbage against the Spanish and
British embassies to protest Pinochet's arrest despite efforts by
police to keep them away.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Confirms Census Bureau Director </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate confirmed
Kenneth Prewitt as director of the Census Bureau on Wednesday, a
month after lawmakers warned him to expect strong political
pressure over the use of statistical sampling in the nation's 2000
census.
</P>
<P>
Prewitt, head of New York's Social Science Research Council,
has said that the proper use of sampling -- the statistical
estimation of hard-to-find people -- would improve the census'
accuracy and cut costs. The 1990 census missed an estimated four
million people.
</P>
<P>
But at a confirmation hearing last month, senators told Prewitt
that pressure will mount regardless of how the Supreme Court rules
on sampling.
</P>
<P>
Sampling is strongly opposed by Republicans, who say the
Constitution requires every person to be counted.
</P>
<P>
Census results are used to reapportion seats in the House of
Representatives and to determine distribution of federal funds.
Republicans fear sampling would raise population figures in
previously undercounted urban and minority areas that
traditionally support Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary William Daley, whose department includes the
Census Bureau, called Prewitt "one of the country's most
distinguished social scientists and accomplished executives" in a
statement released after his nomination.
</P>
<P>
In August, a three-judge federal panel killed the Census
Bureau's plans to use sampling. The administration has challenged
that decision, and the Supreme Court is likely to hand down a
final ruling by next Spring.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Ponder Over Kosovo in Few Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the 15-member Security Council for the month
of October, Jeremy Greenstock of United Kingdom, made the
statement at the end of the council's informal consultations on a
draft resolution on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was jointly prepared by Germany, Italy,
the United States, Japan, Portugal and Sweden following an
agreement between U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement was reached after marathon
talks to avert NATO's threat of air strikes against Yugoslavia on
the ground of Belgrade's failure to honor relevant U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We are implementing the agreement in good faith," Vladislav
Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations, told a news conference here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Serb security forces had not carried out "anti-terrorist
activities" for several weeks except in response to direct
attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat also accused Kosovo Albanian
political and rebel leaders of failing to comply with Security
Council resolutions, which called for an immediate ceasefire and
an early beginning of the political dialogue and the recognition
of Serbia's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who formed a majority of the population in

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Found for Oceans on Jupiter's Moons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- New observations of Jupiter by
the Galileo spacecraft provide new evidence suggesting there may
be oceans underneath the ice crust of two of the planet's moons.
</P>
<P>
Previous observations from Galileo, which has been orbiting
Jupiter since December 1995, showed that neither Europa or
Callisto, the two moons, have appreciable internal magnetic
fields.
</P>
<P>
But new data picked up by Galileo found that Europa and
Callisto perturb Jupiter's strong magnetic field as they pass
through it, Krishan Khurana and coleagues of the University of
California, Los Angeles, the United States, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed that with no magnetic fields of their
own, the explanation must lie in induced magnetic fields in
conducting layers below the two moons' surfaces.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon may best be explained by the existence of
subsurface layers of a conductive liquid -- oceans of salty
water," they wrote in the scientific journal Nature.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associates
International (CA), a leading provider of business software in the
U.S., announced a 400,000 square foot expansion of its corporate
headquarters in New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An additional 1,000 employees will be accommodated over the next
year as a result of the expansion and over 8,000 are expected to
be working in the Long Island headquarters instead of the 2,300
now, said CA Chairman and CEO Charles Wang.
</P>
<P>
The project features new office and research and development
facilities and a technical training center.
</P>
<P>
The program was seen as an expression of self-confidence at a
time when a number of U.S. companies are cutting their jobs due to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
CA's revenue rose 17 percent to 4.7 billion U.S. dollars in the
financial year 1998, according to its annual report.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1976 and headquartered on Long Island in 1979, CA's
business has grown to 160 offices in 43 countries with its
workforce increasing to 11,000 worldwide.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End Lower on Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets drifted
lower Wednesday on profit-taking after Wall Street failed to hold
highs by Tuesday's close and saw a subdued start.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking from Tuesday's surge clipped the wings of London
blue chips, although losses were limited by improved hopes for
lower U.K. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 fell 45 to 5,206, just shy of the 5,203 session
low. Volume topped 1 billion shares traded, while second liners
continued their positive trend, the FTSE 250 added 7 to 4,638.
</P>
<P>
Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's October meeting
revealed members were unanimous in voting for a cut, although two
individuals called for a more significant easing than the quarter
of a percentage point which was delivered.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly expect a cut in November and wouldn't rule out a
half a percentage point," said Paribas' Paul Mortimer-Lee.
</P>
<P>
Early omens had been mixed, as a near 3 percent advance by
Tokyo's Nikkei was tempered by the Dow's slide from mid-session
heights Tuesday. The Dow's lackluster showing Wednesday,
meanwhile, only served to knock the Footsie back, to display more
substantial losses Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals are still wobbly but we could now have
approached a turning point," said Jeremy Batstone, equities
strategist at NatWest.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares fell back on profit-taking, too,
after Tuesday's solid advance. The leading Dax index closed down
72 points at 4,523.
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks retreated after Tuesday's confident gains. But
Frankfurt dealings were also tainted with an air of uncertainty,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
"Investors are taking a little break at the moment," said a
Frankfurt-based trader.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks fell back as investors took profits on
Tuesday's rally. But a stable to firmer dollar offered some
support.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. currency is still steady, which means most investors
keep on believing in a Bank of France and a Bundesbank rate cut
before the launch of the euro," said Olivier de la Marche, a
trader at Leven brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
Rate-cut hopes had gained momentum amid comments by Jean-Pierre
Gerard, a member of the Bank of France monetary policy council, to
the French daily Le Monde that France and Germany should lower
their interest rates to counter slowing growth in the two
economies.
</P>
<P>
But some traders had said investors were overreacting to
Gerard's comments. Banking stocks suffered from profit-taking
after surging Tuesday on rate-cut hopes and talk of consolidation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia on Question of U.N. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions should be an
instrument of last resort when all other means had failed,
Malaysia said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the General Assembly on the work
of the Security Council, Malaysian delegate Hasmy Agam said
sanctions should be imposed only if absolutely necessary, and they
should have clear and specific objectives and parameters.
</P>
<P>
Agam said sanctions should also be clearly targeted and have
specified time-frames and appropriate review mechanisms that were
based on a fair and objective evaluation of the effects and
effectiveness of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said sanctions could have enormous negative
effects on innocent and blameless civilians, including women,
children, the aged and the infirm before they achieved their
objective.
</P>
<P>
He said that unless they were perceived as being fair and
effectively carried out through the strong and consistent support
of the international community, sanctions could run the risk of
being challenged, thereby undermining the prestige and the
credibility of the United Nations itself.
</P>
<P>
Agam added that it was extremely important that sanctions were
not perceived as punitive instruments in the hands of one or two
council members who were intent on punishing a particular country
or countries which they did not like.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The importance that the
United Nations Security Council was requested to attach to African
issues must be translated into concrete deeds, China stressed here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the General Assembly on the work
of the Security Council, Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, Shen Guofang, said the prolonged turmoil on
the African continent had evolved against profound historical
background and was the result of various complex internal and
external factors.
</P>
<P>
Shen said China had always been in the position that the
Council should consider seriously the legitimate demand of African
countries, respond positively to their appeal and give effective
support and coordination to the efforts of African countries and
regional organizations in solving the problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Security Council had held meetings at the level
of foreign ministers for two consecutive years to discuss,
exclusively, the problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador expressed the hope that the Council's
discussions on the African issue would go deeper on substantive
issues, so as to find an effective way to help accommodate the
real concern of African countries and promote lasting stability
and development in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday afternoon held informal consultations on the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council was discussing a draft
resolution on Kosovo jointly hammered out by Germany, the United
States, Japan, Portugal and Sweden, he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came following an agreement between U.S. special
envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
which was reached after marathon talks to avert the NATO threat of
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has demanded Belgrade's full and speedy
compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions, but stopped short of
authorizing NATO's use of military force against a sovereign
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman announced that the prosecutor of the
International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour,
is planning to lead an investigation team into Kosovo on November
5.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Serbia's province in February this year.
Since then, ethnic Albanians, who make up some 90 percent of
Kosovo's population of 2 million, have been battling with Serbs
for independence.

official confirmation of the deal.

The deal has apparently defused the weeks-long tension between

<HEADLINE> Split in Lesotho Ruling Party Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Kelebone Maope, the
Deputy Leader of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD),
Wednesday denied rumors that he is planning to break away from
the LCD, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"People are on a band-wagon to discredit our party. Rest
assured, there is no split within the LCD... it's just nonsense,"
Maope was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, SAPA quoted several sources as saying that Maope and
a large number of intellectuals in the LCD were planning to break
away and form a new party, to be called Lesiba la Ntsu (Eagle's
Feather).
</P>
<P>
The sources said LCD leader Pakalitha Mosisili had fallen out
of favor with party members, when he said he would resign and
dissolve parliament should the Langa Commission find fraud in the
May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
The three-nation commission, headed by South African
Constitutional Court judge Pius Langa, was established to
investigate claims by Lesotho opposition parties that the
election was rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Sources alleged that Maope's plans to break away had their
roots in the rivalry that erupted between him and Mosisili when
former prime minister and LCD founder Ntsu Mokhehle resigned in
late May.
</P>
<P>
A compromise deal was struck, making Mosisili party leader and
Maope his deputy.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said a precedent had been set by Mokhehle's
maneuvering during a protracted leadership battle which took
place when he was leader of the Basutholand Congress Party (BCP),
a party he led to victory in the 1993 democratic election.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister resigned from the BCP last June,
formed the LCD, and transferred governance to his new party
immediately -- a move which plunged Lesotho into a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The problem in Lesotho is that if intellectuals within a
party don't agree with their leader, it becomes so easy for them
to just remove that person and put their favorite at the helm," a
source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sources claimed that the splinter group, allegedly supported
by Mokhehle's younger brother, Shakhane, had intended to follow
in the footsteps of the former prime minister and form a
government within parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Maope denied all these claims, saying: "I have no such
intentions. Our party... is more united than ever before."

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Military Bases to Be Returned Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho military bases
secured by South African and Botswanan forces would be handed
over to Lesotho Defense Force by the end of the month, South
African National Defense Force (SANDF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said in a statement in Pretoria that operations to
collect and destroy damaged ammunition started a week ago and
were nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
"It is intended to have the military bases cleared by October
30, and to hand them over to the Lesotho Defense Force again,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from South Africa and Botswana entered Lesotho almost
a month ago under the auspices of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to quell rising unrest sparked by
alleged irregularities in the May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
They ran into resistance from rebel Lesotho soldiers that
resulted in fierce clashes at Makonyane and Ratjimoses military
bases outside Maseru, capital of Lesotho. A Makonyane weapons
and ammunition depot was hit and severely damaged during the
fighting.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Use Neutron Beams to Treat Brain Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 21 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are
investigating ways to perfect a treatment for brain cancer using
neutron beams.
</P>
<P>
The new technique, known as boron neutron capture therapy
(BNCT), is far less traumatic than current treatments and with far
fewer side effects.
</P>
<P>
It works by injecting patients non-toxic boron compound that
accumulates in the brain. A beam of low energy neutrons are then
fired at the tumor area where they react with the compound to
produce cancer-killing nuclear particles.
</P>
<P>
The treatment, already under trial in the United States, is now
only available at nuclear reactor sites where the beams can be
safely generated.
</P>
<P>
Now a team of British scientists are working in Birmingham to
set up the world's first non-reactor site for BNCT, where patients
will be treated in radiotherapy clinics.
</P>
<P>
The researchers are also hoping to improve the compounds used
in the process of BNCT to make treatment more effective.
</P>
<P>
The new compounds will allow radiation treatment to be targeted
more directly to the tumor without causing irreparable damage to
the brain.
</P>
<P>
The research is being carried out on malignant gliomas, which
is resistant to many conventional forms of treatment and new
approaches are urgently needed to help boost survival rates.

Greece has voiced its strong opposition to this formula,
saying if necessary, Athens would resort to the EU court in order
to protect Greece's financial interests.

NANJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese departments plan to
accelerate the introduction of amendments to laws and regulations
in order to strengthen protection for the rights and interests of
Taiwan businesspeople and improve legal services.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the two-day symposium on the theory and
implementation of the Law on Protecting Investment of Taiwan
Businesspeople, which closed today in the city of Kunshan in east
China's Jiangsu Province, agreed that laws and regulations for
protecting Taiwan investment in inland areas must be enhanced to
keep pace with investment growth and expanded reform on the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 government officials in charge of Taiwan
investment affairs in 11 coastal provinces and municipalities and
Taiwan businesspeople attended the symposium at the joint
sponsorship of the Ministry of Justice, the Taiwan Affairs Office
under the State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said the ministry, to which his department belongs,
is drafting regulations to ensure the effective implementation of
the Law on Protecting Investments of Taiwan businesspeople. He
noted that the ministry has solicited extensive opinions from
related departments and local governments since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The draft regulation on the implementation law includes terms
on capital transfers, arbitration procedures, entry and exit
procedures for Taiwan businesspeople and their families members,
the protection of intellectual property rights and various other
related issues, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xinghua, an official with the Ministry of Justice,
acknowledged that inland lawyers have helped a number of Taiwan
businesspeople avoid business losses over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Briefs Iran on Ankara-Damascus Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) - Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem has informed his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi of the
accord signed between Turkey and Syria, the official news agency
IRNA reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Kharrazi on Wednesday, Cem appreciated
the role Iran had played in striking an accord between Turkey and
Syria to defuse their tensions over the issue of Turkish Kurds.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi earlier this month paid a mediation visit to Syria
and Turkey after Ankara accused Damascus of supporting the
Turkish separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) which is fighting
for independence from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria signed an accord on Tuesday and Syria promised
not to support the PKK against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Cem also invited Kharrazi to pay another visit to Ankara to
discuss Ankara-Damascus relations.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Kharrazi said that Iran is ready to continue with its
efforts to bring Turkey and Syria closer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Mahmoud
Mohammadi said on Wednesday that Iran hopes Turkey and Syria would
follow up on their accord with good intention.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Middle East now needs peace and stability, and
any tension and instability would benefit only the common enemies
of the nations in the region.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday called for immediate international help
to overcome poverty of the poor.
</P>
<P>
"The assistance of multilateral and bilateral lenders should
aim at immediately overcoming poverty of the already poor
directly. Endless discussions on the so-called 'new architecture'

Asia is experiencing a rapid increase in poverty as a result of

manipulation, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said the currency devaluation and subsequent economic
recession following the crisis that began in Thailand last year
had hit the rural poor most, particularly the women.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting's theme, "Poverty Amongst Rural Women,
Their Families and Communities", rings a warning bell in this
trying times. It seems timely that a meeting on poverty is held at
a time when Asia and possibly the world are in the throes of
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said businesses had slowed down or folded up and
millions had lost their jobs in the crisis-hit countries while the
people had less money for their food, shelter, health and
education.
</P>
<P>
"Under-consumption worsens the business situation. People are
reduced to a state where they are unable to participate actively
in mainstream community life. Thus, people are not only poor but
are also socially deprived. Joblessness, inflation, food
shortages, mental and physical anguish contribute to the social
unrest with devastating riots, strikes, protests and political
instability increasingly being reported in many countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the present situation was not helped much by self
aggrandizing pronouncements from speculators with sanctimonious
attitudes making unjustifiable attacks on the stricken countries
and urging the investors to pull out their money and invest in
more lucrative markets.
</P>
<P>
He said international response should be strengthened beyond
mobilizing financial support and focused on preventing such crisis
from happening again.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Strives to Remove Defective Components </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest aircraft-maker, said Wednesday that its engineers had
completed efforts to locate a defective wiring component in some
100 jets on the production line.
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokeswoman Yvonne Leach said about 100 jetliners in
production at Boeing's plants in Everett, Renton and Long Beach,
California, were found to contain the suspect component, known as
Burndy blocks.
</P>
<P>
No planes with suspect parts had been delivered to customers,
she added.
</P>
<P>
A Burndy block is an electrical connector that splices together
wiring, said Wolf Glende, chief engineer for Boeing 777 systems.
</P>
<P>
The problem was detected after some of the 18,000 Burndy blocks
received by the company failed testing in the wiring shop before
being installed, Boeing officials said.
</P>
<P>
Burndy blocks, which came from an approved Boeing supplier
between August and September, are found on Being's new-model 737s,
as well as the 747, 757, 767, 777 airplanes and on MD-90 and MD-11.
</P>
<P>
Leach said that, by Wednesday afternoon, the suspect parts were
removed from five planes in Everett and 12 in Renton. But she
noted it is more difficult to remove the parts in planes that are
closer to completion.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sources say the company faces a possible new
production delay if the wiring problems affect more aircraft
closer to completion.

BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China has revised upward the
growth target of its building materials industry this year from
six to seven percent to seven to eight percent, today's Market
Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision by the State Building Materials Industry
Bureau followed the central government's decision to increase the
amount of spending on infrastructure, and the demand created by
post-flood reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
A bureau study of 70 major cement producers showed combined
sales of 5.44 million tons in September, up 19.2 percent from the
same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Plate glass is becoming more expensive, with a study of 23
factories showing prices higher in September than in August, which
was already higher than for the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Plate glass prices had been falling until June, when the bureau
set a bottom price to protect the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The bureau estimates that China will produce 520 million tons
of cement this year, up 1.6 percent from last year, and 170
million weight cases of plate glass, up 2.4 percent.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Incidences of armed
robbery and car theft increased in South Africa in the first half
of this year compared with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of armed robberies per 100,000 people rose from 73.4
to 90, and that of vehicle theft from 110.4 to 117.8, according
to the latest quarterly crime statistics released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,073 vehicle hijackings were reported between
January and June, which represented a 10.6 percent rise on the
same period last year. Most occurred in Gauteng Province, while
KwaZulu-Natal came second.
</P>
<P>
Most hijackings were carried out at weekends, especially on
Friday afternoons and evenings. Most victims were black men.

MAPUTO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament
passed a law Wednesday, banning youths under 18 years of age from
some night clubs.
</P>
<P>
Tarciso Jemusse, parliament member of the Democratic Union

Angelina Enoque, a parliament member from the opposition

would be very helpful in cracking down on some illegal

youths for sex activities.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Beset With Financial Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, October 21 (Xinhua) -- Since the beginning of the
year, Mongolia has been afflicted by serious financial
difficulties, which were expected to grow worse.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the Mongolian financial
deficits in the first nine months of the year hit 50.2 billion
Tughriks (58.4 million U.S. dollars), with revenues totaling 151.6
billion Tughriks (about 176.3 million dollars) and expenditures
201.8 billion Tughriks (234.65 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade dropped by 26.7 percent compared with the same
period last year, with deficits amounting to 119.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the annulment of a previous bank merger has led to a
suspension by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank
of the payment of the promised 45 million dollars for 1998, which
was described by the acting Minister of Finance Bat-edrdene
Batbayar as "adding salt in the wounds."
</P>
<P>
Batbayar said Mongolia was still incapable of taking commercial
loans but had to rely on 40-year-long preferential loans provided
by foreign countries with interest rate lower than one percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's annual expenditures were about 500
million dollars, three fifths of which could be self-earned. The
remaining 200 million dollars came from the preferential loans and
grants provided by foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
Mongolian acting Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorij said the
adverse external conditions were largely to be blamed for the
country's current financial predicament.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going financial crisis in Asia and the deepening
economic and financial crisis in Russia had directly affected the
Mongolian economy.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the financial difficulties have already developed into
a financial crisis. To ease the crisis, the Great Hural
(parliament) has passed a resolution authorizing the issue of 20
billion Tughriks in national debts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government departments have stepped up
tax-collection efforts but to little avail.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Try to Prevent Impending Doctors' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliamentary
committee on social service Wednesday pleaded with the Uganda
Medical Workers Union (UMWU) to call off their impending strike
and ask the government to solve the problems through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
The committee made this appeal in response to the UMWU's
planned strike on November 29, demanding better working
conditions and payment, the New Vision paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The UMWU members should think twice on the deadline and
withhold the strike until all channels have been tried, Jane
Akwero, a woman MP from northern district of Gulu was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
UMWU President Apollo Nyangansi said the workers have resorted
to striking because of absence of a mechanism through which they
can air their grievances.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, President Yoweri Museveni said that the
medical workers are underpaid and promised to solve the problem
soon.
</P>
<P>
But he fiercely opposed strikes by the medical staff, because
he said if the doctors who control people's lives go on strike,
some patients may die.
</P>
<P>
He said he would sack the doctors who go to the street instead
of expressing their complaints through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, ILO Sign Agreement on Eliminating Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) and the Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and
Exporters Association (PCMEA) Thursday inked an agreement aiming
to phase out child labor from the carpet industry, the country's
largest cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by ILO Deputy Director General K.
Tapiola, who is visiting Pakistan this week, and representatives
of the PCMEA here Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It is the beginning of a long-term commitment of the ILO and
the government and people of Pakistan to work together towards a
total elimination of child labor in the production of carpets in
the country," Tapiola said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also reflects a commitment on the part of the
carpet manufacturers in Pakistan to address child labor "in a
responsible manner, not by removing the children from the
workplace but rather by transferring them from the weaving looms
to the educational centers," he added.
</P>
<P>
A project jointly funded the U.S. Department of Labor and the
PCMEA, will start in December this year under the frame work of
the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor which
has been active in Pakistan since 1994, according to a press
release issued by ILO.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this project is to eliminate child labor among
children under the age of 14 in the production of carpets in
Pakistan by gradually phasing them out of the workplace and
providing them with educational opportunities and other options.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the project will target at least 8,000 children
working in the carpet industry including some 2,000 of their
younger siblings and their families.
</P>
<P>
The carpet-weaving industry is the largest cottage industry in
Pakistan. In 1996-1997, Pakistan exported about 3 million square
meters of carpet valued at about 7.5 billion rupees ( 150 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas families have been weaving carpets for
generations. Children, particularly girls, and adults who face a
lack of opportunities for work outside the home often spend long
hours working at the looms.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Increase Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Official statistics show
substantial growth in personal savings deposits in the Chinese
capital for the first nine months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Personal savings through the end of September hit 216.4 billion
yuan, up 18.89 billion yuan on beginning year figures and one
billion yuan more than the pervious year's figure, according to
statistics released by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of
China, the nation's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Demand deposits accounted for 53.9 percent of the total, up
23.8 percentage points on an annual basis. The proportion of term
deposits fell by 23.8 percentage points to 46.08 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the accelerated growth in personal savings
to the declining interest in stocks sparked by the adverse impact
of financial turmoil sweeping Asia.
</P>
<P>
Recent treasury bond issues also contributed to the resurgence
of personal savings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that bonds valued at 27.4 billion yuan, or 99.9
percent of planned issues in Beijing, had been sold by the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the displacement of workers due to poor corporate
efficiency have cooled optimism about income prospects and more
people have turned to savings accounts.

<HEADLINE> Soda Manufacturers Criticized for Targeting Schoolchildren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 21 (Xinhua) -- The battle field of cola
war has expanded to U.S. schools Wednesday, when a consumer group
criticized soda makers of paying for the installation of vending
machines on campuses.
</P>
<P>
According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest
(CSPI), schoolchildren had become a key target for soda makers who
are willing to pay school boards up to 15 dollars a student for
exclusive marketing rights that include vending machines,
corporate logos on athletic scoreboards, free coupons and other
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 schools have signed exclusive marketing
agreements with soda companies this year, and the stepped-up pace
of school merchandising worries some teachers, parents and school
administrators, said the organization.
</P>
<P>
The CSPI urged the Clinton administration to study the public
health impact of soft drink, ban it from public schools, put an
end to advertisements that target at school children, and impose
special taxes on sodas to fund health education campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soda industry executives were quick to accuse the
group of promoting "unfounded consumer alarm", saying that banning
or taxing sodas was not the way to change the diet of Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Soft drinks have never pretended to be anything more than a
nice refreshment product and consumers are smart enough to make
their own choices," said Jim Finkelstein of the National Soft
Drink Association.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Ranks as Third Largest Overseas Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Taiwanese investors have pumped
40.16 billion U.S. dollars into contracted investments in the
Chinese mainland over the past two decades, making the island the
nation's third largest overseas investor.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said today that Taiwanese business
people have initiated 40,608 projects in the Chinese mainland,
with actual investments standing at 20.86 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the regional financial crisis led a drop in
Taiwanese investments during the first nine months of the year,
with the volume actually used falling by 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the decline was lower than the average level in terms of
total overseas investments in the same period, the official told a
symposium on the protection of Taiwanese investment which opened
this morning in Kunshan, Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Taiwanese investments are concentrated in coastal provinces
such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian and Shandong, as well as the
city of Shanghai, said Wan Hui, director of MOFTEC's Department of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Trends indicate that Taiwanese investments are moving towards
capital-intensive industries such as manufacturing, real estate,
service, construction and agricultural sectors, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The extension of investment terms from 15-20 years to 20-30
years has sparked a steady expansion in volume, Wang added.

<HEADLINE> Many Lebanese Lack of Basic Needs: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Over a third of Lebanese is
living without such basic needs as heating, proper education or a
car, the daily Star quoted an official survey as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by a team of officials from the social
affairs ministry and a U.N. development program, showed that
214,000 households, or 1,095,000 individuals, live in shortage of
basic needs, which make up 35.2 percent of the country's total
population.
</P>
<P>
The study employed a new U.N. method, the "Unsatisfied Basic
Needs," using 11 indicators to measure the level of basic needs
of households and individuals, such as location, education,
housing services, car ownership and the job of household's head.
</P>
<P>
The outcome showed that about 58 percent of the deprived people
live in urban areas, particularly in Beirut and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
And the proportion of poverty is relatively higher among
families headed by women or with more children, and among the
elderly. Near 60 percent of the heads of deprived households
are wage-earners, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
It also said that over 70 percent of those deprived families do
not have their own cars and 13 percent live without heating. But most
deprived households are connected to the public water network and
sewage system, and have their own houses.
</P>
<P>
The study proposed the government formulate policies to raise
wages, create more jobs, lower the prices of commodities and cut
charges of services such as health and education.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The city of Zhuhai in south
China's Guangdong province is becoming more attractive to foreign
investors as the return of Macao to the mainland approaches.
</P>
<P>
The 3-sq km Zhuhai Bonded Zone is the largest of the six in
Guangdong. Although it is still at a preliminary stage, it has
already got a dozen overseas investment projects, involving a
billion Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Xiang, director of the zone's Administrative
Committee, the zone has targeted at investment from international
giants, with the focus put on the information industry.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to Macao, the zone will take advantage of its location
to get investment from multinationals, he said, adding that the
zone will try to play the role of a bridge between the mainland
and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
At present, negotiations are underway for the establishment of
more than 20 foreign investment projects in the bonded zone for
infrastructure, electronics, medicines, and packing materials.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Invests 420 Millions Dollars in Ex-Soviet Republics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Direct investment in the former
Soviet republics by South Korea's top five largest conglomerates
amounts to 420 million U.S. dollars, said the Ministry of Finance
and Economy Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five largest chaebols -- Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and
SK -- have invested 52 million U.S. dollars in Russia, 106 million
dollars in Kazakhstan, 109 million dollars in Uzbekistan and 153
million dollars in Ukraine as of the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo is the largest investor in the region with 379 million
dollars, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of total investment
by the five chaebols, followed by Hyundai with 29 million dollars,
Samsung 7.8 million dollars, LG 3.9 million dollars and SK 255,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, more active in the region than other South Korean
business groups, will suffer a severe setback if Russia's
financial crisis persists. Russia has declared a moratorium on its
external debt, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and other former Soviet republics in the region depend
on Russia economically. The International Monetary Fund's failure
to rescue the Russian economy will deal a fatal blow to them.

LOS ANGELES, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists in
California said Thursday that they had detected new evidence of
underground oceans on two of Jupiter's moons, supporting the hopes
of finding life there.
</P>
<P>
A team from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA),
the California Institute of Technology and NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory published their findings in the latest issue of the
journal Nature on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The scientists hypothesized the existence of underground seas
from data collected by the Galileo spacecraft which measured
strong disturbances to Jupiter's magnetic field as it zipped past
Europa and Callisto, two of Jupiter's moons.
</P>
<P>
"One could expect life in such oceans," said Krishan Khurana, a
geophysicist at UCLA.

<HEADLINE> Rampant Illegal Timber Trade Worries Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
worried over the rampant illegal timber trade since the country
is losing billions of Kwacha in the timber industry through fraud
and illegal dealings between some forestry officers and license
holders.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at a seminar for timber concession license holders
in Lusaka Wednesday, Alfeyo Hambayi, minister of Environment and
Natural Resources, expressed concern at the manner in which
timber is being smuggled out of the country, said Zambia Daily
Mail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi noted there is enough evidence that the discrepancy
between timber production and revenue receipts has led to loss of
government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The state should be able to raise three billion Kwacha (about
1.5 million U.S. Dollars) annually from the sale of timber,
according to the minister, but it fails to reach the target due
to illegal timber exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Commercial license holders are allowed to cut a maximum of 600
trees in a month but in most cases they bribe the forestry
officers, resulting in 3,000 trees being cut, disclosed Hambayi.
</P>
<P>
The most affected areas are Western and Southern provinces
where reserves have been depleted at alarming levels.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi also revealed that his ministry has got information
that a lot of unprocessed timber is being smuggled by foreigners
using helicopters and by road.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government, Hambayi warned, will mete out
stringent measures against any erring individuals or companies to
protect the forest reserves from any further depletion.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to guard trees and other natural resources
to avert possible environmental degradation.

TOKYO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan received a cool response
from the United Nations Thursday when its Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to give
Japan greater responsibilities within the world body.
</P>
<P>
Komura, who made the request while meeting with Annan on the
U.N. reform, sought the greater position to reflect the financial
contribution Japan has made to the international organization,
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan only responded that he will make further efforts
to bring about the U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the second largest financial contributor to the United
Nations following the United States. Japan and Germany, the third
largest contributor, are seeking U.N. Security Council permanent
seats.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Annan and Komura agreed on the need to
tackle the problem of firearms, with the United Nations playing a
central role.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was here for the Second Tokyo International
Conference on African Development, will conclude his three-day
visit to Japan later on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Strengthen Management of Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen vowed Thursday to take strong measures to control
the illegal logging and timber exports in order to keep the
sustainability of the forest and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made an important speech on a rally to mark King
Norodom Sihanouk's 76th birthday, the Independence Day (November
9) and the 7th anniversary of the signing of Paris Peace Accords
on Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen admitted in his speech," the forest issue is the
weakest point of the Royal Government of the first term. The
anarchy in logging happened seriously during the period of 1994 to
1998. We can say that in the past four years the forest have been
most seriously destroyed in the thousand-year history of
Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups warned logging in Cambodia is out of
control and Cambodia's forest will be logged out within three to
five years unless the industry can be properly regulated.
</P>
<P>
To keep the sustainability of the forest, which is the rare
natural resource, and protect the environment, the Royal
Government declared four point measures:
</P>
<P>
-- To put an end to permission for the investment in wood
processing;
</P>
<P>
-- To begin to review all contracts on forest concession, and
cancel the contracts having yet to be implemented. The forest
zones belonging to the canceled contracts should not be granted to
any other company, but be set in the reserve zones or wildlife
refuge or national parks under the strict management of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and the local
authorities;
</P>
<P>
-- As for the forest concession which implemented in accordance
with the contracts must equip with more modern processing means in
order to increase the wood value as well as the employment for the
people;
</P>
<P>
-- To conduct a review on the draft law on the forest
management and prepare decree on the forest management. Those who
are involved in illegal logging or illegal export must be
identified and punished immediately.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, IMF Loan Talks Underway: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Advisor to Prime Minister on
Finance and Economic Affairs Hafiz Pasha Thursday said that talks
were underway with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank on a loan program.
</P>
<P>
Pasha stated this while addressing a press conference at the
head office of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in Karachi, the
official Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
"Though, the IMF mission has postponed its scheduled visit on
October 21 to Pakistan, negotiations are still on," Pasha said,
adding that the government intends to continue talks with the two
bodies.
</P>
<P>
However, an IMF spokesman has said in Washington that the
resumption of discussions "depends to a great degree on the
satisfactory resolution of the government's conflict with
independent power producers (IPPs) over power tariffs."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Pakistan suspended a power purchase
agreement with British-run Hub Power Co. (Hubco), alleging the
company bribed officials to raise power tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The country earlier suspended contracts with several other IPPs
and issued notices to others over alleged bribes to secure deals.
</P>
<P>
The IMF-Pakistan talks, which began in September, are aimed at
reviving a 1.56-billion-dollar Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF), which was suspended after Pakistan detonated
nuclear blasts in May.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves were down from 1.43
billion dollars in May to about 600 million dollars this week,
equivalent to just over two weeks worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
The country's external debts stand at 32 billion dollars and it
has reportedly to pay around 1 billion dollars in debt servicing
by December.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian House Passes New Bill on Expression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian House of
Representatives in its plenary session here Thursday unanimously
approved the bill on the freedom of expression and passed it into
a law.
</P>
<P>
All of the House's factions, in giving their final views,
expressed their approval of the bill, which will regulate citizens
wishing to express their opinion in public in a manner free from
any physical and psychological pressure, in conformity with the
freedom guaranteed in Article 28 of the 1945 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
They all agreed that the freedom to express opinion in public
is a basic right of every citizen.
</P>
<P>
After all the factions had given their final view of the bill,
the session's chairman, Deputy Speaker Hari Sabarno, asked if all
House members agreed to pass the bill into a law and the members
unanimously gave their agreement.
</P>
<P>
The bill was submitted by the government on October 2 to
replace the government regulation in lieu of law on freedom of
expression which was turned down by the legislative body last
month.
</P>
<P>
The bill contains seven chapters and 20 articles plus
explanations. Article one of the bill stipulates clearly that it
is "every citizen's right" to air their opinions, either in
writing or verbally in public spaces. Opinions can be aired in the
form of street protests, rallies, public gatherings and
free-speech fora.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, protests cannot be staged at the presidential
and vice presidential palaces, religious buildings, military
installations, hospitals, airports and seaports, train stations,
bus terminals and other places of vital national interest.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill does allow for protests to be staged within a
certain radius of sites designated in the bill.
</P>
<P>
Protests can be staged 100 meters away from the presidential
palace fence, 150 meters away from military installations and 500
meters away from other strategically important sites.
</P>
<P>
Protests are banned on national holidays.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the controversial original draft of the bill, the bill
states that no police permit is required for people to exercise
their freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Article 10 states that people need only notify the police in
writing three days in advance before staging a protest in a public
space. The police are obliged under Article 13 to issue a receipt
soon after they receive notification. If canceled, protest
organizers must notify the police 24 hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
Religious activities and campus activities do not need any
notification whatsoever, the bill says.
</P>
<P>
In a further departure from the original draft of the bill, the
number of protesters is no longer limited. However, for every 100
participants involved, a further one to five persons must make
themselves responsible for any mishaps or trouble which occurs.
This stipulation is meant to ensure the "free and responsible"
exercise of freedom of expression.

Al Ahram:
</P>

</P>
<P>
The spokesman of Turkish Foreign Ministry has said that the
positive role played by Mubarak led to the signing of an detente

</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Visiting Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides is to
meet Mubarak Thursday following his talks with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement Wednesday to encourage
investment and eliminate dual taxation, which will pave the way
for a more cemented bilateral economic cooperation, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Colombian intelligence said Wednesday it has detained an
Egyptian who was suspected of one of the terrorists involved in

after he arrived in Colombia via Ecudor, sources with the
intelligence said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Acknowledges Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday acknowledged that the democratic system is quite
complicated as it thrives only among people who think maturely.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy can only thrive if the people have the
broad-mindedness and the tolerance to accept different opinions in
a condition where heterogeneity is respected," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 5th national congress of the ruling Golkar
(Functional Group)-affiliated organization AMPI at the State
Palace here, Habibie said democracy could develop only if all
parties are ready to uphold political ethics, justice and legal
norms.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, democracy will only turn into a joke that will make
the people laugh. Moreover, democracy can turn into anarchy if the
political activists are immature in terms of attitude," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the reform process, the president stressed that the process
should be conducted democratically.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to achieve democracy through anarchic ways,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded the people that democracy is not identical with the
freedom to curse or slander one another. On the contrary,
democracy should respect differences even if one group disagrees
with another group's ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In democracy, every party has the right to exist and to be
respected, the president said, adding that the only party that
does not deserve this right is one whose ideology is against
democracy itself.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Continues Peace Efforts in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Deputy envoy Dame Ann
Hercus met Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides Thursday to continue
the U.N. efforts to revive the Cyprus peace talks within the
bi-communal formula.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting between the U.N. Special
Representative for Cyprus and Clerides.
</P>
<P>
"I have had a meeting with Mr. Clerides this morning, I'll have
a meeting with Mr. (Rauf) Denktash (Turkish Cypriot leader)
tomorrow and I'll have another meeting with Clerides on Friday
next week," Hercus told reporters after the 50-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
But she refused to give more details about their talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a breakaway republic
in 1983, which is recognized only by their close ally Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula.
</P>
<P>
But the peace talks broke down last year when Denktash walked
out of the negotiations to protest against a European Union
decision to start accession talks with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also raised a proposal in August, calling for the
establishment of a confederation of two equal states in Cyprus,
which met strong opposition from Greek Cypriot-dominated
government and the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The fresh round of U.N. efforts, which began last week, is
"with a goal of reducing tensions and promoting progress toward a
just and lasting settlement," Hercus said.
</P>
<P>
Hercus had discussions with Clerides and Denktash respectively
last Friday and Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> WBC Boss Wants Holyfield-Lewis Fight in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Council
(WBC) president Jose Sulaiman says he will push for the
heavyweight unification title bout between Lennox Lewis and
Evander Holyfield to be staged in South Africa, national
newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman, who arrived in Johannesburg Wednesday for next
week's annual convention of the world sanctioning body, said he
will talk to U.S. promoter Don King about a request by South
African President Nelson Mandela that the fight be hosted in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Englishman Lewis is the WBC champion; American Holyfield holds
the World Boxing Association (WBA) and the International Boxing
Federation(IBF) titles.
</P>
<P>
The fight is scheduled for March after Holyfield was
guaranteed a 20-million-U.S. Dollar purse by King.
</P>
<P>
"I will return to talk to King to find out what can be done,"
Sulaiman said. "I will talk to him strongly and profoundly. I
will try to bring it here... If it's possible to bring
Lewis-Holyfield here, we will."
</P>
<P>
King, the promoter of the long-awaited bout to unify Lewis'
WBC crown and Holyfield's WBA and IBF titles, is the only
promoter to have staged an undisputed heavyweight title match in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
That was the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and
George Foreman in 1974 in the then Zaire, now the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
On hosting the convention in South Africa from October 25-31,
Sulaiman said it was part of the WBC's commitment to bring the
sport to the continent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Africa is the future of boxing. We want you to
keep them (the boxers), support them, not let them go," he said,
adding that many boxers from Africa were based overseas.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said the convention would salute President Mandela
and honor former WBC junior lightweight champion Azumah Nelson of
Ghana as the greatest world champion born in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman predicted Mike Tyson, who was given permission to
fight again by the U.S. authorities this week, will become a
world champion again. He described Tyson as a man with "the worst
mental strength I have seen in my life in boxing".
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said he intends inviting Tyson to the convention "if
I can get in touch with him". But he said it would be difficult
because Tyson has just been given his license and will have to
undergo medical tests.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said he hopes this year's amalgamation of the oldest
organizations -- the WBC and the WBA -- will trigger other
organizations joining them, thus whittling down the number of
"world" sanctioning bodies.
</P>
<P>
The WBC and the WBA harmonized their fight rules in May to
pave the way for undisputed title bouts in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang said here today at a routine press
conference that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's coming visit to
Russia is believed to further develop the friendly and cooperative
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the strategic partnership between China and
Russia is a new type of state-to-state relations which is based on
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistance, characterized by
non-alignment and non-confrontation, and not targeted at a third
country.
</P>
<P>
Such a relationship can be summed up as one of mutual respect
and trust, equality, sincerity to each other, mutual benefit and
cooperation for world peace and common development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Russian ties witnessed smooth development in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
On the coming Russian defense minister's China visit, Tang said
that the two armed forces have also set up cooperative ties of
mutual trust, equality and mutual benefit as the relations between
the two countries grow. The frequent contacts between the leaders
of the two armies and the exchange of visits by military
delegations have enhanced mutual understanding and trust and
boosted further cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-Russian military cooperation is in the
fundamental interest of the two peoples and beneficial to the
regional and global peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such cooperation is not targeted at a third
country.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Editor-in-chief of the banned
daily Tous, Mashallah Shamsulvaezin, has been released on bail,
the Public Relations Department of Iran's judiciary announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Shamsulvaezin, who was freed Wednesday night, was the last of
Tous' four detained members released by the conservative
judiciary, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Tous' publisher Mohammad Javad Hessari and columnist Ebrahim
Nabavi were released on bail Wednesday while another member Hamid
Reza Jalaeipour was set free on bail last week following a
petition by his mother to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The four men were arrested last month on charges of launching
activities against national security and interests.
</P>
<P>
Tous, which was named after an ancient Iranian city, was
ordered to close on September 16 for publishing material with
defamatory character against the late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The daily has all along had troubles with the powerful
conservative-dominated judiciary as it, believed by many,
strongly supports the moderate President Mohammad Khatami and has
vowed to fight for freedom of expression in the country.

strike as they have made their point known.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Thursday quoted ZCTU General-Secretary Alec
Chirwa as saying that the teachers should now leave the matter in
the hands of the Zambia National Union of Teachers (ZNUT).
</P>
<P>
He noted that teachers have a valid reason which should be
looked at seriously by the Ministry of Education in particular
and the government in general.
</P>
<P>
The issue of poor salaries and conditions of service for all
public services workers is not new but ZCTU is disappointed with
the government for taking too long to address the plight of the
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirwa also called on public service unions to take advantage
of the lapsing of the wage freeze and open negotiations with the
government so that they can be concluded in good time.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, striking teachers in Livingstone,
southern Zambia, have vowed never to return to class despite the
appeal made earlier this week by Education Minister Godfrey
Miyanda.
</P>
<P>
ZNUT's provincial organizing secretary Keith Mabuku said that
all the teachers from 26 primarychools in the district of
Livingstone are on strike and will only meet Friday to review the
minister's appeal.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 pupils in the district are affected because of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Teachers in Livingstone and many other parts of the country
have been on strike for one month demanding better conditions of
service and wages.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's GDP to Grow 1 Percent Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok of Thailand Governor
Chatumongol Sonakul said Wednesday at the central bank that he
expects Thailand's gross domestic product to grow 1 percent next
year with inflation rate and interest rates falling by at the end
of this year, the Thai News agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand's gross domestic product is expected to see 1
percent growth in 1999 compared to about 7 percent contraction in
this year projected by economists.
</P>
<P>
He said that inflation will be 8 percent for 1998, lower than
International Monetary Fund estimates of 9.2 percent. He added
that it won't exceed 5 percent in 1999, which would mark a return
to levels common before an economic crisis hit Thailand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief attributed the declining purchasing
power of Thai consumers, and the stability of the country's
currency, the baht, as the reasons for improved inflation figures.
</P>
<P>
The stable baht will also help bring down interest rates at
banks to 12-13 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The baht is at an 11-month high against the dollar, trading at
37.85 to the dollar early Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Reunion Mining, a British
company, has made an offer to buy Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) Mufulira mine and the government is expect to
respond to it in two weeks, Zambia Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Angola-American Corporation (AAC) has asked
for a two-week extension to make a final decision regarding the
purchase of Nkana mine.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye as
saying Wednesday that although Reunion Mining's offer is
attractive, it has been submitted to experts for evaluation
before the government could make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the sale of a mine is a complex matter which
needs extensive consultation and broad based consideration on
various matters such as labor and environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is not only looking at the purchase
price but other factors which affect the social set-up of the
mining towns in which the mines are based.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that AAC has asked for a two-week extension
from its original October 12 deadline of the presentation of a
due diligence report on Nkana mine, upon which it will decide to
buy the mine or not.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised privatization package, Nkana mine is to be
combined with the Konkola Deep Mining project which AAC has been
interested in for some years.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been trying to quicken the
privatization of ZCCM but failed to complete the process in the
first half of this year as planned.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the cost of Nkana and Nchanga mines,
two biggest mines of the country, Zambia discontinued the
negotiations with the Kafue consortium last April over the sale
of the two mines, which accounts for 65 percent of ZCCM assets.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Reform on Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's
Procuratorate issued an impeachment regulation today as part of an
effort to eliminate corruption in government bodies and prevent
certain unlawful practices in procuratorial departments.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Beijing, Deputy Procurator
General Zhang Qiong said the impeachment system under revision
covers investigations of government employees involved in bribery,
embezzlement and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation provides checks and balances to ensure
appropriate actions by procuratorial bodies in charge of
corruption investigations," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Investigations of corruption cases, arrest authorizations and
eventual prosecutions were formerly the responsibility of one
procuratorial department. However, the functions have been the
responsibility of separate departments since introduction of the
anti-corruption campaign in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation divides investigation procedures into
several categories which are handled by reporting agencies,
anti-corruption bureaus, disciplinary departments and examination,
prosecution and appeals departments.
</P>
<P>
The regulation requires different departments to reexamine
investigation results.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates will practice a collective decision-making
system to avoid decisions made by one person, and senior
procuratorates will offer strengthened guidance to departments on
lower levels. said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that directors of
anti-corruption bureaus will rotated to other positions or
departments on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that procuratorate departments will improve
efficiency, and welcome public and media supervision.

NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An Indian noted geophysicist,
Dr. J. G. Negi said Thursday that the industrialized nations are
the main culprits behind atmosphere pollution and depletion of
ozone layer causing global warming phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The panic being created over global warming and greenhouse
effect is guided by vested economic interests of industrialized
nations. India need not fear the global warming phenomenon since
its contribution of greenhouse gas emissions is negligible
compared with developed countries, Press Trust of India (PTI)
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The emission of carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons
and other greenhouse gases from Western countries touched around
2,500 million tones per year while the contribution of entire
developing nations was around 1,000 million tones, he said.

<HEADLINE> 500 TB-Infected Buffalo Culled in S. African Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- At least 500 buffalo
infected with tuberculosis have been culled in Kruger National
Park, with poisoned darts, South African Press Association
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The culling was concentrated in the northern, southern, and
central areas of the park, the biggest nature reserve in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
JJ van Altena, one of the culling co-ordinators, was quoted as
saying that the culling had been going on for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
There are about 20,000 buffalo in the park, according park
staff.
</P>
<P>
Kruger National Park authorities have been trying to establish
the level of infection and the spread of TB because lions in the
park eating infected buffalo carcasses were contracting TB.
</P>
<P>
The disease reportedly had spread to cheetah, at least one
leopard, kudu and baboons.
</P>
<P>
About one month ago, 32 of 33 lions in south of the Sabie
River were confirmed as having TB.
</P>
<P>
Johan Krige, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture
said late September that lions in the Kruger National Park were
being ravaged by an incurable and deadly bovine strain of TB
which could kill them all.
</P>
<P>
Lions have no natural resistance to the disease, spread to
them from herds of infected buffalo, a study by academics from
the University of Pretoria's Veterinary Sciences faculty.
</P>
<P>
There are well over 1,000 lions in the park, according to a
park official.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Takes Measures to Protect Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government will
take "appropriate security" measures to ensure strict protection
of all oil installations including pipelines in the country, the
Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) said.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting of the PRC, Nigeria's ruling body, the
General Officer Commanding of Mechanized Division of the Nigerian
Army, Major General Sarki Muktar said Wednesday in Abuja that
"appropriate security will be put in place for the surveillance
of oil installations," press reports here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the responsibility to guard against future
recurrence was not only that of the government but also of the
communities, adding that "they have their roles to play because
of the distance of the pipelines installations".
</P>
<P>
After last Saturday's oil pipeline fire tragedy which killed
more than 700 people, the Nigerian government has decided to
launch a full-scale investigation into the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Dalhatu Bayero, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, was quoted by Vanguard newspaper
as saying Wednesday in Abuja that anyone implicated over the
vandalization of the oil pipelines is to be arraigned for
sabotage before the court.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is to deter others who might want to
vandalize oil facilities in the country, adding that a panel was
set up at a top management meeting to look into what led to
Saturday's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The Pipeline and Products Marketing Company (PPMC) gave its
own accounts of the events while conducting newsmen round the
scene Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
James Ogungbemi, PPMC Executive Director in charge of the
company's operation, attributed the incident to vandals who
allegedly removed the pipeline's valve pit with the intention of
siphoning fuel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the team of fire fighters assembled last Saturday
by the Delta State government had withdrawn their fire fighting
equipment Monday after efforts to extinguish the raging inferno
proved abortive.
</P>
<P>
When a team of top officials of the PPMC in charge of the
pipelines visit the fire site Tuesday along with local energy
correspondents, the pillar of fire was still raging.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is due to have talks with Rwandan Vice President
Paul Kagame in Pretoria Thursday with the two sides focusing on
regional conflicts in the Great Lake region, the President's
office said.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted presidential aide Parks
Mankahlana as saying that the talks would be confidential, and
that no details would be released.
</P>
<P>
The talks are believed to be part of Mandela's renewed effort
to broker peace in the civil war of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), the latest in the long line of failed attempts.
</P>
<P>
Mandela Monday held "confidential discussions" in Pretoria
with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni. His office
announced then that other meetings were planned over the next
nine days with a DRC rebel delegation, and Namibian President Sam
Nujoma in addition to talks with Kagame.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK No Longer Expensive Destination for Tourists: Tourist Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is no longer an
expensive destination as it had grown into during the boom years,
Lo Yuk Sui, Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The free market practices have enabled Hong Kong to have prices
 down to stimulate demand and help it remain competitive against
devalued currencies and sharply reduced spending power. And this
was reflected in healthier arrivals and occupancy levels in Hong
Kong's hotels in recent months. "I am confident that we are well
set to prosper from the inevitable upturn in our industry," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lo made these comments when presenting the HKTA's 1997/1998
Annual Report at the Association's 40th Annual General Meeting
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lo explained that he was not suggesting that the heavy
price-cut can be sustained indefinitely. "But at least the message
is permeating through our source markets that Hong Kong is no
longer the expensive destination it has grown into during the boom
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lo praised the cooperative partnership among all sectors of the
tourism industry that has grown out of the downturn and thanked
the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government for its support
including tax breaks and recent decision to appoint a Commissioner
for Tourism.
</P>
<P>
But the HKTA chief warned that the future would not be all
roses. "The next year is going to be as tough as the last one,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Although China's mainland offers the best hope for continued
growth, Hong Kong SAR has to emphasize the need to maintain
international image by continuing to attract the top end of the
market and explore the potential of secondary cities in major
market regions as well as new markets as India, Russia and Middle
East countries, Lo continued.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA needs to re-package the product for changing eras, as
well as to upgrade and improve both the product and the standard
and quality of human resources and services. And investment in the
future is also needed, Lo added.

<HEADLINE> HK Insurance Industry Grows 12 percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong insurance industry
grew by 12.4 percent in 1997 in terms of premium income, compared
with a 5.6 percent increase in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisional statistics released Thursday by
Commissioner of Insurance Alan Wong, the total premium income of
general business (excluding Lloyd's, which is subject to a
different reporting system) and long term business amounted to 52
billion HK dollars (6.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997,
representing about 3.9 percent of Hong Kong gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
General business gained growth in 1997 after a dismal
performance in 1996. Despite the Asian financial crisis which
began in the latter half of 1997, gross premiums grew by 5.3
percent to 19.5 billion HK dollars (2.5 billion U.S. dollars) for
the year.
</P>
<P>
Property damage business remained the largest class, accounting
for 31 percent of the total gross premiums, followed by general
liability business representing 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Net premiums after reinsurance grew at a slightly lower rate of
5 percent to 12.6 billion HK dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in
1997, which is attributable to the mild decrease in the retention
ratio from 65 percent in 1996 to 64.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the growth in premium income, the general
insurance industry, after enjoying an underwriting profit for four
consecutive years, suffered an underwriting loss of 60 million HK
dollars (7.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Long term business continued to register a double digit growth
rate of 17 percent in 1997," Wong said. The total office premiums
in force increased to 32.5 billion HK dollars (4.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Individual life business remained the major type of long term
business, contributing some 70 percent of total office premiums.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional financial turmoil "has clearly begun to
impact negatively on the insurance industry in 1998," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
For example, gross premiums of general business for the first
half of 1998 amounted to 9.7 billion HK dollars, representing a
slight drop of 1.1 percent against the same period of 1997, while
underwriting result continued to deteriorate with a loss of 200
million HK dollars (25.6 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As at September 30,1998, there were 212 authorized insurers
doing business in Hong Kong. As regards insurance intermediaries,
there were 321 insurance brokers and 40,723 insurance agents.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Carpet Woven in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- World's biggest hand-woven
carpet has been produced in the city of Ben in Iran's western
province of Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari, the official news agency IRNA
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the provincial welfare department Siyavash
Ahmadi said Thursday that the carpet of 1,000 square meters was
produced over a span of three years by 84 weavers.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadi said the carpet, with a cost of about 500 million rials
(about 166,000 U.S. dollars) was valued at 1.2 billion rials
(about 400,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Iran is well-known for its traditional hand-woven carpet,
which ranks first in the country's non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the Iranian carpet industry has been
challenged in the world market by products of China and India.

LOS ANGELES, October 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday declared 20 counties in the state of Texas as disaster
areas, making them eligible for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
State officials have put preliminary damage estimates at about
400 million U.S. dollars. Flooding across central and southern
Texas worsened Wednesday due to continuing rain.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain, as a result of humid air streaming off two
hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Mexico, has
caused floods in about 60 of the 254 counties in Texas. Governor
George W. Bush Tuesday asked President Clinton to declare 20
counties disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two people have died from the storms since nearly two
feet of rain fell over the weekend. In the Houston area, an
estimated 5,000 homes were flooded, while at least 2,000 people in
Cuero, a city of 7,000 in Dewitt County, were homeless.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of cattle are missing after weekend rains
caused four major rivers in southern and central Texas to flow
over their banks, uprooting fences on flooded ranches and farms.
</P>
<P>
The latest city to fall victim of the flooding, local officials
say, is Wharton, a low-lying town of 10,200 about 50 miles
southwest of Houston where 40 percent of the homes are threatened
by the flooded Colorado River.
</P>

MANILA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- At least four persons have been
killed by typhoon Babs which Thursday blew from the central
Philippines to the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The casualties are expected to go up due to strong winds and
heavy rains brought about by Babs, the ninth typhoon to hit the
country this year, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and
Astronomical Service Administration (PAGASA) said.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon is slamming Metro Manila and nearby provinces. In
Metro Manila, strong warning signal No. 3 was declared and all
government agencies and schools were closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, PAGASA said the typhoon's strength is weakening from a
maximum speed of 235 kilometers per hour to 180 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
Babs is mild when compared with supertyphoon Zeb which crossed
the country on October 14-15, leaving 86 people dead and a heavy
financial loss of one billion pesos (about 23 million U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> West African Gas Pipeline Gets A Major Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The proposed West African Gas
Pipeline (WAGP) project got a major boost Wednesday, as Nigeria
and Ghana signed an agreement for the supply of gas to a power
plant in Tema, Ghana.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Chevron Nigeria Limited, in joint
venture with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, will be
supplying 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from its
Escravos Gas Project to a 220-megawatt power plant in Tema for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Ghanaian capital Accra between
representatives of the Chevron Nigeria Limited and the KMP
consortium that is building the power plant, local press
reported.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that before the WAGP is commissioned, the power
plant will run on light crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Chevron's chairman and managing director George Kirkland said
at the ceremony that with the feasibility study for WAGP underway
and the governments of Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Togo
co-operating to accelerate the WAGP, his company is confident it
will be supplying Nigerian gas to the region by the end of year
2001 and then for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
George Kappaz, president and chief executive officer of KMP,
said he hoped that this project will do more than alleviate the
energy shortage in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
Richard Matzke, President of the Chevron Overseas Petroleum
Incorporated, said the agreement "is a key to the development of
the West African Gas Pipeline, a major economic development to
provide a low-cost, environmentally preferred fuel supply for the
entire region."

Prime Ministers Hashimoto Ryutaro and Murayama Tomiichi, and
Sakurauchi Yoshio, former speaker of Japanese House of
Representatives. The Japanese delegation is in China to
participate in activities marking the 20th anniversary of the
signing of the aforementioned treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the treaty reconfirmed the principles of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Communique, and laid a solid political
foundation for the development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also reflected the aspiration of people in the
two nations to extend friendly relations from one generation to
another, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries have enjoyed a long history of
friendship which dates back well over 2,000 years, and added that
the war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists brought
misery to both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Past lessons should serve as guideposts to the future," said
Jiang, adding that "remembering positive experience and negative
lessons in the development of the bilateral relations is the only
way to carry forward the friendly traditions of the two countries
and expect fruitful bilateral ties in the future."

SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Eleven foreign airlines have
suspended flights to South Korea since last December when the
country was gripped by the financial crisis, the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Inflation Hits New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's consumer price
inflation continued to slow down in September of 1999, with the key
barometer Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI) up just 2.5 percent
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was a new record low since the year-on-year rate of
increase in the Composite CPI was computed from October of
1981. The index increased 2.7 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures released by the Census and
Statistics Department, a government spokesman said on Thursday,
the further moderation in consumer price inflation was part and
parcel of the adjustment process taking place as the economy
continued to weather the impact of the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of increase was mainly attributed to continued
easing in private housing rentals, while the freezing of railway
fares and tuition fees since the last price revision in September
of 1997 also contributed.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1998, the increase in the
Composite CPI averaged 4.1 percent over the same period of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Lee Quo-Wei, a veteran Hong
Kong banker, told Xinhua here Thursday that he had dreamed of
establishing a "Nobel Prize of China" when he first advocated the
establishment of the Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation was established in Hong Kong in 1994 for
awarding annual prizes to outstanding scientists on the mainland
in recognition of their achievements in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
This year another 63 distinguished mainland scientists gained
laurels at the awarding ceremony held in Beijing Thursday,
increasing the total number of prize winners to 249.
</P>
<P>
"By rewarding talented scientific and technical persons with
outstanding achievements in China, we hope that the Foundation can
play a part in strengthening the development of the country and
provide impetus for its modernization," said Lee Quo-Wei, who, with
three other donors S H Ho, Kau-kui Leung and Ho Tim, each
contributed 100 million HK dollars (12.8 million U.S. dollars) to
the Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The Foundation, named after the surnames of the four donors,
has granted a total 45 million HK dollars (5.8 million U.S.
dollars) over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Lee, now honorary chairman of Hang Seng Bank, said Wednesday
in an interview with Xinhua: "Education, science and technology
are fundamental to the advancement of China. China has so many
outstanding scientists, and we hope the award is a recognition of
their achievements."
</P>
<P>
The Foundation presented two kinds of awards each year. Till
now, a total of 15 world-class scientists on the mainland have
received the Award of Science and Technological Achievement, each
with a prize of one million HK dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars); and
234 won the Award of Science and Technological Progress, with a
prize of 150,000 HK dollars (19,000 U.S. dollars) each.

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a nationwide
cultural campaign to discover outstanding singers in the urban and
rural areas of 200 Chinese cities in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuqin, official with the Ministry of Culture, said that
the the one-year campaign, which will cover almost every part of
the country, has invited dozens of famous Chinese singers and
musicians to serve as judges, including Wang Kun, Li Shuangjiang
and Fu Lin.
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of amateur troupes and singers in the
country's cities, towns and villages," Liu said, adding that they
are playing a positive role in providing local people with
performances of both classic and popular music and songs.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are active on grassroots stages and their
outstanding talent has been warmly received by audiences, Liu
said, but they seldom have the opportunity to perform at national
events because they live in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will provide these singers and musicians a greater
chance to perform on stages nationwide, and attend international
cultural exchanges and art festivals which will help them develop
their talent and introduce Chinese music and songs worldwide, she
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, audios and videos of their singing and
musical performances will be released to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will be sponsored by China Radio International and
the Audio and Video Publishing House.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Turns Transit Stop for Slave Trade: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- International syndicates
are using South Africa as a transit point for slave trade between
developing countries and Europe, the United States and Canada,
The Star daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a detective from a South African police unit
investigating the trade as saying that migrants from developing
countries were being lured to a number of "transit countries"
including South Africa "with stories of money and jobs,
land-of-milk-and-honey stuff" in the Western world.
</P>
<P>
He said aliens had to pay for air tickets and were then helped
into South Africa, entering either at Johannesburg International
Airport or landing in neighboring countries and "jumping the
fence".
</P>
<P>
Once in South Africa, criminal agents provided the migrants
with accommodation and documentation before they moved on to the
next destination, where they had to pay off their debt.
</P>
<P>
The victims were either forced into prostitution, drug dealing
or other criminal activities or ended up as virtual slave labor
in factories to pay off their debt.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by an inter-agency, including Interpol,
South African Home Affairs Department and police, and the United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service, hundreds of
thousands of illegal migrants are currently being moved by
international smuggling syndicates from their countries of origin
to western Europe and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The human trade syndicates have identified Johannesburg as a
convenient center to obtain fraudulent documentation.
</P>
<P>
They are taking advantage of the fact that South Africa also
has direct flight and shipping routes to most countries in the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is regarded as one of the countries in the
developing world whose citizens do not try to enter other
countries illegally in significant numbers, enabling syndicates
to evade suspicion at ports of entry into the destination
countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Trading in human cargo earns smugglers billions of U.S.
Dollars in annual profits.

SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Most of South Korea's industries
will continue to suffer from sluggish domestic demand in the
fourth quarter of this year, said the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report on business prospects for major industries in the
fourth quarter, the chamber said major industries, except
petrochemicals and shipbuilding, will see lower exports in the
last three months of the year.

Production of motor vehicles is expected to decline 29 percent
to two million this year. Domestic car sales will be halved to
750,000 units, while exports will remain at 1.3 million units,
which was last year's level, the report said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- An official with the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today urged an addition to the
Law of Trade Unions that will punish activities which obstruct
trade union officials in the exercise of their functions and
powers.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhiming, director of the ACFTU law department, who is
attending the ongoing 13th National Congress of the Chinese Trade
Unions, also suggested adding items to the law to punish those
who obstruct workers' organizations in joining trade
unions and violating trade union property.
</P>
<P>
The law should provide protection for trade union officials
who are treated unfairly by enterprise leaders.
</P>
<P>
If the establishment of trade unions is obstructed in rural or
private enterprises, the managers of these enterprises should be
punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
The law should also ban the illegal use of trade union funds
and the violation of properties in trade unions' sanatoriums,
cultural centers and clubs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the law must be strengthened with a series of
regulations on establishing a trade union conference system,
protecting the rights of trade union delegates, and punishing
violations of the law.
</P>
<P>
The current Trade Union Law was approved by the National
People's Congress and put into effect in 1992.

JAKARTA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rupiah was closed at
7,500/7,750 to the U.S. dollar on the Jakarta inter-bank spot
market Thursday, declining by 400 points compared with Wednesday's
close of 7,100/7,300 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a statement by Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita helped contain the
rupiah's rally.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters Wednesday, Ginandjar said: "I personally
expect the rupiah will not strengthen to below the 5,000 rupiah
level because it will hurt our exports. I think 7,000 to 8,000
rupiah is the best equilibrium level for now."
</P>
<P>
Money market analyst Farial Anwar agreed with the government
that the currency should not jump drastically.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been advancing significantly during the past
couple of weeks, touching the 7,000 level at one point during the
Wednesday trading session. The currency, which plunged to its
lowest level of 17,000 against the greenback in January, was
hovering at a range between 10,000 and 11,000 rupiah last month.
</P>
<P>
"The rupiah must consolidate at around 7,000 for the time being
and start declining by about 200 or 300 points in the weeks to
come so the people have gotten used to the level," Farial said,
adding that a drastic rise will also invite speculation.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Party Criticizes Israeli Delegation's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's coalition Shas party
leader Aryeh Deri Thursday criticized Israeli delegation's walkout
threat during peace talks in the U.S., saying such a move would
not be helpful to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Deri voiced his objection to such a behavior of the Israeli
delegation at the Wye Plantation near Washington in his telephone
conversation Thursday morning with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The walkout from the Wye Plantation Mideast peace summit could
only leave a bad impression to the whole world that Israel is not
interested in moving the process forward and Israel must be blamed
for the failure of the summit talks, Deri was quoted as telling
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Wye summit was in crisis Wednesday night as Israeli
negotiators threatened to walk out, accusing the U.S. of going
back on its word and the Palestinians of evasion.
</P>
<P>
Israel delegation blamed the Palestinian side for not meeting
Israel's demand on the so-called security issue and planned to
fly home. But later on it decided to stay at the summit.
</P>
<P>
During the last seven days, the Wye Plantation summit has
reportedly reached agreements on Israel's 13 percent second stage
troop redeployment in the West Bank, the opening of the Gaza
airport and karni industrial part in Palestinian-controlled Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The main areas of contention in the talks as of late Wednesday
night were the issues of convening the Palestinian National
Council to abrogate parts of the Palestinian national charter, the
extradition of prisoners, the confiscation of weapons, the third
redeployment, the reduction of the Palestinian security forces,
the crackdown of Islamic terrorists and others, Israeli media
reported from Wye.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deri also asked Netanyahu that how could Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon snub Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in
their first meeting at Wye Plantation, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon is Israel's foreign minister and he should known the
diplomatic procedures, Deri told Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Sharon refused to shake Arafat's hands at Wye Plantation Monday
night when the two negotiation teams met for dinner, but Arafat
reportedly "stunk out his chest and saluted" Sharon upon hearing
Sharon's introduction.

<HEADLINE> Expedition Team to Unveil Tibetan Canyon Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lhasa, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A 60-member expedition team composed
of scientists, explorers and journalists will venture into the
Yalu Tsangpo Daxiagu in Tibet--believed by Chinese scientists to
be the world largest canyon--to explore one of the least known
realms on the earth.
</P>
<P>
The government of the Tibet Autonomous Region today held a grand
ceremony in front of the famed Potala Palace to mark the start
of the expedition which begins tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The team plans to hike across the canyon in southeastern
Tibet and reach the top of the canyon in early
November. From there the team will split into three groups with
separate scientific research missions.
</P>
<P>
The Yalu Tsangpo Daxiagu, located on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, is 496 kilometers long and more than 5,000 meters
deep.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are expected to obtain first-hand material on
the natural ecology and resources of the canyon.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, U.S. Start Talks on Sharing Military Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States
on Thursday began their negotiations over Seoul's share of the
cost in 1999 to maintain 37,000 U.S troops stationed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. asked South Korea to pay 440 million U.S. dollars next
year, while South Korea tried to scale back its share to the 1994
level of 260 million U.S. dollars because of the current economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. demand is based on a 1995 agreement, under which South
Korea has to increase its share by 10 percent every year starting
with 330 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea hoped the U.S. would reduce the payment, which
is almost double the 1997 level of 360 million U.S. dollars if
calculated in the devalued South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
Last year South Korea paid 310 million of its previously agreed
399 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen consented earlier this
year to reduce South Korea's share at his visit here.
</P>
<P>
Washington would not seek to benefit from the economic crisis
of a friendly nation, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to agree on a mutually acceptable
amount before the Security Consultative Meeting convenes next
month in Seoul.

<HEADLINE> China Mulls Law on Administrative Appeal, Securities Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A draft law on administrative
appeal which will allow the public to seek reconsideration of
government violations of their interests is to be considered by
China's top legislature next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also to be submitted for deliberation is the country's long
awaited securities act, first put before lawmakers six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two officials, at the request of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, briefed the press today on the two draft laws.
</P>
<P>
"The new administrative appeal law will facilitate a highly
efficient interior mechanism of checks and balances within the
government, and help to institute the system of the rule of law
within the government," said Qing Feng of the Legal Affairs
Bureau of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1990 government regulations on administrative
appeal, the new law enlarges the scope of appealable government
violations from the existing personal right and rights to
possession to all the violations by government bodies and its
employees.
</P>
<P>
According to existing rules, victims must seek the government
agencies at a higher level for reconsideration of violations
committed by lower governmental bodies, and sometime they must
travel thousands of miles to reach that department.
</P>
<P>
However, the new law gives victims the right to choose where to
appeal: a higher level governmental body, or government at or
above the county level near the location of the accused
governmental body.
</P>
<P>
To make things easier for the public, the new law allows
victims to raise appeals verbally or in the written form; and if
such an appeal is not rejected with an explanation, it is legally
regarded as accepted.
</P>
<P>
Reconsideration procedures are further clarified and
supervision over agencies of appeal intensified in the new law,
Qing said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the law was drafted with suggestions from
Premier Zhu Rongji, and reflects his ideas on the clarification
of legal consequences for law violations.
</P>
<P>
On another matter, an official with the NPC Standing Committee
explained that the drafting of the securities act has been
prolonged because China's security market is not yet mature and
several key issues including the kinds of securities the law
should cover, management of the securities market, classification of
direct investment and commissioned services, and credits
transactions, all need to be decided.
</P>
<P>
The draft act consists of 214 articles in 12 chapters and covers
issues from stock listings to self-discipline in the security
market.

<HEADLINE> New Bone-marrow Treatment Offers hope to Dying Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A new method to transplant bone
marrow from a mismatched donor means that almost anyone who needs
the potentially life-saving procedure can get it, the Globe and
Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 20 to 30 percent of patients who received bone-marrow
from mismatched donors in the hospital in Canada's Calgary city
so far remain free of disease, said James Russell, director of the
bone-marrow-transplant program at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, this means we can offer a transplant to virtually
everyone who needs it," Russell said. "We won't feel limited by
the availability of a suitable donor."
</P>
<P>
For people suffering cancers of the blood, particularly
leukemia, transplants are often the only chance. A donor's marrow
usually must match all six of the recipient's immunological
markers on the chromosomes: three inherited from the mother, three
from the father.
</P>
<P>
Siblings generally have a 1-in-4 chance of being a perfect
match. If they aren't, dying patients must turn to other blood
relations, bone-marrow registries or media pleas.
</P>
<P>
Now scientists from Israel and Italy, who first developed the
technology to transplant bone marrow from mismatched donors on
mice in 1989, have shown that the same procedure can work on human
patients. Doctors pioneering the technique in Canada are reaching
similar conclusions.

WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. Newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President bill Clinton's national security team
struggled Wednesday night to stave off collapse of the largest
diplomatic investment of his presidency, narrowly averting an
Israeli walkout from the Middle East peace summit without an
accord.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a huge year-end spending
bill Wednesday, ending the threat of any government shutdown this
year but leaving a bitter taste among some House and Senate
members who resented how Congress finally wrapped up its business
and shot out of town.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- After arguing for months that the United States must pay its
back dues at the United Nations, President Bill Clinton vetoed a
bill that would have paid those dues, declaring that an unrelated
anti-abortion measure left him no choice.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and NATO worked to keep the military
pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as he
continued to resist complying with international demands to
withdraw Serbian forces from the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey and Syria announced details of an agreement intended
to defuse a brewing conflict over support by Damascus for Kurdish
rebels, and Ankara has gotten its way.
</P>
<P>
-- An Italian ex-Communist was sworn in as prime minister and
a parliamentary confirmation vote is expected Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
urged localities to give top priority to the issue of quality as
the State invests more money in infrastructure to spur the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee Political Bureau, issued this
call for action during his trip in this north China metropolis
from October 19 to 22.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier visited a number of key infrastructure
projects, including a state grain storage facility and several
universities. He was informed by local leaders of the city's recent
progress in the infrastructure and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with local officials, Li said that the
devastating summer floods have prompted the government to increase
expenditures, while the growth of tax revenues has yet to reach
its goal.
</P>
<P>
Taxation departments should maker greater efforts to fulfill
the year's tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the universities, Li pledged that the government
will resolve the housing problem for young teachers within this
century.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Minister Confers with Russian Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister
General Chi Haotian and his Russian counterpart Marshall Igor
Dmitriyevich Sergeyev agreed here today that certain countries'
plans to develop theatre missile defense system will arouse new
arms race and threaten world and regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Chi and visiting Sergeyev also exchanged views on international
and regional security issues of common concern during the talks
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi extended a welcome to Sergeyev, who is in China for the
first time, and indicated that the visit, a major event in
Sino-Russian military relations, not only helps maintain and
develop the existing friendship and cooperative relations between
the two armed forces, but also promotes the comprehensive
development of Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership
oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission
(CMC) and state councillor, noted that the two countries are
cooperating closely on the basis of good-neighborly friendship and
mutual trust toward the goal of establishing a new international
political and economical order featuring fairness and
reasonableness. It is vital to maintaining global peace and
development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China highly values the agreements reached among
five mid-Asian countries including China and Russia which says
that mutual trust will be enhanced and armed forces reduced. He
pointed out that the two documents is of tremendous importance to
strengthening good-neighborly friendship among those countries,
and to maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region
and in the world.
</P>
<P>
That China, Russia and some other mid-Asian countries chose the
path of trust, disarmament, peace and cooperation contributes
enormously to world peace, and sets a good example for the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he highly values the state-to-state and
army-to-army relations between the two countries, adding that both
countries share identical or similar views on a series of
international and regional security issues, and have carried on
fruitful cooperation in international affairs. He expressed the
hope to further promote the bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arms Inspector Recalled From Iraq on Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. weapons inspector in the
U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) has been
recalled by the commission on charges of espionage in Iraq, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nils Carlstrom, director of the U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and
Verification Center, was quoted by INA as saying that the American
inspector, whom he did not mention by name, violates the rules of
UNSCOM as he shot pictures of an Iraqi missile site by his own
camera on October 8.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of the U.N. commission
that a U.S. weapons inspector has been ordered to withdraw from
Iraq on charges of conducting espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
Carlstron told reporters that UNSCOM had ordered the American
inspector to leave Iraq four days after his spying operation.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate
Hussan Mohammed Ameen has disclosed that a pilot of a Chilean
national within UNSCOM also tried to shoot pictures of his
helicopter to an Iraqi test field Tuesday, said INA.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ameen affirmed that such acts of espionage
have been repeated by the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing some U.N. arms inspectors of spying
on Iraq's important military installations.
</P>
<P>
Ameen said that it was well known that the American inspector
Scott Ritter had frankly admitted through the international TV
channels of spying in the interests of the American and Israeli
intelligence and delivering to them information concerning Iraq's
security and its sensitive sites.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, a former U.S. marine officer during the 1991 Gulf
War, resigned last month from his post as an important U.N.
weapons inspector, complaining that the U.S. and UNSCOM failed
to take a tough stance toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 decide to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM and
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), accusing them of
being dominated by the U.S. and adopting procrastination policy
regarding their disarmament mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has not announced its revocation of the August 5
decision, though it is widely expected that Baghdad will resume
cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait will not be lifted unless
U.N. weapons inspectors verify that it is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Unveil Aid Package at APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia would use next
month's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting
to announce a package of bilateral assistance for regional
economies hit by global financial chaos, Australian Prime Minister
John Howard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling his second-term blueprint for the Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation group, Howard said the Australian government
had engaged a consultant to survey the needs of regional economies
for technical assistance on economic governance, and what was
being done to meet these needs.
</P>
<P>
"There are substantial gaps," he said in a speech at the 10th
International Conference of Banking supervisors in Sydney. "I will
be announcing in Kuala Lumpur a package of bilateral assistance
which will help economies fill those gaps and I will be
encouraging other APEC members in a position to help to do
likewise."
</P>
<P>
He said the effect of financial chaos on the Asia-Pacific
region had been colossal and conceded that Australia would
continue to be hit, but said domestic economic growth was set to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Howard called on the APEC members to reaffirm their trade
liberalization goals at next month's meeting, saying they must
resist the urge to raise barriers for self-protection in bad
economic times.
</P>
<P>
"The worst possible response to the crisis would be to put up
the shutters," he said. "That would result in competition to raise
tariffs and barriers within the region and outside."
</P>
<P>
"We saw the consequences of this sort of policy in the Great
Depression in the 1930s," he said. "Others won't keep their
markets open if we don't."
</P>
<P>
Howard backed United States President Bill Clinton's call for
urgent action to reform the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
"We must focus on what can be done now to ensure that growth
resumes and to avoid a major credit crunch," Howard added.
</P>
<P>
He also appeared to suggest possible changes to institutions
such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
saying: "The world has changed dramatically since these
institutions were established."

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Marginally Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. reined in the Australian share market Thursday ensuring
it only ended marginally higher despite a strong run by four major
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed the day 2.2 points, or 0.9
percent, higher at 2,545.2.
</P>
<P>
"There's mixed moves in the market if you look at the strength
in (Australia's leading mining company) BHP, National Bank (of
Australia), the Commonwealth Bank (of Australia), Telstra, but it
has all been offset by the downward move in News Corp.," Shaw
Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
News Corp. ended the day down 62.9 cents, or 6.08 percent, at
9.71 Australian dollars, its preferred shares lost 56.4 cents, or
6.15 percent, at 8.60 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the stock succumbed to profit-taking after it
jumped sharply on news that its Fox Entertainment Group Inc. could
raise about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in its initial public offer.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the market remained fairly cautious and "is
probably going to trade on a conservative manner in comparison to
overseas markets as has been the case," Spiteri said.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector received strong investor support Thursday,
boosting the index 59.1 points, or 1.10 percent, to 5,428 points.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank added 48.3 cents to 20.20 Australian
dollars, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 17 cents to 19.13
Australian dollars, ANZ bank jumped 1.5 cents to 8.95 Australian
dollars while Westpac bank slipped five cents to 9.45 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the resource sector, BHP stacked on 18.4 cents to 12.99
Australian dollars after rumors that Duke Energy chief executive
Paul Anderson may take up the helm at the diversified miner.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto added 11 cents to 20.42 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index slipped 1.2 points to 1,138.8, while the price
of gold bullion in Sydney closed down at 294.25 U.S. dollars an
ounce compared to Wednesday's close of 297.10 U.S. dollars an
ounce.
</P>
<P>
National turnover ended the day with 295.36 million stocks
traded for 459.79 million Australian dollars (287 million U.S.
dollars), with falling stocks outnumbering rising stocks 491 to
479, while 365 stocks remained steady.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday returned to the Wye Plantation, Maryland, where the
Middle East summit is in an impasse, and said the Israelis and
Palestinians need to make tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The hardest decisions, now, at last, are on the table. Israel,
the Palestinians, the region and the world have very much at stake
today," Clinton told reporters before boarding a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the parties will seize this opportunity, and not
retreat from the clear moment to capture the momentum of peace and
keep it moving forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton rejoined the discussions on Maryland's Eastern shore
after a week of hard bargaining and a threat by Israelis to walk
out of the talks unless they won more Palestinian concessions on
security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
"There's progress to be made. The president is going back out
there to continue pushing hard. I think we're at a decisive moment
to make tough decisions. We're hopeful that the parties can now
make them," said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart before Clinton
left.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who had packed his bags and ordered his plane on standby, agreed
to stay and work with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
CIA Director George Tenet on a West Bank security proposal that
Israel could accept.
</P>
<P>
The president was accompanied to the conference site by Sandy
Berger, his national security adviser, and other officials.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday
the president would become an active participant again only if
enough progress was made by the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators in agreeing to a U.S. text of a land-for-peace deal
which was presented by Albright for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Rubin called the deal "a rolling document" of less than 20
pages, which was undergoing minor revisions and left room for
compromise between the two sides.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Locked-out NBA players meet
in Las Vegas today with the league six weeks away from the
"danger zone" of canceling the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have a deal at some point in December, you're in
the danger zone of no season," deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern said the league, which already has
canceled the first two weeks of the season, is prepared to cancel
more games if agreement is not reached by next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"By next week, I think the only issue will be, how much of
December should be canceled, along with November, given the lead
time we need," Stern said.
</P>
<P>
The union had no response.
</P>
<P>
The players' meeting, which superstars Michael Jordan and Karl
Malone, among others, will attend, comes on the 112th day of the
lockout with the players having lost two litigation cases and
close to $100 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
The players will be presented the league's latest proposal and
could discuss decertification, which could end the lockout but
trigger a protracted court suit.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that what would come out of their meeting is a
decision to return to the bargaining table," Stern said. "We
would hope the majority of players would say, 'Enough fighting.
Let's negotiate,'"

<P>
CAIRO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa Thursday briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on the latest developments of the Syrian-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa delivered a message to Mubarak from Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The message dealt with the outcome of the recent Syrian-Turkish
talks aimed at defusing the tensions between the two countries,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
After two-day's meetings between Syrian and Turkish officials,
the two neighbors Tuesday signed an agreement, easing their
weeks-long standoff and heading off a possible regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Damascus pledged to shut down Kurdish
rebel camps in its territory and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
valley in Lebanon. Syria also agreed not to allow Kurdish rebels
to stage cross-border attacks on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Syria and Turkey were running high in the past
weeks after Ankara threatened to resort to military actions to
stop what it said Syria's support for Kurdish rebels fighting for
an independent state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
For fear of a conflict, Egypt exerted intensive efforts to
mediate between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Cairo earlier in the day, al-Sharaa expressed
his country's gratitude to Mubarak, the Egyptian government and
people for the efforts to help defuse the crisis, according to the
news agency.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa flew back to Syria after his meeting with Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills 15 Mozambicans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of cholera since
early September has infected 493 people, killing at least 15 in
Mozambique, Mozambican Health Minister Aurelio Zilhao disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said here Wednesday that most of the cholera
cases occurred in capital Maputo, its neighboring town of Matola
and some counties in the north part of the central Zambezia
Province.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Noticias newspaper quoted Zilhao as saying that the
prevention and treatment of the epidemic involves not only the
health ministry, but other departments concerning the
environment, water and food.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all layers of the society to act in a bid to
prevent cholera from occurring and spreading.
</P>
<P>
The health minister noted that some 800,000 Mozambicans are at
present carrying cholera virus.
</P>
<P>
If measures are not taken, the epidemic would break out at any
time, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Zilhao urged people to keep personal hygiene, eating clean
food, drinking boiled water and washing hands after going to
stool.
</P>
<P>
Cholera broke out twice in late 1997 and early this year in
most provinces of this southern African country, taking the death
toll of more than 800 people among over 30,000 infected cases.
</P>
<P>
Hot weather and poor hygiene are the major causes for the
outbreak of the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has
expressed the belief that China will be able to approach or reach
its economic growth target of eight percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The top law-maker said he is satisfactory with the country's
economic situation in the first nine months this year, describing it
as sound on the whole.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee Political Bureau, made
the remarks at the 16th meeting of the 9th NPC's Financial and
Economic Committee which was convened on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the last two days, several ministerial officials in charge
of economic and financial issues delivered reports on the
country's economic and financial situation to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke after hearing the reports. "It is not easy to achieve
such a good result of economic development," he noted, referring
to the increasingly serious impact of the current Asian financial
turmoils on China and the difficulties caused by the severe summer
floods.
</P>
<P>
In a socialist market economy, some goals are mandatory and
more serve as guidance, he explained, stressing that priority
should be given to readjusting the structure, improving the
quality, and enhancing the efficiency, in order to make the
economic growth a "substantial" one.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the reform, development and stability
should be balanced, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Disputes Erupt at Indian Education Ministers Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Severe disputes erupted soon
after the education ministers conference began here Thursday with
some state ministers accusing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) of trying to introduce Hindu ideology in education.
</P>
<P>
Education ministers of several states including BJP's allies
staged a walkout to protest attempts to impose Hindutva (Hindu
ideas) in the non-official agenda for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Singing of "saraswati vandan", a prayer to the Hindu goddess of
learning, had become a focal point of protest that had been
building over circulation of non-official agenda for the
conference by the Human Resource Development Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Faced with strong opposition at the meeting, Human Resource
Development Minister M. Manohar Joshi was forced to drop the
controversial non-official part of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
BJP leaders have had different voices over the controversial
issue so far. While Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in his
inaugural speech said that there must be no place for religious
bigotry and intolerance, BJP spokesman Venkaiah Naidu said the
same day that the BJP supported suggestion for "Indianizing and
spiritualizing" education.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry,
on behalf of the Contact Group, warned Thursday all forces in
Kosovo against disrupting the peace agreements, according to
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with visiting Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said, "We are really very worried" over the resumption of military
action in the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said there are people who would like to disrupt the
efforts of the world community to achieve a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to remind you of the fact that Resolution
No.119, passed by the UN Security Council, applies in full to both
Belgrade and the Albanians," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov urged all the parties in Kosovo to take advantage of
political channels for settling the situation.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos denounced a double standard in handling the Kosovo
crisis, saying those who used a one-sided approach to solving the
problem are responsible for the current situation.
</P>
<P>
He said Greece has always stated that within the framework of
NATO and the European Union, a settlement can be achieved in
Kosovo. But the initiatives should be balanced and not directed at
only one of the parties concerned, he said.

HONG KONG, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's foreign currency
assets amounted to 88.4 billion U.S. dollars at the end of

Thursday.

<P>
This shows that in terms of foreign currency reserves ranking,
Hong Kong remains the third largest in the world, after Japan and

</P>
<P>
However, the newly released figure represented 3.7 billion U.S.
dollars less than that of the previous month.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the HKMA attributed the drop mainly to the

<HEADLINE> S. Tome &AMP; Principe to Hold Parliamentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Nine political parties will
contend for the 55 seats in the National Assembly on November 8
in the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, a report
reaching here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, former president Manuel Pinto da
Costa, also president of the ruling Liberation Movement of S.
Tome &AMP; Principe/Social Democratic Party (MLSP), said he was
confident that his party will win the majority of the seats and
the next presidential election as well.
</P>
<P>
MLSP now holds 27 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the Party of Independent Democratic Act
(ADI) led by Carlos Neves also has a chance to win the majority
in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The ADI party, reportedly established with the support of
President Miguel Trovoada in 1993, holds 14 seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming elections, the Democratic Convergency Party
(PCD) which also has 14 seats in parliament is expected to
maintain its position.
</P>
<P>
The PDC once won majority in the elections in 1991 and formed
a government, but its cabinet was dismissed by the president in
1994. However, the PDC forms part of the coalition government at
present.
</P>
<P>
Raul Braganca, head of the PDC, has insisted the parliamentary
polls be delayed on the ground that the national economy should
be strengthened first.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party (DP), a small political party founded in
1990, won only one seat in the elections held in 1991, and the DP
and other small parties are unlikely to have much influence in
the forthcoming elections, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The coming elections is the third since the island country in
the Gulf of Guinea adopted the multi-party system in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Each party seeks to rule by itself, abandoning the idea of a
national unity government commonly agreed on after an abortive
coup in 1995 which created split between the government and the
president, and worsened the ties between the ruling parties and
the opposition.
</P>
<P>
To defuse the crisis, President Trovoada called for the
formation of a national unity government to reconstruct the state
and urged the setting up of a coalition government between the
ruling parties and the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Trying to Rid Himself of Don King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson, with new boxing
license secured, is trying to rid himself of an old problem --
Don King.
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the fighter hunts for a new promoter for his
1999 comeback, but one with severely limited power and
remuneration.
</P>
<P>
With King and Tyson's 10-year relationship asunder, the
ex-heavyweight champion began depositions with the controversial
promoter's lawyers in the figher's $100 million lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Tyson gave three hours of testimony in New York yesterday.
King sat nearby at a conference table. The fighter alleges King
engaged in a pattern of deceit and fraud.
</P>
<P>
While the 32-year-old former heavyweight champion searches for
a new promoter, his advisers might have located his first
opponent. And the good news is Brian Nielsen of Denmark is no
Peter McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
No deal is finalized, but negotiations are heating up between
Tyson's advisers and Pallen Mogens, promoter for the 1992 Olympic
bronze medalist who has a 44-0 record.
</P>
<P>
Nielsen can fight. The Dane's not a banger, but he is big.
Because of timing, and difficulties with sites and dates, Tyson
won't fight until January. The newest working date is January 16.
If the fight is not in Las Vegas, January 9 is an option.
</P>
<P>
First, Tyson must find a promoter. Whomever he signs with,
Tyson wants a loan of up to $3.5 million, possibly to be used as
part of a down payment to the IRS for his $13 million tax bill.
</P>
<P>
For his comeback bouts, Tyson plans to pay his promoter
$200,000 a fight, which would be considered a bargain.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's new promoter would serve as a "front man" who is paid
a straight fee. Depending upon the agreement, it could be
structured as a one- or two-fight contract, or a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Dan Goossen of America Presents, backed by the Fox
network, has emerged as a front-runner. Goossen was conspicuous
at each of Tyson's appearances before the Nevada commission.
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, who has a promoter's license in two states, is
viewed as a less likely selection, though he could be an adviser.
</P>
<P>
After Tyson won his license Monday in Las Vegas, he became
annoyed at Johnson's over-reaching statements in a news
conference. Johnson had told the commission he "hoped" he could
serve on Tyson's new West Coast-based team. "It's a role I'd love
to play," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Later, he told media, "I'll be involved in all the decision.
Promoting is not like brain surgery. I'm going to bring Mike
along slowly."
</P>
<P>
The former basketball star has no boxing experience but knows
people who can steer him.

<HEADLINE> Big Swindler Arrested in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong Provincial
Public Security Department announced Thursday that Luo Dazhan has
been arrested for swindling 9.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The case has been moved to the Taishan city procurator by the
police, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, Luo, claiming to be the president of a
so-called China Town Group in Cambodia, opened a company in
Taishan and began his schemes.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, Luo signed contracts with some local
companies in Taishan on four large infrastructure projects. Since
then, he has done nothing on the projects while continuing to sign
more contracts with over 140 other companies, posing as an
exporting agent for stone materials.
</P>
<P>
He then told the city government of Taishan that he finally had
enough funds for the four infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Local police arrested Luo this April and seized nearly 8
million yuan of the fraudulently gained funds.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Scholar Says Don't Take Tibet As Backward Museum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 22 (Xinhua) -- A Tibetan scholar today refuted
the idea of keeping Tibet primitive and backward, saying this
might satisfy the curiosity of some tourists and adventurers but
will surely hold back the development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"Some people today still think that everything in Tibet should
remain like it was a few hundred years ago and they try to put the
label 'museum of live cultural relics' on Tibet," said Shesrab
Nyima, associate professor of Tibetology at the Central University
for Nationalities.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned that when a group of foreign tourists set foot on
the soil of Lhasa, capital city of the Tibet Autonomous Region,
they couldn't help shouting their wishes to have a look at the
people of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly against national nihilism since the cultural
traditions of any nationality do not exist in a state of rest, and
they can develop only after absorbing the cream of other
cultures," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s when China started its reforms and
opening-up, not as many farmers and herdsmen in Tibet rely on the
natural economy as in the past. They now know more about the
market economy and have a sense of competition.
</P>
<P>
Especially young Tibetans in major cities and towns now enjoy
pop songs and music as they sip traditional buttered tea. This has
become a new fashion in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Shesrab Nyima pointed out that though Tibetan culture is facing
challenges, it still has the great vitality to allow modern
civilization to take root among its traditions, which is expected
to promote national modernization.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has its own characteristics, which are an important part of
China's languages and characteristics, and ancient Tibetans left
huge numbers of documents, some of which are unique in the world.

Some people agree that the living conditions of Tibetans have
been really improved, but on the other hand, they believe that
these improvements have destroyed their traditional life style. A
few have even said that the "unique culture and religion of the
Tibetans has been damaged almost totally".

woodcuts, has been put on a state list of social science research
projects, and three million copies of Tibetan editions have been
published nationwide. This provides valuable material for the
study of ancient Tibet.

China often sends Tibetan song and dance troupes to
international art festivals. A recent performance given by a
Tibetan children's art troupe won great success during an American

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Moves to Link its Currency with the Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has been working to
link its currency, the lev, with the proposed European single
currency, the euro, in a bid to speed up the country's financial
integration into the European economy.
</P>
<P>
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of
the euro, which is scheduled for January 1, 1999, the Bulgarian
government adopted a system of monetary commission on July 1,
1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, one German mark is equivalent to 1,000
Bulgarian lev. The mark has also been used for the settlement of
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev has pledged that the
lev will experience its connection with the euro automatically as
the European single currency comes into use less than three months
later, and that the entire process of transition will be
accomplished by July 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
With regard to easing the accounting, the Bulgarian government
plans to print next year a new national currency, with a face
value of one lev equivalent to one Mark.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the euro will be used to replace the German mark as
the accounting unit for Bulgaria's foreign exchange reserve.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Grain Harvest to Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATER, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian grain production
will experience a severe plunge this year due to two heavy snows
in October that covered more than 100,000 hectares of wheat, said
a Mongolian labor union official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To date, Mongolia has only harvested 163,000 tons of wheat from
166,000 hectares of land, while the country planted a total of
285,000 hectares of wheat this year, the official said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
At most, only 40 percent of the snow-covered wheat can be
gathered in if the weather improves measurably, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has suffered a continuous drop in wheat production. In
1996, wheat production fell to 220,000 tons from 800,000 tons in
the 1980s. But in 1997, it gained a light rally to 240,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, 200,000 tons of grain can meet only half
of Mongolia's annual domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Members Asked to Sign Non-Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security
organizations throughout the territories summoned on Thursday all
members of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) to
sign non-violent commitments.
</P>
<P>
Hamas members in various Palestinian districts in Gaza Strip
and the West Bank were summoned by the security authorities to
sign written commitments that they will not involve in acts which
violate the law, Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say how many Hamas members were summoned,
but the move was apparently aimed at delivering a message to
Israel that the Palestinian side is serious in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is one of the main Palestinian Islamic groups that oppose
the Oslo Accords. In the past, its members conducted a number of
suicide bombings inside Israel and other violent activities.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the 29-year-old Hamas member Salem Sarsour from the
West Bank city of Hebron threw two hand grenades at the central
bus station in Israel's southern city of Beersheba, injuring 64
people.
</P>
<P>
Security cooperation is one of the key issues hindering the
progress of the current Israeli-Palestinian summit at the Wye
Plantation outside Washington, the U.S., which began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that the Palestinians should fight against
terrorists and crack down on Islamic groups.

<HEADLINE> China Crushes Qatar in Asian Under-19 Soccer Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHIANG MAI, Thailand, October 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Yan scored a
splendid goal in Thursday's match against Qatar, lifting China to
the same footing with the other three teams in Group B of the
31rst Asian Youth Under-19 soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
China, together with Qatar, South Korea and Japan, gained four
points, while Iraq had zero.
</P>
<P>
Qatar made thrushing advances at the beginning of the match
held at Chiang Mai's 700-Year Main Stadium, but met with strong
resistance. Abdula M Alrasheedi got a yellow card less than five
minutes into the first half.
</P>
<P>
Qatar missed a great scoring chance when Sellman M Almeamari
got cross two meters from the almost open gate but fell down.
</P>
<P>
China lost one player only 25 minutes into the first half when
Liu Yujian got a red card for fouling against Mohmd Gulam.
</P>
<P>
However, China, kept its composure and managed to press
forward with several execellent but unsuccessful shots. Qatari
goal keeper Ali Hilal Najm fell into the net when trying to catch
a shot that was fired over the post. It took almost one minute
before he could stand up.
</P>
<P>
Although with one man less, China dominated the second half.
Li Yan scored a marvellous goal when the Chinese made a
counter-attack 20 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw Qatar having two yellow cards.
Goal-keeper Ali Hilal Najm had two great saves. Then Qatar had a
great chance to score two minutes before the match ended when
Chinese goalie Liu Yunfei palmed off the shot from a close range.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Chen Jingang said his players played well and
kept calm during the game. He said Qatar was stronger in terms
of skills but China laid emphasis on team-work and what he called
"team spirit".
</P>
<P>
Qatari coach Abdulla Juma said Qatar, with one-man advantage,
should have won the match. But the team lacked cooperation and
harmony.
</P>
<P>
He cited fatigue as another reason for the failure, saying his
players had played three games without enough time to relax.
</P>
<P>
Qatar played more games than the other teams in Group B, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In another match Thursday, Japan beat Iraq 6-2. Saturday's
matches are Qatar vs Japan and Iraq vs South Korea.

<HEADLINE> EU Backs French Asbestos Ban in Face of WTO Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 22 (xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Tuesday announced its rejection of Canadian claims that the French
measure concerning an asbestos ban violates international trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The French measure bans the production, transformation, sale,
importation and marketing of asbestos and asbestos-containing
products, with certain exceptions for applications for which safer
substitutes do not yet exist, an EU news release said.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it is confident that the French measure is
compatible with WTO obligations.
</P>
<P>
Canada on Wednesday requested the establishment of a World
Trade Organization (WTO) panel against the French ban on asbestos
and asbestos-containing products.
</P>
<P>
As is allowed under WTO rules, the EU rejected the request for
the first time. If Canada repeats its request at the next WTO
Disputes Settlement Body meeting, a panel will be automatically
established.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU announcement, Canada claims the French
measure has violated the Agreement on Sanitary and Phyto-sanitary
Measures, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, and
Articles XI and III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
It has been scientifically proven that asbestos fibers are
carcinogenic. In France alone about 2,000 persons die of cancer
caused by asbestos every year. The figure for the EU is in the
tens of thousands, it added.

<HEADLINE> UK Plutonium "May be in US Warheads", say Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 22 (Xinhua) - The possibility that plutonium
produced by Britain end up in at least 300 US military warheads is
raised by British scientists.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that Britain and America broke the spirit of the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty by diverting nuclear material
from civil nuclear programs for military use.
</P>
<P>
British paper, the Daily Telegraph, quoted Prof Keith Barnham
of Imperial College and his colleagues as saying that according to
the official figures, "There is a 1.4-ton discrepancy in the
amount of plutonium transferred from Britain's civil reactors,
supposedly for civil use in America, under a 1958 agreement."
</P>
<P>
He points out in the journal Nature that, despite claims of
openness by the Department of Trade and Industry, official UK
figures now contain less information than previously.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that there has been an attempt to rewrite history,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
The paper said, the Government changed its line from saying
civil plutonium had never been exported for weapons in 1986 to
saying that it had not happened since 1979 - after the exchanges
ended.
