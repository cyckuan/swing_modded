<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Lawyers Accuse Opposition for Creating Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 550 lawyers in the
country Monday accused the opposition for creating "an unnecessary
controversy" centering the recent comment of the prime minister on
granting of bails to criminals.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said in a statement that a certain political
quarter is collecting signature for contempt petition against
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. According to the law of the country,
only a court can draw such contempt proceedings, the lawyers
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina recently said that the judiciary should be
accountable as criminals are repeating crimes after obtaining
bails from courts.
</P>
<P>
The statement observed that the prime minister's comment was
the manifestation of people's concerns in the wake of growing
criminal activities and it deserved a healthy discussion involving
all concerned.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the signature campaign under the
auspices of political parties was, in fact, a political and party
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"The people will never want that any lawyer or member of
parliament would do anything which would encourage in creating
conflict between the judiciary and the executive," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition lawmakers will file a contempt petition
with the High Court against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her
remarks against the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
All the MPs of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jatiya
Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami will be plaintiff in the petition,
BNP secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan told newsmen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have unanimously decided to file the
petition to protect the judiciary and ensure rule of law in the
country, Bhuiyan said, adding as lawmakers "we can not sit idle
when the government and the prime minister attempt to destroy the
judicial system."
</P>
<P>
BNP alone has 110 MPs in the 330-seat parliament. The petition
may be filed on Wednesday, according to opposition sources.
</P>
<P>
Over three hundred lawyers of High Court have already signed a
statement to file a separate contempt petition against the prime
minister for her remarks on judiciary.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves France Telecom's Acquisition of Britain's Orange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Monday that it has granted regulatory clearance to France
Telecom's acquisition of the sole control over the British mobile
phone operator Orange.
</P>
<P>
The transaction came as the sale by Orange of its shares in
Belgium's third mobile operator, which it owns with KPN of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, approved on
April 12 Vodafone Airtouch's acquisition of Germany's Mannesmann,
subject to the divestment of Orange, so as to remove competition
concerns arising from overlaps in the Belgian and British markets
for mobile telecommunications services. France Telecom
subsequently agreed to buy Orange.
</P>
<P>
The new transaction gives rise to horizontal overlaps in the
market for mobile telecommunication services in Belgium, where
France Telecom is present via its subsidiary Mobistar while Orange
also has a joint venture with KPN, called KPN Orange.
</P>
<P>
This overlap, the Commission said, would have given France
Telecom a combined market share of over 30 percent on the Belgian
mobile phone market. The deal would have led to the absorption of
the third mobile operator in Belgium, leaving Proximus and
Mobistar as the only two competitors on the market.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the creation of a duopoly on the Belgian market, the
France Telecom/Orange offered to divest their interest in the KPN
Orange joint venture to an independent third party, according to
the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the EU gave the green light to the deal by France
Telecom.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to See Trade Surplus of 9.7 Billion Dollars This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's government-run
economic research institute Monday predicted the country's trade
surplus to be some 9.7 billion U.S. dollars this year, less than
the official estimate.
</P>
<P>
The (South) Korea Institute of Economics and Trade said in a
report that due to increase in imports, the country's trade
surplus would drop to around 5.3 billion dollars in the second
half of this year, bringing down the surplus total.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy
estimated the trade surplus totals 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The institute put second-half exports at 90.7 billion dollars,
up 16.8 percent from the same period last year, and compared the
figure with 83 billion dollars in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chiefly as a result of increased international oil
prices, the country's imports would grow by 30.5 percent to 85.4
billion dollars in the second half, raising this year's imports
total to 164 billion, up 37 percent from 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Learns to Play Defence from Second Loss to NBA Legends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, Guangdong Province, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The NBA
Legends proved they are the teachers of any dimensions on the
court, especially of the defence, to the younger Chinese national
team, whom they beat in the second straight game 90-77 on Sunday
in the Tianhe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Leading by the NBA 50 Greatest Player Clyde Drexler, the
Legends, who won the Game One 79-73 in Beijing on Thursday,
cemented the Asian champions with one-on-one marking defence to
claim the second consecutive victory of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
"It's not very surprised to lose the second game," said Chinese
head coach Jiang Xingquan. "The Legends team is better than us
though they are retired players."
</P>
<P>
But the Legends head coach Rick Barry was optimistic with the
Olympics Odyssey of the Chinese team, which will face the United
States in the opening game in Sydney Games in September.
</P>
<P>
"If they could make better of chance playing with the Legends,
learning how to play defence like the NBA players, they may be in
the last eight in Sydney," said Barry.
</P>
<P>
China finished eighth four years ago in the Atlanta Games, and
the same placing in the World Championships in 1994. They are
expecting some break-through with the "Twin Towers", Wang Zhizhi
and Yao Ming, in the upcoming Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The duo proved the basement of the team on both ends, with the
2.13-meter Wang, 24, more versatile on offence and the 2.28-meter
Yao, 19, more solid on defence.
</P>
<P>
The Legends, consisted of such big retired names like Eddie
Johnson, Buck Williams and Ronaldo Blackman, took an early lead
with Blackman's three-pointer on 3-0, but trailed all the way in
the first half when Wang and Yao were on full wing.
</P>
<P>
Leading 45-41 after the break, China floored the smaller power
forward Liu Yudong for Wang, and Drexler stole the lead with three
3-pointers in row at the start of the second 20-minute half to
make it 53-51.
</P>
<P>
China did not come up again after the setback and the Legends
had the good of the game.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Legends Tour in China will be concluded with Game Three
in Shanghai on August, 17.

<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Six Egyptian parents have been
arrested for helping their children cheat on a secondary school
placement exam, an official of the Education Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 50 parents gathered near the Dar el-Salam school in the
southern city of Sohag, where their children were taking the exam,
said Mustafa Mohamed Mustafa, undersecretary of state for education
and teaching.
</P>
<P>
A number of them entered the school and shouted out answers to
the questions being asked by the teachers, Mustafa was quoted as
saying by the country's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Police moved in and arrested the six, while others managed to
flee, he added.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it is a common practice at exam time but
only came to light after Mustafa was called in by the examination
jury to deal with the problem. A commission has been set up to
study whether to annul the Sohag examination results because of
fraud.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Gaddafi to Mediate Hostage Crisis in Philippines: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- France has asked Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi to mediate the negotiations between the Philippine
government and Muslim rebels on the release of a dozen hostages
taken by the rebels last April, reported the local popular weekly
Canard Enchaine in its latest issue dated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Three French hostages are among the group of tourists who were
taken hostage by Philippine Muslim rebels of Abu Sayyaf in April
in a Malaysian island and then are kept in captivity in the
southern Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Canard Enchaine quoted its sources as saying that France has
asked Libya to pay for the ransom to the hostage takers and will
in exchange help Libya break its diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the French Foreign Ministry went to
Tripoli early this month to negotiate with Gaddafi on the issue
and promised the latter that France will make "a strong political
gesture" for Libya in return.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi wants to be invited to attend the European-Mediteranean
summit to be held in November in Marseilles, and wants France to
help Libya end the United Nations' economic sanctions, said the
weekly.
</P>
<P>
Libya has sent a plane to Manila which is waiting to fly to
Jolo to bring the hostages to Tripoli.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament to Hold Another Special Session on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset, or
Parliament, decided Tuesday afternoon to call another special
meeting during the summer recess to discuss the possible renewal
of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Knesset session, which itself was a special session in
the summer recess beginning on August 2, made the decision after 39
legislators voted for the motion, while only one Knesset member
voted against it.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the next special meeting, according to Israeli
Channel 3 Television reports, will include the opposition parties'
charges against Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on the legality
of his government, his negotiating behavior in the peace talks, his
continuing talks with the Palestinians without a Knesset majority.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's control in the 120-member Knesset had
shrunk from a 68-majority to a 40-minority following a series of
resignations by his ruling partners over talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's session, Ariel Sharon, chairman of the leading
opposition Likud party, accused Barak of surrendering Israeli soils
in the talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a proposal submitted during last month's
Camp David talks, in which Israel will exchange lands with the
Palestinians for annexing some settlements in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day-long summit talks, attended by Barak, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, failed to reach
any agreement in the end.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, there are reports that the three leaders may hold
another three-way summit in New York when they attends the upcoming
United Nations Millennium Summit there at the beginning of next
month.
</P>
<P>
However, Likud faction whip Reuven Rivlin reiterated Tuesday
that the Knesset should bar Barak from continuing talks with the
Palestinians as long as he did not have a majority in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that he is planning to garner signatures of 61
lawmakers in favor of a plenary session of the Knesset on August
28.
</P>
<P>
At the end of such a plenary meeting, Rivlin hoped, a regulation
stipulating that the prime minister cannot sign any agreement
without the support of a majority of the Knesset could be passed.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin threatened that if Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg does not
permit this special meeting, he will consider petitioning Israel's
High Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government, Immigrant Absorption Minister Yuli
Tamir said that in her opinion, there is no question over Barak's
legal power to continue the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, she added, was directly elected by Israeli
people by a large margin and when he finishes an agreement with
Arafat, he will surely bring it to a referendum as he had promised.
</P>
<P>
The people will judge his achievement in the referendum, the
minister concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Attorney-General Rules Barak's Appointments Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein ruled Tuesday that Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
appointment of ministers and parliament members as acting ministers
is legal, even if they are returning to the portfolios they
resigned earlier.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was made in response to a complaint filed by Knesset
(parliament) member Limor Livnat from the opposition Likud faction
against Barak's appointments and questioned the legality of them.
</P>
<P>
Livnat had objected to the appointments of Ra'anan Cohen from
the ruling One Israel bloc as Minister of Labor and Social Affairs,
and Roni Milo from Center Party as Health Minister, without the
approval of the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
She had also objected to the anticipated return of the left-wing
Meretz party to the ministries of education, trade and industry,
and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
A representative for the attorney general responded to Livnat's
objections in a letter. Rubinstein conceded that the situation is
problematic and undesirable. However, he said that it does not go
against the law.
</P>
<P>
The attorney added that the law authorizes the prime minister to
make appointments, which do not need Knesset approval, as long as
they are for a period of less than one year.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to meet Meretz leader Yossi Sarid Tuesday
evening on the possibility of having the party back into the
government. Three Meretz ministers resigned in June at the height
of a government crisis triggered by Sarid's disputes with the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party over funding for the powerful religious
party's educational network.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, the former education minister, has expressed the
willingness to rejoin the government but on conditions that he
returns to the education portfolio with full authority over the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Barak has filled up posts vacated by such former
coalition partners as Israeli Ba'aliya (Russian Immigrants' Party),
the National Religious Party and Shas Party, and later by former
Foreign Minister David Levy.

<HEADLINE> U.S., British Jets Bomb Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said that the U.S. and
British warplanes bombed its northern part on Tuesday, but reported
no damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
an Iraqi military spokesman said that at 11:20 local time (0720
GMT), seven formations of the U.S. and British planes carried out
14 armed sorties over the three northern provinces of Dohuk,
Neiveva and Erbil.
</P>
<P>
The planes bombed "civilian and service installations" in the
area, the spokesman said, adding that Iraqi gunners opened fire at
the aggressing planes and forced them to flee back to their bases
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British jets have been enforcing the so-called no-fly
zone in northern Iraq, imposed after the 1991 Gulf War with the
claimed aim of protecting the region's Kurdish population.

<P>
A similar air exclusion zone was also set up in southern Iraq to
allegedly protect the Shiite Muslims there and is patrolled by U.S.
and British aircraft based in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the zones, which are not authorized
by any specific United Nations resolution, and has regularly fired
on aircraft patrolling them since the joint U.S.-British air
strikes against Iraq in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Japanese MP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said on Tuesday Jordan is keen to strengthen relations with Japan,
the largest creditor to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Japanese
parliamentarian and President of the Japan-Jordan Parliamentary
Friendship Association Koichi Kato.
</P>
<P>
The monarch commended assistance provided by Japan in the
development process of Jordan as well as its efforts to promote
peace in the Middle East region, Jordan's official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the role played by the Japan-Jordan
Parliamentary Association in boosting relations between the two
countries in all fields, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kato expressed satisfaction over the status quo of
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also lauded King Abdullah's efforts in establishing a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region as well as his
efforts to develop national economy and to achieve sustainable
development at home, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Abdullah bestowed upon Kato the independence
medal of the first order in appreciation of his contribution to
promoting friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kato arrived here on Monday for a two-day friendly visit to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting on Tuesday, Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah al-Khatib told Kato that Jordan attaches importance to
developing ties with Japan, and the kingdom appreciates Japan's
efforts to promote peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Currently Japan is the largest creditor to Jordan and some 1.9
billion U.S. dollars out of Jordan's 6.9 billion dollars of foreign
debts are owed to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese laws prohibit the government from writing off debts for
another country, but part of the debts owed by Jordan are likely to
be converted into Japanese investments into the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Journalists Association Criticizes Press Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Association of Journalists
on Tuesday strongly criticized the crackdown on pro-reform
newspapers and journalists by the country's conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Terming the "restrictions and hardships" exerted on journalists
as unprecedented in Iran's history, the association demanded the
Majlis (parliament) to take measures to safeguard press freedom,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Majlis members should move to prevent the illegal bans on
newspapers and safeguard the freedom of expression, the association
said in an open letter to the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly protest the manner in which journalists are treated
and plead for justice," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The association urged the Majlis to stand firmly, with its legal
mechanisms, against the blatant disrespect of journalists' rights.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary has for the past few months
ordered the closure of over 20 pro-reform newspapers and journals
on the so-called charges of defamation, violating Islamic values
and propagating pro-American reforms. A number of reformist
journalists have also been imprisoned on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
The move came after President Mohammad Khatami's reformist
allies won an overwhelming victory over their conservative
opponents in February's Majlis election.
</P>
<P>
Iran's reformist-controlled Majlis, which replaced its
conservative predecessor on May 27, has tried to remove the
restrictive clauses in the press law, the basis for the
conservative crackdown on reformist papers and journalists.
</P>
<P>
But on August 6, a scheduled debate on the press law in the
Majlis was cancelled on the order of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the highest authority of the country who is believed to
stand by the conservatives.

KAMPALA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 top officers of
the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) will be laid off by the
end of this year to help streamline and enhance efficiency in the
army, said Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that Acting Chief of Staff Stephen Kashaka has
instructed all unit commanders to list all the officers whose

</P>
<P>
The army authorities are also targeting undisciplined officers,
especially those who drink excessively, and those with poor health
and without skills, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Defense Minister Stephen Kavuma as saying that "UPDF
is one of the most disciplined armies in Africa and the whole
world, army officers and soldiers will be enjoined to uphold
discipline or else they face the harsh rules."

<HEADLINE> SADC to Facilitate Implementation of Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of Ministers of
Trade for the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has
considered and approved all necessary documentation to facilitate
implementation of its free trade protocol on September 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference here on Tuesday, Zambian Minister
of Commerce, Trade and Industry William Harrington said 11 of the
14 member states, namely Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, will join this arrangement first.
</P>
<P>
The SADC Trade Protocol was signed at the Heads of State summit
in August 1996 in Maseru, Lesotho. By the time when the Windhoek
summit was held on August 4, 2000 in Namibia, 10 of the 11 member
states that are party to this protocol had ratified it. Zambia is
the only country that has yet to ratify.
</P>
<P>
With the two-thirds majority that is required to enforce the
protocol already attained, the minister said, it should have come
into force on January 25, 2000. However, the implementation
process could not be effected due to the fact that negotiations
were still on-going.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia, on its part, had not been in a comfortable
position to consider the ratification prior to the recent SADC
Trade Minister Retreat in the Tanzanian capital Dar-es-Salaam, due
to a number of unresolved issues.
</P>
<P>
The Dar-es-Salaam Retreat afforded Zambia the opportunity to
resolve several of the outstanding issues, which include the rules
of origin, dispute settlement mechanism, elimination of non-tariff
barriers, treatment of sensitive products and market access on
sugar, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Zambia is fully committed to
implementing the trade protocol scheduled for September 1 and its
current position does not in any way imply that the country is not
committed to seeing the process through.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Lawyers Demonstrate for Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- About 100 members of the Law
Society of Zimbabwe Tuesday staged a peaceful demonstration to
force the government to restore the rule of law on commercial
farms invaded by war veterans.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers marched to the parliament building in Harare where
they delivered the petition to Speaker Emmerson Mnangagwa who was
expected to hand it over to President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"We are apolitical and not opposed to land reform, but this has
to be done in a legal and orderly manner," President of the Law
Society Sternford Moyo told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Law Society has appealed to the responsible authorities on
many occasions to restore the rule of law but in vain, Moyo said,
citing a recent letter to the new Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo
to discuss the issue but there was no response.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed with the commitment of the government to
restore the rule of law," he said. "The matter does not appear to
have enjoyed the urgency which it deserves."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of war veterans have invaded about 1,500 white-owned
commercial farms to force the government to speed up its land
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The government has recently started a fast-track land
resettlement program aimed at resettling landless people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Urged to Conserve Natural resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Executive Director of the
Environment 2000 Foundation of Zimbabwe Charlene Hewat Tuesday
called on war veterans occupying farms and other people being
resettled under the government's fast-track land redistribution
program to conserve natural resources.
</P>
<P>
She was quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency as saying that there
had been wanton destruction of trees on occupied farms and this
would have disastrous consequences on future generations.
</P>
<P>
"It is disastrous," she said. "Trees are the lungs of the earth
and by destroying them we are destroying our future generations."
</P>
<P>
She urged those on occupied farms and those having been
resettled to use the land sustainably without rampant destruction
of trees.
</P>
<P>
There was need for proper planning and implementation of the
land redistribution program to avoid further depletion of the
forests, she said, adding that "it is unfortunate they are looking
at the short-term benefits but in the long-term we must conserve
our trees."
</P>
<P>
According to Hewat, the Environment 2000 Foundation had met
several times with the national leadership of the former
liberation war fighters urging them to advise their members to
desist from cutting down trees, but the situation had not improved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an environment program officer was quoted as saying
that it was difficult to source funds for environmental management
programs for people on occupied farms because "there is no
documentation from the government and everything is being done
haphazardly."
</P>
<P>
Farm occupations which started in February this year had been
blamed for exacerbating the extent of environmental damage.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Police Seize Over 30 Kilograms of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Swiss city of
Zurich have seized 31.1 kilograms of heroin with a street value of
over 580,000 U.S. dollars and arrested three men, according to a
Swiss Radio International report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police took action Saturday after a search of two vehicles
yielded 32 packets of heroin, each weighing half a kilogram. Two
men were arrested, a police statement said.
</P>
<P>
Police then raided an apartment in Volketswil, belonging to the
parents of one of the men, and discovered a further 28 packets. A
third man was arrested at a separate location in Rumlang later
that day, and was found to be carrying 1,3 kilograms of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The three suspects, all in their early 20s, were not named, but
were said to be from former Yugoslavia. Two are residents in
Switzerland, and one lives in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Police said it was unclear whether the drugs were intended for
sale in Switzerland or were to be exported. They said the
investigation was continuing.
</P>
<P>
The seizure is a major victory for Zurich police, given that 51
kilograms of heroin were seized by Switzerland's border guards
over the whole of last year.

<HEADLINE> China: Comprehensive Settlement of Bosnia Issue Relies on Bosnians Proper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China said here Tuesday
that the international community, when taking part in the
reconstruction in Bosnia, must adhere to the principle of giving
priority role to the people of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Chen Xu, representative of the Chinese
Mission to the United Nations, took the floor at an open U.N.
Security Council meeting on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We have always believed that the comprehensive and thorough
settlement of the question of Bosnia depends ultimately on the
people in Bosnia and Herzegovina themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"When participating in the reconstruction in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the international community must adhere to the
principle of giving priority role to the people themselves there,
respect the will and choice of the people there, and focus its
work on helping the local people realize self-government and self-
reliance and gradually reduce their dependence on foreign aid," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, once the international assistance is reduced, all
kinds of social and economic problems will arise again," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of the national reconciliation is the
fundamental guarantee for the peoples of Bosnia to enjoy their
life and peaceful coexistence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go before this goal can be achieved,"
he said. "There still exists radical and extreme elements in all
the parties, the international community, including the United
Nations, needs to make greater efforts in promoting the national
reconciliation among all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina
so as to ultimately build a unified, democratic and economically
self-dependent Bosnia and Herzegovina," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen voiced his appreciation of "the important
contribution" by the U.N. Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (
UNMIBH) and the International Police Task Force to promoting the
positive development in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the good progress made by the U.N. Mission in
reforming and training police there and the efforts to strengthen
the legal institutions there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But, the recruitment of police from minorities is still not
satisfactory, and it is our hope that the UNMIBH will continue its
efforts in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the stability in the overall situation
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the implementation of the Dayton
peace accord," signed in 1995 to end the bloody Bosnian war, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This can be attributed to the political will and cooperation
demonstrated by all ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it should be realized that the progress is far slower
than what the international community had expected in implementing
the peace accord," he added.

<HEADLINE> Inflation In Britain Steadies In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Britain stayed
unchanged in July, easing fears that the Bank of England may move
to raise interest rates soon, according to official figures
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The key underlying inflation rate, used by the bank for setting
interest rates, was at 2.2 percent, comfortably below the
government's 2.5 percent target, the Office for National
Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The headline rate of inflation, which includes mortgage rate
payments, also remained unchanged from June at 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the rising cost of petrol had pushed the
headline inflation rate up to its highest level for nearly two
years in June.
</P>
<P>
In a report published last week, the Bank of England warned
that inflation would rise above the government's target over the
next two years.

UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan announced here Tuesday that the world body will
resume aid flights to the Sudan, lifting a week-long suspension
that followed a spate of government bomb attacks on relief
aircraft and compounds.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was contained in a statement issued here by
Annan's spokesman. The Sudanese government has given the United

</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is pleased to announce that tomorrow,
August 16, 2000, the United Nations will resume all humanitarian
relief flights throughout the Sudan," the statement said. "He
welcomes that he received from the president of the Republic of
the Sudan that all measures are being taken to ensure the safety
of Operation Lifeline Sudan personnel and aircraft."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general trusts that the government of the Sudan
and other parties to the conflict will continue to honor fully
their commitment to ensure the safety and security of relief
workers and also the vulnerable populations whose urgent needs U.N.
humanitarian personnel are trying to address throughout the
country," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led relief effort, the Operation Lifeline Sudan,
suspended flights on August 8 after some 18 bombs were dropped
near a U.N. aircraft in the southern town of Mapel.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed a dramatic escalation o bomb strikes on
rebel-held towns in the southern Sudan by government warplanes.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2 million people have been killed in the conflict
and related famines. Millions are dependent on relief supplies
from aid agencies which fly daily to dozens of locations to drop
or distribute food.

<HEADLINE> Ecstasy Seizures in Canada Almost Double Last Year's Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian police have seized 712,
000 tablets of the designer drug Ecstasy this year, almost
doubling the entire haul for 1999, the Ottawa Citizen reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizures of the "feel-good" tablets, with a street value up
to 28.5 million Canadian dollars (about 19.2 million U.S. dollars),
illustrate demand for the drug has exploded from last year's haul
of just 360,000 tablets, which were valued up to 14.4 million
Canadian dollars (about 9.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The growing demand for the drug has caused two major problems.
One is that drug producing labs are threatening to shift from
their traditional bases in Europe to Canada.
</P>
<P>
There are no estimates as to the number of labs, but there
appears to be no shortage, according to Det. Randy Smith of the
Toronto police major drug unit.
</P>
<P>
Each investigation conducted by the Toronto police this year
has turned up a lab, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that drug producers are increasingly
targeting easy prey of teens.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's most populous province of Ontario, about 4.8
percent of junior and high school students have used the drug in
the past 12 months, said a study by the Center for Addiction and
Mental Health in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Police say that they are getting better at investigating
Ecstasy operations whether it involves rings that import the drug
into the country, or labs that manufacture the drug in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Ecstasy's popularity is largely based on the widely-held belief
that it has no negative side effects. But researchers have warned
that more use has meant more Ecstasy related deaths.
</P>
<P>
Research is beginning to detail the depression or hangover that
can occur a few days following an Ecstasy high.

<HEADLINE> Prices For Germany's UMTS Licenses Keep Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Bidders for license to build
Germany's future mobile system Tuesday offered a total sum of 83.3
billion Deutsche marks (38.6 billion U.S. dollars) as the auction
on the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), is
approaching the end.
</P>
<P>
In the 148th round, there are still six consortiums, one fewer
than at the start, vying for 12 frequency blocks in auction in
Frankfurt held by the German telecommunication authorities.
</P>
<P>
There are speculations that one more bidder will soon quit,
which leaves enough blocks for the remaining ones to end the
competition, probably by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
The UMTS, which offers a data-transporting speech 200 times
more than the currently used GSM, or Global System of Mobile,
phones, enables customers to enjoy multi-media functions,
including Internet-surfing on mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel has made it clear that
expected billions of proceeds from the UMTS auction will go to
debt reduction. But opposition parties have called for part of the
income to be used in alleviating the tax burden of ordinary
families.
</P>
<P>
The 80-some billion DM (37.1 billion dollars) is four times as
much as what was originally expected by Eichel, who said that in
case that 20 billion DM (9.3 billion dollars) is committed to
slashing Germany's national debt, the federal government can save
1 billion DM (0.46 billion dollars) in interest payment.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. national soccer coach
Clive Charles named Monday three over-23 players to join the men's
Olympic soccer team, bounding for the Olympic Games slated for
September 15-October 1.
</P>
<P>
The overaged players are defenders Jeff Agoos, Frankie Hejduk
and midfielder Chris Armas, all of whom are regular starters on

26, at right back.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 players Charles selected, 14 were on the team that
qualified back in April for the Olympics, and the only new face
added was defender Evan Whitfield, a member of the U.S. under-23
team.
</P>
<P>
Charles was an assistant on the U.S. 1998 World Cup team that
finished at the bottom of the expanded 32-team quadrennial soccer
gala.
</P>
<P>
Following are the complete roster for the Summer Olympic Games:
</P>

UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Five experts led by a
former minister of energy from Cote d'Ivoire, Safiatou Ba-N'Daw,
have been appointed to probe how diamonds and other natural
resources are illegally exploited to fuel a many-sided conflict in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the United Nations said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the president of the U.N. Security Council, U.

Nairobi-based panel, which is appointed for six months.
</P>
<P>
Annan described the former minister, who is also a former
official of the World Bank, as "an eminent person whose experience
amply qualifies her to occupy this important position."
</P>
<P>
The other four members of the panel are Francis Ekoko of
Cameroon, Moustapha Tall of Senegal, Henri Maire of Switzerland,
and Mel Holt of the United States, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment must be confirmed by the Security Council,
which asked Annan in the June 2 resolution to recommend names.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the panel will "convene in New York for an
initial briefing period before proceeding to Nairobi, which would
serve as the basis of their operations."
</P>
<P>
The decision to look into illegal trade in mineral resources in
the DRC is modeled upon the council's investigation of breaches of
U.N. sanctions against the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the DRC, the former Zaire, has been going on since
August 1998. The government of President Laurent Kabila, backed by
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, is battling rebel groups supported
by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The DRC panel will "follow up on reports and collect
information on all activities of illegal exploitation of natural
resources and other forms of wealth," the council resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the panel will "research and analyze
the links between the exploitation of the natural resources and
other forms of wealth in the DRC and the continuation of the
conflict."

<HEADLINE> U.N. Promotes Police Reform in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Tuesday said that the U.N. Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (
UNMIBH) promoted police reform there through cutting down on the
allowed police strength by some 1,000 to 10,600 because of the
reduced needs in some areas of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, U.N. under-secretary-general for peacekeeping,
told an open Security Council meeting that the police reduction
was made "because of the introduction of the State Border Service
and reduced needs in some of the smaller Federation cantons."
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the U.N. drive to achieve police
restructuring, police reform and the strengthening of the common
institutions in the police sector, which was identified by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his report to the Security Council
as the main priorities for the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, registration of police officers continues and since
June 2, 2000, more than 2,800 additional officers have been
registered," he said. "The mission is on track to conclude the
registration process by mid-December 2000 resulting in the first
transplant and comprehensive Law Enforcement Personnel Registry in
Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
"In parallel to the registration of the current police officers,
UNMIBH continues to assist local authorities in fulfilling their
obligation to ensure an adequate minority representation in their
police forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
The steps included the recruitment of minority cadets for the
police academies, voluntary redeployment of serving minority
officers between entities, and the encouragement for the displaced
and refugees for police officers to return to their pre-war homes
and rejoin local police forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In total, nearly 450 minority officers are currently attending
or have graduated from the two academies and 130 minority officers
have been identified for redeployment across entity lines," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"To promote police reform, UNMIBH has continued its efforts to
institute police commissioners in the Federation police, in order
to create a professional, nonpartisan, civil service-type
leadership for the police and insulate it from the direct
political influence of the Ministry of the Interior," Miyet said.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, the Security Council adopted a resolution to
authorize a 12-month extension of the UNMIBH, which comprises the
International Police Task Force and the Stabilization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
The International Police Task Force monitors, trains and
assists local police in Bosnia, where refugees have often
encountered hostilities when trying to return home in areas that
were "ethnically cleansed" during the 1992-1995 conflict involving
Moslems, Croats and Serbs.

<HEADLINE> 100 DPRK People Reunite With Their S.Korean Families in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- In tearful reunions, 100
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) people hugged and
wept with their South Korean relatives Tuesday afternoon whom they
had not seen more than 55 years.
</P>
<P>
The 3,600-square conference hall of the Conference and
Exhibition Center in southern Seoul was overwhelmed with tears and
cries of bitter joy for minutes when the 100 DPRK people were
crying or screaming together with some 500 South Koreans in each
other's arms.
</P>
<P>
The separated family members kept calling "Mom !" "Dad" "My son
!""My daughter !" "Sister !" "Brother !" as if they were trying to
heal the pain of decades of separation in a single moment with
tears streaming ceaselessly down their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
The family reunions demonstrated that blood is thicker than
water no matter how long the separated family members have lived
in different societies.
</P>
<P>
Most South Koreans reportedly wept when they watched the
reunion of these lucky families on TV because it reflected the
reality of 55 years' national division and the dream of national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
In another move to further reconciliation after the Pyongyang
inter-Korean summit, Seoul and Pyongyang Tuesday morning exchanged
100 people from each side by air for the family reunions, timed
with the 55th anniversary of liberation from the Japanese colonial
rule on August 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
"We (South and North) are now ushering in the era of the Korean
peninsula. This is a dream but a portrait of what will be in near
future," said President Kim in his speech to mark the Liberation
Day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Seoul and Pyongyang have agreed on more separated family
reunions in near future.
</P>
<P>
"Separated families are a shameful thing worldwide. We are all
brothers and sisters. We must reunify our nation," said DPRK Kim
Dong Jin when asked of his comment on the family reunion.
</P>
<P>
Ryu Mi-youn, head of the 100-member DPRK delegation, said the
family reunions will promote national reconciliation and unity and
implement the South-North Joint Declaration signed by South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il at their
historic summit in Pyongyang on June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
"Now the wall of confrontation and division that had been
frozen solidly has began collapsing," said the 78-year-old Ryu.
</P>
<P>
The 100 DPRK people arrived in Seoul aboard a DPRK Air Koryo
plane, which was the first DPRK plane to have landed on South
Korean soil since the 1950-1953 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
Under an itinerary issued by the South Korean government, the
people to Seoul and Pyongyang will enjoy six family reunions and
sightseeing during their four-day stay reunion.
</P>
<P>
Members of separated families on the Korean peninsula are
estimated to be around 11 million, according to the South Korean
Unification Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing inter-Korean family reunions are expected to help
build mutual confidence between Seoul and Pyongyang, thus leading
to further economic exchanges and reduction of military tension on
the Korean Peninsula, South Korean officials said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sues Jerry-Contractors Over Last Summer's Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 122 dossiers regarding
the contractors of the jerry-buildings that collapsed in Turkey's
western Izmit city and its Golcuk township in the deadly earthquake
on August 17, 1999, were sent on Tuesday to the Basic Criminal
Courts.
</P>
<P>
The republican prosecutors were conducting investigations into
the contractors of 392 and 534 cheesy buildings that broke down
respectively in Izmit and Golcuk in the devastating earthquake,
Anatolia News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors have so far completed the probe into contractors
of 70 ropy buildings in Izmit and 52 in Golcuk, requesting
imprisonment terms between four and 10 years for the jerry-
contractors.
</P>
<P>
Owners of those dwellings, which were heavily or moderately
damaged in the quake but where nobody died, had filed lawsuits in
the Fourth Basic Civil Court to get compensations from the jerry-
builders.
</P>
<P>
The devastating quake, measuring 7.4 degrees on the open-ended
Richter scale, rocked Turkey's northwestern Marmara Region on
August 17, 1999, claiming 16,899 lives and injuring 23,781 people,
according to official figures. The high casualties were blamed on
poor quality of buildings.
</P>
<P>
In Izmit and its Golcuk township, the epicenter of the quake,
most buildings were demolished as if they had been made of
cardboards.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, 1999, another 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit the
northwestern Bolu province, claiming hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is an earthquake-prone country. After the two deadly
earthquakes, the government has put strict emphasis on quality of
buildings.

process as "small."
</P>
<P>
The American envoy added in an upbeat tone that a compromise can
be reached between the Palestinians and Israel soon, reported the

</P>
<P>
"Our optimism is that because the differences are somewhat
small, we will be able to reach an agreement in the not too distant
future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walker said, "when I say small it doesn't mean not important.
These differences are critically important, foremost among them is
the question of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that important developments were recorded in the
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David last month, the senior U.S.
State Department official said, "our shared conviction is that this

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's overall retail
sales in June 2000 ran up to 2.72 billion Singapore dollars (about
1.60 billion U.S. dollars), rising significantly by 23.1 percent

with the 2.47 billion Singapore dollars in the previous month,
according to data released by the Singapore Department of
Statistics Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Turn Bone Marrow Into Nerve Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. research team has
successfully coaxed bone marrow cells into becoming nerve cells,
raising the tantalizing possibility of an easily accessible source
of replacement cells to treat brain and nerve injuries and
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the August issue of Journal of Neuroscience Research,
the team of researchers at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey said they had developed a culture that
makes stem cells, the so-called body master cells that have the
potential to develop into any types of cells, turn into nerve
cells "like wildfire."
</P>
<P>
In their study, the researchers removed stem cells from the
bone marrow of rats and of humans and grew them in the laboratory
in shallow dishes. The cells normally would develop into tendon,
cartilage, muscle and fat.
</P>
<P>
Then they added an antioxidant, beta mercaptoethanol that had
been shown to help neurons live and grow, and some growth factors
such as fibroblast growth factor.
</P>
<P>
It turned out that 80 percent of the cells were converted into
neurons, said Dr. Ira Black, the leading scientist of the study.
</P>
<P>
Black and colleagues then transplanted the rat nerve cells to
the brains and spinal cords of rats and found that they survived,
for months so far.
</P>
<P>
Next they will test the cells in animals with Alzheimer's,
stroke, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injuries. And experts
emphasized that huge amount of work needed to be done.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Rises 0.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. industrial production
increased 0.4 percent in July from June despite a big drop in
electric utility output caused by unseasonably mild weather, the
Federal Reserve reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 0.4 percent increase, following a 0.2 percent gain in June,
was in line with what many analysts had expected and provided
evidence that manufacturing continues to rebound from last year's
sluggish performance. It was the fourth straight monthly advance
for output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output increased 0.5 percent in July, and mining
output rose 1.7 percent. Output at utilities, which dropped 2.5
percent in June, fell 3.3 percent last month as abnormally cool
weather in the east kept electricity generation down.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, industrial production in July was up 5.
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Fed report also said the nation's industries were operating
at 82.3 percent of capacity, up from 82.2 percent in June. The
capacity rate suggests an absence of production bottlenecks that
could cause shortages and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
There were other declining sectors in July, the Fed report
showed. Output of consumer goods fell 0.5 percent, led by durable
goods. Production of automotive products dropped 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The declines appeared to be in line with other recent data
suggesting a slowdown in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has boosted interest rates six times over the past 14
months in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation in
check. Many economists believe the Fed will leave rates unchanged
at its meeting next Tuesday, preferring to wait and see whether
the rate increases it has already approved will be enough to do
the job.

<HEADLINE> Russia Expresses Concern Over KFOR Seizure of Serb Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Tuesday
expressed "profound concern"over the Monday closure of a Serb
lead smelter in the flashpoint Kosovo town of Mitrovica forced by
the United Nations mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The plant, part of the Trepca mining and metals group in
Mitrovica that is divided into the Serb-dominated north and the
Albanian-held south, was occupied by the multinational
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) and the police units of the U.
N. mission in the Yugoslav province early Monday.
</P>
<P>
Such an action represents "an attempt to capture and estrange"
property that the U.N. mission does not own, the Interfax news
agency quoted a Foreign Ministry statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
There is "obviously a political motivation behind ... the
arbitrary seizure of the Trepca plant" without agreement of the
plant's legitimate owner, the Republic of Serbia, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It regarded the U.N. argument to justify the move as "holding
no water." Some U.N. officials have said that the smelter gives
off lead 200 times above the safe level into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The action taken by the U.N. mission in Kosovo and the U.N.
Secretary General's special envoy there, Bernard Kushner, has
manifested "their inability to solve problems... through political
dialogue," said the Foreign Ministry in the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the fact that more than 2,000 people, mostly
Serbs, were employed at the plant, one of the few businesses
continuing to operate in Kosovo after the launch of the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian Foreign Ministry
criticized Kushner for "forcing elections" in the Yugoslav
province this year "at any cost."
</P>
<P>
Such an approach will undermine efforts towards a truly
democratic state in Kosovo, the ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Kushner has decided to hold municipal elections on October 28
despite Russia's objections, the statement said, adding that it
will not support any election in Kosovo this year since not even
minimal conditions exist for a truly free, fair and democratic
election.

<HEADLINE> Evacuation Underway for Sunken Russian Submarine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that evacuation of the 116 servicemen aboard
the stranded "Kursk" submarine has started in the Barents Sea as
weather improves.
</P>
<P>
The storm in the area of the accident has calmed down, which
makes it possible to carry out the rescue operation, the Interfax
news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" went down to the bottom of the
Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routine exercise of the
Russian Northern Fleet. It is not yet clear whether there are any
casualties inside the submarine.
</P>
<P>
Russian Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the evacuation work
might last 6 to 7 hours, although "it is never possible to
forecast the situation because of the changing weather, poor
visibility and powerful underwater currents."
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident remains unknown and all
possibilities are being checked, Sergeyev said. He listed
collision with another object or an explosion in the first
compartment of the submarine as among the most probable scenarios.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were two U.S. submarines nearby at
the time of the accident, which reported sound of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk", with a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and
able to dive to an depth of up to 500 meters, was commissioned for
the Russian Navy in 1995. It is armed with torpedoes and "Granite"
cruise missiles. Earlier Interfax reports said the submarine can
operate autonomously for up to 120 days.

<HEADLINE> Glasses Have Hidden Trouble: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Results from the second quarter'
s selective examination of glasses shops show that only 65.7
percent examined shops are up to grade.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision surveyed
143 groups of glasses from 143 eyeglass shops, and only 94 of them
qualified.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found out that about 94 percent of large
professional (chain) eyeglass shops, each with more than five
million yuan of annual sales, reached the qualification standards,
while only 31.8 percent small shops each with less than 500,000
yuan sales annually met the standards.
</P>
<P>
All the large professional shops are equipped with advanced
machines, high-precision detective facilities and self-contained
lens storage, all of which guarantees the quality of their glasses,
said the survey.
</P>
<P>
A major problem found out by the survey is that many small
shops sell substandard lens.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has urged departments concerned to increase efforts
to improve the quality of glasses.

BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Patrolling part of China's
northwestern border is no longer done with soldiers riding on
horses, but by using patrol cars armed with high-tech equipment
like computers, wireless transmitters, GPS devices and video
cameras.

<P>
Commanders of the border troops in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region can easily monitor the situation on the border
area from hundreds of kilometers away as the patrol cars send back

The border troops getting on line with the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) information network shows that the army has entered
into a new stage of automated patrolling, according to military
experts.
</P>
<P>
Recently, border units of the Yili sub-commanding area of the
PLA invested millions of yuan to develop the automated patrolling
system and so far, all the local border troops have connected them
with the PLA information network center.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Several Japanese groups from
Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki and other Japanese cities gathered here
today to mourn the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese participants, gathering at the Memorial Hall to
Victims of the Nanjing Massacre, called upon everyone to take this
past event as a warning and create a peaceful new century.
</P>
<P>
Yamaochi Sayoko, secretary general of a Japanese organization
for supporting Azuma Shiro, a former Japanese soldier, said that
63 years ago, the Japanese war plane took off from Nagasaki and
launched the first bombing in Nanjing, which indicated the
beginning of the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
She said the mourning of the massacre victims is aimed at
preventing the reoccurrence of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, an 88-year-old former soldier, published his
wartime diary and disclosed the true facts of the Japanese
invasion.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Supreme Court has overruled his appeal in which he
sought to acknowledge the history of Japan's invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
Matsuo Katamaki, head of another Japanese group, said Japanese
right-wing forces have been attempting to deny historical facts
and the act violates the wishes of the Japanese people and people
from other countries around the world for peace in the new century.
</P>
<P>
She urged the Japanese people to remember the lessons of
history and keep away from war forever.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Disclose Genetic Elements in Leukemia Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists for the
first time in the world disclosed today a whole set of genes which
play a key role in treating an acute form of Leukemia.
</P>
<P>
The 169 genes can be adjusted by ATRA, a chemical element
derived from Vitamin A, to form a genetic system which controls
the division of white blood cells and help cure acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL), according to Chinese scientists'
research paper which was published in today's edition of "Blood,"
a prestigious magazine on hematology.
</P>
<P>
The paper has shown a lot of work and is very important and
meaningful, said Prof. Kenneth Kaushansky, the chief editor of the
magazine in a congratulatory letter.
</P>
<P>
In the mid 1980s, Wang Zhenyi from the Shanghai Hematology
Institute and other Chinese scientists succeeded in using ATRA to
treat APL, one of the most dangerous forms of leukemia in clinical
medicine. But it still remained a "riddle" for scientists in the
world to find out how the chemical works in treating the disease.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Shanghai Hematology Institute, Shanghai
Institute of Cell Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)
and the South Center of the National Genome Research have
cooperated in finding ATRA-controlled genes with methods of
functional gene research, and discovered the 169 genes and how
they form a network to prevent the growth of diseased cells.
</P>
<P>
They have also cloned eight new genes which are under the
control of ATRA, which provides new material for the next stage of
research.
</P>
<P>
The research findings has provided theoretical guidance for the
use of a drug in APL treatment and will also provide evidence for
the treatment of other types of leukemia and tumors, said Chen
Kaixian, an academician with the CAS and head of the Shanghai
Institute of Materia Medica.

<HEADLINE> Barak Pledges Further Peace Efforts, Calls Russian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said on Tuesday that Israel will push ahead its peace-making
efforts with the Palestinians, but will not rush for peace at any
price.
</P>
<P>
Touring the southern town of Eshkolot, Barak said even if Israel
cannot find a sincere peace partner in the peace process, it still
can win international support for its efforts, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted Israel will continue its peace efforts, but will not
strive for peace at any price.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Barak held a telephone conversation with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Prime Minister's Office said
Barak got the impression that Russia does not support a unilateral
declaration of statehood by the Palestinians before the September
13 deadline for a final peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader conveyed the same stance last week in a
meeting with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Prime Minister's Office was quoted by the
radio report as saying the Russian stance is of great importance,
viewing the traditional pro-Arab positions that the Russians have
taken.
</P>
<P>
The stance, said the official, again showed that Israel's
worldwide diplomatic efforts aimed at explaining the country's
stance on the peace talks are successful.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders hoped to hold talks while attending the U.N.
millenium summit in New York slated for September.
</P>
<P>
Barak also offered to help rescue the Russian nuclear-powered
submarine stranded on the Arctic seabed with more than 100 sailors
on board. Putin said the submarine is in serious conditions and the
chances to rescue the sailors are quite slim.
</P>
<P>
Barak called Putin last Thursday prior to Arafat's visit to
Russia to update him on the developments of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Following the failure of last month's Camp David summit, both
the Palestinians and Israelis launched an extensive information
campaign to drum up international support for their positions in
the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Estrada's Net Approval Rating Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The approval rating of Philippine
President Joseph Estrada has gone up to 53 percent mainly due to
his handling of the Mindanao conflict, according to the results of
a nationwide survey released Tuesday by Pulse Asia Inc.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Miranda of Pulse Asia said in a statement that in their
latest survey, President Estrada got an approval rating of 53
percent, as compared to a disapproval rating of 26 percent, or a
net approval rating of +27 points.
</P>
<P>
The Pulse Asia survey, conducted July 14-28 with 1,200
respondents, showed an increase of six percent in Estrada's net
approval rating, as against the figures collated and interpreted
by the poll body in March this year which gave him a net approval
rating of +21 points.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said the improved rating was mainly due to Estrada's
handling of the crisis situation in Mindanao, including the
hostage-taking by the Abu Sayyaf and the armed conflict between
government troops and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
According to Miranda, this was clearly reflected in the survey
results from Mindanao that showed President Estrada's approval
rating had gone up to 62 percent, compared to a disapproval rating
of only 17 percent, or a net approval rating of +41 points.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada's net approval rating in Mindanao was +28
points in March.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the president's net approval rating also
improved significantly in Metro Manila, from -6 points in March to
+27 points in July.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada's highest net approval rating of +65 points
was recorded in May 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), the country's highest law-making body here Tuesday
assigned President Abdurrahman Wahid to soon take strict measures
in dealing with separatist movements in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MPR also urged the president to take firm actions against
provocateurs who are inciting the communal bloodshed in the
provinces of Maluku, North Maluku and other provinces as well.
</P>
<P>
In a plenary session of the Assembly's annual meeting on
Tuesday, the Assembly's Commission C in charge of deliberating the
president's report and other high state institutions, stated that,
"The President has not yet been able to deal with separatist
movements which have been threatening the totality of the unitary
state of Indonesia especially in Aceh and Irian Jaya provinces."
</P>
<P>
The Commission C then decided to task the president to pay more
attention and take any necessary measures against the separatist
activities and soon implement the special autonomy bill in the
provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The president was also asked to rebuild the integrity and the
authority of the Indonesian Military (TNI) and the National Police
(Polri) so as the two institutions can do their best in carrying
out their duties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in economic field, the Commission C considered that
the ongoing economic recovery process was sluggish, urging the
president to accelerate the national banking restructuring program,
as well as speeding up the debt restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
"The Assembly assigns the president to soon create political
and security stability, provide guarantee of law, revise
investment bill, speed up privatization (of state owned companies)
process, and increase promotion of investment in the country," one
of the decree's appendix said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Issuing Shoot-to-Kill Order on MILF Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
clarified Tuesday that it has not issued a shoot-to-kill order
against Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) chairman Hashim
Salamat, vice-chairman for military affairs Al Haj Murad and MILF
spokesman Ed Kabalu.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department
of Interior and Local Government explained that the only directive
issued by his office involving the three MILF leaders was for law
enforcers to gather information that could lead to their arrest.
</P>
<P>
Lim announced earlier that the government is offering a total
of 9 million pesos (225,000 U.S. dollars) for information that
would lead to the arrest of the three top MILF leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I have not issued any shoot-to-kill order. I don't understand
who is spreading those words," he said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno earlier
clarified that the directive issued was for the arrest of the
three MILF leaders, and that no instructions were issued to have
them killed on sight.
</P>
<P>
Puno stressed that the law enforcers were only instructed to
act accordingly should Salamat, Murad or Kabalu resist arrest.
</P>
<P>
Lim said should the MILF leaders decide to fight it out with
the police, "the police and the military have to defend themselves.
"
</P>
<P>
Kabalu earlier issued a statement that he would rather be
killed than surrender to the police, saying that he will "fight it
out to the end."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to this, Lim said the police and military officers
will have to act accordingly, should they come face to face with
Kabalu.
</P>
<P>
Lim said posters are being ready to provide the public the
exact description of the MILF leaders, so they could volunteer
information on their location.

MOGADISHU, August 15 (Xinhua) -- While members of the Somali
transitional parliament were debating national issues under the
canvas of a tent in neighboring Djibouti, ordinary Somalis on the
dusty streets of Mogadishu expressed hope and jubilation that at
last they had a parliament, albeit in exile.
</P>
<P>
The TV and radio coverage made by the Djibouti government for
the announcement of the parliament on Sunday has immediately
touched every part of the Somali society in one way or the other
and most of the people celebrated for the inauguration of the
parliament by offering free meals to their fellow friends.
</P>
<P>
All of them are longing to see the fruits of the efforts made
by the Djibouti government and how the new legislators who just
started debating over their bylaws will tackle Somalia's multiple
problems. However, the sound of heavy machine guns blast
reverberating around their city reminded them that the armed
militia of the faction leaders still loomed large.
</P>
<P>
"It's awkward that guns are still to be tested whether they are
good to kill after ten years they reigned the country through
chaos," said Abdisalan Abdulle Mohamed, a whole salesman of
imported cloths in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
In the economical front, the value of the U.S. dollar has
plunged down to 8800 shillings on Monday, loosing more than 1000
shillings in one day, the sharpest downfall ever since the United
Nations forces abandoned Somalia in early 1995.

</P>
<P>
At present, the National Equities Commission and the National
Equities Association intend to create new regulations for the
operation of the Bucharest Stock Exchange and the RASDAQ over-the-
counter market.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations refer to the transactions of the two
markets, the decentralization of decisions and increasing the
attractiveness of the Romanian capital market.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily quoting stock exchange agents, a
solution to increase the liquidity on the capital market is to
provide a larger range of offers by quoting fixed income
instruments - bonds, T-bonds and municipal bonds. Such offers and
certain companies such as sports clubs will become extremely
attractive, stock exchange agents said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next period, the RASDAQ market will have two levels,
following the American NASDAQ model. The first level will operate
according to stock exchange principles and the second function as
an over-the-counter market for companies that no longer meet the
listing conditions.
</P>
<P>
After a compulsory shutdown that lasted 50 years, the Romanian
capital market was restored in 1994.

PRAGUE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Slovak President Rudolf Schuster
returned home Tuesday after 48 days of treatment in Austria, the
Czech News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After his plane landed in Bratislava, Schuster said that he has
felt the strength of Slovak citizens over the past few days, as "
the whole of Slovakia was living through it with me."
</P>
<P>
The president was accorded a warm welcome by Slovak Prime
Minister Migulas Dzurinda, parliament chairman Jozef Migas and
many ordinary citizens.

<HEADLINE> Importance of Peace Highlighted on Anniversary of Japan's Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Several Japanese civic groups held
rallies in Tokyo Tuesday to pledge for peace and express their
opposition to cabinet ministers' visits to Yasukuni Shrine on the
55th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 members of the Heiwa Izuokukai (group of bereaved
families of peace) held a meeting to discuss the current state of
Japan's war-renouncing Constitution.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the group members took to the streets and
marched near Yasukuni Shrine demanding that the prime minister and
cabinet members refrain from making official visits to the shrine
where 14 class-A war criminals, including Japan's wartime Prime
Minister Hideki Tojo, are enshrined.
</P>
<P>
Group member Itsuko Ishikawa, 67, stressed the importance of
speaking in concrete and accurate terms of the tragedy of war to
gain the understanding of young people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 200 people took part in a meeting sponsored by
the Forum Heiwa Jinken Kankyo (forum for peace, human rights, and
the environment) at the Chidorigafuchi cemetery in Tokyo's Chiyoda
Ward to offer a prayer for people killed in wars.
</P>
<P>
"We must not change our resolve to build peace on regret for
the past, and not resort to war," Takako Doi, chairwoman of the
opposition Social Democratic Party, told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Japan's Constitution has been admired throughout
the world as a new benchmark for the 21st century, Doi stressed
that it is the duty of the citizens to preserve its Article 9,
which renounces war and the use of force as means of settling
international disputes.

<HEADLINE> China Wants W.W.II Germ Warfare Test Base to Be on World Heritage List (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Bai, deputy director of the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage, compared the germ experiment in northeast China
with the slaughters at the Auschwitz concentration camp and in
east China's Nanjing City.
</P>
<P>
"The germ experiments are one of the most appalling Nazi war
crimes," he said. "The site of Unit 731 should be forever
preserved."
</P>
<P>
The Kwantung Army headquarters burned and buried its records of
Unit 731 to get rid of evidence just before Japan surrendered on
August 15, 1945. A large amount of the germ experiment data was
transferred to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Based on confessions from Japanese war criminals, more than 3,
000 people died from the experiments during 1940-45. But some
records suggest a much larger figure, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the records, Unit 731 experimented on more than 10,
000 prisoners of war and civilians from China, the Korean
Peninsula, and the former Soviet Union, and at least 936 died in
the first nine months of 1941. Over 200,000 people died from the
germ arms in the battle field.
</P>
<P>
Jin Chengmin, vice-curator of the archives on Unit 731, said, "
The site of a living hell will be renovated into a museum
appealing for peace throughout the world in four to five years."
</P>
<P>
So far 23 Chinese cultural and natural sites have been approved
by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) for the list. None of them has been for wars.
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima, one of the two Japanese cities which suffered from
an atomic bomb in 1945, has succeeded in applying for being
inscribed on the World Heritage list sponsored by UNESCO.

<HEADLINE> China Wants W.W.II Germ Warfare Test Base to Be on World Heritage List (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to have the
world's largest germ warfare experimental base, which was built by
Japanese troops in China during World War II, put on the World
Heritage list.
</P>
<P>
China started cleaning the site of Unit 731 of Japan's Kwantung
Army in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang this month. Over
100 households and some 10 factories are scheduled to move away
from the site.
</P>
<P>
The project which will probably cost nearly 100 million yuan (
12 million U.S. dollars) has got approval from the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage. Some Japanese non-
governmental organizations and civilians have made donations in
support of the project as well.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers hope to find out more evidence from the
scraps of the slaughterhouse which will be preserved permanently
as a special reminder of the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 was part of Japan's Kwantung Army, whose headquarters
were in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, in 1932. It is notorious
for manufacturing materials for germ warfare that were tested on
more than 10,000 live people.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 pieces of relics have been found at this site,
including anatomic appliances, incubators and shrapnel with germs.
What also remains on the site are vestiges of incinerators, a
vivisection center and typhoid and cholera laboratories. More
solid proof of Unit 731's crimes are likely to be found.
</P>
<P>
The six-square-kilometer site is now guarded and isolated by
enclosures with a sign that says "danger."
</P>
<P>
The results of experiment show no residue of germs in the area,
according to experts from the Chinese People's Liberation Army
Medical Research Institute and the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine who have participated in the checkup.

<HEADLINE> Underground Gallery on Old Murals Being Built in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIAYUGUAN (Gansu), August 15 (Xinhua) -- Jiayuguan, the western
end of the Great Wall, is now building a subterranean museum to
exhibit ancient frescos painted during the 220-420 period.
</P>
<P>
The underground gallery is located in an area 20 kilometers
northeast of Jiayuguan City, Gansu Province, where there are over
1,000 ancient tombs and a 30-kilometer-long section of the Great
Wall.
</P>
<P>
Over 700 murals have been discovered in nine of the old tombs
which are three-story brick structures covered with vaultings, a
kind of roof.
</P>
<P>
The frescos, which are painted with simple strokes but are very
colorful, mostly depict people working in the farmland, picking
mulberry leaves, herding, hunting, having banquets and playing
games.
</P>
<P>
But some of the graphs and characters on the brick walls of the
tombs are yet to be recognized, according to some experts who
believe the murals could provide useful reference for research on
politics, military affairs, culture and folk customs during that
period.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities plan to connect six of the nine tombs
underground to build subterranean exhibition halls which will be
open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
The No. 6 tomb is of great value because it stores the murals
of "Camel-Driving," which depicts commercial activities along the
Silk Road, and "Postman," which is now the symbol for China Post.
</P>
<P>
What surprises local researchers is that these tombs and
frescos have survived more than 1,000 years of weathering and
natural calamities as the area stands in the Northwest China
Seismic Belt.
</P>
<P>
Defensive ditches have been dug around the ancient tomb zone to
prevent vehicles from entering and damaging the relics. Meanwhile,
the city government has worked out a complete plan on the
underground exhibition of these ancient frescos.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad
held talks at People's Palace with visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh
Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani shortly after the emir arrived here
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed regional and bilateral issues of
common concern in the meeting which was also attended by high
ranking officials from both countries. Then the two leaders turned
away for a meeting in camera.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Doha, capital of Qatar, said the talks between
Hamad and Bashar touched on ways of cementing bilateral ties,
promoting comprehensive country-to-country cooperation and the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process after the
unsuccessful talks between Palestinian and Israeli leaders at Camp
David, the U.S., last month.
</P>
<P>
They also brought up the issue of Jerusalem considering the
explanations by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, they said.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Damascus, Hamad said that he came to Syria
to extend congratulations for Bashar who was elected Syria's
president in July and to confirm Qatar's support for Syria's right
to restore sovereignty over the Golan Heights captured by Israel in
the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that his visit will be a good opportunity to
exchange views and consult with Bashar over issues of common
concern and ways to further promote bilateral relationship.

<HEADLINE> Manila Doubts MILF's Sincerity to Talk Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
expressed doubts Tuesday over the sincerity and willingness of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to negotiate peace with the
government, following its withdrawal from the talks scheduled on
August 21 and 22.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary told reporters here that there was
no connection between the peace talks and the reward being offered
by the government for any information that could lead to the
arrest of the three MILF leaders with outstanding warrants of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for military affairs,
through a taped interview, reportedly called for the withdrawal of
the MILF from the peace talks because of the reward money offered
by the government for his capture as well as for the capture of
MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat and MILF Spokesman Eid Kabalu.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alfredo Lim of the Department of the Interior and
Local Government has earlier announced that the government is
offering 9 million pesos (225,000 U.S. dollars) reward to anybody
who can give information that would lead to the capture of the
three MILF leaders.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government regrets the decision of the MILF to
pull out from the talks, but stressed that the Muslim rebel group
has no right to cite as an argument, the reward offered against
Salamat, Murad and Kabalu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the three leaders with rewards on their heads are
not part of the MILF peace panel, as he stressed that safe conduct
passes have already been issued to those who were supposed to
participate in the talks from the MILF side.
</P>
<P>
Puno said that the government remains hopeful that the
negotiations will continue, adding that the government "remains
ready and willing to sit down and discuss further aspects of the
peace agreement with the MILF."
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
state in Mindanao for more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Economy Jitters With Little Risk of New Crisis By Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- With rising oil prices, a
weakened currency and a bearish stock market in scene, Thailand's
economy seems to have slipped back to the old hard days in 1997
and 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, since the macro-economic situation now is
significantly different from that which led to the crisis in mid-
1997, the country is not likely to experience a new round of
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's external debts hit 109 billion U.S. dollars in 1997
when it lost all of its foreign exchange reserves in the battle
with international speculators. People panicked, losing their
confidence in the Thai economy completely.
</P>
<P>
Capital flew out of the country at an incredible rate. The baht
went into a free-fall. Interest rates soared. Inflation ran out of
control.
</P>
<P>
But now, with around 30 billion dollars foreign reserves in
hand, the country has accumulated 9.6 billion dollars current
account surplus so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the oil prices rose to an all-time high, the
government is confident that inflation will not be pushed beyond
2 percent because of stable consumer-product prices.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1998 and for most of 1999, the baht was hovering
around 36 to 38 baht to a U.S. dollar, but it fell to 41.62
against the dollar on July 26, hitting a 10-month low.
</P>
<P>
Yet top Thai financial officials said they were comfortable
with the present foreign exchange rate which should help boost
exports, hinting that with an inflation rate below 2 percent this
year the Thai economy can tolerate the baht at 42 against the
dollar without sacrificing growth.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi insisted that
Thailand's economic growth this year will not fall below 5 percent
thanks to an improvement of the global economy, Thailand's
strengthening exports and the government's fiscal stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
The economy posted 5.2 percent growth in the first quarter,
halfway in the 4 to 6 percent annual range projected by the
central bank for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Exports remain a bright star in the economy, growing 30.4
percent in U.S. dollar terms in the first quarter year-on-year.
Manufacturing also grew across the board with rising exports and
stronger domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Strong global demand for computers helped put integrated
circuits and electronic parts at the top of Thai exports. Gains
were also shown in the auto, petrochemicals, steel, jewelry and
textile industries.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates, continued fiscal stimulus programs and
slight recovery in consumer confidence helped boost domestic
consumption, with department stores, car and motorcycle sales and
value-added tax collection all posting increases.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales grew 62.1 percent in the first quarter from the year
before due to stronger domestic demand. Private investment also
posted positive gains on higher car sales, capital goods imports
and cement sales.
</P>
<P>
All of these figures show that Thailand has come a long way
from where it was in 1997 and 1998. The question now is not
whether the economy will fall into a crisis again but how to
sustain the recovery.
</P>
<P>
Some factors are working against a sustainable recovery. A
prolonged slump in the stock market has made it virtually
impossible for companies to raise money. Meanwhile, credit has
continued to shrink. Banks are reluctant to lend given their 1.6
trillion baht (40 billion dollars) non-performing loans (NPLs).
</P>
<P>
Government debt accounts for 52 percent of the gross domestic
product. The current account, which has registered a surplus since
1998, could run into a deficit in 2002 if the high import trend
continues. Then the country will have a problem financing the
economy, given the 92.3 billion dollars external debts as of March.
</P>
<P>
But the most important factor affecting the market recently may
be the fears of a change of government at the next general
election, widely expected to be held in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Phatra Securities Ltd, a major local financial
institution, urges the next government to address four key issues
to restore optimism in the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
The first is a willingness to implement a well-planned fiscal
stimulus program in order to boost long-term productivity.
</P>
<P>
Next, the government should move ahead with the planned
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Third, the central bank's low-interest rate policy should
remain even if the baht declines to 43 or 44 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the government should adopt a proactive
interventionist role in the debt-restructuring and liquidation
processes, which may involve the use of additional public funds.
Such a move would help accelerate the net NPLs reduction.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Tribunal Successful in Handling Criminals of Rwanda Genocide: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has been successful in
apprehending and bringing into its custody 43 mostly high-ranking
individuals accused of being the architects and propellants of the
Rwandan genocide.
</P>
<P>
The individuals include Jean kambanda, Rwandan Prime Minister
and Head of Government during the 1994 genocide, 11 ministers in
his cabinet, senior political and media leaders, as well as
military commanders, ICTR Assistant Secretary-General and
Registrar Agwu Ukiwe Okali told a press conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda's sentencing on a plea of guilty was the first time in
history that an individual, let alone a former Head of Government,
had been punished for the crime of genocide by an international
court, Okali said while attending a workshop here held by the East
African Law Society.
</P>
<P>
Another achievement of the Rwanda tribunal with far-reaching
potential implications is its pioneering advocacy for the
development of restitutive justice for crimes against humanity and
war crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Okali, the tribunal's achievement helps create
peace and national reconciliation in the Great Lake Region,
especially in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He urged Africans to absorb and internalize the lessons of the
Rwandan genocide so as to ensure a crime of such nature and
proportions should never again occur.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, over half a million ethnic Tutsi and politically
moderate Hutus were massacred within a period of three months.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 955 in
1994, which created the ICTR to bring to justice those responsible
for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Veteran Writes Book on Japanese Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chen Ping, a scholar who
was a soldier during World War II, wrote a book on the atrocities
committed by Japanese troops in China along the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Chen's book unveiled the history of depopulated zones made by
the Japanese invaders since 1933 in northeast and north China.
According to the pictures and historical documents Chen has
collected, the Japanese troops have killed 200,000 Chinese
civilians, destroyed 17,000 villages, and burnt 3.8 million rooms,
in order to produce the "no man's zone" in order to keep Chinese
civilians from anti-Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
Chen cited two massacres that happened in 1941 and 1942
respectively in north China's Hebei Province. Each of the
massacres by Japanese invaders resulted in the deaths of over 1,
000 villagers in Panjiayu Village of Fengrun County and Panjiadai
Village of Luannan County.
</P>
<P>
Chen started his study about the "no man's zone" in 1962. He
has visited archives and libraries in most parts of China. Chen
finished his first paper on the "no man's zone," which few people
know about, after he became irritated about the distortion of
history being recorded in Japanese textbooks in 1982.
</P>
<P>
He has spent four years visiting 26 counties in the former "no
man's zone" after retirement in 1984. He has drawn China's first
map on the depopulated zones along the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Chen warned that a small group of people in Japan have never
given up their attempt to rewrite the history and embellish the
aggression. Only when more people come to realize the danger of
Japanese militarism, can people cherish more the hard-won peace.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Market Keeps Upward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer market
maintained its upward momentum for the first half of the year by
seeing higher growth in retail sales in July than the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
According to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)
released today, retail sales nationwide totaled 259.69 billion
yuan in July, up 9.1 percent on a year-on-year basis. The growth
rate was 0.2 percentage points higher than that in June and 3.5
percentage points higher than that a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, the NBS pointed out, the gap between the consumer
market in urban and rural areas remained big. July's retail sales
in cities soared 10.1 percent on an annual basis, while that in
rural areas grew by only 7.5 percent. In terms growth rate, the
rural market lagged behind the urban market by 2.6 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
But competition for market shares are intensifying.
</P>
<P>
According to the NBS, prices for telecommunication products,
cars and color TV sets have been repeatedly reduced over the past
few months, prompting faster growth of sales volume.
</P>
<P>
In July, prices of color TV sets saw an all-round decline, with
the prices of Chinese-made 29-inch color TVs falling below 2,000
yuan (240 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Increasing sales of seasonal commodities and promotional
campaigns by retail companies also helped invigorate the consumer
market, the bureau said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have for the
first time confiscated certain volumes of "Special Websites," a
book specializing in listing erotic websites, the Ministry of
Public Security disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The 191-page book contains more than 400 erotic websites in 24

BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of ancient
literature from the Dunhuang rock cave will open to the public
tomorrow at China's National Library in Beijing to mark the 100th
anniversary of the cave's discovery.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 pieces of Buddhist scriptures and historical documents

of the Dunhuang literature, the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last until the end of the year, according

</P>
<P>
"This exhibition is the largest of its kind in China," said an
official from the library. "Many of the scriptures and documents
will be on display for the first time."

<P>
About 100 years ago, a Taoist priest accidentally came across
the sealed chamber full of Buddhist scriptures and treasures in
the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes in the northwest province of Gansu.
</P>

foreign adventurers, which stunned the world in the early 1900s.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will attend the upcoming United Nations millennium summit in
New York next month, officials in Barak's office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, scheduled for September 6-8 in the U.N. headquarters
in New York, will be attended world leaders, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They did not rule out the possibility that the three leaders
will hold another three-way summit there to resolve core issues
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the three held a 15-day summit at Camp David in the
United States, but failed to reach any agreement due to significant
differences over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the idea of holding another summit to wrap up a deal
has been repeatedly raised. Arafat, who is visiting Vietnam on
Tuesday, said in Hanoi that he did not rule out renewed Middle East
summit talks next month.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin
told Israel Radio Tuesday that Israel and the Palestinians are very
close to reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The dovish minister, who is currently touring the United States
to drum up Washington's support for Israel's stands in the peace
talks, implied in the radio interview that the two sides had made
progress on the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Beilin added that a final accord could be negotiated by U.S.
Mideast special envoy Dennis Ross, who is dye to return to the
region on Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Defense Force (
ADF) would work with aid agencies and business in military
hotspots under a proposal put forward by defense chief Admiral
Chris Barrie on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barrie used a conference on the issue of food and water
security to flesh out an idea of recognizing the changing nature
of military operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the days of the army going in, enforcing the peace and
then departing are over.
</P>
<P>
He said the growing number of peacekeeping missions such as
those in East Timor and Bougainville showed that a more
sophisticated approach was required and this included nation
rebuilding actions.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as our appreciation for the new framework for
security grows, governments will be more inclined to explore the
possibilities of creating a closer relationship and mission
between defense forces, aid organizations and development agencies,
" Barrie told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Under his idea, the ad hoc relationship between defense forces
and aid agencies would be formalized.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats welcomed Barrie's comments and the
party's defense and foreign affairs spokeswoman said it was time
the ADF looked at its role as one different from soldiers fighting
conventional battles.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew described his two-hour meeting Tuesday with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as "positive."
</P>
<P>
"Well, I spent nearly two hours, originally supposed to be one
hour. (If we were not) talking in a positive way, we would not
have gone for so long," he told reporters after the meeting at the
Prime Minister's Office in Putrajaya near here.
</P>
<P>
Asked to describe the state of bilateral relations between the
two countries following their talks, Lee said both countries were
interested in solving outstanding problems and issues between them.
</P>
<P>
"I think both sides wanted to get on with it, meaning let's try
to get over whatever difficulties there are," he said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the two closest neighbors do have
difficulties in their relations, he said, "There are difficulties,
let's sort them out." But he did not mention the issues and
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe take a few months, but let's get on with it. There are
many other things we have to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between Malaysia and Singapore were strained in
recent years due to problems such as the location of the Malaysian
Customs, Immigration and Quarantine complex in Singapore and
negotiations for a new agreement on water supply by Malaysia to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Lee also met Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi in Putrajaya.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived here Monday by road via Johor Baharu Causeway
linking the two neighbors for a four-day working visit, his first
trip to Malaysia after handing over the premiership to Goh Chok
Tong a decade ago.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that an evacuation of the crew of the
stranded Kursk submarine has started in the Barents Sea as weather
improves.
</P>
<P>
The storm in the area of the accident has quieted down, which
makes it possible to carry out the rescue operation, the Interfax
news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" went down to the bottom of the
Barents Sea on Sunday while attending a routing exercise of the
Russian Northern Fleet. It is not clear whether there are any
casualties among more than 100 servicemen aboard the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still unknown and all versions
are being checked, Sergeyev said. He listed collision with a
different object or an explosion in the first compartment of the
submarine as among the most probable scenarios.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were two U.S. submarines nearby at
the time of the accident and they reported the sound of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days and carries a 107-man crew, including 52 officers,
Interfax reported earlier.

Egyptian pounds (51 U.S dollars) from 185 pounds (52.8 dollars)
late last year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Sayed, head of the Suez Cement Company, said the
downturn was attributed to the efforts made by the government to
ensure a stable cement market.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to produce 26 million tons of cement this
year, up 2 million tons from 1999.
</P>
<P>

countries and U.S. would be cut by 25 percent as of September 1.

<P>
Fees on access to the Internet via Egypt Telecom international
lines would be cut 30 percent, the second reduction since December
1999's 50 percent slash, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fees on access to the Internet via ordinary phone sets would

</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Due to increasing dominance of synthetic fabrics in
fashion, Turkey's traditional mohair exports fell from 599 tons in
1991 to 17 tons last year, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The average price of export mohair dropped from 6 U.S. dollars
to 2.3 dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Although mohair is a product of Angora goats, which existed
exclusively in Turkey until the 1850s, now the major producers are
the United States and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, world production is also falling in parallel with the
Turkish trend. Total mohair production fell from 26,200 tons in
1988 to only 7,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Gold 2001 International Ornament and Jewelry Fair,
which is scheduled to take place in Istanbul on January 14-20,
2001, will be initially introduced to an audience at the New York

Istanbul fair.
</P>
<P>
The Gold 2001 fair will address representatives from the U.S.
jewelry sector, as well as those from North Africa, Gulf and
European countries.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Boosts Investment in Electronic Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's investment in
electronic products and electrical appliances reached 38.4 billion
baht(960 million U.S. dollars ) in the first half of this year,
tripling the figure of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment (BOI) said in an official report here
Tuesday that the amount is "the actual investment that has been
put into the construction of facilities and production lines that
are now running."
</P>
<P>
For the second half of the year, the BOI expects that the
booming investments in electronics will draw new investors.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electronic goods have powered Thailand's return to
economic growth after the infamous baht devaluation in July 1997
plunged the country into the worst recession in several decades.
</P>
<P>
The recent slide in the baht, the Thai currency, which lost 3.5
percent of its value in the April-to-June period, has given
exports an extra boost by making Thai goods, including electronic
products, cheaper in dollar terms.

<HEADLINE> Compulsory Primary Education to Be Introduced in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
accepted a recommendation that compulsory primary education should
be introduced up to Primary Six in the city state to meet future
challenges and bring up useful and responsible citizens, according
to a government release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was made by the Committee on Compulsory
Education, chaired by Senior Minister of State for Education Aline
Wong and set up in December 1999 to study the matter concerning
the proposed compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted in July 2000, the committee recommended
that compulsory education be introduced up to Primary Six in
national schools for Singapore citizens residing in Singapore,
subject to the exemption of certain categories of children,
including those with special needs and children attending
madrasahs (religious schools).
</P>
<P>
In his letter to confirm the government's acceptance of the
recommendations, Singapore Minister for Education and Second
Minister for National Defense Teo Chee Hean said these
recommendations "accommodate the aspirations and views of the
different communities in Singapore, reaffirm the important role
that our educational system plays in preparing our young to meet
future challenges and to grow up to be useful and responsible
citizens."
</P>
<P>
Under the recommendations, children attending the six madrasahs
which currently offer full-time religious education for children
and the San Yu Adventist School and those receiving home-schooling
should be exempted from compulsory education.

<HEADLINE> Death toll of Nigerian New Pipeline Fire Rises to 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the appalling
pipeline fire last Friday near Kalabar, a town of Nigeria' s
southeast Cross River State, has increased to 18.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian newspapers Tuesday quoted officials of the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on the site as saying on
Monday that not less than 2,000 people including women and
children had thronged the area to scoop fuel on Friday night
before the incident.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tragedy however, they still littered the area on
Monday bailing fuel in jerricans which NNPC officials and
villagers were busy trying to flush out water from the dug
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The few policemen deployed to the site could not effectively
push back the villagers still desperate to scoop fuel.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers quoted a woman involved in the scooping as
saying that one man who had warned the people to steer clear of
the area to no avail, struck a match in annoyance which resulted
in the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Last month, two major pipeline fires took place in Warri,
capital of the country's southern Delta state, killing a combined
victim population of about 250.
</P>
<P>
Pipeline vandalism or "scooping", propelled by deeply rooted
poverty, is commonplace in the west African nation' s oil rich
Niger delta region, despite the huge risks involved. Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo had accused black market vendors of
acting selfishly and encouraging the pipeline vandalism.

<HEADLINE> Evacuation May Start Soon for Sunken Russian Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday that evacuation of the over 100 crew
from a sunken nuclear submarine would start shortly if the storm
in the Barents Sea calms down.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, who leads a government commission probing the
incident, said a storm measuring five points continues to rage in
area of the accident but there are forecasts that it may slacken
in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
The multipurpose "Kursk" submarine went down to the bottom of
the Barents Sea on Sunday during an exercise of the Russian
Northern Fleet. Authorities said explosion or collision with a
foreign submarine could have caused the accident.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were two U.S. submarines nearby at
the time of the accident and they reported the sound of an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said if weather improves, the military will "most
resolutely begin the evacuation," the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said all the necessary means to do so have been concentrated
in the accident area, but there is no contact with the submarine
now due to the strong storm.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers and the submarine crew had maintained what was
described as "acoustic contact" before by sending sound signals
and deciphering the messages.
</P>
<P>
However, Klebanov said, the absence of communication does not
mean that reserve air regeneration systems are not functioning.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not, there is little oxygen left aboard," he said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov admitted that "the situation is grave," but Moscow
does not want to request assistance from other countries in
dealing with the consequences of the accident or evacuating the
crew.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France and Britain had offered assistance,
Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We have all the necessary technical capabilities that are no
worse than American," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days and carries a 107-man crew, including 52 officers,
Interfax reported earlier.

Another IF, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB), has
delayed negotiations so long as to risk the implementation of a
viable out-of-competition testing program in its sport before the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
So far, 25 of the 28 IFs have joined WADA's unannounced, out-of-
competition testing program, WADA said. 14 of these IFs have to
amend their doping control policies to allow for WADA testing.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with these agreements, WADA either has conducted
or soon will conduct 1,930 doping control tests, bringing the
agency 90 percent of the way toward reaching its goal of
conducting 2,150 tests before the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
The implementation of the other 10 percent of the tests relies on
the willingness of the three IFs that have yet to agree to submit
to the independent doping control program.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.N. Official Says Visit to Iraq Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Benon Sevan, the executive
director of the United Nations oil-for-food program, said here
Tuesday that he is very happy with his current visit to Iraq and
has held "fruitful and cordial" talks with Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Sevan was speaking at a press conference held at the Canal Hotel
in the eastern part of the Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"I have very fruitful and cordial discussions with almost all
the ministers as well as the vice president of Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his two-week visit, he also visited the three northern
provinces of Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaimaniya.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the oil-for-food program, Sevan said that the
program is never meant to solve all the problems of the Iraqi
people. What he and his colleagues have been trying is to see "how
we can improve further the implementation of the program."
</P>
<P>
The program can never be a substitute for the normal economic
activity of Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his trip to Iraq, Sevan released a statement, declaring
that the U.N. humanitarian program is no substitute for the
resumption of normal economic activity in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "There is no doubt that the situation for many
in that country is significantly better than it was when the first
oil was exported under the program at the end of 1996."
</P>
<P>
Sevan is due to leave the country on Wednesday. He last visited
Iraq in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old oil-for-food program is an exemption to the
crippling U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell oil in return for food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the impacts of the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Erupts Anew over Religious Grave on Blue Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIEURT, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army engineering units
have crossed into south Lebanon and "annexed" a disputed grave
claimed by Muslims and Jews on the common border.
</P>
<P>
Several local papers called the Israeli action the gravest
border violation since the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping troops
in the Israeli-vacated zone of south Lebanon last week.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese liaison office with the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) lodged a complaint with the UNIFIL command Monday,
demanding an urgent intervention to get the Israelis out of the
Sheikh Abbad grave site right on the U.N.-drawn Blue Line for
Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, As Safir newspaper reported that a U.N. officer said
Hezbollah guerrillas prevented a UNIFIL patrol from reaching the
disputed site to verify the encroachment.
</P>
<P>
"We went to the site but Hezbollah would not allow us near it,"
the unnamed U.N. officer said in an interview by An Nahar
newspaper. "We tried several times but they would not let us in."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese government or
Hezbollah's press center on the reported U.N. claim.
</P>
<P>
The disputed grave is located in the central sector of the
border on Tall Abbad, or Abbad's Hill. The Israelis claim that
Rabbi Ashi, a renowned Jewish theologian who lived 500 years ago,
is buried in that grave. Muslims contend the tomb belonged to an
Islamic cleric called Sheikh Abdullah Abbad, whose name was given
to the site for the last five centuries.
</P>
<P>
When the U.N. drew the Blue Line with which it measured the
authenticity of the Israeli withdrawal two months ago, two thirds
of the grave fell inside Lebanese territory and one third remained
in Israel. Lebanon and Israel had given the U.N. their agreement to
the split.
</P>
<P>
But local residents Monday saw Israeli troops with bulldozers
crossing into Abbad's Hill, removing the Lebanese flag from the
grave and raising their own after fencing off the entire site with
barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
Beirut has given UNIFIL the green light to deploy in the
liberated zone after it was ascertained that all previous border
violations by Israel had been terminated.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was officially authorized by Lebanon to patrol the entire
length of the border with the exception of the Fatma Gate location,
where the Lebanese have been staging almost daily stone-throwing
attacks on Israeli troops and farmers on the opposite side of the
barb-wired fence.
</P>
<P>
Despite the UNIFIL deployment and the subsequent dispatch of a
task force made up of 500 Lebanese army troops and 500 policemen
into the vacated zone, Hezbollah remained in effective control of
large chunks of the liberated zone.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas have maintained their weapons and most of their
observation positions along the border, obviously with the consent
of the Lebanese government.

<HEADLINE> Manila Maintains No-Ransom Policy in Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will not deviate from its no-ransom policy in
dealing with hostages situations in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made this clear as he
stressed that no ransom money for the hostages held by the Abu
Sayyaf in Jolo was aboard a Libyan plane that arrived in Manila
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan aircraft arrived here Monday night, ready to fly
some of the foreign hostages in Jolo to Tripoli, Libya, in case
they are released by their Abu Sayyaf kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that once they are released by their captors,
the hostages will be flown to Tripoli and handed over to their
respective governments.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such 25 million U.S. dollars payment. That I can
assure you," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also shared the optimism of chief government negotiator
Robert Aventajado that the hostages would be released within this
week.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said negotiators have so far convinced the Abu Sayyaf to
accept social development projects and livelihood opportunities in
exchange for the hostages' safe release.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful there will be some breakthroughs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is holding three French journalists abducted on
July 9 while the latter were covering the hostages crisis in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began on April 23 when Abu Sayyaf gunmen kidnapped
21 mostly foreign tourists and resort workers from the Malaysian
resort of Sipadan and brought them to Jolo.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has released seven Sipadan hostages and three
reporters covering the hostages crisis after it was reportedly
paid up to 247.5 million pesos (6.2 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Russia Demands Immediate End to Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday reiterated its
demand that the U.S. and British air forces immediately stop
bombing Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "considers these actions illegal from the point of view
of international law," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement. "It (the bombing) must be stopped immediately."
</P>
<P>
The recent air raids caused casualties among the civilian
population, and homes, food storehouses and centers for
distributing humanitarian goods were destroyed, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of the Iraqi territory only increases tension in
the region."
</P>
<P>
"This is taking place at the exact moment the international
community is becoming convinced of the necessity to settle the
Iraqi problem through political and diplomatic means."
</P>
<P>
According to an Iraqi military spokesman, two Iraqis were
killed and 19 others injured in the U.S.-British air strikes
Saturday afternoon, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes followed Friday's air raids that killed one and
injured 20 others.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been patrolling the two so-
called "no-fly zones" in the north and south of Iraq to protect
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from what they
called the persecution of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
The zones have witnessed almost daily skirmishes since the
allies' air war on Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the zones, which were established
after the 1991 Gulf War but are not directly covered by a United
Nations resolution.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says the bombings have killed 300 innocent people, injured
1,000 others and inflicted huge property damage.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Demand Third Party Probe into EgyptAir Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian pilots have demanded the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hand over the
probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it
fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Pilots Association wanted U.S. authorities to
provide radar images for the investigations and NTSB to question an
air traffic controller on duty at the time of the crash, Walid
Murad, head of the association, told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic shortly after
takeoff October 31 from New York airport, killing 217 people on
board. After over nine months of investigations, NTSB issued a
factual report last Friday.
</P>
<P>
While NTSB said "there are no unresolved safety issues,"
Egyptians have accused the U.S. of denying their access to the
radar images on the pretext that they contained military secrets.
</P>
<P>
Murad further demanded that Egypt receive the plane's wreck and
the two black boxes, recording flight and voice data, for re-
examination, the pro-government newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
If the Egyptian demands are rejected, the investigation
documents should be withdrawn from NTSB and given to a third party
to reopen the inquiry, he said.

</P>
<P>
The minister said Wahid could do so many things during his trip
to Iraq, including extending humanitarian help.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not state when the president would make the
trip.
</P>
<P>
Wahid announced that he will visit Iraq in October after
meeting with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez here Saturday. If he
proceeds with the visit, he will be the second head of state after
Chavez to visit Iraq since the 1990 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Wahid's plan, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said such a trip would be inappropriate and ill-advised.
She urged the Indonesian leader to heed Washington's advice.
</P>
<P>
Shihab expressed his belief that the U.S. government would not
"isolate" Jakarta if Wahid does go to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia wants to see the trade embargo, imposed on Iraq by
the United Nations after the Gulf war, lifted very soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we also call on Iraq to meet the United Nations'
conditions," Shihab added.

<HEADLINE> Drought Drives Farmers into Kenyan National Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Over 6,000 farmers have invaded
parts of the Kenyan national reserve Mount Kenya Forest due to the
severe drought, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They have cultivated an estimated 10,000 acres of land, deep in
the forest, threatening massive environmental degradation in a
region that is also a leading water catchment area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Mount Kenya Forest, in central Kenya and covering 715 square
kilometers, has been listed as a natural treasure by the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The farmers have put up makeshift shelters in the forest, with
which they guard their farms from wildlife attacks.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged severe drought in east Africa has dried up crops
and pastures, forcing some farmers and nomads to invade Kenya's
national parks for survival.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 3 million people are at risk of starvation in
this east African country with a population of 28.9 million.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets aside Funds for Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set
aside 20 billion shillings (about 267 million U.S. dollars) this
year for the poverty eradication program, Chairman Gilbert Oluoch
of the National Poverty Eradication Commission has announced.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted Oluoch as
saying "the money has been released to benefit all less fortunate
people and will serve all of the country."
</P>
<P>
Oluoch made the remarks Monday when he was speaking at a
district development committee meeting in Mombasa, a port city in
southeastern Kenya, where stake holders discussed the review of
projects focusing on rural development.
</P>
<P>
He said attention will be given to medical, sanitation, water
and other basic needs that are part of the program, which will run
from year 2000 to 2015.
</P>
<P>
The funds for the poverty eradication program had already been
passed in this year's budget, Oluoch said, urging the commission,
nongovernmental organizations and private sector to strategize on
how the money will benefit the affected people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the poverty eradication program in Mombasa can
only succeed if the district is free of the drug menace and called
upon all the stake holders to join hands in forming community-
based projects and rehabilitation centers to help fight drug
abuse in the city and Coast Province as a whole.

<HEADLINE> College Enrollment Expansion Causes Mixed Feelings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities and
colleges planed to enroll a total of 2.04 million students this
year, up 24.4 percent from last year's, which has caused mixed
feelings among some Beijing-based schools.
</P>
<P>
In the past two or three years, Chinese universities and
colleges kept expanding their enrollment, partly decided by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University of Science and Engineering (BUSE) plans to
enroll 3,100 students, up 25 percent over last year. The most
tough issue it facing now is inadequate infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the university built a new apartment
building and rebuilt its dinner hall. However, excessive
construction pressed a lot on the campus environment.
</P>
<P>
"We solved the problem eventually this year, how about next
year?" said the dean with BUSE.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for those infrastructure-guaranteed universities,
increased enrollment sticks out the problem of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Since the enrollment expansion last year, teachers of computer
science, foreign languages and some newly-established majors in
BUST have been inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Facing the conflict between increased students and deficient
facilities, some universities had to give its added quota to the
local students who are day-boarders.
</P>
<P>
This practice inevitably led to downslide of enrollment quality,
according to some educational experts.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious People's University of China (PUC) recruited
200 local students last year to release dormitory shortage
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jianming, vice secretary of the school's CPC committee,
was regretful at the decision. "We had to lower the enrollment
score line to take in these students, and this decreased the
student quality."
</P>
<P>
The university will never repeat the practice which depressed
its own prestige just for sake of enrollment expansion, Zhang
added.
</P>
<P>
He also called for policy support from the local government or
education department.
</P>
<P>
"After all, capability of the university is limited," the
newspaper quoted Zhang as saying.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Auto Giant Set to Meet State Pollution Control Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- China First Automobile Group
Corp, one of the country's three major auto manufacturers, has
invested nearly 100 million yuan (12 million U.S. dollars) in air
and water pollution control projects over the past year.
</P>
<P>
 Song Xuezhi, director of the Security and Environmental
Protection Department of the company, said the investment, a sum
rarely seen before, aims to enable the auto giant to meet the
pollutant discharge standards set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
 The central government vowed four years ago to close down all
the polluting industrial firms that fail to meet industrial
pollution discharge standards by the end of this year to curb
growing industrial pollution following 18 years of high economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
 Located in Changchun, capital of northeastern China's Jilin
Province, the company has recently allocated 76 million yuan (9.1
million U.S. dollars) for centralized disposal of the sewage of a
disposal plant being built in western suburb of the city.
</P>
<P>
The company also earmarked 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S.
dollars) last year for air pollution control projects.
</P>
<P>
Song said he is confident that his company will meet the State
standards by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The company, with 150,000 workers, reported a sale volume of
30 billion yuan (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) last year and the waste
water it produced each day topped 74,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Only 65% Spectacles Found Up to Standards: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Only 65.7 percent of the
spectacles were found up to standards by the State Bureau of
Technological Supervision in its latest nationwide sample survey.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of the survey conducted in the second
quarter of this year, only 94 of 143 pairs of spectacles selected
from 143 spectacles shops across the country passed the tests.
</P>
<P>
But 94 percent spectacles selected from large shops, or shops
whose annual sale volumes exceeding 5 million yuan (602,000 U.S.
dollars) were up to standard, while only 31.8 percent of those
selected from shops whose annual sale volumes less than 500,000
yuan (60,200 U.S. dollars) were up to standard.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said large spectacle shops are found to be equipped
with advanced equipment to ensure the quality of spectacles.
</P>
<P>
An outstanding problem with substandard spectacles produced by
small shops is that the shops were found to use spectacles with
less accurate diopters to substitute the prescribed ones which
they run short of, resulting in less satisfactory rectification of
eye sights.

</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper Monday reported that President
Mubarak has warned against any concessions in Jerusalem which would

himself will not dare sign an agreement implying abandoning
sanctities," said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian pilots said Monday that the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board should turn its inquiry into the 1999
EgyptAir aircraft crash over to a third party unless it releases

<HEADLINE> Four Kenyan Policemen Nabbed over Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Four Kenyan policemen in the
capital Nairobi have been arrested on charges of robbery and
extortion, bringing the number of police officers apprehended in
the past week to 10, the major newspaper Daily Nation reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest batch of four constables arrested were from one
police station and were behind an extortion racket targeting
traders and suspected criminals, police disclosed.
</P>
<P>
They include a sergeant and a corporal who were involved in the
fatal shooting of a policeman and the robbery of 12 million
shillings (about 160,000 U.S. dollars) from Kenya Railways on July
31.
</P>
<P>
The racket was exposed last Saturday when they arrested the
owner of a garage and demanded 8,000 shillings from him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nairobi Provincial Police Officer Geoffrey Muathe
said on Tuesday that a total of 12 suspects were being held over
the daylight robbery at Kenya Railways, in which the gang armed
with AK-47 assault rifles and sub-machine guns, ambushed a van
carrying salaries guarded by three railway security personnel,
killing a policeman nearby.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the Kenyan government is making efforts
to crack down on flagrant crimes perpetrated by policemen in order
to restore confidence of its people on police and create a
conducive environment for foreign investors.

TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher in
Tokyo for the third straight trading day Tuesday, led mainly by
export-oriented high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 144.38 points, or 0.89
percent, from Monday's close to end at 16,298.29.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 6.88 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,
500.31.
</P>
<P>
Trading, however, remained thinning amid the summer holiday

shares, slightly up from Monday's 450.10 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Furukawa Electric was the day's volume leader.

Semiconductor-related issues were boosted by gains of their U.S.

<HEADLINE> Nine Japanese Cabinet Members Visit Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nine Japanese cabinet members
Tuesday visited the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to pay
respects to Japan's war dead on the 55th anniversary of the
country's surrender in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The nine ministers included Justice Minister Okiharu Yasuoka,
Education Minister Tadamori Oshima, International Trade and
Industry Minister Takeo Hiranuma and Defense Agency chief Kazuo
Torashima.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's visits bring to ten the total of cabinet ministers
who paid respects at the shrine this year, up from last year's
nine. Home Affairs Minister Mamoru Nishida visited the shrine last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hidenao Nakagawa have said they will not visit Yasukuni
after "taking all circumstances into consideration."
</P>
<P>
Japanese cabinet members' visits to the shrine, a bastion of
the wartime military government-sponsored Shintoism and symbol of
militarism in Japan before and during World War II, often draw
condemnation from Japan's Asian neighbors, which suffered
atrocities of the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The shrine houses the memorial tablets of 14 class-A war
criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, and some
2.4 million Japanese military personnel and officials who died
since 1853 in Japan's various wars.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers' visits to the shrine are also controversial
as Japan's postwar Constitution stipulates separation of religion
and the state.
</P>
<P>
In a rare development, Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara also
visited the shrine Tuesday despite criticism from several local
civic groups, becoming the first Tokyo governor to make an
official visit since the Tokyo metropolitan government starting
recording such visits in 1967.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Agriculture Bank of China (
ABC), one of China's four State-owned commercial banks, said today
its individual consumption loans have risen by a big margin during
the January-June period this year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with ABC said the bank's individual housing loans
has increased 8.1 billion yuan this year to hit 23.4 billion yuan
by June, an annual increase of 74.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Automobile consumption loans amounted to 1.5 billion yuan by
the end of June, taking the second largest share among the four
State-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Other individual consumption loans, such as education loans,
loans to purchase agricultural equipment, tourism loans, durable
goods consumption loans, all witnessed a hefty increase as well.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that ABC's housing loans had maintained a
steady and healthy development over the past six months due to
efforts paid on the quality of loans. ABC also expanded its
businesses by providing clients with new housing services, he said.
</P>
<P>
To minimize risks, ABC has been keeping a strict eye on the
qualification of auto distributors and purchasers, with the surety
gained via interim agencies and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the newly added individual consumption loans
accounted for some 10 percent of ABC's all new loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- If Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
ignores advice he is hearing in various capitals and unilaterally
declares a state on September 13, the European Union is likely not
to recognize the state, a Western diplomat said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite declarations by various Palestinian officials that no
decision will be made until the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's Central Council, the top policy-making body, meets
on the matter during the first week of September, the diplomat said
the EU's assessment is that Arafat will not declare a state then,
but will make do with some other symbolic act of sovereignty or
statehood, such as issuing formal Palestinian passports.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shochat signed an order on
Monday reducing the purchase tax on 630 consumer goods as well as
on manufacturing costs, totalling 1.3 billion shekels (about 325
million U.S. dollars) per year. The 65 percent purchase tax on
vehicles has not been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Shochat said that he hoped that dealers, wholesalers and
retailers would pass on the tax benefits to consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tax reduction was a progressive move that would
minimize inequality in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is expected to meet Tuesday
evening with left-wing Meretz leader Yossi Sarid to discuss
conditions for Meretz's return to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Meretz activists predicted that the party will return to its
former place in the government in the very near future, provided
that its demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Vatican disagrees with the Palestinian's belief that they
are the keepers of Jerusalem's holy sites, Vatican Foreign Minister
Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran Monday told Israeli acting Foreign
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gilad Sher, Ben-Ami's partner to the peace talks with
the Palestinians and a member of the Israeli team at last month's
Camp David summit, was very optimistic on Monday about the chances
of finalizing a peace deal with the Palestinians within a short
time.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Sees Lower Perinatal Mortality Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Recent perinatal mortality
rates in New Zealand are the lowest ever recorded, according to
the latest information from the New Zealand Health Information
Service.
</P>
<P>
The service Tuesday released fetal and infant deaths numbers in
1997 which show that in that year for every 1,000 births there
were 10.2 perinatal deaths(stillbirths after 20 weeks of pregnancy
and deaths of babies in the first week of life). Provisional data
for 1998 and 1999 show rates of 8.1 and 9 per 1,000 total births,
the lowest ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
John Marwick, a senior advisor with the New Zealand Ministry of
Health, said in a ministry's press release that figures vary a
little from year to year, "but the general trend has been
improving.The 1998 figure looks to be one of the lowest rates in
the world ahead of Australia, the UK, Canada and the U.S."
</P>
<P>
He also said the number of women dying during pregnancy or
after delivery was very low. "Maternal mortality data takes longer
to determine but trends also seem to be improving with the number
of maternal deaths dropping from four in 1996 to only two deaths
registered in 1997."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Envoy to Return to Fiji, But Sanctions Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's high
commissioner is returning to Fiji but the government says it has
no plans to relax sanctions at the moment, according to The
Dominion.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday quoted New Zealand
Foreign Minister Phil Goff as saying High Commissioner Tia Barrett,
who was withdrawn for consultations in mid-July, will return to
Suva at the end of the week together with the Australian high
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Goff said the commissioner's return is in "recognition of the
step forward Fiji has taken by charging coup leader George Speight
and 13 of his collaborators with treason."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome that as an advance as we welcome the restoration of
law and order...in Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said
charging Speight and his supporters with treason is "a necessary
step on the long road back to restoring Fiji's international
reputation."
</P>
<P>
She said the move was "encouraging."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has also been imposing aid, development, diplomatic,
military and sporting sanctions against Fiji since Speight plunged
the country into crisis when he toppled the Fiji government headed
by Mahendra Chaudhry on May 19.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand government will not reconsider its sanctions
till it sees some firm commitment to a return to democracy, Goff
was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He held that things in Fiji have not returned to normal yet.

<HEADLINE> Police Fires Pepper Spray, Arrests 10 at Democratic Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Police Monday
fired pepper spray and other chemicals at black-clad youths who
attacked them with concrete blocks, bottles and parking signs on
the margin of a mass open air pop concert outside the National
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
In the first serious trouble after two days of largely peaceful
protests, police fired the chemicals repeatedly at some 40
anarchists trying to scale a 13-foot high security fence while 8,
000 other people danced and sang to the punk rock band Rage
Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics said several dozen people were treated for the
effects of pepper spray and other chemicals. The incidents took
place as President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary addressed
the convention inside.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, about 2,500 demonstrators protesting what
they termed Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore's stock
holdings in Occidental Petroleum were escorted by police on
bicycles as they staged a noisy and colorful march from the
downtown area to the heavily fortified Staples Center where
Democrats are gathering.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company has come under fire from
environmentalists for its plans to drill for oil on land claimed
by the U'wa Indian tribe in northeastern Colombia. Protesters
claim Gore has family shares in Occidental valued at up to one
million dollars, but the Gore camp Monday said the vice president
is only executor for the estate of his father, who had owned the
stock.
</P>
<P>
As the marchers and their giant satirical puppets dispersed and
protesters gathered for the second big demonstration of the day,
some 200 police in riot gear swooped to disperse a sit-in by 15
people linking hands across a key intersection.
</P>
<P>
In the first violent incident of a week expected to be thick
with protests, several people were hit by batons and police said
they made 10 arrests on charges of failing to disperse.
</P>
<P>
Three bomb scares were reported at the Los Angeles Police
headquarters, at a building a block from the Staples Center, and
on the coast at Venice beach. Nothing was found.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Efforts Continue for Russian Sub, Crew Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military continued
their efforts Tuesday to rescue a nuclear submarine sunken at the
bottom of the Barents Sea since Sunday, but little results have
been achieved so far, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The crewmen of the multipurpose "Kursk" are still alive, but
the situation at the site of the accident was worsening amid high
seas and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
"Rescue ships have been swept off anchor," the Itar-Tass news
agency quoted Navy Commander Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov as saying.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 sailors aboard the Kursk will be evacuated,
said Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads the government
commission probing the causes of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov said the sub's special locks and the underwater rescue
apparatus should allow the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that "the situation is grave," but Moscow does not
want to request assistance from other countries in dealing with
the consequences of the accident or evacuating the crew.
</P>
<P>
The United States, France and Britain had offered assistance,
Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
"We have all the necessary technical capabilities that are no
worse than American," he said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have not yet established the causes of the
accident, which occurred Sunday when the Kursk was participating
in a routine exercise of the Russian Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Fleet spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky said high winds had
prevented two underwater rescue apparatus from docking with the
emergency hatch of the sub and guaranteeing electricity supplies
and the functioning of life-support systems on Kursk.
</P>
<P>
However, acoustic communications continue with the crew with
both sides sending sound signals and deciphering the messages, the
Interfax news agency quoted Navrotsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the crew members are alive because there is oxygen and
food aboard, but that he could not rule out the possibility of
casualties among the sailors.
</P>
<P>
The "Kursk" was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995. It
has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of
up to 500 meters. The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "
Granite" cruise missiles. The vessel can operate autonomously for
up to 120 days and carries a 107-man crew, including 52 officers,
Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Stars Shine at Du Maurier Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- As many as 18 top singles players
in the world have committed to playing in Montreal for the 1.08
million U.S. dollars du Maurier Open women's tennis tournament,
which began Monday till Sunday, according to Canadian media.
</P>
<P>
Among the super stars shining on the list are four players
whose names have been engraved on the du Maurier Open champion's
hardware, including four-time champion Monica Seles, two-time
champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 1991 winner Jennifer Capriati
and reigning champion Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
From a ranking point of view, the top rivalry is between No.1
Martina Hingis of Switzerland and No.2 Lindsay Davenport of the
United States. Hingis and Davenport gained their top positions on
the Sanex WTA Tour heading into the North American hardcourt
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Both, however, are likely to face a series of stiff challenges
in pursuit of the title.
</P>
<P>
Another player in the limelight is the 18-year-old American
rising star, Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
Both Serena and her sister Venus, 20, reached the semi-finals
of the U.S. open and that marked the first time sisters had
advanced that far in a Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
The William sisters repeated that feat this year at Wimbledon.
Venus, who missed the Canadian Open, beat Serena in the semis and
then Lindsay Davenport in the final.
</P>
<P>
The Wimbledon champion is reported to be absent from this year'
s du Maurier Open because younger sister Serena is entered.
</P>
<P>
When Serena was asked what fans could expect from her when she
made her first appearance in the du Maurier Canadian Open, she
replied, "Expect for me to be holding the winner's trophy."
</P>
<P>
More than 110,000 tickets had already been purchased before the
player list was released in the spring of 2000. A new high is
expected after Canadian tennis fans established a world-record
attendance of over 151,000 two years ago in Montreal for a single-
week, women's-only tournament.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Rates Sydney Olympic Organisers "Bronze" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace Tuesday given Sydney
Olympic organisers six out of ten for their environmental
practices - one point less than last year.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Olympics campaigner Blair Palese said while there
had been outstanding environmental successes, the failures were
disappointing and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Greenpeace gave the Games a "bronze" for its
environmental performance.
</P>
<P>
Palese said key failures included the fact there was no clean-
up plan for the toxic waste in Homebush Bay and Rhodes Peninsula
and the use of non-environmentally friendly air-conditioning and
refrigeration in venues.
</P>
<P>
Palese said the confusion over which body will manage the toxic
waste at the site after the Games and the failure to keep
environmental records were also failures.
</P>
<P>
Streets ice-creams had also failed to comply with the waste
strategy by using plastic wrappers.
</P>
<P>
Palese said the bronze medal, or C grade, performance, meant
that organisers had just crossed the line in making the Sydney
Olympics the "Green Games."
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace was part of Sydney's Olympic bid, the first to
include environmental guidelines, and has been assessing
preparations ever since.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions to environmental problems do exist," Palese said.
</P>
<P>
"The Sydney Olympics could have been a world class showcase for
these solutions, instead they just managed to scrape in under the
title, Green Games."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The weather in Sydney will be "
drier than average" during the Olympic Games, a weather forecaster
predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney's Meteorology Bureau meteorologist Robert Fawcett said
September was typically the driest month of the year.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage we have nothing to suggest September will be
wetter or drier but looking historically September is drier than
average over the year," Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
"If we include October and November in the equation, within our
usual three-monthly forecasts, the chance of rainfall increases to
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"However, this (forecast) is only for statistical purposes," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Judgment on Anwar's Defamation Suit Against Mahathir Reserved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Court of Appeal
Tuesday reserved judgment on former deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim's appeal against a High Court decision striking out his
defamation suit against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
A three-member panel led by Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim
decided to reserve judgment after hearing submissions from Anwar's
lawyer Karpal Singh, and Mohamed Adnan Shuaib for Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
The court said it would inform the parties of the date for the
decision and that the court would give a written judgment.
</P>
<P>
Anwar's 100 million ringgit (26.31 million U.S. dollar)
defamation suit filed on January 25 last year was struck out on
August 30 last year by High Court Judge R.K. Nathan on grounds
that it was frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of
the court.
</P>
<P>
Anwar claimed in the suit that Mahathir had falsely and
maliciously spoken to local and foreign reporters at a news
conference at the Prime Minister's Department accusing him of
committing immoral act.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir contended in his statement of defence filed on March
22 last year that he spoke the words as prime minister on an
occasion of qualified privilege.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's application to strike the suit out was allowed by
the High Court.

<HEADLINE> Iran Doubles Tea Imports From Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with local media on Monday, Minister of
Internal and International Commerce and Food Kingsley T.
Wickremeratne said that the two countries signed an agreement on
the tea imports at the Sri Lanka-Iran Joint Commission meeting
held at Iranian capital Teheran earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Iran imported 9,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea. The
quantity of tea to be imported this year will well exceed 20,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement Sri Lanka will give Iran a three month
credit line for tea exports and will in return receive a six-month
credit line for petroleum imports from Iran, the supplier of 60
percent of Sri Lanka's crude oil requirements.
</P>
<P>
There will also be an increase in rubber exports to Iran for
its tire industry and also spices, the Minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said that also under consideration is the establishment of a
tea blending factory in Kish Island, Iran. The factory, a joint
venture, will re-export Sri Lankan tea under the Ceylon tea label
to Russian markets.
</P>
<P>
Wikremeratne said that an Iranian team of businessmen will
visit Colombo shortly to establish joint venture industries to
manufacture carpets, chandeliers, melamine and furniture to meet
the demand in the South Asian markets using Colombo as the base.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Delivers Independence Day Address Amid Tight Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"To achieve this ambitious target we have to make many
important reforms in our economy. At the same time, we need to
implement necessary reforms in our administration, our judiciary,
in education and in other areas," said Vajpayee in a 30-minute
address to the nation marking India's 54th Independence Day here
Tuesday morning. India's per capital gross national product was
440 U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Giving his address in Hindi from the rampart of the historic
site of Red Fort, where former Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal
Nehru announced India's independence on August 15, 1947, Vajpayee
said his government would take "many big and important steps" this
year to accelerate economic and social development and bring its
benefits to the people, promising the interest of workers would be
fully taken into account in the economic reform process.
</P>
<P>
On India's relations with Pakistan, Vajpayee once again accused
Islamabad of sabotaging recent peace talks between the Indian
government and Hizbul Mujahideen, a major militant outfit in
Kashmir, and ruled out any dialogue with Pakistan till it stops "
cross-border terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should underestimate India's willingness and ability to
deal firmly with violence, terrorism, extremism and separatism,"
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
In his address, the prime minister also declared his government
's resolve to intensify its campaign against corruption among high-
ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
"Our country cannot make expected progress in development
without probity in administration and in public life," he noted. "
We shall intensify our campaign against corruption in high place."
</P>
<P>
Describing the rapidly spreading HIV/AIDS as a grave challenge
to the nation, Vajpayee said all sections of society should fully
participate in creating awareness about the disease.
</P>
<P>
"They should also make necessary changes in their behavior so
that this disease can be controlled," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also made a series of promises on behalf of
his government to the Indian people, including a road project to
connect all villages with a population of more than 1,000 in the
next three years, clean drinking water for every village and
hamlet in next four years, education upto class eight for every
Indian child and free education for women by 2010, as well as
access to computers and Internet for every school and every
village in "as less time as possible."
</P>
<P>
Stating that India needs more social justice in the new century,
Vajpayee said: "Our independence is incomplete without social
justice."
</P>
<P>
"We need that kind of social justice that also promotes social
harmony," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving at the Red Fort, Vajpayee paid floral tributes
at the mausoleum of India's founding father Mahatma Gandhi at
Rajghat. He also hoisted a tri-color national flag before giving
his address.
</P>
<P>
However, India's first Independence Day of the new millennium
was celebrated amidst unprecedented security in the wake of
threats from militant groups, especially those from Kashmir, to
intensify their attacks.
</P>
<P>
In the Indian capital, over 55,000 local police and
paramilitary personnel formed a tight security blanket which, in
the words of the quasi-official Press Trust of India, almost
turned the city into an "impregnable fortress."
</P>
<P>
While the prime minister was speaking from behind a bullet-
proof glass shield, Indian Air Force helicopters maintained vigil
from the skies and air corridors remained closed till the end of
the address.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Americans To Choose Gore for Next President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Democratic National
Convention opened here Monday with 4,300 delegates bidding an
emotional farewell to U.S. President Bill Clinton and giving an
enthusiastic welcome to his designated successor, Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Clinton suggested Gore and his running mate Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman are the obvious choice over Republican
presidential nominee Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his running
mate Dick Cheney, whom he never mentioned by name.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows Al Gore is thoughtful and hard-working," he
said. "I can tell you he's also an exceptional leader."
</P>
<P>
"Most important, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our
prosperity growing by paying down the debt, investing in education
and health care, moving people from welfare to work and providing
family tax cuts that we can afford," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who twice led his party to the White House, said in a
televised speech that the United States is "more confident,
hopeful" than eight years ago, urging Americans to trust Al Gore
as his successor to "keep this progress and prosperity going."
</P>
<P>
"Now, you know how I feel, but it's not my decision to make.
It's yours. I just want to tell you a few things I know about Al
Gore," Clinton said on the opening day of the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
"In the most difficult days of the last years, when we faced
the toughest issues -- of war and peace, of taking on powerful
special interests -- he was always there. More than anybody else
I've ever known in public life, Al Gore understands the future and
how sweeping changes can affect Americans' daily lives," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spent equal time outlining how his administration's
economic and social policies have had a real impact on the nation,
and why Gore -- after nearly eight years as his active understudy -
- was best qualified to assume the mantle of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a prime-time television address that is expected to be his
last major political address before he leaves office in five
months, Clinton also pointed out the achievements and progress he
and Gore have made in the eight years in the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are in the midst of the longest economic expansion in
our history. More than 22 million new jobs, the lowest
unemployment in 30 years, the lowest female unemployment in 40
years, the lowest Hispanic and African American unemployment on
record, the highest home ownership rate in our history. Today, we
have also gone from the largest deficits in history to the largest
surpluses in history - and if we stay on course, we can make
America debt-free for the first time since 1835."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the current Democratic administration's progress
is far more than economics. "America is more confident, hopeful
and just, more secure and free. We are more confident because of
progress in education: higher standards, more accountability, more
investment. We have doubled funding for Head Start and provided
after-school and mentoring to more than one million young people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' four-day political production was designed not
only to promote Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman, but also
to stir memories of John F. Kennedy's nomination in this city 40
years ago. Kennedy's image appeared on the video screen behind the
speaker's podium as the convention opened; his voice echoed in the
hall. His daughter, Caroline, addresses the delegates on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning him by name, Clinton fired a salvo at
Republican presidential nominee Bush, belittling the Texas
governor's claim that the Democratic White House's policies had
little to do with the U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"To those who say the progress of these eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear," he said. "
America's success was not a matter of chance; it was a matter of
choice."
</P>
<P>
Polishing a partisan image, Clinton said, "The GOP wants to
spend every dime of our projected surplus and then some - leaving
nothing to extend the life of Medicare and Social Security,
nothing for emergencies, nothing in case the projected surpluses
don't come in."
</P>
<P>
One pre-convention poll suggested Bush's lead had shrunk to
three percentage points. CNN said more Americans are concerned
with a candidate's stand on the issues than about character - a
switch from the primaries of earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile predicted that Gore would
surge into the lead in the polls during the convention and stay
there all the way to the Nov. 7 election.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Expresses Remorse For Japan's Wartime Acts in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori Tuesday expressed "deep remorse" for the cruelty perpetrated
by Japan in Asia during World War II and extended condolences to
the war victims in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"The war caused tremendous pain and sorrow not only to our
country, but also to people in many other countries, particularly
to those in neighboring countries. We would like to sincerely
express our deep regret and condolences to them," Mori said at a
ceremony marking the 55th anniversary of Japan's surrender in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, about 6,000
relatives of Japanese war dead, and about 1,000 government
officials and politicians attended the government-sponsored
ceremony in Tokyo's Nippon Budokan Hall.
</P>
<P>
Mori's speech marked the eighth straight year in which Japan's
prime ministers have expressed remorse to Asia's war victims in
their speeches at the annual event.
</P>
<P>
Mori also stressed the importance of establishing lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"We must humbly look back on the past and urge our succeeding
generations not to get involved in war, but to establish lasting
peace by informing them about the cruelty of war," Mori said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that fulfilling this responsibility is the only
way to compensate for the past and ease the pain of the victims'
souls," he added.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the ceremony offered a silent prayer at noon
for souls of 3.1 million Japanese who perished in the war.
</P>
<P>
In a brief memorial address after the prayer, Emperor Akihito
offered condolences to the war victims and voiced hope for world
peace.

LAGOS -- Visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Monday
called on oil-producing countries to resist demands to cut oil

Addressing a joint press conference in the Nigerian capital

Chavez said some powerful countries were using blackmail to force

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Launches 1st Optical Fiber Telecom Transmission Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched its first
optical fiber inter- province telecommunication transmission ring
at a cost of 1,500 million rupees (around 19.1 million U.S.
dollars), the Island newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, an optical fiber cable was laid connecting
the telephone exchanges of 15 major cities and urban centers
encompassing four provinces.
</P>
<P>
The ring circles the capital city of Colombo, Gampaha, Negombo,
Chilaw, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Matale, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Hatton,
Nawalapitiya, Avissawela, Ratnapura, Kalutara, Mt Lavinia with a
total route length of about 700 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The system is equipped with a sophisticated Network Management
Center in Colombo which can monitor the entire network and enables
it to give necessary instructions for the delivery of service in
each part of its system.
</P>
<P>
The system will increase by many folds Sri Lanka Telecom's
capacity and strengthen its backbone transmission network with a
high degree of reliability due to its self-feeding ability.
</P>
<P>
As a light signal carries the message through the cable, there
can be no interference during its travel and it will be immune to
noise. It also enhances the quality and clarity of its voice
services.

This is the second reshuffle of the government led by the
Solidarity Union in less than three months. The Freedom Union, the
second largest party in Poland's ruling coalition, withdrew from
the cabinet in early June.
</P>
<P>
Wasacz was forced to resign from within and without his party
after several major mistakes were made in the ministry, since he
assumed the office in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, Wasacz wanted to
resign in order to avoid tension within the Solidarity Election
Action Union, a partner of the ruling coalition. The treasury
ministry is in charge of the country's privatization, retirement
system reform, and gathering domestic capital.

<HEADLINE> Moldova Roots out Immigrants Trafficking Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan Ministry of the
Interior said it has destroyed a gang trafficking in illegal
immigrants; the gang reportedly has connections with high-ranking
officials, according to press reports reaching here Monday from
Chisinau, the Moldovan capital.
</P>
<P>
The gang has trafficked in more than 100 Moldovan illegal
immigrants to western countries at the charge of 1,700 U.S.
dollars per head since last December, said the Moldova news agency.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the gang bribed officials from information
and security branches of the government to obtain clearance for
their illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have found proof, such as lists of names of
possible illegal immigrants as well as fake seals and documents,
which include fake passports, from the homes of gang members, said
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Moldova news agency quoted Vladimir Turcanu, the Moldovan
Minister of the Interior, as saying that gang members could be
sentenced to 1-5 years in jail under the charge of forging
official documents and seals if they are judged guilty.
</P>
<P>
Officials involved in the trafficking activities will also be
punished, the Minister added.

<HEADLINE> 112 Dams Built in Myanmar in 12 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 15 (Xinhua) - Altogether 112 dams have been
built in Myanmar since late 1988 when the present government took
office, irrigating 607,500 hectares of farmland, official
newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dams include 25 in Bago, 19 in Magway and 29 in Mandalay
divisions.
</P>
<P>
Dams were built in the Bago division to prevent flood and water
shortage which usually occur in the western part of the division,
the main sugarcane growing region of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Magway and the Mandalay divisions, which lie in
the central arid zone, are main producers of beans and pulses,
edible oil crops and cotton.
</P>
<P>
The Bago and Magway divisions are also among Myanmar's six
divisions and states where vacant, virgin and fallow lands are
being reclaimed by private entrepreneurs to promote the country's
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 37 percent of the country's
gross domestic product and 25 percent of its export value.

<HEADLINE> Members of Separated Families Begin Reunion in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 15 (Xinhua) -- In another significant move toward
reconciliation, Seoul and Pyongyang exchanged 100 people from each
side by air Tuesday morning for a four-day reunion with family
members separated from for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The family reunions for separated family members are timed with
the 55th anniversary of liberation from the Japanese colonial rule
on August 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
An Air Koryo plane from the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), which carried 100 people, arrived at Seoul Kimpo
International Airport 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) Tuesday and will return
to Pyongyang with 100 South Koreans one hour later.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for the DPRK plane to have landed on South
Korean soil.
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, the South Korean Air will bring the 100 DPRK
people back to Pyongyang and return with South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
At the inter-Korean Red Cross meeting last month, Seoul and
Pyongyang agreed to share their aircraft in transporting the 200
people.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to discuss the opening of a permanent
meeting point for institutionalizing reunions of separated
families caused by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end
of World War II and the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of the 200 people was part of the June 15 Joint
Declaration reached between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il at their historic summit in Pyongyang,
in which both sides agreed to work toward promoting reconciliation
on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
According to an itinerary issued by the South Korean government,
the people to Seoul and Pyongyang respectively will enjoy six
family reunions with their relatives and sightseeing at specified
places.
</P>
<P>
But the people will not be allowed to visit homes of their
separated family members or ancestral graves and a maximum of five
South Koreans will be allowed to meet each visiting DPRK relative.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government Monday reportedly gave brief
instructions to the 100 South Koreans on how to behave in DPRK.
They were advised to not take any book that are critical of the
DPRK and to take less than 1,000 U.S. dollars in cash with them.
</P>
<P>
More than 75,000 South Koreans applied for this week's reunions
with their relatives in the DPRK, but the number was narrowed down
to 400 by computerized lottery, and then whittled down to 100,
giving priority to those with a direct family relationship, such
as parents, spouses and children.
</P>
<P>
Members of separated families, including the second and third
generations, total 7.67 million in South Korea, according to the
Unification Ministry.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan navy has
brought a 16 million dollars suit against the cargo ship Skyros,
which ramed into the naval mine-sweeper "Valiente," press reports
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Skyros, a cargo ship under Panamanian flag, and the Valiente
collided on August 5 off the coasts of the Rocha state, killing 11
sailors.

<P>
Rocha's justice court put into jail the captain of Skyros for
his absence in last week's trial, although he participated in
rescuing the victims.
</P>
<P>
Niver Lines, the company that built Skyros in 1977, termed as "
crazy" the 16 million dollars suit filed by the Uruguayan navy.
</P>
<P>
It was evaluating the possibility to leave the cargo ship at
the port of Montevideo, for Skyros has a value of 1.5 million
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Jenny Thompson and
Dara Torres repeated their dominance in the women's 100m butterfly
by finishing one-two anew in the finals of the 100m freestyle in
the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 27, who was still seeking her first Olympic gold
medal away from the team events, again touched home first by
setting a new American record of 54.07 seconds in the 100m
freestyle finals.
</P>
<P>
Closely chasing behind was again the 33-year-old Torres, who
ended her seven-year retirement last year, in 54.62 seconds,
beating Ashley Tappin and Amy Van Dyken to third and fourth
respectively in 55.28 and 55.30.
</P>
<P>
Being the first American swimmer for four Olympic Games, Torres
was also hoping to reap her first Olympic gold medal from the
individual events after her appearences in the 1984, 1988 and 1992
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200m individual medley, Tom Dolan also redeemed
his reputation by claiming the second straight title in 2:00.81,

WASHINGTON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- World record-holder Lenny
Krayzelburg and world champion Kristy Kowal both won their
specialities as expected at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials in
Indianapolis Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, 24, remained unchallenged in the backstroke events
by anchoring his second straight victory of 1:57.31 in the men's
200m backstroke, following his first triumph in the 100m
backstroke in 53.84 seconds days ago.
</P>
<P>
Aaron Peirsol, who topped the semifinals Sunday evening,
finished second in 1:57.98 for his first ticket towards the Sydney
Olympic Games as only the top two qualify from each event.
</P>
<P>
Krayzelburg, who holds the world records in the 50m, 100m and
200m backstrokes, becomes a sure bet for the gold medals in Sydney.
</P>

Kristy Kowal also made the Olympics by setting a new American
record in the women's 200m breaststroke in 2:24.75, followed by
Amanda Beard who also secured her first Olympic ticket in 2:26.79.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGYE (GANSU), August 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhangye, a city with a
long cultural tradition in northwest China's Gansu province, pays
special attention to protecting cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The protection of the Shanxi Gild Hall, which was built in the
early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was one of the typical examples
during the construction of the city's main avenue.
</P>
<P>
If the avenue should go straight, the Hall would be turned down.
To protect the Hall, the designers decided to let the avenue go by
the Hall, costing the city two million yuan more, but saving the
Hall from being pulled down.
</P>
<P>
"It was once a heated debate among local residents as to
whether the Hall should be demolished," recalled Wu Zhengke, an
expert of cultural relics protection in the city.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, protecting the Hall won the day."
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi Gild Hall dates back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
It was a gathering place for wealthy merchants from neighboring
Shanxi Province in the early Qing Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Hall's architectural features and carvings are
of high archeological value.
</P>
<P>
Zhangye is applying to the central authorities to designate the
Hall as a state cultural protection site.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
rejected U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's warning that
President Abdurrahman Wahid should cancel a planned visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cannot pose "a threat and intimidation" against a
sovereign country's leader who plans to visit another country,
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Sulaiman Abdulmanan
told the Indonesian Observer on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The planned trip does not contravene the principles of foreign
politics," Sulaiman said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Wahid called for the lifting of international
sanctions against Iraq and said he would visit that country at the
end of this summer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Albright said that such a
trip would be "inappropriate and ill-advised." She urged Wahid to
heed Washington's advice.
</P>
<P>
"It's not up to me to tell Wahid what to do, I think, however,
it does not enhance the stature of any country to go there,"
Albright said.

<P>
MEXICO, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The North America Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) intensified exchange between Mexico and the
United States, and also raised controversies, said Mexico's Trade
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Since NAFTA came into effect, the United States has filed 17
claims against Mexican exports, said the secretariat in a report
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, U.S. products represent a third of
investigations into unfair trade in Mexico, it added.
</P>
<P>
Mexico is the second most important trade partner of the United
States after Canada. Trade between Mexico and the United States
went from 81 billion dollars in 1993, a year before NAFTA came
into effect, to some 200 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mexican products facing U.S. sanctions include oil, livestock,
rubber, wire, lamb, tomato, millet brooms, TV sets, steel pipes
and plates.
</P>
<P>
"As trade relations expands, it is natural that controversies
take place. The treaty has dispositions to solve them," the report

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Free Trade Zone Seeking Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone (
WFTZ) in Shanghai is to enlarge its free trade zone area for the
fourth time this October to meet the increasing demand of
investors, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the 6.1 square kilometers that already make
up WFTZ have been leased out, mainly to manufacturing, stocking
and distribution industries," the English-language newspaper
quoted Li Li, an official with the WFTZ Administration Committee.
</P>
<P>
After the enlargement, the developed area of WFTZ will reach
eight square kilometers, 80 percent of the maximum planned for
WFTZ at the beginning of 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The companies registered inside this area enjoy zero tariffs
and other preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
"The fourth enlargement is the result of the large amount of
investments that have been attracted to WFTZ since last year," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
WFTZ recorded 69 new investment contracts in fixed assets in
the first half year of 2000. The total contracted investment is
more than 300 million U.S. dollars, a 53.3 percent increase from
that of the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the increased investment to improved
transportation links by the introduction of transportation by sea.
</P>
<P>
With funding from the government and Hong Kong investors,
Shanghai has almost completed the first three phases of the
construction plan of Waigaoqiao Deep-Water Port.
</P>
<P>
The new Pudong International Airport has also helped WFTZ
expand by bringing in more cargo.

<P>
GENEVA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Anti-Doping Agency (
WADA) said on Monday that only three international summer sports
federations have yet to join the program for unannounced out-of-
competition doping tests ahead of the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The International Gymnastics Federation and the International
Modern Pentathlon Union have so far refused to submit to the WADA
program while the International Volleyball Federation has delayed
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
WADA, set up last year to coordinate a worldwide testing
campaign for banned performance-enhancing drugs, said it so far
has conducted 680 tests and plans to carry out another 1,250
before the Olympics open on September 15.
</P>
<P>
That will bring it to 90 percent of the goal of 2,150 before
the start of the games.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the other 10 percent of the tests relies
on the willingness of the three federations that have yet to agree
to submit to the independent doping control program," WADA said.

HAVANA, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Merlene Ottey will miss the 100m

the Jamaican Amateur Athletics Association(JAAA) said on Monday.

Adrian Wallace, president of the JAAA, said at Kingston that
the former Jamaican sprint queen will not achieve her dream of

<P>
Ottey placed fourth at 100m in the Jamaican Olympic trials,
taking a relay berth but missing a spot in the 100m at was to be
her farewell showcase. Ottey has since vowed not to go to Sydney
for a relay without a 100m berth.

<HEADLINE> Reform Process in Iran Irreversible: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Intelligence Minister Ali
Yunesi Tuesday termed President Mohammad Khatami's reform programs
as irreversible and encouraged public participation in state
affairs, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Iran's diplomats abroad, who are currently gathering
here for a meeting, the minister said a major challenge Iran now
faces is the unification of the country's two political factions,
namely the reformers and the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Struggles between the two factions have become more intense
since the February parliamentary election, in which Khatami's
reformist allies won a landslide victory over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
This was the second humiliating defeat for the conservatives in
the past few years. The first one was the 1997 presidential
election, in which moderate Khatami, former minister of culture and
Islamic guidance, defeated former parliament speaker Nateq Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Although the conservatives, through their control of the
powerful judiciary, have ordered the closure of more than 20 pro-
reform papers and arrested a number of journalists in the past few
months, the reformist trend seems irreversible because it has the
support of a majority of people.
</P>
<P>
In his address on Tuesday, Yunesi called for public
participation in state affairs in order to combat the challenges
Iran currently faces.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of providing security in
economic, cultural, political and social areas, which he said are
the major policies on the agenda of the Intelligence Ministry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Urged to Directly Hear Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
urged Tuesday the Supreme Court to directly hear the Microsoft
antitrust case, saying that delay "could irreparably harm
competition in a vital and rapidly evolving sector of the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
In a brief filed with the high court, the government opposed
Microsoft's request that its appeal go first to the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia before reaching the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The court should agree to skip the intermediate panel because
this case "has immense importance to our national economy," the
government said.
</P>
<P>
"It is especially important to the rapidly developing high-
technology sectors, which need to know how they will be affected
by the remedies resulting from this case," it added.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft opposed the government's proposal for expediting the
appeal process. "We continue to believe that the Supreme Court
would benefit from an initial review of this very complex and
technical appeal by the Court of Appeals and we look forward to
responding next week in our reply brief," Microsoft spokesman Jim
Cullinan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Microsoft told the Supreme Court its appeal should
take a slower route. The company's brief urged the court to avoid
"the onerous task of sifting through a large and complex record
and forgoing the many benefits of intermediate appellate review."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the number of and nature of the errors below militate
strongly in favor of review by the court of appeals," the appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department called the company's arguments
unconvincing. The government pointed out that from 1903 until 1974,
all such antitrust appeals went directly from the trial court to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"The district court has distilled the record into clear and
well-organized findings of fact that provide a detailed roadmap of
its reasoning," the government said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled in April that
Microsoft had engaged in illegal anti-competitive conduct to
maintain its monopoly over the operating systems that run personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the company to split itself into two companies. One
would sell Windows, the operating system that runs most of the
world's personal computers. The other would sell everything else
the company produces, such as its Internet services and its
lucrative Office software suite, which includes popular word
processing and spreadsheet programs.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft wants its appeal heard first in the Court of Appeals
because that court has reversed Jackson's decisions on Microsoft-
related matters twice in the past. The Justice Department, on the
other hand, wants to avoid the Court of Appeals for the same
reason.
</P>
<P>
The nine justices are not expected to say until September at
the earliest whether they will grant direct review or send the
case to the appeals court. The highest court's 2000-2001 term will
not begin until October 2.
</P>
<P>
The government estimated that a final resolution of the case
would be reached at least one year earlier if the high court
exercised its discretion to take the case now.

<HEADLINE> French, British Officials to Consider Prolonging Concorde Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- French and British aviation
administration officials will meet in Paris Thursday to consider
prolonging the flight suspension of their Concorde supersonic
aircraft, said French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot said in a communique that the decision by the British
Airways to suspend the flight of Concorde on Tuesday "probably
followed the recommendation of the Bureau of Accident
Investigation (BEA)" of France and its British counterpart, the
AAIB.
</P>
<P>
BEA and AAIB recommended that British Airways suspend the
flight of Concorde "until appropriate measures guaranteeing a
satisfactory level of security concerning the risks linked to
tires are established," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that experts take advantage of the time from
the suspension to solve the problem of risks from the tires of the
undercarriage of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of a tire on the undercarriage could have been
the primary cause of the crash of the Air France Concorde on July
25, in which 113 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
France has since then suspended the flight of its five
remaining Concorde planes, while British Airways, the only other
air company which flew Concorde from Europe to the United States,
resumed the flight of the plane the next day after the crash took
place.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 348 Million U.S. Dollars in U.N. Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported some 348
million U.S. dollars worth of oil last week, the United Nations
Office of the Iraq Program said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian scheme,
said Iraq had earned an estimated 2.9 billion dollars by exporting
121 million barrels of oil at market value since the current phase
of the oil-for-food program began on June 9, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Sanctions Committee monitoring
the sanctions against Iraq approved three more contracts last week
for the sale of Iraqi oil, bringing the total number of approved
contracts to 95 with a volume of over 375 million barrels,
according to the office.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the oil-for-
food program, 66 percent of earnings goes to fund the country's
humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the Compensation
Commission which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission for Iraq, and U.N.
operational costs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food, which began in late 1996, is
aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the
country. The sanctions cannot be lifted until the United Nations
clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspectors have not gone back to Iraq since the U.
S.-led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

CARACAS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose
Vicente Rangel discarded Tuesday that President Hugo Chavez's
visit to Iraq may provoke the United States to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said there was no possibility that Venezuela may be
sanctioned because Chavez's visit to Iraq was part of his tour of
all members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the United Nations has confirmed that Chavez'
s visit to Iraq does not violate any restrictions established by
the international body.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, neither Kuwait nor Saudi Arabia opposes
the Venezuelan leader's presence in Iraq because they know Iraq is
an OPEC member.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's tour of OPEC nations is designed to invite their
leaders to attend the organization's summit meeting to be held in
Caracas at the end of September this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government on
Tuesday honored 114 federal agents for their predawn raid in April
that resulted in taking away Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez from his
Miami relatives who tried to separate the boy from his reunion
with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held in Glynco, Georgia, where Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner praised the
agents for their successful "operation Reunion."
</P>
<P>
"You not only did the right thing, you did it extraordinarily
well," Meissner said. "The objective of the operation was to
remove Elian safely from the home of his great uncle and reunite
him with his father. That was accomplished."
</P>
<P>
Elian, a six-year-old boy, was kept by his great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez and other relatives in Miami after his rescue from the
sea in Florida last November. They refused to hand over the boy
for the reunion with his father and a ship wreck incident soon
became highly politicized.
</P>
<P>
On April 22 shortly after 5 a.m., armed U.S. agents stormed
Lazaro Gonzalez' home and snatched the boy from a closet and
hustled him into a waiting van.

<HEADLINE> Two U.N. Agencies Contribute to Offset Drought Effects in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced on Tuesday that it would
immediately provide 75,000 U.S. dollars to combat the effects of a
devastating drought in Iran.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said as the greatest need was for drinking water, it
would support the provision of safe drinking water to affected
population primarily in the five hardest hit provinces.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's funds will be made available to local authorities
through the Minister of Interior for the purchase of stationary
water tankers, bladders, jerricans, chemicals and other water
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) had earlier
contributed 60,000 dollars to the relief effort in the hardest-hit
provinces.
</P>
<P>
A multi-disciplinary United Nations assessment mission recently
toured the worst affected provinces. The mission's initial
findings revealed that more than 50 percent of Iran's population
are affected by the drought to varying degrees. Over 800,000
animals have already died because of lack of water, malnutrition
and disease, and more losses are expected.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations appealed to the international community to
generously assist in alleviating the suffering caused by the
drought upon the lives of many Iranians, particularly vulnerable
groups such as children, women and nomadic livestock raisers.

<HEADLINE> White Farmers' Offer on Land Issue Unconstitutional: Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
respects the offer of 200 farms per year for resettlement by the
Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), but the offer is unconstitutional,
a senior government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information and Publicity Jonathan Moyo
said in a statement that the offer fell out of the policy
framework governing land reform program.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, the government will compulsorily
acquire more than five million hectares of land from white farmers
for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The CFU had said it was prepared to avail 200 farms each year
to the government to start the land redistribution process.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, "We hope this offer represents a new thinking in the
CFU and that it indicates a fresh appreciation of the urgency of
the land reform program."
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly, we hope the CFU is sincere in its offer and that
it will not use the offer as a public relations exercise designed
to hold or reverse the land reform program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the government was willing to have dialog with those
committed to solving the land problem and welcomed the withdrawal
of litigation by the CFU.
</P>
<P>
The CFU had previously taken court action against President
Robert Mugabe, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri and war
veterans leader Chejerai Hunzvi for failing to remove war veterans
from white-owned commercial farms.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister said the government would soon launch a
publicity program to ensure that the public fully understand the
land issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the program would describe the constitutional,
technical and administrative details that govern the land reform
program in all the country's major languages.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged to Boost Agriculture Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Erastus Mwencha, secretary-
general of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
Wednesday urged member states of the regional group to boost
agriculture for their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop on agricultural development held here on
Wednesday, Mwench said agriculture is expected to be the biggest
beneficiary of the COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA).
</P>
<P>
He said the FTA will lead to the crumbling of national
boundaries, enabling agricultural producers to sell their products
in any COMESA member state where prices are good and demand is
buoyant.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said although FTA eliminates import duties and
completely removes non-tariff barriers and other obstacles,
restrictions and bottlenecks in intra-COMESA trade, this is
necessary but not sufficient to dynamise the economies of the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is the main stay of our economies and the backbone
for our survival," he said, adding that Africa has to invest and
develop agriculture and there is no alternative in its development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
In eastern and southern Africa region, between 60 and 85
percent of people derive their income, employment and sustenance
from agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Vows to Continue Dis-engagement Plan Over Congo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has vowed
to continue with its dis-engagement plan to facilitate the
deployment of U. N. peacekeeping force to end the conflicts in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda will tirelessly support any move aimed at peacefully
resolving the Congo conflict, especially the Lusaka summit and
facilitating the deployment of the U.N. troops," the news agency
quoted Rwandan President Paul Kagame as saying Tuesday evening
upon his arrival at Kanombe International Airport in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Kagame had just returned from the Lusaka summit, which began on
Monday and ended Tuesday morning in an effort to bring an end to
the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Although DRC President Laurent Kabila resisted everything
discussed and also rejected former Botswana president Ketumile
Masire as facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue and to allow
U.N. peacekeepers unlimited access throughout the DRC, "the Lusaka
results were good," Kagame said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "we shall continue to support the Lusaka peace
accord," which was signed by all belligerents last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Kagame, Kabila's intentions, manifested by buying
more weapons and rejection of the new peace mediator, is a clear
indication that he does not back the peaceful resolution of the
DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, press reports quoted Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, Kabila's main ally, as saying that "President Kabila had
refused to listen or discuss the matter. He says he does not want
Ketumile Masire."
</P>
<P>
According to a final communique issued after the Lusaka summit,
leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) urged
Kabila to reconsider his position and threatened sanctions if he
remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
All SADC countries are in support of Masire as the facilitator
with the exception of the DRC, the communique said, re-affirming
its support for the Lusaka ceasefire agreement as the only
accepted and viable basis for resolving the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The summit, among other things, addressed such issues as cease-
fire violations, deployment of U.N. peacekeepers, resources of the
Joint Military Commission and DRC inter-political negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Welcomes Withdrawal of Litigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice President Joseph
Msika Wednesday expressed welcome to the move by the Commercial
Farmers Union (CFU) to withdraw its litigation against the
government over land raids by war veterans.
</P>
<P>
"I am going to reply and say we appreciate that they want to
work with us. This will make my task easier as it is a step in the
right direction," Msika said.
</P>
<P>
"If farmers continue to play games we will lose control of the
people," he said. "We want to establish a system that will not
bring chaos but sustain stability."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the fast-track land resettlement program, Msika
said the landless people would have been resettled before the
rainy season.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 3,000 farms have already been identified for
resettlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
CFU withdrew its litigation against the government last week.
President Robert Mugabe, Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri and
war veterans leader Chenjerai Hunzvi were supposed to respond to
issues raised by CFU in connection with the acquisition and
occupation of commercial farms in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to CFU president Tim Henwood, the move was meant to
improve the atmosphere for meaningful dialogue among concerned
parties.
</P>
<P>
CFU pledged on Monday to work with the government to find a
lasting solution to the problems afflicting the country.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Denies Intentions to Impose Sanctions on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said the second summit of signatories to the Lusaka peace
accord which ended here Tuesday did not discuss the possibility of
imposing sanctions on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing on Wednesday, Chiluba said during the 18-
hour meeting, which was attended by 10 heads of states, government
officials, representatives of the rebel movements, the United
Nations and the Organization for African Unity, there was no
committee constituted to discuss sanctions on the DRC government
as widely reported in international and local media.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said as opposed to the impression created by media
reports that the summit had collapsed without yielding any results,
a lot of positive results came out of the summit.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the notion that some heads of states
including DRC President Laurent Kabila abandoned the Lusaka summit
following disagreements among signatories to the Lusaka Summit.
</P>
<P>
"Some heads of state left the summit and the country before the
summit was concluded in the early hours of Tuesday because they
had to meet their other national commitments, while others had to
return home quickly because they did not have clean clothes to
change," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Kabila's departure before the summit was concluded, Chiluba
explained that Kabila had to travel back home because he was
unwell.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba however alluded to the standoff between the DRC
government and the rebels on who was to chair the inter-Congolese
dialog. The DRC government has rejected former Botswanan
president Ketumire Masire as facilitator for the dialog and it
recently locked Masire's offices in Kinshasa accusing him of
siding with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the "sticky" issue of who chairs the internal DRC
dialog was not resolved at the summit and still remained hanging,
awaiting further discussion.

<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign exchange
reserves reached 7.136 billion U. S. dollars at the end of June
this year, the Central Bank of Nigeria said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was available here on Wednesday, said the
foreign exchange reserves increased by 900 million dollars in June.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the main inflow of the country's
foreign exchange was from oil exports, while the main outflow was
for external debt service, national priority projects and cash
calls from commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
When President Olusegun Obasanjo took over power last May,
Nigeria's foreign reserves were almost in red, due to the spending

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Lawmakers Urged to Confine to Own Responsibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has urged members of the country's National Assembly to
confine themselves to their constitutional responsibilities, press
here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said Tuesday that it is not the responsibilities of
the legislature to saddle itself with the award of contracts,
saying that it would make it become both the executor and judge,
sacrificing the principles of checks and balances the legislature
should be upholding, said the president.
</P>
<P>
It's the first time the president has commented on the matters
relating to the country's top legislature since the Senate
corruption scandal earlier this month, which removed the senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo was cautious with words on the top legislature, for
the ties between the two branches of government had been on the
strain in the past months.
</P>
<P>
The president also slammed the legislators' taking of "illegal
and unconstitutional allowances", saying members of the executive,
legislative and judiciary are all public officers, whose action
must be put under public scrutiny.

<HEADLINE> Drought Eases, Rain Expected in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The drought condition that has
affected Kenya for most part of the year is now easing up and the
short rains are expected in October, according to a source at the
Kenya's Meteorological Department.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted the source
as saying "due to change in weather conditions in most parts of
the country, indications show that the weather has now reverted
back to normal in the third quarter to the end of the year."
</P>
<P>
He said the rain being experienced in Nakuru town, the capital
of Rift Valley Province in central Kenya, due to the moist Western
Congo air-mass which results in rains in the western and Rift
Valley regions when it blows to the east.
</P>
<P>
However, the water crisis in Kenya's capital Nairobi worsens as
most estates in the city have gone without water for two weeks
running, while others received the water sporadically at night and
in small quantity.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the city council began the water rationing
program in the capital. Residents urged the city council to sink
more boreholes in estates or encouraged residents to sink
boreholes in their residence instead of relying on piped water.
</P>
<P>
Due to a prolonged drought, more than 3 million Kenyans are
facing the famine threat. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and the
United Nations World Food Program have appealed to international
community for food aid to the affected Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> Troop Deployment in Zanzibar not to Influence Elections: Defense Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Ministry of
Defense and National Service has refuted claims by some opposition
parties that the Tanzania People's Defense Forces (TPDF) has
dispatched troops to Zanzibar in a bid to boost the ranks of
supporters of a certain political party for the forthcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News Wednesday quoted a press release issued
by the ministry as saying that recent troop deployment is intended
to reinforce security in the Indian Ocean Isles, a semi-autonomous
region of Tanzania, during the run-up to the elections scheduled
for October 29.
</P>
<P>
"The army is not involved in politics and therefore does not
support any political party, but will provide defense and security
for all regardless of their political affiliations," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the army will not interfere in the voting activities in
Zanzibar until such a time that it is asked to help when breach of
peace for the people or their property is eminent.
</P>
<P>
While in Zanzibar, said the statement, army personnel, like
other citizens, will participate in the electoral process, but
will cast their votes for the presidential candidates of the
Tanzanian Union government only.
</P>
<P>
"They will not be allowed to vote for the Zanzibar president,
Members of Parliament or Members of the House of Representatives
because the Isles electoral law does not allow any person to
participate in the elections if he or she has not stayed there for
five years."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of Defense Forces General Robert Mboma
cautioned the military forces Tuesday to keep away from politics
because their responsibility is to defend whatever government to
be elected by the people.
</P>
<P>
The military chief said under the current democratic multiparty
system in Tanzania, the defense forces have no right to
participate in politics except through voting.
</P>
<P>
Political tension has been rising high recently in Zanzibar
since the voting registration exercise started on August 8,
forcing the government under the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)
to take measures to enhance security in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But it has its own government and
parliament. It will go to polls in October simultaneously with the
mainland during the second multiparty elections. Zanzibaris have
the right to vote for their own president as well as for a leader
of the Union government.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's CCM, under President Salmin Amour, claimed a narrow
victory over the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) in the 1995
elections, but the CUF questioned the result.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Completes Troop Withdrawal From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

KAMPALA, August 16 (Xinhua) -- The withdrawal of 4,000 Ugandan
soldiers from the town of Buta in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) has come to an end, Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima
told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of personnel has ended and equipment is still
being brought home," said Katirima, adding that the whole exercise
is expected to be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers from Buta will be deployed in northern Uganda to
fight remnants of anti-government rebel Lord's Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni last June ordered the withdrawal of
five battalions which had fought in the northeastern Congolese
city of Kisangani in May and June against the Rwandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The five battalions moved to Buta after the demilitarization of
Kisangani under the agreement of Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops fought each other three times since
last August in Kisangani, the third largest city in the DRC, which
caused heavy civilian casualties.

<P>
ROME, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Five climbers were killed Tuesday
when an avalanche swept through a group of twenty making the
normal Tour Ronde ascent at about 3,800 meters high on Mont Blanc,
head of Val D'Aosta's Alpine rescue unit Giuliano Trucco said
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the mass of snow and ice hit the climbers at about
midday, and the climbers were French, German and Italian.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the dead were taken to Chamonix in France by
French and Italian Alpine rescue helicopters.
</P>
<P>
All but two of the fifteen injured were also taken to Chamonix.
The two were brought to hospital in Italian northwestern city of
Aosta and released almost at once.
</P>
<P>
Alpine guides said Tuesday's high temperatures seem to have
loosened boulders on top of the Tour Ronde. These then tumbled
down and triggered the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
The normal climb up the Tour Ronde is on the French side of the
mountain. The guides say that in summer, it should only be climbed
in the early morning because of the risk of falling rocks and
avalanches.

NEW YORK, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mostly
lower Tuesday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling on
profit-taking. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose a
bit.

At the close of session, the Dow index fell 109.14 at 11,067.00,

Investors took profits as they await a meeting of the Federal
Reserve on the monetary policy. Analysts have widely expected the
central bankers to leave interest rates unchanged at the meeting.
</P>

A new report gave investors more confidence in steady rates.
The Federal Reserve reported today that the U.S. industrial
production rose 0.4 percent in July, in line with analysts'

The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, US Resume Direct Air Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the United States
Tuesday resumed direct air link between the two countries, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Aviation Kema Chikwe made the announcement
at a ceremony marking the maiden Lagos-New York flight here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. suspended direct air link to Nigeria in 1993 on the
grounds of inadequate security and as a way of sanctioning against
the military regime then.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians had to detour to London to get to the United
States, making the Lagos-London airline one of the most lucrative
in the world.

<HEADLINE> 23 People Injured in U.S. Train Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the riders suffered minor neck and back injuries in the
crash, officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, a train was going too fast and could not stop at
the station and went through the barrier at the international
terminal," Mass Transit Administration spokesman Frank Fulton said.
</P>
<P>
The front of the train was crushed and rode up onto an abutment
at the end of the line, but the train did not go into the terminal,
Fulton added.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic was not affected, although some roads leading to
the terminal were closed temporarily by emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have not ruled out mechanical failure as the
cause of the crash. The driver will undergo mandatory drug and
alcohol testing.
</P>
<P>
In February, another light rail train crashed into the barrier
at the end of the line at BWI, injuring 24.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Passes Political Torch to Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 15 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday passed the leadership of the Democratic Party to Vice
President Al Gore, describing his deputy as "the right person to
be the first U.S. President of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint rally with Gore in Monroe, Michigan, Clinton
said that "every good thing that has happened that came out of our
administration in the last eight years, Al Gore was at the heart
of it."
</P>
<P>
He said, "He (Gore) has been a leader for the new economy, a
leader for welfare reform, a leader for education, a leader for
lowering the crime rate."
</P>
<P>
Gore thanked Clinton with a bear hug and promised to keep the U.
S. economy strong if elected president on November 7.
</P>
<P>
"Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy right, and I'm
pledging to you here today, I am not going to let the other side
wreck it and take it away from us. We're going to keep the
prosperity going," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
After brief campaign speeches, Clinton with his wife and
daughter exited the rally stage to the back. After watching them
leaving, Gore and his wife waded into the crow to start his
campaign on his own.
</P>
<P>
The two men headed in different directions -- Clinton going on
vacation in New York and Gore heading to the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles where he will accept the party's
presidential nomination on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who opened the convention Monday with a ringing
endorsement of Gore, flew to the small town of Monroe for the
rally which was billed as a symbolic passing of party leadership.
