<HEADLINE> Russian Duma to Vote on PM Nomination Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma of parliament
will convene a plenary session next Wednesday to vote on President
Boris Yeltsin's nomination of Sergei Stepashin as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the lower house of parliament,
announced the decision Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, originally a first deputy prime minister and
interior minister, was nominated premier Wednesday after Yeltsin
fired the cabinet of Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Observers see little chance that the State Duma would endorse
the nomination of 47-year-old Stepashin, but under Russian
constitution, Yeltsin can dissolve the lower house if it fails to
approve the candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Already, a top aide to Yeltsin told the ORT public television
that the president would stick to his choice of Stepashin as
premier.
</P>
<P>
Once Stepashin is rejected for a third time, Yeltsin would
dismiss the State Duma and call parliamentary elections in three
months.
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, the State Duma started hearings on impeachment
proceedings against Yeltsin on five charges: instigating the 1991
Soviet collapse, improperly using force against hard-line
lawmakers in 1993, launching the botched 1994-96 war in Chechnya,
ruining Russia's military and waging genocide against Russians
with economic policies that impoverished the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that only the charge on the Chechnya war stands
any chance of clearing the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the 450-seat State Duma needs
300 votes to set the impeachment process in motion in a vote set
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If impeachment charges were approved by the Duma, they must be
examined by the Supreme Court to determine whether they constitute
serious criminal offenses and by the Constitutional Court for
procedural correctness.
</P>
<P>
Then they go to the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, where a two- thirds vote is required to remove the
president. If the council does not act within 90 days, impeachment
fails.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt. Accuses Congo (K) of Training Hutu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Thursday again accused
President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and his allies of training and re-equipping thousands of
"Interahamwe" militiamen in preparation of an invasion of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"At least 5,000 militiamen are at large in the DRC where they
continue to train for an attack on Rwanda," the Rwandan News
Agency quoted a press statement from the office of Rwanda's
Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that the presence of the Hutu extremists
in the DRC remains the biggest threat for the survival of the
Rwandan nation.
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled that Kabila had openly declared that he
wanted to use the Interahamwe and members of the defeated former
Rwandan government army to take the war in the DRC into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, together with Uganda, has been accused of supporting
the DRC rebels determined to oust President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Following a peace deal signed by Kabila and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni in Libya's Sirte in April this year,
the Ugandan troops are gearing up to pull out of the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
But Rwanda insists that there will be no withdrawal as long as
the "Interahamwe'' still looms high, saying that any solution to
the war in the DRC should address concerns of its neighbors and
those of the internal opposition.

<HEADLINE> Stradivarius Violin Discovered in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Stradivarius violin made in
1713 has been discovered, being so far the fourth one existing in
Romania, reported on Thursday the official Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
The violin, whose authenticity was confirmed by art museum
experts, bears a label reading "Antonio Stradivarius - Cremonese
1713" and an inscription in the Czech language.
</P>
<P>
The violin was discovered by Nicolae Nica, a peasant and
sculptor, at the farm of a fiddlers family in a neighboring
village.
</P>
<P>
Nica, past 80, is also the founder of the Village Museum of
Chilia-Fagetelu in southern county of Olt. He bought the violin
for the village museum he is running.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the same restless art lover discovered a Steiner
violin, which he also put on display in the museum he founded.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Charged With Monopolizing Air Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department on
Thursday charged that American Airlines, the nation's
second-largest air carrier, tried to monopolize airline passenger
service to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The American Airlines was charged in a lawsuit with repeatedly
trying to drive small, startup airlines out of the DFW airport,
the nation's third largest, by saturating their routes with
additional flights and cutting fares.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita,
Kansas, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The Justice's antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General Joel
I. Klein, said, "American pursued a predatory policy... so it
could return to its monopoly practices."
</P>
<P>
He said these tactics were successfully employed against three
new entrants into the Dallas-Fort Worth market: Vanguard, Sun Jet
and Western Pacific. "The effect on the traveling public was
devastating" in terms of higher prices and fewer flights, Klein
said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news conference that
American Airlines increased its prices between Dallas-Fort Worth
and Wichita by 50 percent after it forced Vanguard Airlines out of
that route.
</P>
<P>
Klein said the government sued after negotiations with American
broke down. This is the first predatory-practices case brought
since airlines were deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department also is investigating other airlines and
their practices at their hub airports, Klein said, but did not
name them.
</P>
<P>
American issued a statement saying the allegations "are
unwarranted and go against the very essence of free-market
competition. "
</P>
<P>
"American will mount an aggressive defense and is confident
that its actions in Dallas-Fort Worth will prove to be nothing
more than those of any tough competitor in a highly competitive
industry," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The American Airlines dominates service at the DFW airport,
flying more than 70 percent of all nonstop passengers that travel
through it.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greece backs Cyprus' decision to
align itself with sanctions the European Union (EU) intends to
implement against Yugoslavia, Greek Deputy Foreign Minister
Yannon Kranidiotis said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a 16-member delegation, Kranidiotis arrived here
Thursday afternoon for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on arrival at Cyprus' Larnaca airport, Kranidiotis
also noted that Greece and Cyprus are holding a "delicate balance
and so far the way they have handled the problem is successful."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has decided to align itself as far as
possible with sanctions the EU intends to implement against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The decision sparked off criticism from various quarters.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party AKEL "condemned unreservedly" the
government decision, saying that there will be serious reaction
from Russia, which will affect bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis said that the Cyprus reunification talks must
concentrate on the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We support every effort within the framework of the United
Nations resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> World Environment Day to be Celebrated in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) --- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) announced here Thursday that this year's main
international celebrations for the World Environment Day on June 5
will be held in Japanese capital Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's World Environment Day is "Our Earth,
Our Future, Just Save It ", UNEP officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Once a species is extinct, no wishful thinking can bring it
back. Not the best landscaping can resurrect the beauty and
majesty of the mountain that has been stripped of its forest and
vegetation," said UNEP's Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
"Hunger, disease, poverty, air and water pollution, land
degradation, ozone layer depletion and all the environmental
problems with which we struggle every day can be corrected, but we
need to take adequate steps to achieve this end," Toepfer added.
</P>
<P>
The UNEP is encouraging people and communities across the world
to celebrate the World Environment Day in a way that will make a
difference both locally and globally.
</P>
<P>
As the host of this year's World Environment Day celebrations,
Japan will organize a world conference aimed at arousing
environmental awareness among the earth residents.
</P>
<P>
The main event to be held on June 5 will culminate with the
presentation of UNEP's Global 500 awards to 17 individuals and
organizations from 12 countries who have made outstanding
contributions to the protection of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The World Environment Day, established by the United Nations
General Assembly in 1972, is a popular event with governments,
individuals and community groups organizing activities to improve
the environment.

CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Thursday that he is to confer with
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud over the stalled Middle East peace
and the situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that during an upcoming visit to
Lebanon on Sunday, he is also to discuss with Lebanese Parliament
Speaker Nabih Berri the continued Israeli aggression on south
Lebanon and seek ways of galvanizing Arabs on the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He will also meet with Prime Minister Salim Hoss to find out
how to boost the Lebanese position and coordinate the Arab
stances on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-claimed security zone in 1985 in south
Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed last year that it would pull back from south
Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees to guarantee the
security of the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected the offer, insisting that the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon be unconditional.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Central Bank Tries to Rescue Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, has said here Thursday evening that it has
intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to rescue the
depreciating local currency shilling.
</P>
<P>
The management of the central bank said in a press release that
it intervened in the foreign exchange market on the sales side to
the tune of 10 million U.S. dollars earlier in the same day.
</P>
<P>
The bank continues to monitor closely developments in the
foreign exchange market and stands ready to intervene further if
need arises, it added.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the central bank injected money to
stabilize the country's falling currency. In April, it pumped in
25.6 million dollars to halt the plunging trend of shilling.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan shilling began to devalue against dollar one year
ago. The recent sharp decrease in coffee exports, fish ban by the
European Union and delay of donors' aid worsened the financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate between shilling and dollar fell from 1,230
shillings per dollar in July, 1998 to the present level of 1,580
shillings per dollar.
</P>
<P>
This instability prompted more people to buy dollars, resulting
in a vicious cycle in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Economists warned that the shilling could depreciate further if
no more effective measures were to be taken.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj Thursday launched a 20-year plan to improve
the country's transport system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing in Pretoria, Maharaj said the plan,
called "Moving South Africa", would focus on boosting South
African public and freight transport system by improving
infrastructure and encouraging investment.
</P>
<P>
One of the ways to attract investments would be to allow the
private sector to provide resources and operate portions of the
country's rail network on a concession basis, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He gave examples that bus contracts had been negotiated along
the lines of competitive tendering, and steps had been taken to
start regulating the taxi industry.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the public transport system would be redirected
to the historically disadvantaged people, such as those with
disabilities and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj said the strategy was based on two years of research
and consultation, and was a "skeleton" for future developments in
the transport sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Thursday condemned the continued air strikes
against Iraq by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing air raids of the two Western allies have been
"outside the legal framework of the United Nations Security
Council," Abdel-Meguid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the league's opposition to the U.S. and British
attack on Iraqi sites, accusing the two countries of seeking to
destroy Iraqi civilian and residential establishments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain set up two no-fly zones in the north and
south of Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to allegedly protect the
ethnic Kurdish minorities and the Shiite Muslims from attacks by
Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones have
been attacking Iraqi targets for over four months.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the efforts to resolve the issue of the missing
Kuwaiti nationals, Abdel-Meguid said he met in the day with Deagig
el-Enzi, head of the Kuwaiti Prisoners Committee, and briefed him
on his talks with officials of the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) during a recent visit to Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has charged him with working out a mechanism
concerning the missing nationals of Kuwait, Iraq and Saudi Arabia
and coordinate with the U.N. and the ICRC on the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait accuses Iraq of detaining hundreds of its nationals
captured during the 1990 Gulf crisis when Iraq occupied the Gulf
sheikdom. Iraq has denied the charge.

<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights Mrs Mary Robinson said here Thursday that she was
struck at NATO's missiles attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who just returned from a visit to Yugoslavia, said
she went to the damaged Chinese embassy on Thursday morning to
express her sympathy and condolences to the journalists killed by
NATO missiles.
</P>
<P>
"I was struck when I viewed the building. It is a very
distinctive and custom-built embassy. But the large and
distinctive building was destroyed by five bombs, one of which is
still unexploded," Robinson said when answering a question by
Xinhua at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore view it as an extremely serious event," said the
head of the Geneva-based UNHCHR.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released on Thursday, Robinson also
expressed concern over the impact of NATO's aerial bombardment on
civilians and urged that diplomacy and peacemaking take center
stage in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday in the city of Nis, south of Belgrade, Robinson
saw the damage caused to a residential area by bombing that had
taken place shortly before her arrival.

<HEADLINE> Chirac: Talks Bring France, Russia Closer on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
here Thursday that his talks with Russian leaders have brought
closer the two sides' stances on settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The talks had a very positive character," Chirac said of his
meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov and Yeltsin's special envoy on Yugoslavia, Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He said the days to come will show that progress has been
reached on settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to Yeltsin's resoluteness we may find a solution to the
Kosovo problem," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Despite Yeltsin's reiteration that Moscow may have to withdraw
from the Kosovo process if Russia's views continue to go unheeded
and NATO continues its air strikes on Yugoslavia, Chirac said
Paris unconditionally supports the NATO operation in the Balkans,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"France participates in that operation and believes that it is
necessary to continue it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the settlement of the Kosovo issue needs
Russia's active participation.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing could be worse than Russia's withdrawal from that
negotiating process," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian envoy Chernomyrdin told
reporters that a diplomatic solution to the Yugoslav conflict
might be found within days.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Helsinki, he said that Finnish President
Marti Ahtisaari was joining in the peace settlement in the Balkans
as a U.N. representative.
</P>
<P>
He once again urged NATO to stop the air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to spare no effort to put an end to killing
people who do not even understand why they are by bombed,"
Chernomyrdin said.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Warns Against Possible Balkan Borders Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
warned Thursday that a possible change of borders in the Balkan
region would lead to widespread war and complete destabilization
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing young deputies from European Union (EU) member
states in Athens, Simitis said that Greece believed that if there
was a change of borders in the Balkans, then all the countries of
southeastern Europe with minorities might be tempted to pursue
other forms of states in the region, and this would mean
widespread war in the Balkans and complete destabilization in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this would not be in the interests of any country
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The current conflict in the Balkan region led to hatred, he
said, adding that if it continued for some time, post-war
cooperation would be impossible, not only between the states of
the region but also between ethnic groups, Simitis said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the way of solving the Yugoslav crisis could
only come through the implementation of international law.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his British counterpart Tony
Blair Wednesday, Simitis stressed that the Yugoslav crisis had
proved that only one superpower could not secure global stability
and security today since its unilateral actions alone amounted to
an imbalance.

<HEADLINE> Japan Reschedules Rwanda's Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government Thursday
rescheduled Rwanda's debt worth about 826,860 U.S. dollars as a
follow-up of the Paris Club meeting held with bilateral donors and
focused on debt-servicing and relief in June of last year.
</P>
<P>
The related protocol was signed by the Japanese Ambassador and
Rwandan Finance Minister, Donald Kaberuka, Rwanda News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Aoki said that this rescheduling will help at alleviating the
financial and economic imbalance and would propel up Rwanda's
enhanced adjustment facilities signed with the IMF in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kaberuka appreciated Japan's aid to Rwanda which has been
translated into the disbursement of 66 million dollars out of the
89 million pledged during the last two Round Tables in Geneva and
Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
He, however, renewed calls for assistance to donors saying that
the recovery of Rwanda's battered economy is still crippled by the
heavy foreign debt, amounting to 1.2 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- NATO warplanes bombed more than a
dozen cities and towns in Yugoslavia from Wednesday to Thursday,
killing at least two people and wounding others.
</P>
<P>
NATO aircraft fired four missiles on the southern Serbian town
of Vladicin Han Wednesday night and the attack killed two people
and wounded five.
</P>
<P>
Early on Thursday, NATO warplanes attacked a civilian
residential area in Kosovoska Mitrovica in the province of Kosovo.
They fired three missiles on the town and fired another two
missiles on a mining facility solely populated by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Several missiles were fired against a primary school at
Leposavic but no casualties were reported. Also on Thursday, NATO
aircraft attacked the village of Ladjevce near Kraljevo in central
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The eastern city of Pirot saw the third aerial attack by NATO
ever since the western military alliance started air attacks
against the Balkan nation on March 24. Two NATO missiles hit in
between the villages of Izvor and Poljska Rzana near Pirot.
</P>
<P>
In Nis, the third largest city in the federal republic, cluster
bombs were dropped on the eastern residential area of the town.
Cluster bombs were dropped against the Duvaniste and Medijana
housing complexes and quite a few civilians were wounded by the
attack, but no detailed report on casualty was available.
</P>
<P>
At least four missiles were fired at Batajnica near Belgrade
early on Thursday, while Pancevo, also close-by Belgrade, was also
hit by NATO air raids. Two strong blasts were heard in eastern
Pancevo.
</P>
<P>
Inside Kosovo, NATO overnight attacks aimed several towns and
villages including Gnjilane, Srbica, Decani, Djakovica, Urosevac,
Pristina, Slovinje, Kutlovac.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said here Thursday that he had no plan to send any
envoy to the Balkans for the moment.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks when talking to the press briefly before
a high-level meeting on the crisis in the Balkans began on
Thursday afternoon in the United Nations Office at Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"I have not said my two envoys were going to the Balkans, I
have said I have appointed two envoys for the Balkans," Annan told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And as to whether I expect the war to go on for a long time, I
really cannot say," he added. "I am not privy to the plans of NATO
and I don't know where we stand on that."
</P>
<P>
The two special envoys whom the U.N. chief appointed are Carl
Bildt of Sweden and Eduard Kukan of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that there is still much more to do in order to
assess the situation but they will try to create the conditions
for peace and then implement the conditions in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will discuss the present and future
challenges faced by the United Nations system as a whole in
addressing the Balkans crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The soaring energy costs pushed
the producer prices up 0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department
said thursday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rise in the Department's Producer Price
Index (PPI) for finished goods brought the annual rate of inflation at
the wholesale level to 1.1 percent so far in 1999. There was a
smaller 0.2 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core
producer prices increased only a mild 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Economists worry that inflation could become a danger if U.S.
consumers, secure in their jobs, continue to spend briskly as
price-containing pressures caused by recent low demand for U.S.
products overseas begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
In April, energy prices rose 5.1 percent, the most in nearly
nine years. Gasoline prices posted the largest gain, an
unprecedented 29.1 percent rise, breaking the record set in
January 1990, during the Persian Gulf crisis. Fuel oil prices
jumped 14.3 percent, the most in five years.
</P>
<P>
Economists have been expecting energy prices to rise because,
after global economic turmoil pulled them down sharply last year,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed this
Spring to limit production.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell 0.9 percent in April. Fish prices dropped 7.1
percent, the most in five years, after rising sharply in March.
Dairy, egg and pork prices also fell.
</P>
<P>
That helped offset a 15.8 percent increase in vegetable prices,
led by a huge 85.5 percent increase in the cost of lettuce. The
cost of fresh fruit also rose, by 0.9 percent, with citrus fruits
leading the way as Florida suffers Droughts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, competition from low priced imports flooding
into the United States from economically distressed countries is
keeping most prices here low.
</P>
<P>
In April, for example, the cost of computers fell 3.9 percent,
prices for children's clothing fell 0.8 percent and home
electronic equipment prices fell 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many economists said because energy prices were behind the
latest rise in the PPI, a blip higher in the index would not
suggest a broad trend of rising inflation pressures at the
wholesale level.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-time
claims for unemployment benefits held steady at a moderate
303,000 last week. The four-week moving average of jobless
claims dropped by 4,000 to 304,250. This suggests little change
ahead in the nation's unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in April.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Cannot Have Luxury With Outside Aid: ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Thursday said that Pakistan is still under sanctions and its
government "cannot have the luxury of being complacent" because
multinational assistance is just a "brief reprieve."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint news conference here, Program Manager of the
bank Marshuk Ali Shah and Senior Program Officer Bruce Carrad said
their assessment of Pakistan is that the country is "still going
through a difficult time and it is very vulnerable to crisis."
</P>
<P>
The two officials are on a two-week visit to Pakistan to
prepare country programming for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
They said Pakistan is still under sanctions imposed following
nuclear tests in May last year. A resumption of loans by
international financial institutions, an agreement reached with
the Paris Club on a rescheduling of debts and on-going
negotiations with the London Club on commercial debts are all a
temporary reprieve to the economy.
</P>
<P>
"In order to take the country out of the problems it is facing,
the economy will have to be revived which is practically stagnant
for the last 12 months," they added.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the country will face further difficulties if
the government fails to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
Asked what Pakistan ought to do to improve its economy, Shah
said the "most important area is to maintain the macro-economic
stability."
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign exchange reserves position is fairly
comfortable but it "all depends on to what extent the government
is able to generate exports to strengthen the foreign exchange
reserves."
</P>
<P>
The other thing, he said, is that over the last eight months,
the country is below targets in various sectors, adding that the
government will have to address fundamental structural problems in
order to revive the economy.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch New Stimulus Package: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will announce a
new economic stimulus package soon to boost investment and support
economic expansion, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry spokesman Sathit Limpongphan said the ministry
is to submit the second-phase economic stimulus package to the
cabinet for consideration in mid- or late June.
</P>
<P>
The new package would be focused on stimulating the real estate
sector and related industries so that the Thai economy would grow
one percent this year as targeted.
</P>
<P>
The proposed package would supplement the one implemented in
April aimed mainly at stimulating private consumption and
government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Sathit said the Finance Ministry would also give financial
support to local investors, particularly small and medium-sized
enterprises, through the so-called venture capital fund, which is
a cooperation project between lenders in both the public and
private sectors, and those in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
For external loans from the Export-Import Bank of Japan and
Nordic Investment Bank, investors seeking the loans had to have
contracts or business relations with their counterparts in the
lender countries in forms of raw material deals or joint venture
projects.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Famous chefs, food critics and
lovers of Thai cuisine from all over the world will be convening
in Bangkok for the first International Thai Food Conference on
June 1-2, a Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) news release said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at highlighting the refreshing taste
and health benefits of Thai food and building closer links between
two of Thailand's strongest bedrock industries: agriculture and
tourism, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of Thai cuisine is one of the nine themes of the
1998-1999 Amazing Thailand campaign. To support it, the TAT has
published thousands of sales brochures and promotional material on
Thai food. Thai cooking schools are featured at hotels
nation-wide.
</P>
<P>
The convention, co-hosted by the TAT, the Department of Export
Promotion and the Thai Chefs Association, will focus on the
advantages of Thai herbs, Thai cuisine for Europeans, delectable
fruits of Thailand and best Thai restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The conference is expected to benefit the Thai farmers
nationwide and also to encourage research into higher quality of
agricultural production and provide alternate sources of income.
</P>
<P>
It will also benefit the Thai exports, especially the exports
of Thai food, and the creation of new markets in the same
countries that also generate visitors for Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Starts Impeachment Hearings Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma started
impeachment hearings Thursday against President Boris Yeltsin, a
day after Yeltsin plunged the nation into a fresh bout of
political crisis by firing Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of Primakov, announced Wednesday by Yeltsin on
national television, was the third time in just over a year that
Yeltsin has ousted a premier
</P>
<P>
The hearings began with lawmakers of the lower house of
parliament reading out reports on the five impeachment charges
Yeltsin is facing: instigating the 1991 Soviet collapse,
improperly using force against hard-line lawmakers in 1993,
launching the botched 1994-96 war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's
military and waging genocide against Russians with economic
policies that impoverished the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that only the charge on the Chechnya war stands
any chance of clearing the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
As deputies debated inside, about 500 protesters rallied
outside the parliament building to demand Yeltsin's ouster.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the 450-seat State Duma needs
300 votes to set the impeachment process in motion in a vote set
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If impeachment charges were approved by the Duma, they must be
examined by the Supreme Court to determine whether they constitute
serious criminal offenses and by the Constitutional Court for
procedural correctness.
</P>
<P>
Then they go to the Federation Council, or upper house of
parliament, where a two-thirds vote is required to remove the
president.
</P>
<P>
If the council does not act within 90 days, impeachment fails.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Poses as Major Challenge to Zimbabwe, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its latest weekly economic highlights, the central bank said
sound macro-economic conditions were crucial for savings to
accumulate, which in turn would support increased investment.
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge the country faced was high inflation,
the bank publication said.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation figure for April is at 52.7 percent,
 Economists forecast that levels may even go beyond 60 percent in
view of the recent hike in producer prices of the agricultural
commodities which are likely to be passed on to the consumer.
</P>
<P>
The central bank this week raised its lending rate by one
percentage point to 46 percent, a move likely to trigger a rise in
commercial banks' minimum lending rates.
</P>
<P>
"Monetary policy will, therefore, remain targeted at ensuring
price stability. To complement this, recent fiscal consolidation
should be sustained or better still, improved on particularly in
relation to domestic debt reduction and improved parastatal
performance," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said additional tax incentives for both domestic and
foreign investors also needed to be considered with further tax
relief extended to exporters.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the monopolistic production structures which
 characterize the economy needed to be dealt with as a matter of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of an enabling environment to promote greater
entrepreneurial activity in all sectors of the economy especially
by the small-scale and informal sectors, is vital," it said.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Calls for Halt to NATO Air War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 13 (Xinhua)--After numerous debates and votes at its
special congress on Kosovo conflict, Germany's Greens Party
Thursday in the city of Bielefeld passed a resolution which called
for a temporary halt to NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders also urged members to support the negotiating
endeavor on Kosovo by Greens' Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
The resolution yielded by the party leadership won support of
444 among some 800 delegates, but 318 others approved an
alternative resolution demanding an unconditional stop to the air
war.
</P>
<P>
After announcing the final voting results, party leaders
appealed to delegates to restore unity and work constructively
towards a solution to Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which seemed to have avoided a party split,
came after Fischer said he would not implement any decision
demanding a stop to the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fischer has said he would quit the Greens if the party
could not support Bonn cabinet's participation in NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
And the compromise also affirmed the Greens' role in Bonn
coalition and avoided a governmental crisis. The Greens serves as
junior partner in cabinet, sharing power with Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said he would choose another partner if the
Greens had accepted a stance against his policy.
</P>
<P>
Peter Struck, head of SPD parliamentary fraction, said after
the congress' resolution supported Schroeder and Fischer's
Kosovo policy.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the delegates have sent a clear signal that
the party wants to keep the red-green coalition," said Struck.
</P>
<P>
But Germany's left wing opposition, Democratic Socialism Party
(PDS), in a statement called the compromise "a sell-out" of the
basic principles of the Greens, a party founded as non-violence
and peace movement.
</P>
<P>
Anti-war sentiments prevailed at Thursday's congress while
several hundred protesters held an anti-NATO rally just outside
the venue.
</P>
<P>
Whistles, boos and anti-NATO shouts were heard when Fischer
gave a speech defending his policy on Kosovo crisis. Left wing
critics called Fischer a "war monger" and demanded his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, a tough advocate of NATO's air strikes, said he had
done everything in his power to avert the war. He called his party to
give diplomacy a chance.
</P>
<P>
When the delegates were debating, a demonstrators rushed into
the congress venue and threw a paint bottle on Fischer's face. The
minister was shortly sent to hospital with minor injures.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Strobe Talbott will
meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Geneva on thursday
evening for a possible solution of Kosovo crisis, a U.S. official
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters that Talbott continued his talks with Russian officials
on details of last week's agreement between Russia and NATO
members, which included a proposal to send international military
forces to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's talks between Talbott and Russians took place after
the U.S. envoy returned from a trip to Finland where he met with
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, a possible envoy of the West
to the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
A Russian Foreign Ministry statement said on Thursday that
Moscow did not believe in holding talks "for the sake of talks."
</P>
<P>
Russia would make "serious changes" to its position on Kosovo
if NATO did not stop bombing Yugoslavia, it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Chamber, Hong Kong Move to Expand Commercial Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on
Thursday announced that it will organize the U.S. section of a new
bilateral Hong Kong-U.S. Business Council, a private sector
initiative that will help to strengthen and expand ties between
Hong Kong and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Chamber is committed to strengthening the American
business community's commercial ties with Hong Kong through the
Hong Kong-U.S. Business Council," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce
President Thomas J. Donohue.
</P>
<P>
"There are tremendous opportunities for U.S. companies in the
greater China region, and Hong Kong is the gateway to many of
those opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council, the successor organization to the U.S.-Hong Kong
and Hong Kong-U.S. Economic Committees, will maintain professional
representatives in Washington, New York and Hong Kong as well as a
select board of corporate leaders from Hong Kong and the United
States, the U.S. Chamber said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council will continue to serve
as secretariat for the Hong Kong section.
</P>
<P>
"The Council will draw upon the expertise of both Hong Kong and
U.S. companies as a means of developing business and contacts with
China and the wider region as well as with Hong Kong itself," said
Paul Volcker, the U.S. Chairman of the Hong Kong-U.S. Business
Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber said Hong Kong, America's 15th largest trading
partner, already plays a pivotal role as an operational center for
U.S. companies targeting the China mainland and markets across the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, trade between Hong Kong and the United States has
risen by more than 80 percent and nearly 500 American companies
now maintain regional offices or headquarters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber is the World's largest business federation,
representing more than three million businesses and organizations
of every size, sector, and region.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Rebound after 5-day Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices staged their first
significant rebound on Thursday since tumbling from last week's
highs, as world benchmark Brent crude traded up 50 cents to 16.10
U.S. dollars a barrel by the close in London.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some of the large investment funds punting on oil
futures had made a sharp exit when prices toppled from just over
17 U.S. dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
With fewer funds speculating on the market, oil prices could
now reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand for physical
crude more closely, which would provide a more concrete basis for
price rises, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
"It makes the market a little more healthy -- in a few days we
will be able to continue on our upward march," Christopher Bellew
of Prudential Bache International was quoted saying.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the market's 16-month high of 17.09 dollars
last week was built on sandy ground, as the price had been sailing
upwards on excitement over evidence of supply curbs by OPEC oil
exporters despite weak physical demand.
</P>
<P>
"OPEC's agreement to cut oil supplies by more than 1.7 million
barrels a day from the beginning of April has already set oil
prices soaring with hardly a barrel of output having been removed
from the market," the London-based Centre for Global Energy
Studies said in report.
</P>
<P>
Prices cascaded downwards this week to below 15.50 U.S. dollars
as a slew of figures showing mounting petroleum stocks in the U.S.
stoked fears that crude demand was too weak to justify the
market's buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
Memories of last December, when a global supply glut drove
prices down below 10 a barrel U.S. dollars, are still fresh in
market players' minds. But some said they see firmer gains in
coming weeks once OPEC's cuts begin to eat into oil supplies and
demand increases as millions of U.S. holidaymakers take to the
roads in their gas-guzzling cars.
</P>
<P>
"While the very short term may be bearish, it is important to
note that as long as OPEC maintains compliance then there is
little reason to get too bearish," Reuters quoted GNI research as
saying in a note.

<HEADLINE> Nile Riparian States Urged to Take Action in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of Water
Resources Shiferaw Jaso Thursday urged the Nile River riparian
states to take action in cooperation for equal and effective use
of the mother river of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Closing a two-day conference of the 10 Nile River riparian
states, Shiferaw, also Chairman of the 7th Ordinary Session of the
Nile Council of Ministers (Nile COM), called on these states to
"move from planning to action."
</P>
<P>
"It is now time for action," the Ethiopian minister said.
"Within a very short period of time we shall have a fully
operational Nile Secretariat in place."
</P>
<P>
"We came together twice last year to discuss difficult issues
and to give instructions to our technical advisers in the Nile
Technical Advisory Committee," Shiferaw added.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Nile riparian states to "keep the process
moving with continued dialog and regular contact with one
another."
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference are ministers of water affairs
and their representatives from Nile Basin countries of Egypt, the
Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
The conference has adopted a report which the organizers said
is confidential.
</P>
<P>
The 7th annual meeting took place following the two
extraordinary council meetings held over the last six months in
Arusha, northern Tanzania, where Nile COM ministers launched the
Nile Basin Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The 10 Nile riparian states have been meeting annually in their
 continued search for a basis of cooperation for exploiting the
resources of the Nile.
</P>
<P>
The meetings are envisaged to come up with a final framework
cooperation agreement by the year 2002 at its 10th conference.

WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Department said
Thursday retail sales increased only 0.1 percent in April to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 239.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Demand for durable goods dropped 0.3 percent, due to an 0.8
percent decline in sales at auto dealers, which analysts
attributed mainly to the end of new year's discounts.
</P>
<P>
However, sales of nondurables, such as food and fuel, rose 0.4
percent, and excluding the jumpy autos category, overall retail
sales also climbed 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Compared with April last year, sales were up 7.5 percent.
</P>

Economists said the fundamentals driving consumer spending
remain positive, but higher gasoline prices may start to affect
consumers.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Extends Amnesty to Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Thursday agreed to extend an amnesty to Joseph Kony, leader of the
Lord Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, and all those being misled to
commit criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement when addressing a public rally in the
northern district of Gulu Thursday afternoon, a press release from
the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The presidential amnesty was in accordance with the wishes of
the majority of people in northern Uganda, it added.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that his amnesty to Kony and all the people he is
 misleading will hold good provided they come out to benefit from
it in a certain agreed time.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that his government will continue to
strengthen the army as a fallback measure in case the rebels do
not give up their criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
The problems Uganda has had since the mid-1960s are largely due
to political mismanagement by the past leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling National Resistance Movement has ushered into Uganda
an era of democracy which has enabled the government to solve a
number of teething problems.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Museveni also praised the government army for
having done its best to control banditry and pledged to the people
that it will do even better.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels, the main factor leading to the instability in
northern Uganda, began fighting the government in 1986 and they
are said to operate from bases in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They kill, maim, and abduct to destabilize the region and
tarnish the image of the current government.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian diplomat
said Thursday that China must get justice from the U.N. Security
Council after the NATO missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, told a press conference that "China must get justice from
the Security Council after the embassy bombing. This is a very
important and immediate task."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade with
more than three missiles last Friday, killing three Chinese and
wounding more than 20 others. However, the international community
saw it as insufficient the U.S. explanation that the attacks were
a mistake out of the use of out-dated maps.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on the Chinese Embassy were seen as a flagrant
violation of the sovereignty of China and international law.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign policy "remains unchanged" after the
government reshuffle, and the Russian policy on Kosovo also
"remains unchanged," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the (NATO) bombing stops, the political settlement is
impossible," said the Russian envoy, who stressed that NATO must
first stop the on-going air strikes against Yugoslavia, which
kicked off on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov made the remarks just minutes before the Security
Council entered into discussions on the crisis of Kosovo, which
broke out in February last year after ethnic Albanians have been
fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's mediation efforts on the Kosovo issue, the Russian
ambassador said, "We are not acting on anybody's side and we are
acting as an honest mediator trying to reach a just settlement."
</P>
<P>
Russia has been firmly against the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia and demanded an immediate end to the unilateral
military action against the Balkan country.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Development to Be Top Agenda at Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Peace and development are
among the main topics proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan for the Millennium Summit, according to his latest report to
the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the report, dated May 10 and released Thursday, Annan said
the overall theme should be the United Nations in the 21st century
and the sub-topics include peace and security, including
disarmament and development, including poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
He listed also human rights and strengthening the U.N. as the
sub-topics.
</P>
<P>
Since Annan first proposed the Millennium Summit, part of the
Millennium Assembly or the 55th session of the General Assembly
next year, the Assembly president called several sessions of
consultations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The role, function and tasks of the U.N. in the new century,
new challenges to multilateralism in the era of globalization, and
international cooperation were mentioned in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report is to feed new ideas to the further discussions.
</P>
<P>
He concludes that the third millennium presents a timely
opportunity for the only global organization, in terms of its
membership numbering 185 as much as of its areas of work, to
identify the challenges it faces in the future.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that it should provide an opportunity for a
moral recommitment to the purposes and principles laid down in the
Chamber of the United Nations and spur new political momentum for
the international cooperation and solidarity that the peoples of
the world increasingly demand," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Students Pay Respects To Chinese Journalists Who Died In Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Twelve students from the
International School of Beijing went to Xinhua News Agency and
Guangming Daily this afternoon with wreaths for the three Chinese
journalists who were killed in the NATO attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The students, aged 9 to 16, placed the wreaths beneath the
portraits of the three journalists, and then made three bows
together with Dr. George Paul Dulac, the director of the school.
</P>
<P>
Emily Sun, 16, the president of the school's student council,
said that they wished to express their deepest regrets to the
Chinese people and deepest sympathy for the families of those who
lost their lives in the tragic missile attack, on behalf of the
scholl's students and staff.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dulac explained that the students are the sons and
daughters of foreign diplomats and overseas business people, 8 of
them from the United States, 3 from Canada, and one from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Emmie Johnstone, 15, an American, said that she has been
studying in China for six years and loves China and called the
three deaths unfortunate, and said that she hopes never to see
such tragedies again.
</P>
<P>
When reporters asked an American boy about the impact of the
attack on the Chinese embassy on his daily life, he replied that
there hasn't been much because he has Chinese friends and they are
still friends.
</P>
<P>
Emily Sun said that that they value the close relations they
have with Chinese staff members and the general community in which
they live and hope that this will grow in the future.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dulac told reporters that the purpose of bringing the
wreaths was to give the students some understanding of the war and
to teach them to contribute to world peace when they grow up.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Not to Ignore May Riots Findings: Wiranto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense and Security
Minister Gen. Wiranto Friday said military authorities do not
ignore the findings of the joint fact-finding team (TGPF) on the
May 1998 riots and will always follow them up.
</P>
<P>
"We will not bury the findings and views of the TGPF. Neither
do we intend to ignore them. We will always be active," Wiranto
said after a ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, who is also the military commander, said his side
always clarifies inputs provided by the TGPF, especially regarding
the meeting at the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad)
headquarters on May 14 last year.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, there will be another clarification with
regard to that meeting on May 14, 1998. We will summon all those
who attended the meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored TGPF team presented its findings to
the media in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Their findings showed that nearly 1,300 people were killed
during the May 13-15 riots and that 52 women were raped with 14
more falling victim to rape with violence, 10 to sexual attacks,
and 9 to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
The team is urging the government to investigate a secret
meeting held at the Kostrad headquarters on May 14 last year, and
the possible role of former president Soeharto's son-in-law Lt.
Gen. Prabowo Subiyanto and former Jakarta military commander Maj.
Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoedin.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the National Commission for Elimination of
Violence Against Women has condemned the government for not
bothering to seriously investigate riots across the country,
especially last May's unrest, in which dozens of women were
killed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Sharply in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department reported
Friday that consumer prices increased in April by an unexpectedly
sharp 0.7 percent, the biggest monthly jump in nearly nine years.
</P>
<P>
The big advance was led by a record 6.1 percent spike in energy
prices, including a 15 percent leap in the price of gasoline. But
prices for many other products and services, from food and
clothing to housing and medical care, also increased.
</P>
<P>
The energy prices jump was the largest monthly gain since 1957,
the Department said. Gasoline prices was also the biggest monthly
gain since 1935.
</P>
<P>
The core prices, which exclude the volatile energy and food
categories and are the most closely watched by economists, rose
0.4 percent, the most since January of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The April leap in the Consumer Price Index followed smaller
increases of O.1 percent in both January and February, and 0.2
percent in March. It pushed the annual rate of inflation felt by
consumers so far this year to 3.3 percent, compared to a 1.6
percent rise for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, world economic turmoil had pulled energy prices down
sharply. So the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed this Spring to limit production of oil. Many economists
expected the prices to rise, because military fuel demands for the
conflict in Yugoslavia are tightening energy markets.
</P>
<P>
Prices of other goods also have been expected to rise as other
countries begin to recover from nearly two years of global
financial turmoil and world demand picks up. But April's price
hikes were sharper and more widespread than most economists had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Fuel oil prices also jumped 3.8 percent and electricity costs
rose 0.2 percent. So far this year, energy prices are rising at a
24.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Affected by climbing energy costs, transportation prices rose
2.4 percent, the most since 1981 and airline fares were up 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said energy prices jump may be temporary. But they
warned it could lead to more widespread inflation, since oil and
gas fuel so many industries.
</P>
<P>
The only category of products where prices declined was
communications equipment, including a 1.4 percent drop in the
price of computers.
</P>
<P>
Competition from discount-priced imports coming into the United
States from economically troubled countries is continuing to keep
prices in that category low.

<HEADLINE> Chinese International Politics Specialists Warn About U.S. Hegemony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese international
affairs specialists today said that the military action in
Yugoslavia by NATO is actually a strategic step by the U.S. to
achieve world hegemony in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars in the International Politics Department of
People's University in Beijing have written an article saying that
the multi-polarization of the world political structure will mean
a long and difficult process and that, if the U.S. achieves its
goal in Kosovo, the world will see a return to power politics.
</P>
<P>
They said that multi-polarization reflects democratic progress
in the world and that China should not only push the process of
the world political structure forward but should also to take a
position in the newly multipolarized world to help maintain world
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
They said that hegemony is the root of all threats to world
peace and stability and should be opposed with a principle of
reason, benefit, and moderation and that China should continue to
seek peace and development and establish a new world order based
on the five principles of peaceful co-existence to tie up the U.S.
's attempts at hegemony.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece supports all efforts for a
just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue based on
U.N. resolutions, visiting Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yannon
Kranidiotis said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
as "particularly constructive," the Greek official said he assured
the Cypriot president that Greece stood by the side of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis noted that there was no concrete proposal for a
solution of the Cyprus issue so far, adding that the
U.N. Security Council had put forward a proposal for a meeting
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession bid, the
Greek official said that full membership would also facilitate a
just solution to the political problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that the accession process is not an opportunistic
option for Cyprus, but a strategic choice, which holds the
potential for a just, viable solution of the Cyprus issue based
on the U.N. principles.
</P>

Kranidiotis, heading a 16-member delegation, arrived here
Thursday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Premature Babies May Face Brain Damage: Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Babies born more than five weeks
premature could be much more likely to suffer brain damage that
leads to behavioural and educational problems in adolescence,
British scientists suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at University College London have studied 72
adolescents born prematurely and other young adults who were
delivered at full term.
</P>
<P>
The premature babies chosen to take part were born after less
than 33 weeks of pregnancy. They had check-ups at intervals until
they were 14 or 15, when they were given a series of reading,
spelling and behavioural tests.
</P>
<P>
The overall results were compared with those of other 14- to
15-year-olds who were born after a full-term pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Of the 72 children who had been born prematurely, 40 had
abnormal scans, compared to one abnormal scan out of the 21
children born after a full-term pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
Another 15 adolescents in the premature group had scans showing
slight abnormalities, compared with five in the control group.
</P>
<P>
The most common abnormality among those who had been born
prematurely was in the brain part called the white matter, which
is involved in carrying signals between different areas of the
brain and between the brain and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the British medical journal The Lancet, the
researchers called on doctors to take steps to reduce the
likelihood of brain abnormalities in premature children.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Begins Family Planning Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing today cancelled the age
limit for having a child that has been in force for 8 years, at
the 10th session of the 11th Beijing People's Congress Standing
Committee that ended today.
</P>
<P>
Previously, a married woman in Beijing had to be at least 24 to
have a child, but the new Beijing Family Planning Regulations put
no such limitation, as long as a couple only have one child.
</P>
<P>
The reform is based on the low birth and mortality rate in the
city and is meant to make it easier for a couple to make a
decision about children and to improve population statistics in
the area, according to Xiao Yanjun, director of the Beijing
Municipal Family Planning Commission.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Dyslexia to Brain Abnormality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A new study by British scientists
has linked dyslexia to reduced activity in a primitive part of the
brain that controls movement, co-ordination and balance.
</P>
<P>
Dylexia is one of the most most common learning disorders,
affecting nearly one in 20 people. People with dyslexia often have
great difficulty learning to read, write and spell.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the established view has been that dyslexia is the
result of a problem in the highly developed language centers of
the brain found in the cerebral cortex.
</P>
<P>
However, the new research, by psychologists from the Sheffield
University, England, indicates that the problem is linked to
abnormalities in one of the most primative areas of the brain, the
cerebellum.
</P>
<P>
Situated at the base of the brain, where the spinal cord is
attached, the cerebellum controls motor functions and is common to
humans and lower animals.
</P>
<P>
In their study, the researchers compared the brain activity of
six normal and six dyslexic adults using a scanning technique
called positron emission tomography.
</P>
<P>
Their results, published in The Lancet medical journal, showed
that cerebellum was less active in the dyslexic group than
non-dyslexic ones when they were asked to learn a new task.
</P>
<P>
"Our findings support the hypothesis that a substantial
proportion of dyslexic children have a cerebellar deficit that
adversely affects the learning of new skills and the performance
of automatic, over-learned skills," the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> China Moves into Sudirman Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China is on the brink of winning
their third Sudirman Cup title when they defeated arch-rivals
South Korea 3-1 after four games in a semifinal match here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese shuttlers won the men's singles and doubles, mixed
doubles, but lost the women's singles, in which the result was
well beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
China started their campaign through the mixed doubles when Ge
Fei and Liu Yong rallied from first set down to edge Kim Dong Moon
and Ra Kyung Min 10-15, 15-10 and 15-13.
</P>
<P>
With one point in hands, former world champion Sun Jun, top
player in the Chinese team, gave a performance well below his par,
winning the men's singles after one set down at 9-15, 15-6 and 15-
7 against Ahn Jae Chang.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that China would have the match at 3-0
after the third game in which Gong Zhichao met South Korean Kim Ji
Hyun. In their seven previous meetings since 1997, Gong Zhichao
had a dominating winning record with five victories and two
defeats.
</P>
<P>
However, Gong Zhichao, silver medalist at the last Asian Games
in Bangkok, Thailand, met a strong challenge from Kim Ji Hyun, and
lost the game at 9-11, 11-1 and 3-11.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's doubles, China's Zhang Jun and Yu Jinghao
played well above standard, trouncing South Korena duo Lee Dong
Soo and Yoo Yong Sung with ease at 15-3, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the two pairs met each other at a
major tournament.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles had been a crucial game for both China and
South Korea, which finished second in the last Sudirman Cup
championships in Glasgow, Scotland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
After playing to a deadlock of 1-1 draw in the first two sets,
South Korean duo of Kim Dong Moon and Ra Kyung Min had a flying
start in the third and final one, leading their Chinese rivals 8-3.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of several errors by Kim and Ra, Liu Yong and
Ge Fei trailed the score to 8-13 and 11-13.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the point of live-or-die, Kim and Ra made successive
mistakes when serving and the Chinese shuttlers jumped to lead the
score 14-13 and took the game through smash by Ge Fei, women's
doubles Olympic champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Liu Xinmin attributed the pair's win to strong
mentallity. "The Chinese pair are at the same level with the
South Koreans, Only those who have strong metallity in the match
could win," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Acting PM Calls for Technocrat Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Acting Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin said on Friday that Russia needs a cabinet of
technocrats to end its socioeconomic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, nominated premier Wednesday when President Boris
Yeltsin fired Yevgeny Primakov and his cabinet, indicated that he
does not think it expedient to form a coalition government under
the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, is set to discuss
Stepashin's nomination next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members "do not have the right to serve the interests
of one political organization or another," Stepashin said.
Attempts toward this end will be rigorously opposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin promised that the "backbone of the cabinet will
undoubtedly remain and there will be no overhaul," but both acting
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and acting Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev told the press they got no words that they would remain
in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Stepashin named three
key tasks for the government.
</P>
<P>
First, it must "guarantee the speedy approval of the package of
economic bills drafted by the government of Yevgeny Primakov and
supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
</P>
<P>
If the bills are not passed or if the new cabinet is not
approved, all existing and future understandings with
international financial institutions will be threatened, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The other two tasks were to draft the budget for the year 2000,
and the steady fulfillment of the current budget in keeping with
its quarterly schedule.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Steady Tax Revenue Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China scored continuous growth in
tax revenue during the first four months of the year and the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT) urged localities to crack down on
tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The SAT announced here today that the country's tax revenues
totaled 314.866 billion yuan for the period, up 20.8 percent over
the same period of last year, accounting for one-third of the
planned annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
Central tax revenues rose 24.1 percent to 174.145 billion yuan,
while local tax revenues rose 17.1 percent to 140.721 billion yuan
in the period.
</P>
<P>
A SAT official said that the general situation of taxation was
good in the first four months of the year. He attributed the
increase to sound economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to remarkable growth in industrial production and
retails of consumer goods, industrial and commercial taxes
increased by 18.9 percent and 11.3 percent respectively in the
period, accounting for more than 44 percent of the country's total
tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
China's crack down upon smuggling has shown a clear effect on
the economy. During January to April, tax revenue from the customs
more than doubled on the year-on-year basis to 32.233 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, taxation offices at all levels have stepped
up efforts to crack down on tax evasion, collecting 8.8 billion
yuan in overdue tax payment, or 47.9 percent more than in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the rising trend of enterprises in
arrears of taxation has been effectively checked.
</P>
<P>
However, he predicts that the year-on-year growth rate of tax
revenue will be lower in the latter half of the year, because tax
revenue was much lower in the first half than in the latter half
of last year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researcher Finds Cause of Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian Researcher has found a
common protein called the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) that
cause diabetes, the National Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the disease was discovered by Dr. Ji-Won Yoon, an
immunologist and virologist at the University of Calgary. His
discovery is widely expected to lead to a diabetes vaccine, and
scientists say it could dramatically boost the mediocre success
rate of pancreas transplants.
</P>
<P>
For years scientists have known Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-
dependent diabetes, could be diagnosed when a patient tested
positive for antibodies to GAD, making them a good "marker" for
the disease. Antibodies are part of the immune system that attack
certain molecules. Roughly 80% of Type 1 diabetics have these GAD
antibodies, compared with about five percent of the general
population.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yoon decided to see what would happen when he rid the
pancreatic cells of laboratory mice of GAD altogether.
</P>
<P>
"None of the mice developed diabetes," he reported.
</P>
<P>
"If we suppress GAD in the Pancreas cells, then we can stop
diabetes. So our finding means a new therapy," said the researcher.
</P>
<P>
After discovering GAD's role in the disease, Dr. Yoon's
research team created a vaccine by putting the gene that expressed
the GAD protein into a harmless virus. When injected into three-
week old mice, the vaccine prevented them from developing
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
"Just one injection did it," said Dr. Yoon. "So our finding
means a new therapy for diabetes."
</P>
<P>
The GAD discovery could also lead to improved transplants.
Currently when new pancreatic tissue is implanted in a diabetic
patient, the patient's immune system destroys it within five to 10
years. By using genetic therapy on any donated tissue to suppress
GAD production, it would prevent an immune response in the
recipient.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yoon's team tested the theory by implanting GAD-suppressed
tissue into diabetic mice. "The mice have had no recurrence of
diabetes and no destruction of transplanted tissue," Dr. Yoon said.

MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz authorities have arrested an
Uzbek national at Manas Airport for attempting to smuggle
plutonium on a flight to the United Arab Emirates, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The radioactive substance was loaded in a rubber container, but
even its surface showed a deadly level of radiation, the news

</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Tahir Naizov, said he received the
plutonium at the airport from a stranger and was told to fetch the
material to the United Arab Emirates for a fee of 16,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of plutonium was not immediately known, but an
investigation is under way.
</P>
<P>
Plutonium is a radiological poison, specifically absorbed by
bone marrow. It is used especially in the highly fissionable
isotope Pu 239 as a reactor fuel and in nuclear weapons.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Bo Baohua, the president of China
Travel Service (CTS), one of China's largest travel agencies, says
that he felt a sense of relief when he got the report that a
British group of 300 people will visit China next month as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
He says that he was worried that overseas visitors would cancel
their plans to visit China because of safety concerns after the
protests against the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British governments told their citizens that it
would be wise to postpone travel to China and Bo and his colleges
were busy over the last few days telling foreign visitors that the
situation in China is all right and that the nation's policy is to
protect overseas visitors.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in talks
with his Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana Arango at Beijing's
Great Hall of the People this afternoon, said that NATO wantonly
attacked the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in an act of
humiliation, a trampling on the U.N. Charter and international
relations, a gross infringement on Chinese sovereignty.

Pastrana, who arrived Thursday for a three-day state visit,
said that the Colombian government expressed its support to the
Chinese government and people.
</P>

Jiang called the NATO act a rare atrocity in the history of
international relations and one of hegemony and power politics and
said that the Chinese government and people expressed utmost
indignation and condemned the barbarous act. The Chinese
government issued a solemn statement lodging a strong protest,
demanding that NATO bear all responsibilities, he said.

government's stand, demonstrating their patriotic enthusiasm and
lofty sense of justice and that this reflects the glorious

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Restructure Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China is planning a major shakeup
of its fledging automotive industry by restructuring the existing
13 biggest auto makers into 3-4 internationally competitive group
companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it may also foster five or six specialized
automotive enterprises. The move will cut the number of auto
makers in the country by more than one third.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Machinery Industry (SAMI) has
already drawn up a draft restructuring plan to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Yang Hua, director of the Department of Planning and
Development of SAMI, said that as China is expected to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the Chinese government must push
forward the consolidation of local automotive companies, which are
much weaker and smaller than foreign giants.
</P>
<P>
Now China has some 120 automotive companies, turning out 1.6
million automotive a year.
</P>
<P>
Local industrial experts said that the planned restructuring
will involve more people, companies and institutions than the
major reform General Motors carried out in the 1980s, though the
total output of these Chinese companies is merely one-seventh of
GM's.
</P>
<P>
A SAMI official said that the local automotive industry has been
studying measures to counter foreign competition since 1992. SAMI
has already set competitiveness standards for local auto companies.
</P>
<P>
China's automotive industry is improving technology and
efficiency. During the first three months of the year, the auto
industry earned 810 million yuan in profits, as the profit-to-
sales ratio reached 1.9 percent. Auto sales value was up 13.9
percent over the same period of last year, reaching 42.6 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jianping, director general of the Department of Industry
Management of SAMI, said that increasing competition has helped
squeeze inefficient auto companies out of the market in the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
The top 13 auto makers now account for more than 92 percent of
the country's total output, while the remaining 100-plus companies
account for less than eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between winners and losers is widening," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
According to SAMI statistics, the most profitable automotive
company in the country -- Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation
(Group)-- made 820 million yuan in profits from January to March.
On the other hand, the money-losing China Heavy-Duty Truck
Corporation (Group) lost 232 million yuan in the same period. The
gap of profits between the two companies exceeded 1.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Automotive industry is a major topic in the discussion of
China's accession to WTO. Zhou said that China is trying to gain
eight years of a protection period for its auto industry after
joining WTO. He said that the government will give favorable
treatment to local automotive companies in terms of policy, funds
and operation environment so as to improve their standards of
technology, development and product quality.
</P>
<P>
"If we make adequate preparations for the entry into WTO, the
local automotive industry will not be overwhelmed by foreign
competition. The impact will be big, but we can tide it over,"
Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Selection of Macao Chief Executive Candidate Arouses Media Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The selection of the candidate for
the first chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) scheduled for Saturday has aroused great media
interest, according to an official source here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 journalists representing 110 newspapers and TV
and radio stations from Macao, Hong Kong, the Chinese inland,
Southeast Asia, the United States, Britain, France and some other
parts of the world have applied for coverage of the selection,
said the official at the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee
for the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Cazer, a reporter of the French newspaper Figaro-
Magazine, said that his newspaper was going to print a special
page on Sunday on Macao's return to China and the selection of the
candidate for the first chief executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
The magazine will also carry a special report on the above
issues, Cazer said.
</P>
<P>
After more than 400 years of colonial rule by Portugal, Macao
will return to the motherland on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that all preparations for Saturday's
selection have been completed and the 199 members of the Selection
Committee for the first Macao SAR government will select between
the two candidates, Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au Chong Kit, by
casting secret votes.
</P>
<P>
He said the third plenary session of the Selection Committee
will be held at 10:00 a.m. Saturday at the Macao Tourism and
Activity Center.
</P>
<P>
"The selection of the candidate for the first chief executive
of the Macao SAR marks a new application of the principle of 'one
country, two systems' following the smooth return of Hong Kong (to
the motherland in July 1997)," the official said.
</P>
<P>
And it is the first time in hundreds of years that the head of
Macao will be selected through democratic elections and as such,
the selection is of special significance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in HK Grow 11.1 Pct in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in Hong Kong for
April this year were 897,652, an increase of 11.1 percent over the
same month last year, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The momentum of the growth has kept for nine months since last
July due to the economic improvement in some countries, the
efforts of the association and other favorable factors, the HKTA
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, hotel room occupancy was 80 percent, up from
76 percent in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newly released statistics show that leading the shorthaul
markets' increase in April was Indonesia, with a rise of 83.4
percent in arrivals. That was followed by the Republic of Korea
and Thailand with their visitor arrivals up 38.8 percent and 33.9
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland registered a 25.4 percent increase in
arrivals, helped by the favorable outbound policies on the
mainland and an increase in flights.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from the longhaul markets such as Canada and France
also increased.
</P>
<P>
Markets showing a decline in April included Singapore, the
Philippines and Germany with the drops being attributed to
increased competition and, in the case of the Philippines, a rise
in the airport departure tax.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, said she was happy
with the sustained growth in visitor arrivals in the face of the
strong competition and sluggish economies in some countries.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA will continue to work together to ensure steady and
stable growth in arrivals, she said.

<HEADLINE> China-made Exchange System Inaugurated in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The first 6,000 lines of digital
exchange made and installed by Chinese producers were inaugurated
on a trial basis on Friday in Rawalpindi, Islamabad's twin city.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a package installation of a total of 280,000
telephone lines covering 15 major cities of Pakistan by a
consortium of China Wanbao company and Zhongxing Telecom Ltd, one
of the leading telecom equipment producers in China.
</P>
<P>
The 95 million U.S. dollar project is the first major telecom
contract Chinese producers have ever won abroad. The Chinese
consortium was awarded the contract in October 1998 in a
competition with multinational telecom giants including Simens,
Alkatel, Erricsson and Nokia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration ceremony, Pakistani Minister of
Communication Raja Nadir Pervaiz Khan said that with the
introduction of the Chinese switching system, Pakistan has entered
into "an era of sophisticated digitalization" which will provide
the Pakistani people the telecom facilities "at par with the
developed world."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan expressed the belief that
the Chinese consortium's success in Pakistan will make an
excellent beginning for greater cooperation between the two
countries in the field of high-tech information industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Chinese consortium will complete the
whole project by July 2000 and hand over it to Pakistan and pass
the know-how relating to digital switching technology to the
Pakistani side within five years.

<HEADLINE> Value of Manufacturers' Orders-on-hand Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The value of manufacturers'
orders-on-hand for local production in March this year saw a 20
percent decrease over a year earlier, according to a monthly
survey released by the Census and Statistics Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fabricated metal products industry had the most significant
fall in the value of orders-on-hand in March compared with the
same month 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by the plastic, electrical, textiles,
electronic products industries and the wearing apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
However, a slight increase in the value of orders-on-hand was
recorded in the printing and publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman noted that orders-on-hand
remained on a downtrend in the most recent months.
</P>
<P>
As a leading indicator of the performance of domestic exports,
the weak performance of the orders-on-hand position might point to
a further decline in domestic exports in the near term, he said.

PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The British Grand Prix will go back
to Brands Hatch, England from the year 2002 as the Formula One
failed to reach an agreement with the current host Silverstone.
</P>
<P>
Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone said on Friday that he
offered the owners of Silverstone, the British Racing Drivers Club,
the opportunity to renew the contract but they felt they were "not

Brands Hatch Leisure Group, the owners of the Brands Hatch
circuit, about 50 kilometers southeast of London, said they signed
an exclusive six-year contract with Formula One Administration

</P>
<P>
The owners of Brand Hatch said they are committed to 20 million
pounds (about 30 million U.S. dollars) to improve the track and
its facilities to bring it up to current Formula One standards.
</P>
<P>
Silverstone, about 100 kilometers north of London, has hosted
the British Grand Prix since 1987. Before that the race alternated

<HEADLINE> Son Of Journalist Killed In Yugoslavia Following In Mother's Footsteps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cao Lei, the son of Shao Yunhuan,
the Xinhua corespondent who was killed in the NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy, entered Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU),
his mother's alma mater, today to study Serbian and said he
probably will become a journalist like his mother.
</P>
<P>
More than 450 college teachers and students gathered this
afternoon to welcome him as Professor Chen Naifang announced the
decision. Cao's mother majored in the Serbian language here 25
years ago. Xu Xinghu, of Guangming Daily, who was also killed in
the attack, was a graduate of the school.
</P>
<P>
Cao's father was also seriously injured in the attack and Cao
showed the maturity of a person well beyond his 19 years. He said
at the welcoming ceremony that because his parents were both
graduates of the school he had dreamed of going there too and that
he hoped his mother would be happy with his decision.
</P>
<P>
Cao went to the University of Belgrade last September to study
Serbian but transferred to Bucharest after only half a year when
the NATO air attacks began. He said that his choice of Serbian was
influenced by his parents who had been classmates, even though
many other universities and colleges had welcomed him. "My parents
always wanted me to be hones and to have integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The last time he visited his mother was a few hours before the
Chinese embassy was bombed, when everyone in the embassy came to
say good-bye to him as he was leaving for Romania. "Take care and
never be slack in your studies," were his mother's last words.
</P>
<P>
Li Shimin, who taught both Shao and Xu, spoke for all faculty
members in his welcoming speech when he said, "Now I shall become
the teacher of my student's son, and I hope that he is as
excellent as his mother."
</P>
<P>
Beijing Foreign Studies University is the only Chinese
university that teaches Serbian.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prof. Says Human Rights No replacement For Sovereignty (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The pursuit of power politics and
hegemony by the NATO forces because "human rights" are above
sovereignty is bound to meet with greater opposition from peace-
loving people, according to Professor Liu Wenzong, of Foreign
Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's wanton and indiscriminate bombing of
Yugoslavia for the past 50 days or more has killed a significant
number of innocent civilians and destroyed a great deal of
infrastructure, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.
</P>
<P>
There was even a barbaric attack on the Chinese Embassy, which
fully revealed the true nature of their "human rights" and their
real intent. Liu pointed out that the so-called "human rights" is,
in fact, synonymous with hegemony, aggression. Replacing
sovereignty with "human rights," Liu said, is totally unacceptable
and that sovereignty is the supreme power in international law, he
said, meaning that a country may deal with its internal affairs
and foreign affairs independently.
</P>
<P>
International law does not allow a country to infringe on
another's sovereignty no matter what the excuse, he said. If a
country has no sovereignty, it will be a colony.
</P>
<P>
The current barbaric bombing of Yugoslavia reminds people of
the attack on Beijing by the eight western powers in 1900 and
their burning of the city, he said.

<HEADLINE> Prof. Says "Human Rights" No Replacement For Sovereignty (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia is a clear violation of the U.N.
Charter, which gives priority to the sovereignty of member
countries, he said, and that it emphasizes the equal sovereignty
of all countries and protects the interests of member states.
</P>
<P>
It says that disputes should be solved through peaceful means
and it protects the territorial integrity and political
independence of member states. But still NATO persists in using
force against Yugoslavia, he said, and that the principle of
sovereignty is the basis of the United Nations and without it the
U.N. would have collapsed long ago.
</P>
<P>
No part of the U.N. Charter, including that on human rights,
can surpass the principle of sovereignty, he said. Human rights is
actually the internal matter of a country and can only be resolved
by the government and people of the country, he added, and the use
of force against a country in the guise of "human rights" violates
all international laws and international relations norms.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Distribute 100,000 Tons of Wheat in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
plans to distribute 100,000 tons of wheat and other food
commodities to 1.2 million "vulnerable people" across Afghanistan
in 1999, a WFP official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is estimated to cost 53 million U.S. dollars,
is assisted by the United States, Japan, Canada, Finland and the
Netherlands, WFP Country Director for Afghanistan M.A. Sackett
told a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan includes the subsidized sale of bread to
420,000 people in Kabul and Jalalabad. The WFP is providing 80 to
90 percent subsidy on bread to these people.
</P>
<P>
The program, he said, also envisages emergency food
distributions to people in central highlands around Bamiyan, to
earthquake victims and to people in Badakshan province during the
harsh winter months.
</P>
<P>
Life saving food is also being provided to workers who repair
drinking water supply systems, construct flood protection
structures, undertake essential sanitation and drainage
activities, build shelter for returning refugees and the
internally displaced, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food is being provided to hospitals, clinics,
orphanages and other institutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
"WFP food is provided to vulnerable people in areas controlled
both by the Taliban and the Northern Alliance -- the criterion is
people's need," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Colombian entrepreneurs
signed a contract here on Friday to establish a plant in Colombia,
with 4.50 million U.S. dollars worth of investment to produce
tires for motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
The Wuxi Rubber Group Corp. of China and the Villes Group of
Colombia signed the agreement at a Sino-Colombian Seminar on
Investment and Trade. The joint venture will have 3.75 million U.S.
dollars in registered capital, 80 percent of that held from the
Chinese in equipment and technical software.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Colombian business people, who came with Colombian
President Andres Pastrana Arango here Thursday night for a three-
day state visit, attended the seminar. They discussed cooperation
in seafood, precious stones, cigars, minerals, coffee, automobile
parts, and electric appliances at the seminar, according to
officials from the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), the organizer of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president said at the seminar that Colombia wants
to be a gateway between China and Latin America and that his
country welcomes Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT Vice-President Liu Wenjie said that China greatly values
its trade and investment relations with Latin America and
encourages its firms to invest there. China also welcomes
investors and traders from Colombia and other Latin American
nations.
</P>
<P>
China and Colombia have had relatively smooth growth in
bilateral trade and investment since 1980 when the two opened
diplomatic relations, but the trade volume is low and was worth
only 100 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China also has 10 ventures in Colombia in manufacturing, mining,
and fisheries, with total investment worth 5.6 million U.S.
dollars, while Colombia has a coffee factory in Zhuhai in China's
Guangdong Province, with total investment worth about 300,000 U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton redoubled his efforts to defend his
policy on Yugoslavia on Thursday, acknowledging that Americans may
be frustrated by the duration of the bombing campaign but urging
them to stay focused on the conflict and "pay the price of time."
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Justice Department alleged Thursday that American
Airlines slashed fares and added flights to snuff out low-fare
competitors that threatened its near-monopoly at the Dallas-Fort
Worth airport -- only to raise prices after the new airlines gave
up.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a clear sign of the strains placed on the German
Government by the Kosovo conflict, the environmentalist Green
party broke ranks with its coalition partners and other Western
governments on Thursday, calling for a "limited halt" to the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton acknowledged Thursday night that he has
been concerned that Vice President Al Gore's Presidential campaign
was off to a sluggish start. But Clinton insisted that he still
expected Gore to win his party's nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. trade officials, escalating their dispute with Europe
over food, plan to ask the World Trade Organization Friday to
authorize about 200 million U.S. dollars in sanctions against the
European Union for failing to lift its ban on U.S. hormone-treated
beef.
</P>
<P>
-- Boeing Co. said it will cut as many as 7,000 jobs at its St.
Louis military-aircraft operations by mid-2001, or about 35
percent of its employment at the site, because of dwindling orders
for its older lines of fighter and attack jets.

<HEADLINE> Victims Of Embassy Attack Have Right To Seek Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cai Shixin, a Chinese-Canadian
lawyer who has worked in Canada for over 10 years, says that the
victims of NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia and
their relatives have the right to sue the governments of NATO
member states.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO member states should bear the brunt of the
blame under international law. The United States, the United
Kingdom, and Canada have a common law system and Germany has a
civil law system, but they all say that if one person's life or
property is damaged by another person or government, he or she has
the right to seek compensation, he said, and pointed to the Jews
in the US and Canada who sued the German, British, and Swiss
governments after World War II.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of the 3 dead and over 20 injured have the right
to take civil action in American, British, Canadian, and German
courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He that it is normal in the West for a citizen to sue the
government and that the victims in this attack who are demanding
that NATO compensate them will not affect diplomatic relations
between China and NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
It will be necessary to face difficulties like financial
problems during the lawsuit, but Cai says he hopes that Chinese
around the world can unite to help the victims gain their legal
compensation and demonstrate their abilities to use the law to
safeguard their rights.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Prepares for Another Belgrade Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian special envoy for the
Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, returned from Finland Friday where
he and President Martti Aahtisaari agreed to visit Belgrade
together.
</P>
<P>
The date for the trip to Yugoslavia will be set next week,
probably after Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Chernomyrdin as saying in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Before the Belgrade trip, Chernomyrdin, Aahtisaari, and U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will meet again.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, expected to be held in Helsinki within the next
few days, and the Belgrade trip, aims to produce a final agreement
between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the NATO
leadership on the principles for a political settlement on Kosovo,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin again urged the NATO alliance to stop the bomb and
missile attacks on Yugoslavia, which entered the 52nd day Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a high-ranking Russian official
condemned the latest NATO attacks Thursday night on civilians in
the village of Korisa, southwest Kosovo, where 50 residents were
reportedly killed and more then 50 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"Reports on the deaths of civilians in Kosovo is another
graphic confirmation of the aggressive nature of NATO operations
in Yugoslavia," Tass quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to stop the bombing raids on Yugoslavia and to
switch over to a search for ways of a political settlement of the
Balkans crisis," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Accuses Portugal for Receiving UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The official Angola News Agency
Friday accused the Portuguese parliament of receiving two major
members of the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), saying it infringed the U.N.
resolutions sanctioning the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Pedro Feist, deputy speaker of the
Portuguese parliament, met Isaac Wambembe, Carlos Morgado, two
UNITA politicians Thursday. Also present were members of
parliament from the People's Party and the Social Party.
</P>
<P>
The two UNITA politicians used to be UNITA MPs of Angola's
National Assembly. However, they were dismissed from their posts
last September since they refused to sever relations with UNITA
Chairman Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place during the three-day visit of Robert
Fowller, president of the United Nations Sanction Committee, in
Angola. Therefore, its intention is obviously to challenge the
Angolan government and the U.N. Security Council resolutions, said
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Fowller arrived in Luanda on May 11, at a time when the U.N.
sanctions failed to restrain UNITA's war capacity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some countries have violated U.N. resolutions
time and again, and the United Nations is going to send them to
the international court.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has approved three resolutions
sanctioning UNITA since 1993, to force the rebel movement abide by
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include oil and arms embargo, prohibiting UNITA
leaders' visit abroad, closing UNITA's offices in foreign
countries, and banning UNITA's export of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, Angola's former colonial power, used to work along
with Russia and the United States as the troika observer states of
the Angola peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government has accused UNITA of being
responsible for renewing the civil war in the already war-ravaged
southern African country, but its parliament has insisted on the
opposite, protesting many times against the dismissal of UNITA MPs
by the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Tourists Safe in China: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China has reiterated that there is
no incident of hurting U.S. tourists in China despite protests
against the U.S.-led NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will protect the safety of all
foreigners, including citizens in the United States and other NATO
member nations, according to Wei Xiao'an, a spokesman with the
National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the statement in response to an alarm decree issued by
the U.S. State Department on May 9.
</P>
<P>
The decree spread the rumor that U.S. citizens and business
activities are disturbed in China, and alleged the possibility of
more demonstrations and other serious incidents that could hurt U.
S. citizens and their interests.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. tourists thus canceled their travel to China, Wei
noted, and pointed out that this is sheer misleading to U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the speech of Vice-President Hu Jintao on May 9
that China would continue the reform and open-up drive, and
protect the diplomatic institutions and personnel of foreign
countries, as well as foreigners engaged in business, education
and culture activities in China.
</P>
<P>
Wei reiterated that China will put the safety of foreign
tourists and their property under effective protection.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana Arango in Beijing's Great Hall
of the People here this morning and said that the visit will open
a new chapter in Sino-Colombian relations.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that Colombia's government and people support the
Chinese government and people in their stand on the Chinese
embassy attack in Yugoslavia and that this is the view of the Rio
Group.
</P>
<P>
Li said the wanton NATO attack was a blatant infringement on
Chinese sovereignty, an affront to China's dignity, a rare
atrocity in the history of international relations and an act of
hegemony and power politics. President Jiang Zemin's speech on
Thursday comprehensively expounded the Chinese government's stand
on the matter, he said, and it was the voice of the Chinese people
of all ethnic groups in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese held demonstrations nationwide to express their
indignation and to protest the brutal act, he said.

Li said that the incident was a catastrophe for the Chinese,
but it also makes them understand the hypocrisy of democracy and
human rights of the American style, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable for us to demand that the truth of the
incident be told and that those responsible for the attack be
dealt with severely," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, there are some strange stories about how China
doesn't want to punish those responsible for the tragedy because
of its entry into the World Trade Organization," he said, "but
these people look down on the Chinese government and people. China
doesn't trade its principles," he said.

Li said that Chinese leaders have repeatedly stated the Chinese
government's principle on the Kosovo crisis and that the core of
that is that the prerequisite of any solution is an immediate halt
to the bombing. No political solution can be discussed otherwise
and any solution should have the Yugoslavia's approval.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the essential of the U.N. Charter and its member
states are equal and that no country should interfere in the
internal affairs of other countries, but that the U.S. classifies
countries into four types with its own values and criteria and can
randomly strike the fourth class, rogue states, by any means, even
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of World War II, Li said, the United Nations and
the U.N. Charter have demonstrated the firm will of the world
people to wipe out the threat of war and their lofty ideals for a
just and rational international order, but the United States has a
pragmatic attitude towards the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current circumstances, we should be on alert about
the United States using the U.N. as a tool for hegemony and power
politics," Li said.

Pastrana said that he believes that no development can be
achieved without peace and that no development means no peace.

<P>
Li spoke about the friendly and cooperative relations between
China and Colombia and said that friendly contacts and cooperation
between the two parliaments were an important part of those
relations and that the two parliaments have had frequent exchanges
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the visit of Emilio Martinez Rosales, president
of Columbia's House of Representatives, and the upcoming visit of
Cao Zhi, vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, to Columbia
and said that these exchanges all give impetus to bilateral
relations.
</P>

Pastrana said that the two countries have many similarities and
that he believes his visit will boost the growth of bilateral
cooperation. He also discussed the domestic situation in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Deal Made to Ensure Keegan Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan finally could almost
fulfill a lifetime dream of managing his country on a full-time
basis as the Football Association are understood to have reached
agreement with Fulham over a compensation package.
</P>
<P>
Fulham owner Mohamed Al Fayed had claimed a 1 million pound pay-
off to make up for the 14 months remaining on Keegan's contract at
the West London club.
</P>
<P>
However, it now seems that a compromise deal with the club has
been agreed by FA bosses, who have also agreed terms with Keegan.
</P>
<P>
A news conference will be held on Friday afternoon in Lancaster
Gate to unveil the new England boss.
</P>
<P>
Keegan is likely to have been offered a three-year contract,
seeing him take the helm until after the 2002 World Cup finals on
an annual salary of up to 750,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who currently took the England post on a part-time
basis for four matches until June, had originally stated that
there was no way he would be leaving Fulham.
</P>
<P>
But it dawned on the former England captain that he cannot see
out the contract with Fulham while managing the English side.
</P>
<P>
Although he recently expressed a wish to end his contract at
Fulham in some capacity, he later said that it would be in the
club's best interests to hire a new manager.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Undersecretary
Mila Fernandez Friday said the country still enjoys a low and slow
transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
Fernandez made the statement in a press conference that kicked
off the activities of the 16th International AIDS Candlelight
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
But she said, "We should not be complacent as the knowledge,
attitude and practices (of the people) are still low and still
predispose us to an impending HIV explosion if we don't act now."
</P>
<P>
Based on the HIV/AIDS registry, there has been a total of 1,201
HIV cases in the country recorded from 1984 to March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Out of this total, about a fourth, or 374, were recorded as
full blown AIDS cases and 190 have already died.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Department of Health said the most common mode
of transmission remains sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
The highest age group among the HIV positive in the country
remains those from 19 to 49 years old, they said. More males are
affected with a ratio of six males to four females.

<HEADLINE> HK SFC to Raise Transparency, Disclosure Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Hong Kong
Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said Friday that SFC will
improve transparency and disclosure standards to ensure that Hong
Kong stock and futures markets are truly level playing fields.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at a luncheon organized by the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, SFC Chairman Andrew
Sheng said: "The world is moving toward a greater disclosure-based
market and also moving toward a greater disclosure-based
regulatory system."
</P>
<P>
During his speech titled "Transparency and Disclosure in the
Age of Global Market," Sheng said that if Asian economies want to
play in the global economy they have to raise the disclosure and
transparency standards to global levels.
</P>
<P>
One lesson from the Asia financial crisis is that people panic
because they don't have the sufficient information to assess their
risks. "We are dealing with a global financial market with local
laws and regulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We begin to realize that, globally, market regulation is
moving toward disclosure-based regulation," Sheng noted. "The
reason for this is very straight forward -- no regulators, by
definition, can be smarter than the market."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the regulators can not protect every single
investor, but they can only ensure that as soon as their
information was disclosed the investors will have the information
to judge for themselves the risks and returns," he added.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets are not just networks, but they are also
networks across which property rights are transferred, Sheng said.
They must be transferred clearly, otherwise, there would be
counterpart risks, credit risks and market risks.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SFC, as a regulator in Hong Kong, will ensure
that the property rights are protected within the law.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasingly tense international competition, Hong
Kong's markets must have high transparency, low transactions cost,
high liquidity, low volatility, good quality information, timely
disclosures and efficient access to information, Sheng said.

<HEADLINE> Macao People Pin High Hope on Chief of Future SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) have said they would like to choose a
chief executive of the future SAR who is able to take Macao into a
promising new century.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee is scheduled to select the first chief
executive of the Macao SAR Saturday. The SAR will be set up on the
same day as Macao returns to China on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Pai Wan Leung, who is the oldest selection member at the age of
93, said Macao is a special society and the future chief executive
of the Macao SAR should not literally copy Western management
experience.
</P>
<P>
U Wai Ang, president of the Association of Chinese Students of
Macao, said she expects the future chief executive to be "
energetic, honest, bold and decisive" and should have the ability
to make good his promises.
</P>
<P>
Tong Chi Kin, who is also a member of the Preparatory Committee
for the Macao SAR, said, "Macao people governing Macao" means that
the chief executive is utterly different from the past colonial
rulers and instead should be "a leader of our own."
</P>
<P>
"I hope the chief executive will implement the principle of
'one country, two systems', proceed from the overall interests of
Macao and observe the Macao Basic Law," Tong said.
</P>
<P>
Ieong Sau Man, who is also a deputy to the National People's
Congress from Macao, said, "The most important task of the chief
executive is to earnestly implement the Basic Law and stick to
'Macao people governing Macao' and a 'high degree of autonomy'
under the principle of 'one country, two systems'."
</P>
<P>
As the chairwoman of the Council of the Macao Women's
Federation, Ieong also hoped that the future Macao SAR government
will create more opportunities for women to participate in
political, economic and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ng Si Meng, director of the Macao Association of Neighborhood
Communities, said the future chief executive should address four
major issues: the public order, the economy, anti-corruption and
government administration efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Leong Vai Tac, an entrepreneur, said the chief executive should
have knowledge and patience, as many problems in Macao after its
return to the motherland will be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
"The chief executive should, first of all, set the direction
for the future and only then will the public be able to work for
the government efforts," Leong said.

JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The total export of Indonesian
non-oil commodities to 24 countries and areas in the first quarter
of the year fell by 8.17 percent from 32.45 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998 to 29.61 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A monthly report published by the Trade and Industry Department
here on Friday said the figure explained the weakness of non-oil
export performance caused by lower demand from importer countries
and the financial problems suffered by local exporters.
</P>
<P>
The destination countries and areas where Indonesian
commodities suffered decreases are the United States, Singapore,
Japan, Hong Kong and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The other countries are China, Germany, Malaysia and Britain.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the non-oil exports to Thailand, Belgium,
Australia, Italy, Canada, Egypt and France increased by 0.9 to

<HEADLINE> NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy Recalled (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dong Jian, 22, the youngest member of the embassy staff,
escaped from the danger area after the missiles struck. When he
saw that a fire engine sent by the Yugoslav government could not
enter the embassy compound because the gate was locked, he ran
into his office, engulfed by flames and smoke, to fetch the key
and opened the gate, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
After opening the gate, he led firefighters to search for
missing people in the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
In the process of saving themselves, all people in the embassy
put the national interest above all, and put others before
themselves, and withdrew in the order of the extent of their
injuries.
</P>
<P>
When the news of the U.S.-led NATO attack of the embassy
reached Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Ambassador
Pan Zhanlin, asking him to convey the regards of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
When Pan told the embassy staff that the Central Government
would send a special plane to pick up the wounded, everybody
present was moved to tears and pledged to hold fast his or her
position, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the support from the Yugoslavians, Wang said, the
Yugoslav foreign minister rushed to the scene soon after the
attack and conveyed sincere solicitude to the Chinese ambassador
on behalf of the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring residents and Chinese residing in Belgrade also
came to the embassy to offer help and provide necessities.
</P>
<P>
During NATO's 50-day bombing of Yugoslavia, Wang said, "We've
come to see the hypocrisy of the so-called 'democracy' and 'human
rights' claimed by the United States."
</P>
<P>
The United States alleges to safeguard human rights while
trampling on human rights by exercising a power policy and
flaunting humanitarianism by conducting a high-handed policy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Though Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu, and Zhu Ying died, they are the
pride of the Chinese nation and live in our hearts forever.
</P>
<P>
"History and war experience tell us that only if a nation is
strong can it not be bullied by others and effectively maintain
world peace," Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Pursuit of UN Charter Significant: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua)-- Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan
pointed out in a written speech here today that under the present
international situation it is of great practical significance to
continue pursuing the themes and principles of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
Tang's speech was delivered at a ceremony for the publication
of a book titled Commentary on the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Tang described the UN Charter, the basic law of the United
Nations, as a historical document of international law. The
publication of the book, an important research result of China's
legal and diplomatic scholars, fills the domestic gap in this
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the principle of safeguarding the equality
of all sovereign countries and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs is the core of the charter.
</P>
<P>
The post-world-war history of more than a half century has
proven that nation to nation relations cannot be dealt with by "
cold war," "hot war," "group politics," "power politics," or any
such ideas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only by strictly abiding by the five principles of peaceful co-
existence can nations treat each other in a friendly manner and
achieve common development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Looks to New Millennium With Hope: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is looking to the coming
millennium with hope and confidence which is built on the
conviction that the nation is on the "right" track to becoming a
modern and developed state, said Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
"We in Myanmar believe that peace and development are two sides
of a coin and cannot be separated," Khin Nyunt, who is first
secretary of the State Peace and Development Council, said at the
opening ceremony of the two-day 13th ASEAN Labor Ministers Meeting
here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace, there can be no development and without
development there can be no lasting peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar's economy, he said the country has been able to
achieve significant progress in economic growth in recent years
with a five-year economic plan (1996-97 to 2000-2001) being
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the unfavorable international economic and investment
climate, we achieved a 6.4-percent growth in the first year of the
plan, 5.7 percent in the second year and according to preliminary
figures, 5 percent in the third year (1998-99) which ended in
March," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the firm conviction that Myanmar's economy will be
at a take-off stage after the end of the current five-year plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Libyan labor market will be in
need of skilled Egyptian labors in the coming period, the Egyptian
Manpower and Immigration Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Job opportunities available in Libya mainly cover medical and
teaching professions, according to a report sent to the ministry
by the Egyptian Labor Representation in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Libya also wants technicians in the fields
of construction, electricity, refrigeration and operation of
sophisticated machinery.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians are currently making up 40 percent of the teaching
staff at Libyan universities, 32 percent of the manpower at the
national firms and 53 percent at the foreign companies operating
in Libya, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not give the figures of the Egyptian workers
that Libya needs in the near future and those of the Egyptian
laborers already in Libya.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Egyptians are working in foreign countries, notably
the oil-rich Gulf Arab states and North African countries,
remitting home over 3 billion U.S. dollars annually. The
remittances are one of Egypt's main sources of hard currencies.

<HEADLINE> Most Sudanese Welcome Former President's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of the Sudanese
people favor the return of former Sudanese president Gaafar
Nimeri, according to a referendum undertaken by Sudanese daily
"Al Sharie Al Sudani."
</P>
<P>
Five percent of the interviewed adamantly opposed Nimeri's
return.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Friday that students and businessmen were
the most supportive of Nimeri's return home after 14 years of
exile in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that most of the samples welcomed the return of
Nimeri as a player in the political arena rather than an ordinary
citizen.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Abdul Bassit Sedrat, political adviser of
Sudanese President Omar Bashir, had flown to Cairo to arrange for
Nimeri's return.
</P>
<P>
Reports about Nimeri's return have had far reaching
repercussions among his opponents, although the Sudanese
constitution guarantees all citizens the right to return home.
</P>
<P>
Friday's "Al Raie Al Am" daily quoted the president of the Bar
Association Fat'hi Khalil as saying that Nimeri's return should
be viewed within the context of the current circumstances, the
prevailing detente and the trend towards national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Nimeri is expected to arrive in Khartoum before the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
Nimeri was overthrown in April 1985 in a military coup d'etat
and had ever since been living in exile in Egypt.

"The Russian armed forces cannot be dragged into internal
political processes in the country," Sergeyev was quoted as
telling reporters by the Itar-Tass news agency.

"Directions of the activity of the Russian armed forces have
been set by the president, and remain without change," he said.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Tanzanian Sailors Freed by Somali Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) (C Six Tanzanian seamen, who
were freed by a Somali Islamic fundamentalist group after
five-month captivity for ransom, returned home Thursday. !0We
don't believe it... We are finally back home alive!!1 the sailors
exclaimed upon their arrival at the Dar es Salaam International
Airport from Kenya, local newspapers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sailors, aged from 25 to 42, were kidnapped on December 16
last year when their vessel, MV Sjohana, ferrying cargo to India
from Mombasa, Kenya drifted and docked in Somalia following an
engine failure.
</P>
<P>
Armed Somali men from the self-claimed Islamic Salvation Army,
carrying automatic assault weapons, rocket launchers and hand
grenades, boarded their vessel and asked for a 2.2 million US
dollars ransom. !0They later agreed to lower the ransom to just
60,000 US dollars because the cargo was worthless and the ship
itself was worth only 100,000 dollars," a sailor told a sobbing
crowd of relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
The sailors were released to Kenyan on May 7 following
negotiations by the Libyan and Egyptian authorities in Somalia
where Tanzania has no embassy nor consular office.
</P>
<P>
But so far it was not clear if the ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
The sailors demanded the government to deal with the owner of
the vessel,

Mohamed Shabbir, because he had abandoned them to the mercy of the
 abductors.
</P>
<P>
They also pleaded for medical treatment, financial support and
recovery of their travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Libyan and Egyptian Ambassadors to Tanzania, Shabbir A. Shabbir
and Rafik Khalili, Tanzanian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Co- operation, Emmanuel Mwambulukutu were at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Mwambulukutu said that Tanzania will definitely be among the
first countries to ratify an international convention against
terrorism and banditry which is now being drawn by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Right-Wing Candidate Hints Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Right-wing candidate Benny Begin
suggested Friday that he might drop out of the election race, but
said he has not made the decision yet.
</P>
<P>
One of the five prime ministerial candidates, Begin told
Israel Radio that he might announce his withdrawal Sunday, one
day before the national voting, if he has found reasons for the
move by that time.
</P>
<P>
Azmi Bishara, the first Arab candidate for prime minister in
Israel, has said he would announce his final decision Saturday
night on whether to withdraw his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
It's widely expected that Bishara will bow out of the race and
throw support behind One Israel leader Ehud Barak, who is leading
in the polls over his main rival, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Begin's withdrawal could make it more difficult
for Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai to stay on, although he
has vowed to fight until after the May 17 votings despite the fact
that his support rate had dropped to only 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Begin's withdrawal would significantly raise the possibility
that the election for Israel's next prime minister could be
decided in just one round.
</P>
<P>
With his support rate slipping in the polls, Begin has been
under pressure from within his right-wing national party to drop
out of the race.
</P>
<P>
But reports have said Likud officials want Begin to stay on in
order to split the votes in the first round and force a second
round of voting.
</P>
<P>
If no candidates get more than 50 percent of the votes in the
first round next Monday, then a one-to-one runoff will be held on
June 1.
</P>
<P>
Trailing behind Barak in recent polls, Netanyahu believes he
would have a better chance to beat Barak in a second round since
some of the Arab voters, a key voting bloc in Israel, might stay
at home.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has also been under heavy pressure to give up his
candidacy as signs show that his chance of winning the elections
is near zero.
</P>
<P>
Those calling for his withdrawal say that it would be a
serious mistake for Mordechai if Netanyahu wins the elections in
the second round because of his insistence to stay on. Mordechai's
party was formed with a claimed aim of ousting Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, however, has been resisting the pressure since he
made a public pledge not to give up in a televised debate with
Netanyahu in April.
</P>
<P>
People said this makes it hard for Mordechai, who is widely
regarded as a man of his words, to break his promise.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he refused to confirm or deny that he had told
senior party colleagues that if he withdraws from the race he will
retire from politics.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Clean Production Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will begin pilot clean-
production projects in ten cities and five industries in July in a
bid to reduce pollution and achieve sustainable growth of its
industry.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) issued a
circular today which said that showcase projects of clean
production will be conducted in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Chongqing, Shenyang, Taiyuan, Jinan, Kunming, Lanzhou,
and Fuyang. These projects will involve such industries as
petroleum, metallurgy, chemicals, ship-building, and light
industries.
</P>
<P>
Clean production concerns carrying out an anti-pollution
strategy throughout the entire industrial production process. It
enables enterprises to continuously lower the discharge of
pollutants through improved management and technological advances.
</P>
<P>
The SETC pointed out in the circular that Chinese and
international experience proves that clean production is the best
way to alleviate industrial pollution, coordinating economic
efficiency and environmental interests, and thus becoming a major
method for transforming the mode of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The pilot projects will focus on helping enterprise leaders
change their concepts and raise their awareness of pollution
control. The enterprises will be asked to shift their focus from
correcting the end result of industrial pollution to controlling
the sources of pollution throughout the entire production process.
</P>
<P>
The government will help these enterprises improve efficiency
and competitiveness while meeting pollution control standards.
</P>
<P>
In the ten cities, the SETC will achieve the goal of improving
the local environment and the quality of economic growth to a
significant degree. The experiment will include setting up
administrative, policy and operating systems of government-
pioneered clean production.
</P>
<P>
The pilot project will be carried out over a period of three
years, beginning in July and concluding by July 2002.

<HEADLINE> China Helps Women Escape Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Helping rural women become literate
will be an important task for women's organizations at all levels
in China over the next few years, according to the All-China
Women's Federation (ACWF) here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million women have escaped from illiteracy since
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, but there
are still 128 million illiterate women in China, or more than 70
percent of the country's illiterate population, and 110 million
are in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The number of illiterate people is increasing by one million
every year, said an official with the ACWF. She said that the
elimination of poverty should start with the elimination of
illiteracy, because the large number of illiterate women and
millions of new illiterate people are more likely to become part
of the poor population.
</P>
<P>
Some improper ideas have hindered the development of women's
intelligence and ability, which in turn have made them reluctant
to study and become literate, experts with the ACWF said. Some
women believe they can depend on their husbands to prosper, and
some elderly women, burdened with heavy housework, are also
reluctant to study and attend social activities.
</P>
<P>
"Getting rid of illiteracy in rural China, especially among
rural Chinese women, is still an arduous job," concluded an
official with the Department of Elementary Education of the
Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Training classes sponsored by the ACWF, and local women's
organizations have already helped tens of millions of women become
literate, and the ACWF has also established a national prize to
award outstanding work in this field.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs 50 years to rebuild its
battered economy, said Nigerian former Attorney General Richard
Akinjide here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The projection was based on the result of a research showing
"total" wipping out of Nigeria's economy, explained Akinjide, now
chief of the People's Democratic Party (PDP).
</P>
<P>
What is even worse is that Nigerians know little of the real
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the economic situation as "bankrupt" and pointed
out that nobody is really investing in this country.
</P>
<P>
The once presidential aspirant called for the incoming civilian
 government of General Olusegun Obasanjo to appraise the financial
records and make the findings known to the public.
</P>
<P>
The PDP chieftain also urged Nigerians not to underestimate the
 graveness of the situation, adding that people should not
expecting miracles.
</P>
<P>
"It will take time no matter how well meaning the new
government will be" . He blamed bad leadership, corruption,
ineptitude and absence of democracy and rule of law as factors
responsible for the collapse of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been experiencing increasingly grave economic
crisis in recent years, short of even petroleum as an oil-rich
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- India received an inflow of 2.38
billion U.S. dollars of foreign direct investment (FDI) during
January-March 1999 compared to just 3.3 billion for the whole year
of 1998, official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
India's FDI approval during January-March amounted to 5.59
billion U.S. dollars. Foreign investors continued to believe that
the economic agenda of the government would not be reversed, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Industry Ministry officials, however, were cautious in making a
projection for the year, saying that it was yet to be seen if the
trends for the quarter would be repeated during the rest of the
year. They projected a conservative FDI inflow of around four
billion U.S. dollars during the year with approvals of over 10
billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total FDI approval in India since 1991 exceeds 60 billion
U.S. dollars while the FDI inflow is around 18 billion U.S.
dollars, the sources said.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) today urged local
departments concerned to pay close attention to Chinese overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
This should be done in connection with the government efforts
to restructure the economy and expand exports, said Sun Zhenyu,
vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks at the closing ceremony of a five-day
workshop, which was sponsored by MOFTEC and the State Economic and
Trade Commission to promote Chinese investment overseas.
</P>
<P>
He asked some 110 participants from foreign trade departments,
trade commissions and relevant enterprises in 26 provinces and
cities to increase coordination, market research, the
popularization of policy, and personnel training in a bid to
ensure more successful projects.
</P>
<P>
The participants devoted to the study of China's overseas
investment policy, overseas markets, and the investment
environment of various nations during the past five days, sources

</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had set up 5,600 ventures in 160
countries and regions, with combined contractual investment from
the Chinese side exceeding 600 million U.S. dollars.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Regis Debray, writer and former advisor of President
Francois Mitterrand, has published an open letter to President
Jacques Chirac, accusing the French media of distorting the
reality about the war in Yugoslavia. Debray, who has recently
travelled through Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, said that he wants
to trigger a debate in France about the war, because the people of
Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain are now debating whether the war
is just or not, while the French people are ``intoxicated'' by the
distorted media reports.
</P>
<P>
-- The German Greens had their most agitated, and perhaps most
violent quarrel in years on Thursday as they debated the war in
Yugoslavia at their congress in Bielefeld on Thursday. Those
opposing the German participation in the NATO bombing think that
the war is destroying the pacifist base of the party.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After holding talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Thursday in the Kremlin, French President Jacques Chirac said that
within days, things could move toward a peaceful settlement of the
Yugoslav conflict. He said that he did not feel that Russia could
withdraw from the political process in search for a solution.
</P>
<P>
-- The war in Kosovo almost led to an implosion of the German
Greens on Thursday, also threatening a break-up of the coalition
of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. In a compromise vote
arranged by the president of the party and foreign minister
Joschka Fischer, the Greens called for a temporary pause of the
bombing by NATO in Yugoslavia, along with a repatriation of Kosovo
Albanians under military protection.

<HEADLINE> Labor Union Calls off Nationwide Strike in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) has
suspended the month-long industrial action by civil servants in 20
states following an agreement by military administrators in the
states to pay 3,000 naira (about 31.6 U.S. dollars) minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
John Odah, NLC deputy general secretary, said Thursday that
twenty state governments had agreed to pay the new wage, leaving
only four states in the country still to make any commitment.
</P>
<P>
With the suspension, the minimum wage will now be paid by 32
out of 36 states in the west African country, media reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NLC President Comrade Adams Oshiomhole Thursday
pledged a crisis-free year for the in-coming civilian government
at the 42nd annual general meeting of Nigeria Employers'
Consultative Association.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the NLC has no immediate intention to
confront the in- coming administration with proposals for wage
increase, instead to lend full support to the government to stave
off any attempt by ambitious military officers to stage.
</P>
<P>
The NLC directed its members in 28 of 36 states to go on strike
 beginning as from April 13 because the state governments failed
to pay the new minimum wage agreed upon at a meeting in capital
Abuja on March 13 between the federal government and labor
representatives.
</P>
<P>
By the agreement, the federal government and four states of
Delta, Bayelsa, Lagos and Rivers, are to pay 3,500 naira (about
36.8 dollars) while civil servants in the remaining 32 states will
get 3,000 naira.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Led NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy Recalled (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Unity and hard struggle helped
surviving Chinese embassy staff members accomplish their mission
under circumstances of sudden attack, said a returned diplomat
from the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
At a function held yesterday afternoon to welcome home returned
Chinese citizens from Yugoslavia, Wang Fuguo, the first secretary
of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, gave a detailed account of
the barbarous act of U.S.-led NATO, which caused an unprecedented
tragedy in the world's diplomatic history .
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, there have been 30 people at the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade and a dozen Chinese resident-correspondents
covering events in Yugoslavia since March 24 when U.S.-led NATO
brazenly began airstrikes in Yugoslavia in disregard of the UN
Charter and the just voice of the international community.
</P>
<P>
"An embassy is the symbol of a sovereign state and should be
protected and is not allowed to be encroached upon, in accordance
with international laws and conventions," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"However, deep in the night of May 7, the U.S.-led NATO fired
five missiles from different angles on the Chinese embassy
building and the ambassador's residence, which was beyond
everybody's belief," said the senior diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Amid sharp whizzing, three missiles ripped apart the five-
storey embassy building and exploded in the basement, another
missile tore a hole in the fencing of the embassy and also plunged
into the basement, and the fifth hit the residence of Ambassador
Pan Zhanlin, Wang recalled.
</P>
<P>
Following the sound of a huge explosion, there were dazzling
lights, heavy smoke, a wave of heat, and flying debris everywhere.
The five-storey building, most rooms of the ambassador's residence,
and the basement were totally destroyed instantly, leaving a
broken framework and a 2.5-meter-deep, 8-meter-long, 5-meter-long
hole in the ground.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he was then on the third floor, and when one missile
ripped through the ceiling and penetrated through the floor, the
wall of his room exploded, but he survived the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Military attache Ren Baokai, who was living one floor above
Wang, was seriously wounded, but Xinhua correspondent Shao Yunhuan,
living one floor below his room, was killed, and her husband Cao
Rongfei, a first secretary of the Chinese embassy, was severely
injured.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, a newlywed couple
with the Guangming Daily, were killed by another missile, said
Wang, and more than 20 others were injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Forcing his way out from his badly destroyed residence,
Ambassador Pan Zhanlin shouted to the embassy staff to remain calm
and not panic. He led surviving embassy employees in looking for
those in danger, despite the fact that NATO forces were likely to
strike again according to previous practices.
</P>
<P>
When the attack began, embassy staff members also risked their
lives and rushed into the building to remove sensitive documents.
When they completed this task, they were trapped inside the
building, and eventually rescued by local fire control officers,
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Wang also praised his colleague Zhang Cunliang, who managed to
save two other embassy staff members by making a rope with a
bedsheet and an antenna.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's army has taken full control
of Bakassi, a disputed oil-rich region claimed by both Nigeria and
its neighbor Cameroun, a Nigerian military officer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jaji-Kaduna, commanding officer of the 82 Motorized Battalion
of Nigerian armed force, disclosed this in a speech marking the
battalion's West African Social Activity and reception in honor of
six Nigerian war prisoners recently released by Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The officer reiterated Nigeria's stand that the peninsula is
Nigeria's territory.
</P>
<P>
"The nation's armed forces would continue to protect it," said
the officer.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich region has frequently caused hostilities and even
wars between the two west African countries in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice at the Hague ruled in March,
1999 in favor of Cameroun over the ownership dispute of the
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Policies to Stimulate Consumption Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China should adopt more policies to
raise home consumption in a bid to expand domestic demand and
promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The country's consumption rate has dropped to 58.8 percent from
67.5 percent in 1981, lower than the world's average of some 70
percent, according to a recent seminar organized by the China
Development Forum and the Institute of Macroeconomics under the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
A low consumption rate inevitably exacerbates insufficient
domestic demand, and therefore poses a major problem to national
economic advancement, experts attending the seminar said, noting
that the low rate will lead to declining economic growth in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
They attribute the low rate mainly to long-term structural
transformations of social and economic systems, rather to short-
term economic fluctuations, pointing to great income disparities
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts should be made to streamline the income
distribution system in an attempt to raise people's income,
especially that of middle and low income earners, they said,
suggesting that new social security systems be set up to maintain
consumer confidence and raise consumption.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of Defense
Edgar Maokola-Majogo said here Friday that the attack on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a very unfortunate incident.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese Ambassador Zhang Hongxi,
Maokola-Majogo said he supports the Chinese government's stand of
solving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the defense minister said, he was sympathetic
with victims of the incident that took place last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was attacked by
five missiles fired by U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Three Chinese journalists were killed, over 20 diplomats
were injured, and a five-story embassy building was wrecked during
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The incident has aroused the utmost indignation and strongest
protest of the Chinese government and 1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been bombing Yugoslavia since March 24 in an attempt
to force Belgrade to sign a peace agreement, granting greater
autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in the
Kosovo Province.
</P>
<P>
China has opposed to and condemned NATO bombing, maintaining
that NATO must stop air strikes before a peace deal is sealed.

manipulation.
</P>
<P>
There have been some positive statements coming out from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund and positive statements from
countries around the region on the issue, he said at a press
conference here on the eve of a two-day APEC Finance Ministers'
Meeting here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was quite difficult to move forward on this
issue as not many members were affected by money manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that unless and until you are the victim, unless
and until you go through the suffering we went through, ... it is
very difficult for people and others to comprehend how painful the
currency manipulation can be to countries like us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of the international financial system including
regulating short-term capital flows is expected to be a major
issue to be discussed at the two-day APEC finance ministers'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
All APEC finance ministers are expected to come to the meeting
except for Brunei, Chile, Russia and Vietnam, which will be
represented by their deputy ministers.
</P>

APEC (the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) comprises
Australia; Brunei; Canada; Chile; China; Hong Kong, China;

<HEADLINE> China's Textile Industry Reduces Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's debt-laden textile sector,
the flagship of the country's state enterprise reforms,
successfully reduced its losses by 650 million yuan for the first
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a source at a national meeting on textile
enterprise management held recently in the city of Wuxi, a major
light industry center in east China's Jiangsu Province, the
country dismantled a total of 780,000 outdated spindles in its
cotton mills, and about 100,000 laid-off textile workers were
reassigned during the period.
</P>
<P>
China has targeted the textile industry as the sector for
achieving breakthroughs in turning around money-losing state-owned
enterprises. It has set the goal of state-owned textile
enterprises turning losses into profits by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China exceeded the target of cutting redundant
capacity by 4.8 million spindles and streamlining textile
employment by 600,000 people. Actually, it dismantled 5.12 million
spindles, and laid off and reassigned 660,000 textile workers.
</P>
<P>
However, the additional 4.4 million spindles it plans to
abolish this year are mostly new and running at full capacity. A
majority of these are in mills in interior areas of the country
that are lagging behind other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
For the rest of this year, the textile industry will focus on
improving product mix and exploring markets in the rural areas,
and in the fields of decorative and industrial textiles.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese diplomats wrote a heroic
and solemn verse in the U.S.-led NATO missile attacks against the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia for they "are not afraid of
difficulties and risk and are loyal to their duties, and fully
meet their mission," Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks at a meeting held in the ministry, saying
that these diplomats "put the interests of the motherland and
people first in the front-line where they experienced the ordeal
of life and death."
</P>
<P>
Tang first expressed his condolences for the three slain
journalists, Xinhua correspondent Shao Yunhuan, and Guangming
Daily reporters Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, who were awarded the title
of "revolutionary martyrs" by the Chinese government on Thursday.
Tang also conveyed deep solicitude to the family members of the
journalists.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of all staff members and retired diplomats of the
ministry, he extended solicitude to the injured diplomatic staff
members in the Chinese embassy and paid tribute to those still
working in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-led NATO wantonly attacked the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia with missiles on May 7, causing a great number of
casualties and leaving the embassy building in debris.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister described the day as "a dark Friday" in
the history of modern international relations that shocked the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Our diplomats remained calm amidst this sudden incident. They
did not forget their lofty duties and the trust of the motherland
even under great fire," he said.

<HEADLINE> North China Plans Forestry Protection Belts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
plans to invest some 1.9 billion yuan to plant and build three
forestry belts around the Beijing area to protect the Chinese
capital and the city of Tianjin from shifting sand from the
northwestern deserts.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to cost 200 million
yuan and take five years to complete, and the three forestry belts
are expected to exceed 670,00 hectares each.
</P>
<P>
Over the next ten years, the province plans to plant 337,500
hectares of trees and transform about 6,700 hectares of low-
quality forest to the north and west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The three tree belts, along with the existing Saihanba Forest,
will form a windbreak of more than 533,000 hectares to the north
of Beijing and Tianjin, and greatly improve the environment in the
two cities.
</P>
<P>
To shield the two cities from incursions of sand from the
northwestern deserts, Hebei has already forested nearly two
million hectares in area.

The speech delivered by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at
Thursday's honoring ceremony is a great encouragement and spur to
Chinese diplomats, Tang said, and called on them to study the
speech seriously and turn their indignation and patriotism into
the impetus to work.
</P>
<P>
He also called on them to learn from the embassy staff and
journalists in Belgrade their loyalty to the Party's diplomatic
cause and their lofty sentiment in safeguarding national dignity
and the highest interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
All staff of the Foreign Ministry should further bear in mind
the sense of hardship, emergency, and security, study Deng
Xiaoping's thoughts on diplomacy, and work hard under the
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core to contribute to diplomacy geared to a new century and
China's prosperity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guozhang, head of the Chinese government special mission,
briefed the gathering on their work in Belgrade. He said the
mission, led directly by the CPC Central Committee, successively
accomplished its tasks within 60 hours, conveyed regards of the
CPC Central Committee and the State Council to the staff in
Belgrade, brought back the wounded and evacuees, appropriately
attended to the three slain journalists' funeral affairs, and
helped arrange the follow-up work of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
All mission members supported and coordinated with each other,
he said, adding that their hard work did not let down the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fuguo, first secretary of the embassy, spoke of their work
in Belgrade on behalf of Ambassador Pan Zhanlin who remains

Tang said that the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee paid close attention to the development of the incident
and adopted a series of resolute measures after the attacks.
Students and people nationwide also staged protests and
demonstrations to express their indignation over the NATO atrocity,
which is a reflection of the heroic spirit of the Chinese people
that can never be bullied and humiliated, he said. It also fully
demonstrated the firm willingness of the Chinese people to oppose
hegemonism and safeguard world peace, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our fight has strongly stricken the arrogance of hegemonism
and power politics," he said, reiterating that "U.S.-led NATO
should bear all responsibilities arising therefrom. The diplomatic
institutions of the People's Republic of China allow no
infringement."
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle also clearly reflects the important constructive
role played by China in pushing forward a political solution to
the Kosovo issue as a responsible power in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Zhu Rongji have repeatedly expounded the principled stance of the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
In China's view, the Kosovo issue is the internal affair of
Yugoslavia. As an independent state, the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia should be fully respected. All
lawful rights of ethnic groups in Kosovo should be guaranteed.
China firmly opposes the bombardment of U.S.-led NATO. Also, the
political prerequisite for a political solution to the Kosovo
issue is an immediate halt of the NATO bombing, the minister
reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle also uncovers the humanitarian mask of U.S.-led
Western countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The world is far from stable. It still has a long way to go on
the path of safeguarding peace and promoting development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also considers the struggle "a profound patriotic lesson"
for the Chinese people, particularly for young students. "Only by
building a stronger China can we be in a position to make more
contributions to world peace and development," he pointed out.  (

<HEADLINE> China Trying To Hold Down Resource Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to begin a
nationwide campaign to reduce energy and resource consumption this
year, participants announced at a national meeting on resource
conservation here recently.
</P>
<P>
China wants to bring the amount of energy needed to produce
every 10,000 yuan in its GDP down to 3.19 tons of standard coal
next year, from last year's 3.38 tons, and to raise the recycling
rate of industrial waste gas, waste water, and solid waste from 45
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to enforcing energy laws and regulations
and technology will be imported and used in major enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country will also implement a "Green Light Program" to
encourage the use of more efficient lighting.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that, in this way, 30 billion kwh of
electricity will be saved by the year 2000, the equivalent of 15
million tons of raw coal.
</P>
<P>
China plans to use 300 million compact fluorescent lamps and
other more energy-efficient appliances.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for World Financial System Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI (Malaysia), May 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday
stressed the need for the reform of the international financial
system despite signs of stability in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been signs of stability in the world
economy, the need for reforms is there because the risks remain to
be tackled, Malaysia's Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed
said at a press conference here prior to the opening of a two-day
APEC Finance Ministers' meeting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want this urgency which was there for last two years
to reform the international system to wane in the current stable
climate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there might be some economies which believe that as the
economies in this region are recovering as they begin to show some
positive signs of recovery, the urgency for reforms for the
international financial system is no longer there.
</P>
<P>
"In our view the issue remains as relevant as ever because the
risks remain and they need to be tackled urgently, productively,
quickly and efficiently," said Mustapa who will chair the two-day
Sixth APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in this duty-free resort
island in northern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
On the finance ministers' meeting, Mustapha said Malaysia was
"quite pleased" with the preparations made and as the host
country, Malaysia was pleased with the response from APEC
economies to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said this augurs well for the future of APEC.
</P>
<P>
All APEC finance ministers are expected to come to the meeting
except for Brunei, Chile, Russia and Vietnam, which will be
represented by their deputy ministers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Tax Reform Bid Suffers First Major Blow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government's bid to
reform its tax system suffered its first heavy blow Friday as an
independent senator who holds the balance of power in the
Australian Senate said he does not support the government's
proposed tax bill.
</P>
<P>
Senator Brian Harradine's decision means the government will be
unable to pass the goods and services (GST) legislation, if the
Australian Labor and Australian Democrats senators vote along
their party lines as expected.
</P>
<P>
Senator Harradine, whose decisive vote in the senate has made
him an influential figure in Australian politics in recent years,
announced his decision Friday despite concessions made by the
government over the past few months on many social and economic
issues to court his support.
</P>
<P>
The proposed GST package includes a 10-percent tax on all goods
and services and compensation offer by the government to
low-income families and cuts in personal income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
The package will increase the prices of daily necessities, such
as food, but reduce the burden of the business community and
middle- and high-income earners.
</P>
<P>
The senator said the government had made a genuine and
commendable attempt to lock in compensation but that could not be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"And the question that I have to ask myself is whether I am
going to be a party to imposing an impersonal, indiscriminate tax
on my children, my grandchildren and their children for
generations to come," Harradine told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Friday said he was
disappointed by the senator's decision, adding that the
government's commitment to tax reform remained undiminished.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out any exemption of food from the proposed tax,
as sought by the Australian Democrats, the fourth biggest party in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"We fought and won an election (last October) with this
taxation plan fully disclosed, fully revealed to the Australian
people," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe if the senate votes the legislation down it will be
disobeying the wishes of the Australian people."
</P>
<P>
Australia would be plunged into political chaos unless
compromises are made by both sides of the politics.
</P>
<P>
Under the Australian Constitution, the federal parliament
should be dissolved and an election should be called if a
government-proposed bill is rejected for the second time.

<HEADLINE> China's Ship-Building Industry More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ship builders have seen a
result of their strenuous effort to sharpen their competitive edge
in the world market as Greek shipping companies have decided
recently to order some 24 vessels from them.
</P>
<P>
The latest information from the Shanghai Shipping Exchange
Bureau also reveals that shippers from the Middle East also intend
to order five 300,000-ton ships valued at a total of 600 million U.
S. dollars from China.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that China's ship-building industry, the
world's third largest following Japan and the Republic of Korea (
ROK), has greatly improved its international competitiveness,
prompting Europeans to pay more attention to China's ship builders.
</P>
<P>
China's ship-building capacity has rapidly increased to six
million tons since the country initiated its policy of opening-up
and reform in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian financial crisis has undermined the fast-
growing industry, which lost its advantage of low cost compared to
Japan and the ROK, since China insisted on maintaining a stable
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Insiders point out that, facing the tough challenge of
international market competition, governmental support is now
quite necessary for the development of China's ship-building
sector.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they have urged preferential loans for shipyards to
expand production, carry out technical upgrading, and encourage
exports.

<HEADLINE> China Reports New Finds at Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A 1,000-meter-long brick wall
structure bearing literary inscriptions, and another covered with
relief work have been found at the Jinshanling section of the
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the inscriptions concern information such
as the time when the bricks were made and the designations of the
troops who built this section of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
The relief wall structure, found on the second floor of a tower,
is two meters wide and 1.5 meters long. The rectangle was built
with 15 smaller rectangle bricks.
</P>
<P>
Dominated by the pattern of the kylin (a fabulous deer-like
animal said to appear only in the time of peace and prosperity),
the rectangle structure also has patterns of white deer and glossy
ganoderma (a kind of dark brownish fungus supposed to have
supernatural powers) on it.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these finds are of great value for scientific
research and the study of historical relics.
</P>
<P>
The Jinshanling section of the Great Wall, 10.5 kilometers long
is located in Luanping County in Hebei Province, and was first
built between 1567 and 1620 during Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). It is
one of the most attractive sections of the Great Wall.

<P>
MAPUTO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program has pledged

</P>
<P>
In addition, said Langa, the Mozambican government appealed to

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Traffic and industrial accidents
caused losses of 80 billion to 200 billion yuan to China last year,
accounting for one to 2.5 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) recently
released these figures as part of the on-going Workplace Safety
Week.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister in charge of the SETC, Shi Wanpeng, said that in
the first four months of this year, the frequency of serious
accidents posed a serious safety problem for the country.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 31 major accidents occurred in coal mines
around the country, killing 537 people.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting human safety will be the most important part of the
agenda in the 21st century. We must have a very sober awareness of
this issue from now on," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
The SETC has urged local authorities and enterprises to place
the highest importance on safety and curb the rising trend of
serious accidents.
</P>
<P>
China has held the annual Workplace Safety Week for the past
nine consecutive years to raise safety awareness among all
citizens.

ANKARA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismai Cem

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Lead Growth of Township Enterprises in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's township enterprises have
reported a value-added growth of 14.8 percent in the first quarter
this year, and the private sector has played a leading role in
boosting this growth.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Ministry of Agriculture show that industrial
added value in the private sector surged 23.53 percent in the
first quarter to account for 51.9 percent of all industrial added
value in China's township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In coastal regions, where private businesses have enjoyed their
best development, the private sector is booming under a
diversified and quality-oriented economy, according to the China
Township Enterprises News.
</P>
<P>
Large township enterprises with annual sales volume exceeding
five million yuan have also been on a fast track during the period,
with a growth rate of 14.5 percent in terms of added value.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises accounted for 28.8 percent of the total added
value among township enterprises, up from the 27.7 percent in 1998.
The share hit as high as 90 percent in the country's eastern
powerhouse of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts attribute this steady growth to the enhanced
investment in infrastructure construction by the government. Sales
of building materials and textiles have improved markedly, and
recent surveys also showed promising sales condition in food,
chemicals, machinery, and electronics.
</P>
<P>
However, difficulties stemming from the lingering impact of the
Asian economic crisis still exist, posing tough prospects for
labor-intensive and export-oriented firms, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They also called for more effort by the government to address
structural problems and regional discrepancies in township
enterprises, and improve the financing of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Output value for the township enterprises currently accounts
for one-third of China's gross domestic product (GDP), with rural
enterprises making up some two-thirds of all rural added value.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Lead in Polls Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) - With the general election only
three days to go, opinion polls gave One Israel leader Ehud
Barak an increasing lead over his rival, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, and some suggested that he might win even in the
first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
A poll published by the local daily The Jerusalem Post
Friday showed that if a second round of voting were to take
place now, Barak would beat Netanyahu by 50 percent to 43
percent, with seven percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
A similar poll last week gave Barak 49 percent and
Netanyahu 43.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that if all the five prime
ministerial candidates stayed on in the race, then Barak would
get 45 percent and Netanyahu 39 percent in the first round
of voting next Monday. This compared with 43 percent for Barak
and 38.5 percent for Netanyahu in the previous poll.
</P>
<P>
All polls this week have shown that Barak had an
increasing edge over Netanyahu in both rounds, but he might
not pass the 50 percent mark in the first round, thus making
a second round inevitable.
</P>
<P>
But some activists in One Israel began to talk about a
first-round victory by Barak, quoting polls showing that
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, a decisive voting bloc
in Israel, seem to be switching their allegiance from Netanyahu
to Barak.
</P>
<P>
A majority of these immigrants voted for Netanyahu in the
1996 elections, helping him defeat then prime minister Shimon
Peres by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
The optimism of these activists was boosted by expectation
that Azmi Bishara, the Arab candidate for prime minister, might
drop out of the race when he announces his final decision
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
With an expected turnout of about 80 percent in the first
round, Arab voters, another decisive voting bloc, might vote
overwhelmingly for Barak if Bishara withdraws from the race.
</P>
<P>
Despite his slide in the polls, Netanyahu insisted that he
could still win the elections if he and Barak will face each
other in a second round.
</P>
<P>
If no candidates get more than 50 percent of the votes
in the first round, then the two top vote-getters will go to
a second round, which is scheduled on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu believes that he would have an advantage in the
second round if it takes place.
</P>
<P>
As the religious voters, a key constituency for Netanyahu,
are expected to turn out in full force to support him, fewer
Arab voters are expected to participate in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
"The data I have is that we are going to win the
elections," he said. "I can't say whether it will be in the
first round. It could well be in the second round," he was
quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying.

<HEADLINE> S. African Pregnant Women HIV Carrier Risen: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- At least one in every eight
adult South Africans has been infected with HIV, which stands for
human immunodeficiency virus and causes deadly AIDS disease, a new
national survey shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the study released Thursday, the number of
pregnant women with HIV has increased by 34 percent in one year
despite the government efforts to educate people on the pandemic,.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 study targeted women attending public antenatal clinic
and was the 9th of its kind conducted by the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
It was found that the epidemic continued to rise at an alarming
rate, with HIV most prevalent among women in the 20 to 29 year age
group.
</P>
<P>
The highest rate of increase at 64 percent, however, was found
among teenage girls. The survey emphasized the need for education
on HIV/AIDS to be targeted at this age group.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of teenagers taking part in the study had some
information on HIV and AIDS, but half of the respondents did not
know that people who looked healthy or fat could be HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The antenatal study is considered by the South African Health
Department to be a reliable indicator of the spread of HIV among
communities, as pregnant women come from a cross section of the
population and are known to be sexually active.
</P>
<P>
Based on this assumption, the study estimates that
approximately 3.6 million South Africans were infected with the
HIV virus in 1998, as opposed to 2.7 million in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges Bigger Role of Developing Nations in Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here Friday that sustainable economic growth
needs a more active role by developing countries and Asia will
see high growth in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the "Business Opportunities Conference
in Pakistan" jointly organized by the Singapore Trade Development
Board and the High Commission of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
Sharif said, "A more active role is now required to be played by
the developing countries to improve conditions of trade, economic
development and political stability to provide sustainable
economic growth."
</P>
<P>
Noting that rapid political and economic changes in South Asia
have significantly altered the scene on the industrial and
investment front, Sharif expressed his belief that next decade
will see high economic growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There is general consensus that in the next decade global
recovery will further improve at a much faster pace and the Asian
countries, especially that of the East and Southeast Asia, will
embark on the high growth path," he said. He emphasized that
"these economies have immense potential to act as engines of
growth in the coming century."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Pakistan's economy was recovering from
the effect of the economic sanctions slapped on it last year in
the wake of its nuclear tests and his government was giving the
"highest priority" to reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It was imperative to take cognizance of the difficult economic
situation which the country had been facing. That is why we
assigned the highest priority to revitalizing the economy," he
told the conference.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said his country's agenda for economic recovery was
focused on correcting fiscal imbalance through an increase in tax
collection, improving its balance of payments and boosting
exports.
</P>
<P>
"We have launched sound fiscal and economic policies to promote
domestic and foreign investment, increase exports, reform the tax
and tariff regime and ensure full transparency in all
transactions," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani leader arrived here Thursday for a three-day
official visit and has held talks with Singapore Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet Thursday in honor of the Pakistani leader, Prime
Minister Goh expressed Singapore's readiness to share its
development experiences with Pakistan and praised Sharif for
resuming talks with India, leading to the Lahore Declaration in
February.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the state dinner, Sharif said that the prerequisite
for rapid economic growth is peace and stability and that the
security tensions, including the long-run dispute with India over
Kashmir, had impeded economic performances.
</P>
<P>
"The tensions that had prevailed in our region have impeded the
development of South Asia to its fullest potential," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tea Output Rises but Sales Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's tea output this
year has increased but sales dropped due to heated competition
from neighboring Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
This year, Tanzania is expected to produce more than 26,000
tons of tea, compared with 25,500 tons last year, media reports
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the country's tea sales at the Mombasa tea auction market
dropped to 939 tons during the first three months of this year,
compared with 1,300 tons in the corresponding period last year,
Business Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa, on the eastern coast of Kenya, is a major tea auction
market. Tanzania prefers to sell tea at the market due to low
costs of transportation and other services.
</P>
<P>
The drop of sales was associated to competition from Kenya and
Uganda which have higher quality of tea, preferable climate and
better manufacturing technology, said Richard Mwakangale, the
marketing director of Tanzania Tea Authority (TTA).
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is lack of ideal highlands required for the
growth of high-quality tea as Kenya and Uganda, whose tea is sold
at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, Tanzania's tea was traded at an
average price of 1.18 U.S. dollars a kilogram, Kenya's tea was
traded at 1.85 U.S. dollars, and Uganda's, 1.4 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In east Africa, Kenya is the largest producer, followed by
Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plans to intensify research into tea production so
that the output of the cash crop could reach 40,000 tons by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The government responsibility in tea research was taken over
last November by a private institute -- Tea Research Institute of
Tanzania, with financial assistance of British Department of
International Department.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Tanzania's major foreign exchange earner, along
with coffee, cotton, cashew nut, tobacco and sisal.

<HEADLINE> More Pro-Israeli Militiamen in Lebanon Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid decreasing morale among the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA), three members of the militia
turned themselves to the Lebanese government Friday, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The three defectors deserted from Shebaa, a village inside the
Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The latest defection followed a desertion by at least 18 SLA
members in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Following the desertion, Israeli forces blocked the village
and started an investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
There are currently nearly 2,500 SLA members helping the
Israeli occupation forces patrol its occupied zone and handle the
security affairs in Jezzine, a predominantly Christian town facing
the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The militia-men are considered as traitors in Lebanon and the
SLA commander Antonie Lahd has been sentenced to death in absentia
by a Lebanese military court.
</P>
<P>
With calls for a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon
mounting in Israel and their own casualties growing, the SLA's
morale is sinking and more members are defecting to the Lebanese
government or seeking foreign asylum to escape reprisals.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli occupation forces and its ally SLA out of the
country.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold 1st Insurance-Broker Qualification Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will hold its first insurance
brokers' qualification examination on Saturday, with more than 7,
000 people expected to sit for it nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
said the examination will be held in the six cities of Beijing,
Taiyuan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations on the administration of insurance
brokers promulgated in February last year, an insurance broker
must pass the qualification examination before being licensed to
be employed by a brokerage company.
</P>
<P>
CIRC officials said they have never approved any firm to engage
in the brokerage business, and therefore any firm now providing
such service is doing so illegally.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the British solely funded Sedgwick Insurance
&AMP; Risk Management Consultants (China) Limited was ordered to
suspend business for three months for engaging in brokerage
activity without a license.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources have said that China may approve its first
foreign insurance brokerage firm within the year.

<HEADLINE> Edible Oil's Price Rising Slightly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua)-- Edible oil's price in China will
rise slightly as the country's demand outstrips supply by around 2.
5 million tons, according to a recent report in the China Business
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Prices of Chinese edible oil had been falling since 1996, owing
to good harvests, abundant imports, and rampant smuggling.
Nevertheless, this situation began to change last July when China
cracked down on smuggling and floods severely affected the oil-
bearing crops.
</P>
<P>
Although China increased its oil-bearing crops grown acreage
this year, it is unlikely to reap substantial increases in output
because of prolonged drought following last autumn, the State
Administration of Internal Trade is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates that prices for edible oil will continue
to rise.
</P>
<P>
The central government now has a reserve of more than one
million tons of edible oil, which can be served as an effective
guarantee for a stable edible oil market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's computer market has picked
up from a slide of last year, according to sources from the China
Computer Fair that ended last week in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Xu Hongying, secretary of the fair's preparatory committee,
told Xinhua today that signs at the hectic computer fair showed an
upward trend in the growth of China's computer market this year.
</P>
<P>
Computers pre-installed with popular software and network-
related products are selling well, and so is educational software,
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
An estimate by the Ministry of Information Industry predicted a
sales volume of 175 billion yuan (21 billion U.S. dollars) for the
computer market this year, an annual increase of 18.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of China's electronic products declined in 1998, and
analysts attributed this to the impact of the Asian economic
crisis, a weakened demand by the government as a result of
restructuring, and the rapid growth of production capacity.

<HEADLINE> Light Industry Keeps Momentum in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's light industry sector
retained its rising momentum in the first quarter of this year,
with output value topping 129.5 billion yuan by the end of March,
up 10.1 percent over the figure for a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a national conference held in Lanzhou, capital of
northwest China's Gansu Province, 15,950 light manufacturing
enterprises have turned losses of 178 million yuan in the first
quarter of last year to a net profit of 726 million yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The growth of newsprint went up by 48 percent, and
refrigerators by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export value of China's light-industry products totaled 11.
169 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the growth to expanded domestic demand, the
crackdown on smuggling, and the closing down of losing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country will readjust the structure of ten sectors
including foodstuffs, paper-making, durable goods, and porcelain,
and help five others including sugar, leather, and salt producers
turn losses into profits this year, said an official with the
State Light Industry Bureau.

<HEADLINE> China Standardizes State Sector's Purchasing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to introduce a
standard purchasing system for all state-owned enterprises in a
bid to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, state-owned enterprises will make public
all procedures related to the purchasing of goods and materials,
with major purchases accomplished through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
A series of regulations, focusing on auditing and quality
inspection, will be implemented to ensure that these enterprises
obtain high-quality goods and materials at relatively low prices.
</P>
<P>
This move constitutes part of China's ambitious plan to reform
state-owned enterprises beset with difficulties, said Zheng Silin,
vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, at a
national meeting on purchasing management held here recently.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng, many enterprises in China have been
operating in the red partly because they have paid too much for
goods and materials, greatly raising production cost.
</P>
<P>
A number of provinces, including east China's Shandong and
Fujian provinces and north China's Hebei Province, began trying
out the new system several years ago, and have since greatly
benefited from it.
</P>
<P>
In Shandong alone, 65 major manufacturers introduced the system
last year, and reduced their purchasing costs by 2.03 billion yuan,
equal to 47 percent of their total profits.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Receives More Tourists in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China received 1,640 overseas tourists and 210 tourist
groups in the first three months of this year, up 61 percent and
35 percent respectively from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the regional tourist department said that 596
Americans and 349 Japanese visited the autonomous region during
the January-March period.
</P>
<P>
In the past, overseas tourists considered it inappropriate to
visit Tibet from November to March because of the cold weather and
thin air. This notion seems to have changed, thanks to the efforts
of the local tourist department and travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Between January and March, travel agencies in the autonomous
region launched a series of activities to promote the tourist
industry in Tibet.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A leaders' meeting of Indonesia's
ruling Golkar Party early Friday agreed to nominate President B.J.
Habibie as the party's presidential candidate for the election
next month.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the Golkar Akbar Tanjung told the press
Friday morning that the nomination was conducted democratically by
the leaders who attended the meeting which closed at 2:40 a.m.
local time early Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting also agreed to nominate General Wiranto,
defense minister and Armed Forces commander; Ginanjar
Kartasasmita, coordinating minister for economy and finance;
Sultan Hamengkubuwono X and Akbar Tanjung as vice presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is preparing the holding of general election
scheduled for June 7 this year, the first multi-party election in
the country in the last 30 years. A total of 48 out of the 148
political parties in the country will contest the forthcoming
election.
</P>
<P>
Whoever elected will serve as the country's president for the
1999/2004 period.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar has won six general elections in the past 30 years
under the rule of former President Soeharto. However, it is facing
fierce challenge from other parties in the June election because
all the parties have nominated their own presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
In the past six elections, only three parties were allowed to
contest the polls and Soeharto was always the single presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto stepped down on May 21, 1998, amid the country's worst
political and economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Millitiaman Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was wounded Friday in Lebanese guerrillas'
attack in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The millitiaman was injured when guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, attacked an SLA
position at Sujoud on the edge of the Israeli occupied border zone
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed the bloodiest day of the year on Thursday
when seven Lebanese, four of them civilians, were killed in the
cross-fire between the resistance movement and the Israeli
occupation army and the SLA.
</P>
<P>
A roadside bomb killed an SLA member and his wife, his
sister-in-law and her 2-year-old son in Jezzine, north of the
border enclave Thursday. There has been no claim of responsibility
for the blast.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Israeli warplanes fired at least five rockets
at a house in the Majdal Silm village, north of the border zone,
killing two Lebanese who were believed to be members of a
resistance group.
</P>
<P>
Another woman was also killed in the fire exchange between
Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and their SLA
ally out of the country.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of Sri Lanka
(CPSL) has unreservedly condemned the U.S.-led NATO for its brutal
attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in
Belgrade in a statement available Friday.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which killed three persons and injured more than 20
others, constituted a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of
China and the U.N. charter, international law and the Geneva
Convention, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This dangerous development poses a grave danger to the
maintenance of peace in the world and international cooperation,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The party said, "There is reason to believe that this dastardly
act was not an accident but a premeditated act intended to
intimidate the People's China."
</P>
<P>
China has been sticking to its just stand against the naked
aggression of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the member
states of NATO.
</P>
<P>
The party reiterated its condemnation of the continued
bombardment of Yugoslavia by the NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
"We demand an immediate end to the bombardment of Yugoslavia
and to work for the achievement of a political solution to the
matters in issue," it said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO aggression of Yugoslavia exposed the nature and
context of the world order imperialist powers seek to impose on
the world, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the people to rally together to condemn the continued
bombardment of Yugoslavia by NATO and the bombing of the Embassy
of the People's China," it said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should act swiftly to bring the
deteriorating situation under control and cause a peaceful
settlement of all issues in dispute, the party added.

NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Revenue Authority (KRA)

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt. Accuses Congo (K) of Training Hutu Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda Thursday again accused
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and his allies of training and
re-equipping thousands of "Interahamwe" militiamen in preparation
of an invasion of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"At least 5,000 militiamen are at large in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) where they continue to train for an attack
on Rwanda," the Rwandan News Agency quoted a press statement from
the office of Rwanda's Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul
Kagame as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that the presence of the Hutu extremists
in the DRC remains the biggest threat for the survival of the
Rwandan nation.
</P>
<P>
The statement recalled that Kabila had openly declared that he
wanted to use the Interahamwe and members of the defeated former
Rwandan government army to take the war in the DRC into Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, together with Uganda, has been accused of supporting
the DRC rebels determined to oust President Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Following a peace deal signed by Kabila and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni in Libya's Sirte in April this year,
the Ugandan troops are gearing up to pull out of the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
But Rwanda insists that there will be no withdrawal as long as
the "Interahamwe'' still looms high, saying that any solution to
the war in the DRC should address concerns of its neighbors and
those of the internal opposition.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks to Increase Its Share of World Tourism Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- African governments have a riddle
to solve -- how to reap its fair share of the big global tourism
trade.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended 33rd World Tourism Organization (WTO) and
Convocation of African Ministers of Tourism in Accra, Ghana,
sought to find reasons for the inability of African states to
attract a bigger share of the world's tourists and generate high
revenues from the industry.
</P>
<P>
The forum attended by about 1,500 delegates from over 40
countries around the world and representatives of multilateral
bodies was held under the theme "Africa: Tourist Destination for
the Next Millennium," the Ghana News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Madrid-based WTO have indicated that out
of global current and projected earnings from the tourism
industry, 60 percent remains within Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Africa's benefits from the tourism industry, however, account
for only two percent of the financial receipts in the whole world
and four percent of tourist arrivals, although the continent's
tourism sector is the fastest growing in the world.
</P>
<P>
Research has proved that Africa has the greatest potential to
be the leader in the global tourism industry, yet it is the lowest
beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the conference was to find ways and means to move
the tourism industry in Africa out of it present state and make
it what it should be, given the existing potential and resources.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda were the issues of human resource
development and availability of funds and a reliable information
base needed to facilitate the development and promotion of the
African tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Another significant issue on the agenda was safety in terms of
socio- political and environmental atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that too many barriers exist in the African
transport sector which tourists find very cumbersome. They thus
choose to spend their money at destinations where viable and less
cumbersome transport sectors exist.
</P>
<P>
High air fares, long processes in clearing tourists and their
luggage at entry points, poor roads, lack of an efficient rail
system and water transport, were the main transport barriers
identified.
</P>
<P>
African countries at the forum saw the necessity to consolidate
their strengths and collaborate with each other to develop their
tourism industry with emphasis on promoting cultural and
eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
They also saw the necessity to adopt a system of
multi-destination tourism, where tourists who enter the continent
at one point could continue to other countries with a single visa.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to reduce air fares, construct access routes to
tourists centers in their various countries, relax immigration and
customs regulations and checks, provide rail and water transport
facilities and ensure safety and sound security services.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Stresses Need to Develop ASEAN Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lieutenant General
Khin Nyunt stressed Friday the need to further coordinate and
develop ASEAN position on various issues to protect ASEAN
interest, pledging that Myanmar stands ready to work with ASEAN
fellow member countries as well as the international community to
work for a better future of the world.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC), made the remarks at the opening
ceremony of the two-day 13th ASEAN Labor Ministers' Meeting here
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the threshold of a new century. Moreover, in recent
years, the world has seen many rapid and fundamental changes that
impact on all corners of the globe," he noted, pointing out that
the process of globalization is already a reality, bringing with
it not only new prospects but also new challenges.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it becomes incumbent that each region and
each country must try to develop its full potential if it is not
to be marginalized.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the financial turmoil and economic slowdown
encountered in the Southeast Asia region during the last two
years, he refuted the attacks on Asian and ASEAN values and way of
life as well as some pessimistic predictions about the future of
ASEAN by some quarters even within the organization, saying that
these negative forecasts are without foundation.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Myanmar SPDC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe who
attended the Sixth ASEAN Summit in Hanoi last year, as reiterating
 that the principles and ideals set out by the ASEAN more than
three decades ago remain valid as ever, pointing out that the
setback of the last two years is temporary in nature and signs of
recovery are already emerging.
</P>
<P>
He expressed full confidence that in not too distant future,
the Southeast Asia region will regain its dynamism.
</P>
<P>
He warned that international organizations should not be used
as a forum to put pressure on ASEAN member states by the powerful
and influential quarters to fit their own political agenda.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Beats Netherlands in Women's Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The American women footballers
scored five goals against nil to beat the visiting Dutch women in
their soccer friendly in Milwaukee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tiffeny Milbrett scored one and assisted on three as the
American coach Tony DiCicco hailed it as "an awesome performance".
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm scored her 106th goal of her international career,
putting her into the second place of the best scorers, one goal
behind the record-holder Elisabetta Vignotto of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States dominated the first half by holding
the Netherlands without a shot, it only netted in once in the
first half as Milbrett scored her 56th career goal from a center
pass by Julie Foudy.
</P>
<P>
Dutch goalie Marleen Wissink denied the Americans an early lead
by blocking a free kick in the fourth minute by Brandi Chastain,
and an 18th-minute shot also from Chastain.
</P>
<P>
The United States missed two other chances when Chastain put
Hamm's corner kick over the crossbar, and again when Hamm hit the
post.
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Milbrett faked Wissink and passed in the 60
th minute to a wide-open Cindy Parlow, who tapped it in. Six
minutes later, she set up Kristine Lilly and Shannon MacMillan to
set off the scroing spree.
</P>
<P>
The United States will play the Netherlands again on Sunday in
Chicago to tune up for the uncoming World Cup slated on June 19.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Currency's Stability Has Firm Grounds: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The stability of the Chinese
currency, the renminbi, has firm grounds, Dai Xianglong, governor
of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of exchange rate formation mechanism and
the balance of payment position, the renminbi's exchange rate
stability has a solid basis, Dai said in a speech delivered at the
Conference on Central Banking Policies.
</P>
<P>
Dai used China's volume of foreign debt and foreign exchange
reserves and a number of other financial indicators to justify his
judgment.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1998, the balance of registered foreign debt
was around 146 billion U.S. dollars, up 11.5 percent from a year
ago, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that short-term debt accounted for less than 12
percent of the total amount. He also said that overseas-funded
enterprises owed 31 percent of the total value, with domestic
financial institutions and the Ministry of Finance owing 28.8
percent and 28.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The overall structure is reasonable," Dai said, adding that
both the debt service ratio and the debt ratio have also been kept
at reasonable levels.
</P>
<P>
He also said that China's foreign exchange reserves had
exceeded 146.7 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April, an amount
larger than the value needed to cover normal imports for a
12-month period.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve calculation does not include
China's gold reserves, positions in international financial
institutions and the foreign exchange positions of the country's
commercial banks, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
"In general, China's debt-servicing capacity is quite strong
and the stability of the Chinese yuan has a solid basis," he told
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Amid massive currency devaluation in countries hard hit by the
Asian financial crisis, which first broke out in Thailand in July
1997, the Chinese yuan has maintained its ground against the U.S.
dollar. It has been constantly quoted at around 8.28 to the U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, Dai said that in recent years the Chinese
economy has developed from a shortage economy to one with a broad
balance between demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese economy grew at an average of 10
percent between 1978 and 1998 and it is expected to continue to
expand at a relatively high rate during the coming one to two
years.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he expects China's economic growth rate
in the second quarter of this year to slow down from the first
quarter, when the gross domestic product expanded by 8.3 percent
on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
China's year-round economic growth will reach seven percent
this year, Dai said.

<P>
He added that the PBC will not establish any branch office in

Mainland financial institutions operating in Macao should abide
by laws and regulations of Macao and be regulated by the Macao
financial authority, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The governor also said that arrangements of financial matters
between the mainland and Macao will be handled in accordance with
international financial practices.
</P>

rules, Dai said.

He noted that the in line with relevant stipulations in the
Macao Basic Law, the mainland will continue to support the Macao
SAR to develop its international financial relations and
participate in the activities of international and regional
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Using the name of "Macao, China", Macao may participate in
international financial organizations or meetings whose membership

<HEADLINE> APEC Financiers Meet in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANGKAWI, Malaysia, May 14 (Xinhua) -- APEC Financiers Group
began its meeting here Friday to prepare proposals and
recommendations for consideration by APEC finance ministers at
their sixth meeting here on May 15-16.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the fifth in the series, represents part of the
continuing effort by private financiers of the APEC members to
contribute to the establishment of an equitable and efficient
global financial system.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the one-day meeting, Malaysian Second Finance
Minister Mustapa Mohamed said there is a growing consensus that
the weaknesses of the international financial system have to be
addressed in order to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said though there are signs that stability has gradually
returned to the financial markets and that the worst is over for
crisis-affected member economies, much remains to be done both at
the level of individual economies as well as at the regional and
international level, including APEC, if this recovery is to be
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there is "an urgent need to strengthen the
international financial architecture", otherwise "small and open
economies will continue to feel 'unsafe' in a global financial
market place where massive and volatile short-term capital flows
can still destabilize and undermine their economies."
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that the structural reforms we are pursuing
in line with the increasing integration of our financial markets
will be beneficial in the longer term," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the APEC Financiers Group will not only provide the
intellectual input and the necessary advice for consideration of
the APEC finance ministers and leaders but also develop new but
pragmatic approaches to be adopted by the private sector itself in
resolving and more importantly in preventing future financial
crises. "This is critical to the ultimate success of the proposed
changes to the international financial system." he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa therefore urged the APEC Financiers Group to assist the
APEC finance ministers not only by focusing their attention and
efforts on addressing existing issues in the APEC agenda but also
identifying emerging issues relating to the financial and capital
markets to increase the effectiveness of their process in shaping
policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Financiers Group was established in 1994 to advise the
APEC finance ministers on capital and financial market development
issues.
</P>
<P>
The group has initiated two significant initiatives -- one on
the development of the bond markets in APEC and the other on the
creation of a private sector training and education program for
financiers across the APEC region.
</P>
<P>
At the Langkawi meeting, the group is expected to develop a
plan of action for Asian bond markets development and update the
second initiative. The group is also expected to deliberate on how
to revitalize the financial system through institution building.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by all 21 members of the Association of
Asia Pacific Cooperation (APEC) -- Australia; Brunei; Canada;
Chile; China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; South Korea;
Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; the
Philippines; Russia; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; Thailand; the
United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels Train School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's separatist Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels have introduced a training
scheme for school children in areas under their control in the
north of the island country, government sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the attendance at these schools has dropped by 40
percent as parents fear the children will later be recruited into
the LTTE's fighting ranks, the sources.
</P>
<P>
The new idea of the LTTE may not only be to replenish its
cadres lost in confrontations with government troops but also
harbor the hope of either creating a bank of recruits or using
their services in other fields for their separate state which they
have been fighting for since 1983, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The training program is being conducted on school days from
8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. for teachers and senior students and from 4
p.m. to 6 p.m. daily for civilians aged 20 to 28.
</P>
<P>
On completion of training a card is issued to each of them
which entitles them to many benefits, it is said.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Suffers Heavy Losses From NATO Airstrikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Croatia has suffered 11 billion kuna
(1.5 billion U.S. dollars) of direct and indirect losses since
NATO launched airstrikes against neighboring Yugoslavia, local
press reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government held a meeting on Thursday to discuss
the problem of the economic losses, including an 800 million-
dollar loss in industrial sectors and an estimated loss between
260 and 370 million dollars in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, transportation, trade and other important economic
sectors were greatly affected by the airstrikes as contracts were
breached and trade volume and foreign investment fell.
</P>
<P>
A seasonal unemployment has hit about 20,000 Croatians in the
tourism sector as NATO bombs kept falling down on neighboring
Yugoslavia, and the Croatian government has to set aside 100
million dollars to subsidize them.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Silent Protest Against NATO Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SKOPJE, Macedonia, May 14 (Xinhua) -- As the evening is taking
over the day, candles are lit up in the square in downtown Skopje,
capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Facing a few dozens of burning candles, there stands a picture
showing two smiling toddlers sitting beside a toy train and
playing happily. Below the picture are a few lines of words
written in Macedonian.
</P>
<P>
No big crowds and no chanting of slogans. A small group of
Macedonians have been coming here in the dusk of every evening
over the past 40 days to stage their silent protest against the
cruel NATO bombings in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Goran Kovacevic, a 29-year-old Macedonian youth, said, "We are
mourning and praying for the souls who have been killed by NATO
bombings in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"The children, who look just like flowers, now have become the
targets of NATO air strikes." Kovacevic translated the words below
the picture for us.
</P>
<P>
"Every day we come here and stay from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. and we
want to show to NATO that we are against the war and we want peace
in the world," Kovacevic said.
</P>
<P>
They are also collecting signatures from passers-by. "In the
past 40 days, we have collected about 15,000 signatures from
people including some ethnic Albanians in the country," he said,
proud of the response they have received.
</P>
<P>
"We will present the signatures to all foreign embassies
including those of NATO countries just to show that people are
strongly opposed to the bombings," the young man said.
</P>
<P>
Petrovski Gjopgi, a retired musician in his sixties, said that
he was very sorry that NATO had attacked the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade with missiles and killed three Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I believe NATO did this to provoke China and it is a
crime."
</P>
<P>
"Every Macedonian is against NATO," the old man said.
</P>
<P>
Kovacevic also showed a placard which carries a Serb song. The
song, which he said was composed a week after the NATO bombing and
quickly became popular, is broadcast by a Macedonian television
every evening at 5 p.m. local time (1500 GMT)
</P>
<P>
"My name is Suncica,
</P>
<P>
 Sun is my name.
</P>
<P>
 I don't see it by day
</P>
<P>
 from the basement of darkness.
</P>
<P>
 I am Rastko.
</P>
<P>
 And I am very brave.
</P>
<P>
 But when I hear that sound,
</P>
<P>
 My cheeks are wet.
</P>
<P>
 We are praying for our hearts,
</P>
<P>
 Because the war is knocking on the door.
</P>
<P>
 We are asking for peace now
</P>
<P>
 to be in our country also.
</P>
<P>
 My name is Tania.
</P>
<P>
 My sister is Anja.
</P>
<P>
 And I am asking myself:
</P>
<P>
 What little Anja in the basement is dreaming?
</P>
<P>
 My name is Igor and I am really brave.
</P>
<P>
 But when I hear that sound
</P>
<P>
 My cheeks are wet."
</P>
<P>
Kovacevic, who translated this song from Serb into English for
us, said that they will continue the silent protest until the war
ends.

<HEADLINE> More Laborers in North China Turn to Private Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- More than one-third of the workers
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region who used to work
in the state-owned enterprises have now turned to the private
economy for employment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the autonomous region's Bureau of Labor
Resources show that the number of state-owned-enterprise workers
was reduces last year to around 1.33 million, from over 1.93
million, and many other local people have shifted their employment
from public to private businesses. The workers in the region in
individual and private firms increased by about 30 and 60 percent,
respectively, last year.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide reform of state-owned enterprises and the growth
of the public sector have prompted the displacement of the
region's laborers, and over 100,000 laid-off workers from state-
owned enterprises have now been re-employed by private and
individual businesses.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Over 60 percent of the region's enterprises have
changed their property ownership during the reform, with over 600
enterprises now out of the public sector through bidding, mergers,
auctions, and cooperation. The director of the region's Bureau of
Labor Resources said that approximately 140,000 laid-off workers
under the compensation system were able to meet their basic needs
through unemployment compensation, and over 100,000 have received
job training.
</P>
<P>
The region's economy has been developing in a healthy way, and
the competitiveness of state-owned enterprises has intensified,
the official said. At the same time, he added, the total assets of
the autonomous region's 36 major state-owned enterprises are now
27 percent greater than they were two years ago.

LONDON -- A British Committee said on Thursday that NATO's any
land invasion into Yugoslavia would be catastrophic. It strongly
urged NATO to negotiate a settlement to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a British Member of Parliament (MP) from the Labor Party in the
House of Commons, said in a statement that it was time now for
NATO to admit that its bombing against Yugoslavia "has failed." (

LONDON -- U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
said on Thursday she was concerned that there had been "too many
mistakes" in NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview by BBC Television on her return to Geneva on
Thursday night, the former Irish president said she had worried
about the civilian casualties caused by the air campaigns by NATO
in Yugoslavia.
</P>

When asked about the result of NATO's air-strike, Mrs Robinson
said the bombing "seems almost unfocused." (Robinson--Concern-

plunged the nation into a fresh bout of political crisis by firing
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his cabinet.

Blair arrived to accept a German prize.

<HEADLINE> Czech-Moravian Communist Party Condemns NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Miroslav Grebenicek, chairman of the
Central Committee of the Czech-Moravian Communist Party, called on
Chinese Ambassador to Prague Yan Peng on Thursday and handed him a
statement, strongly condemning the U.S.-led NATO for its missile
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The bombing against Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO (North
Atlantic Treaty Organization) is itself a gross violation of the
international laws and the United Nations Charter, and is
obviously a barbaric act of aggression, which cannot be denied,
the party said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade late May 7 was an unprecedented incident in the world
diplomatic history, the statement said it pointed to the fact that
NATO, particularly the United States, went one step further with
their policies of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Grebenicek said that his party strongly condemned the brutal
action of bombing against Yugoslavia, and reiterated that the only
way for solving the conflict was to stop bombing immediately and
to resume negotiations among the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Grebenicek also expressed his deep condolence over the death of
the three Chinese journalists killed in the NATO attack last
Friday night.

BRASILIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fenanado
Enrique Cardoso on Thursday congratulated Peru and Ecuador upon
the formal definition of their long-disputed common border.
</P>
<P>
In a message of congratulations to the presidents of Peru and
Ecuador, Cardoso said Thursday that it is a joyful occasion not
only for Peruvians and Ecuadorians, but also for the entire Latin
American region, which is collectively striving for peace,
democracy and integration.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held Thursday morning in Cahuide, Peru, where the
rivers Yaupi and Santiago converge, Ecuadorian President Jamil
Mahuad and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori signed the final
documents of border definition.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was the culmination of a peace treaty signed last
October to end the border dispute which led to wars between Peru
and Ecuador in 1941, 1985 and 1995. Brazil is one of the guarantor
countries of the peace deal, together with Argentina, Chile and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso attributed the successful solution of the dispute to
diplomatic conversations and the determination and the strong
sense of history shown by the leaders of the countries concerned.

HAIKOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 449 species of butterflies live
in the Jianfengling tropic woodland in Hainan Province, making the
area a kingdom of the colorful insect.
</P>
<P>
Among the butterfly species, 35 are newly recorded in China,
according to one expert, and the butterflies can be divided into
201 categories.
</P>
<P>
The most common butterfly found here is grey butterfly, which
has 124 species, the expert said, adding that the beautiful
phoenix and white butterfly have 42 and 37 species respectively.
</P>
<P>
There are also a number of rare species including the largest,
the golden phoenix, with a wingspan of 160 mm, and the smallest,
the blessing, with a 10 mm wingspan.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can sometimes see thousands of the insects gathering
together like a long butterfly stream floating through a ten-
kilometer-long valley of the rainforest.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called for strict protection for the tropical
forest because it plays as an important role in the propagation
and growth of the butterfly.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's GDP Down 0.99 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic product (
GDP) registered a fall of 0.99 percent in the first quarter of
this year against the same period of last year, said a report of
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the fourth quarter of last year, the GDP
had a growth of 1.02 percent, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the downward GDP to a 4.55 percent fall
in industry and a 0.20 percent fall in services.
</P>
<P>
The farming and livestock sector enjoyed a growth of 9.22
percent in the first three months of this year from the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and Brazil last year, Brazil's GDP this year would have
a negative growth of between 3.5 and 4 percent. Meanwhile, the IMF
is to offer an international rescue deal amounting to 41.5 billion
U.S. dollars for the country's struggling economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and Peru on Thursday
officially put an end to their border dispute lasting more than
160 years, as the last milestone was placed on the Condor mountain
range on the common border in Cahuide.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador and Alberto Fujimori of Peru
traveled to a ceremony in the border city and signed the final
documents, putting into effect a peace agreement they concluded in
Brazil on October 26, 1998 that fixed the two nations' common
border.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Peru cedes Tiwinza, a one-square-kilometer
area, to Ecuador as private property while withholding sovereignty.
The status of Tiwinza had touched off a border war between the two
countries in 1995, in which some 100 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, a total of 30 milestones have been
placed along the common border by a joint commission of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission, consisting of representatives from the armed
forces and foreign ministries of Ecuador and Peru, was also in
charge of removal of mines in the border area.

HELSINKI, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Kosovo Envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here Thursday evening for a short visit,
during which he held talks with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari
and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen on the Kosovo crisis in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's visit was regarded by the Finnish political
circle to have something to do with speculations that Ahtisaari
would like to act as the European Union's mediator to the Kosovo
issue, which worsened since NATO began bombing of Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Details of their talks were not revealed, but Chernomyrdin was
reported to stress that the settlement of the Kosovo conflict
needed a broader political basis.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this week, French President Jacques
Chirac and U.S. Under Secretary of State Strobe Talbott visited
Finland one after another in hope that Finland would play a role
in the political settlement of the Balkan conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari, who once had
expressed willingness to act as EU envoy for a peaceful solution
to the Kosovo problem, would head for Belgrade recently to meet
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the matter.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Debt Relief Package for Guyana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, together with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has agreed to support a
package of debt relief that will reduce the external debt of
Guyana by 256 million U.S. dollars in Net Present Value (NPV)
terms, the bank announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 27 million dollars will be provided by the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The substantial resources released from the debt relief package
will provide room for additional expenditures by the government of
Guyana in social and poverty alleviation areas, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Guyanese authorities have taken corrective measures to
partially offset the adverse economic effects caused by the
atmospheric condition El Nino, the East Asian crisis, and domestic
political disturbances in 1998, and have committed to use the
assistance received under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative prudently, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Based on end-1998 data, after HIPC assistance, Guyana's NPV
debt-to-exports ratio is estimated to decline from 151 percent to
115 percent, thus helping reduce the vulnerability of the economy
to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative, which was endorsed by the World Bank and
the IMF in September 1996, is designed to provide exceptional
assistance to eligible countries following sound economic policies
to help them reduce their external debt burden to sustainable
levels.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The agriculture sector of the
Philippines posted a rebound in the first quarter of the year
registering a growth of 2.69 percent, the Business World newspaper
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials were quoted as saying the figure signals
the start of the sector's full recovery.
</P>
<P>
The sector's growth was fueled by the record-level harvest in
rice and corn as well as the notable performance of the hog
sector, Acting Agriculture Secretary William Dar said.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the growth of 2.69 percent as against the record low
performance of negative 5.11 percent a year earlier, is a strong
signal that the government will be able to meet its target of a
full recovery of the sector by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government expects an even better performance from the
agriculture sector in the second quarter as well as a sustained
growth in the following quarter, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said
the positive performance of the agriculture sector is an assurance
that the government will be able to meet its growth of at least
0.8 percent in the first quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> World's First Cloned Pig to Be Born Within Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The world's first cloned pig should
be born within months, British scientists predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Geron Bio-Med, a commercial spin-off of the
Scotland-based Roslin Institute which produced Dolly the Sheep,
told BBC they believed that cloned pigs will arrive by early 2000
at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ian Wilmutt, who helped develop the cloning
technology known as nuclear transfer that produced Dolly, said he
was hopeful of seeing cloned piglets "later this year or early in
the new millennium".
</P>
<P>
The scientists hoped that eventually they could modify the
technology to make other pig clones whose organs can be
transplanted into humans.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are many more patients needing a transplant
than there are donor organs available, and scientists believe pigs
could fill this tissue gap.
</P>
<P>
Geron Bio-Med also believes its cloning technology is the key
to producing animal tissue that is safe to use in humans, which
the company hopes would help overcome the problems of rejection in
organ transplant.

<HEADLINE> Too Many Mistakes in NATO Bombing--UN Rights Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) - U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson said on Thursday she was concerned that there
had been "too many mistakes" in NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview by BBC Television on her return to Geneva on
Thursday night, the former Irish president said she had warried
about the civilian casualties caused by the air campaigns by NATO
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the result of NATO's airstrike, Mrs Robinson
said the bombing "seems almost unfocused."
</P>
<P>
"The range of targets seems very broad. And quite clearly
civilian residences, hospitals and schools have felt the effects
of the bombing. There are too many mistakes." she added.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable that civilians are so much in the
frontline. It is happening in modern conflicts," she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about last month's attack on the Belgrade television
station, she said "I was very distressed by that particular
example because it was known that there were people in that
building and they were killed -- journalists, make-up artists.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable particularly because it is possible to
prevent communications through targeting transmitters," she said,
calling for constant vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to meet Robinson
when she visited Belgrade earlier on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Land Invasion Would Turn Disaster Into Catastrophe-- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A British Committee said on Thursday
that NATO's any land invasion into Yugoslavia would be
catastrophic. It strongly urged NATO to negotiate a settlement to
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon,
a British Member of Parliament (MP) from the Labour Party in the
House of Commons, said in a statement that it was time now for
NATO to admit that its bombing against Yugoslavia "has failed".
</P>
<P>
"There are just two alternatives (form NATO). A land invasion
which would turn disaster into catastrophe, adding simply untold
numbers of NATO soldiers to the growing list of casualties. The
other alternative is stop bombing, and negotiate a settlement,"
the statement, which was issued on Thursday afternoon, said.
</P>
<P>
The committee said the negotiation should "under the auspices
of the United Nations" and "allows for the safe return of the
refugees and their protection by a genuinely neutral international
force."
</P>
<P>
Tony Benn, a senior Labour Party MP, also pointed out in the
statement that the air war can not succeed and that the United
States Senate had not approved an invasion.
</P>
<P>
"The route to a diplomatic solution through the UN had been
closed off (by NATO). That is why the peace movement is so
important," Tony Benn said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1993, the Committee is always working to promote
peace and reconciliation in the Balkan countries. Several MPs,
from both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, are members
in the Committee.

closing high of 11,031.59 last Friday. The index rose more than 21

percent but the index's core rate was up a mer 0.1 percent in
April, retail sales rose 0.1 percent in the same period and
unemployment remains 4.3 percent this month.

index rose 3.56 to 1,367.56, also a record high. But the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 24.54 at 2,582.00 on
profit taking after the index rose 134.26 points in the past four
trading days.

Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.04 to 800.39. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.58 to 450.84.
</P>

the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,836 up, 1.199 down and 542i
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 785.34 million shares from 824.01
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions Cuts "on Target" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Harmful greenhouse gas emissions in
Britain have dropped by 9 percent between 1990 and 1997, the
British Government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This new figures showed that the UK is well on target to meet
its goal of reducing emissions of six such pollutants by 12.5
percent by the period 2008-2012, said Michael Meacher, Britain's
Environment Minister.
</P>
<P>
Meacher added that Britain was also on track to meet its
obligations under a global agreement to combat climate change.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to meet our commitments under the Kyoto
Protocol to cut greenhouse gases and also to move beyond this
towards our goal of reducing our national carbon dioxide emissions
by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2010," he said.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the UK signed the accord at a United Nations
global warming conference in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The promise was part of an effort by the world's industrialized
countries to cut global emissions by more than 5 percent from 1990
levels over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide contributes to about 60 percent of the potential
global warming effects caused by man-made emissions of greenhouse
gases around the world.
