<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China enjoy a
brand-new and politically mature partnership, a senior official of
the Russian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin made the remark during
an interview with the Interfax news agency, one day before Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's scheduled Sunday visit to China. It will
be Yeltsin's third China tour since he was elected president in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Karasin cited, as as an example of the maturity of
Russian-Chinese relations, the agreement on the build-up of
confidence in the military field in border areas of the two
countries. The agreement was also signed with Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, in 1996 in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister described the five-nation agreement as an
international precedent and said it was also of great importance
to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent visit to
the United States, Karasin said Russia noticed that the leaders of
both countries stressed the importance of cooperation with Russia
in dealing with strategic issues.

dam area of the Three Gorges project, has been immersed in
festivity this evening after the main channel of the Yangtze was
blocked.
</P>
<P>
Residents swarmed to the cultural center and the gymnasium to
watch performances. Inside the fully-packed 1000-seat theater,
builders of the project staged theatrical items of their own
creation at the party titled the "Songs of Three Gorges Project
builders, whereas artists of the Oriental Song and Dance Ensemble
from Beijing performed song and dance items, opera pieces and
varied folk art forms in their tribute to the project builders.
</P>

Meanwhile, a display of breath-taking fireworks lit up the
night sky around 10:00 PM for some 20 minutes as part of the
celebrations for this successful end to the first-phase
construction of the world's largest water control scheme.

Moreover, visitors from far and wide, including many displaced
locals, have come to watch the blocking process during the daytime

<HEADLINE> France to Toughen Law for Trucking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A draft law aimed at improving
working conditions of truck drivers, in the aftermath of the
latest labor conflict in trucking industry, is to be tabled by the
French government.
</P>
<P>
At the proposal of Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot,
the government on Monday will discuss the draft law at a cabinet
session. The session will be chaired by President Jacques Chirac,
the Elysee presidential palace said today.
</P>
<P>
The draft law will also toughen punishment for violation of
labor rights by trucking companies, such as imposing over-long
working hours with low pay.
</P>
<P>
Most of the road barriers were lifted Friday night after the
biggest union of truck drivers, the Confederation Francaise
Democratique du Travail (CGDT), signed a protocol agreement
proposed by trucking employers.
</P>
<P>
However, the six-day conflict caused millions of dollars in
losses to the trucking industries in France and neighboring
countries, raised concern across Europe, and drew worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
In last year's strike, French truck drivers forced the
government to agree to early retirement of truckers at the age of
55.
</P>
<P>
This time, the trucking employers agreed to raise the pay of
drivers by three to six percent immediately, and raise their
monthly wage for 200 working hours to 10,000 francs (1,666 U.S.
dollars) by the year 2,000, and guarantee minimum hourly wages.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Football Federation
today appointed Valdeir Vieria, a Brazilian, as the new
head coach for the Iranian national team, the official
news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President of the Iranian Football Federation Darioush
Mostafavi made the appointment hours after he sacked Mohammad
Mayeli Kohan following the team's crucial setback yesterday to
Qatar in a World Cup Asian zone Group A qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Vieria, who is currently the coach of the Iranian national
youth team, has 35 years of experience as a player and head
coach, IRNA said, he has played in Brazil, France, Belgium,
Algeria and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Vieria once served as a coach in Germany for eight years and
has trained several famous German football teams. He also had
experience as a coach in Brazil, Venezuela, Costa Rica and El
Salvador.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his appointment, Vieria said that Iran has many
talented players who can challenge European rivals.
</P>
<P>
The former chief coach and his assistants were dismissed by
their "weak performance and failure to fully organize the team
and individual capabilities of the players of the national team,"
a press release by the Iranian Football Federation said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian team was defeated on Friday in Doha by the Qatari
team with 0-2.

<P>
PAILIN, Cambodia, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held
here today to mark the establishment of a new municipality in an
area formerly controlled by the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The Pailin municipality, the fourth to come directly under the
central government, will have Ei Chien, a former Khmer Rouge
general, as its mayor.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the ceremony were First Prime Minister
Ung Huot, deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng and former Khmer Rouge
leader Ieng Sary.
</P>
<P>
The special representative of the United Nations
Secretary-General to Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, foreign diplomats
based in Cambodia and representatives of neighboring Thailand were
also invited to the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Pailin, famous for its precious stones, was a former part of
Battambang province, lying on the border with Thailand. The
municipality, with an area of 800 kilometers and a population of
35,000, served as the most important military stronghold of the
Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the former Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary and
several thousand fighters broke with hardliners of the Khmer Rouge
and turned to the Royal government. As a result, control of the
area in eastern and western parts of the country, including
Pailin, was turned over to the government.
</P>
<P>
The other three municipalities are Phnom Penh, Sihanouk and
Kep.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Blames Israel for Washington Talks Flop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today praised the
U.S. drive to revive the peace process and blamed the Israeli
government for ruining the international mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa made the statement following a
tete-a-tete meeting between President Hosni Mubarak and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat this morning.
</P>
<P>
The talks covered the latest developments of the Mideast peace
process and followed up the just-concluded peace negotiations held
in Washington between Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and
Palestine Liberation Organization deputy head Mahmoud Abbas (Abu
Mazen), Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to Moussa, Arafat told Mubarak that Washington talks
were "negative" and that "no progress" at all was reached
regarding issues like Israeli troops' redeployment in West Bank,
the suspension of Jewish settlements, and the building of airport
and sea port in Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that he will preside over a Palestinian leadership
meeting today to hear the Palestinian negotiating team's report on
the outcome of Washington talks which were held last week under
the U.S. auspices.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Arafat expressed his appreciation of the
U.S. efforts to save the foundering peace process asserting the
importance of the continuation of the role, especially under the
strategic ideas announced by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
last summer on exerting pressure to freeze Israeli settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister blamed the failure of all the
U.S. peace efforts so far on Israel's negative stands.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has shown a negative stand towards all issues raised
for discussion, whether those connected with essential matters
that could really salvage the peace march or minor matters that
should have been settled a long time ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor Osama
el-Baz, today called for stepped-up international efforts for the
peace process which is now threatened to be halted completely.
</P>
<P>
Baz also said that Egypt appreciates the U.S. interest in
realizing security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said any tangible positive results now depends on Israel's
response to these efforts.
</P>
<P>
An enlarged session, grouping Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
al-Ganzouri, Moussa, Baz, Palestinian National Council member
Marawan Kanafany and Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Rdeina, was held
here following the summit talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has left here for home after a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
No tangible achievements were made in the Washington talks, but
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to hold
separate talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu soon. The time and venues have not been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement issue, together with Israel's delay in
further troop redeployments in the West Bank, are the leading
obstacles blocking progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a key mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian talks,
which was stalemated after Netanyahu embarked on building a new
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM in Saudi Arabia to Boost Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto arrived in Saudi capital city of Riyadh today on
a two-day official visit to the world top oil producer.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, whose visit to the Gulf Kingdom is the second of its
kind by a Japanese Premier since his predecessor Tomiichi
Murayama's Saudi tour in 1995, is due to hold talks with Saudi
King Fahd later today on bilateral cooperation, according to
Kuwait News Agency reports from Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto would propose to King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz during
their talks a new framework for comprehensive partnership as
visioned by Japan for the 21st century, the reports said, quoting
Japanese diplomats in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports 925,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi
Arabia, meeting 20 percent of the Japanese needs of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade, mainly oil purchase by Japan, amounted to
11.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 with the balance tilting in
favor of Saudi Arabia by some 7.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current Japanese investments in joint ventures in Saudi
Arabia are at 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Hashimoto is expected to
propose an agreement for the protection of investments between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto would also seek a renewal of the oil extraction
concession by the Japanese leading oil firm the Arab Oil Company
which has been independently operating at Khafji oil field in the
neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The concession which enables the Japanese company extract
184,000 barrels of crude oil per day expires before the end
of this century. Hashimoto is highly hopeful to obtain a
pledge from the Saudi leadership to renew the concession.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto is also expected to discuss with Saudi leaders the
deadlocked Middle East peace process and the current situation
of the Gulf region. Tokyo has been strategically concerned
about stability in the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Control of Tropical Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The on-going conference on the
nutritional aspects of tropical diseases entered its third day
today with scientists discussing the effect of diet on malaria
and other parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Among a series of lectures presented is one by Nigerian Nze
Aguwa in which Aguwa noted that malaria and AIDS are worldwide
public health problems whose severity is increased by
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
"Malnutrition is a common complication of malaria and AIDS and
contributes significantly to their morbidity and mortality," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A research conducted in Nigeria showed that severe malaria
necessitated blood transfusion and anaemia in such cases was
usually caused by malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Aguwa recommended that intervention strategies are necessary
to decrease malaria-related complications, mortality and prevent
the possibility of AIDS infection during blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
Noble Nweze, a lecturer from University of Nigeria, said the
present overall macro-economic environment in Africa is
unfavorable to the people in spite of the fact that the
macro-economic policies had been directed to increase food
production.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to adjust policies on the nutritional
status of the poor as well as increase food security.
</P>
<P>
The four-day conference sponsored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is
focusing on the importance of micro-nutrients in the prevention
and control of tropical diseases.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of its kind held in Africa, also
discussed nutritional and health aspects of traditional African
diets and anti-oxidant properties of essential indigenous oils
and ethnic foods.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Public Hospitals to Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Medical professionals in Jordan's
public hospitals would go on strike Monday for the second time in
the month for getting their 60 percent share of revenues collected
from rich patients, a strike organizer said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,500 employees in 22 public hospitals and 650 health
centers would stage a two-hour work stoppage Monday, Bssem Dajani,
president of the Jordan Medical Association (JMA) told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The professionals were "working under unacceptable conditions,
financially and technically," and they urgently needed money, said
Dajani.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ministry of Health and Medical Care promised in an
agreement signed with the JMA in 1996 to pay medical professionals
60 percent of the annual revenues of the treatment fees collected
from rich people.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry said recently that it would only give 36
percent.
</P>
<P>
The JMA, together with the Jordan Dentist Association and the
Jordan Pharmacist Association, organized a three-day strike at the
start of this month.
</P>
<P>
"Work stoppage is just a means to express our anger" and to
pressurize the government to keep its promise, said Dajani, adding
that they would not stop fighting until achieving the aim.
</P>
<P>
Poor people and government employees in Jordan are treated free
of charge in public hospitals and health centers, while the rich
would have to pay.
</P>
<P>
The annual revenues collected from rich patient-paid treatment
fees are estimated at about 7 million dinars (about 10 million
U.S. dollars), according to JMA's figures.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein President Plays Down Party Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
today played down dissent in his party and unrest in its Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla arm over peace moves in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that the resignation of 12 members from the
party in the past week over the republican movement's commitment
to non-violence was a risk to the peace effort in the
British-ruled province. Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA
which has been fighting for the independence of Northern Ireland
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Coming at a time when there has been no real movement in the
peace process beyond most of the parties actually getting into the
same room -- of course all of this is risky, it is dangerous,"
Adams said in an interview with the BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Adams was making his first public comment on the resignations
of 12 Sinn Fein leaders this week and reports that 20 key IRA
activists had stormed out of the underground extremist group.
</P>
<P>
Adams said there could be more walkouts but he insisted there
would be no mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
The walkouts were in protest at Sinn Fein's support for a code
of non-violence which hardliners fear could lead to an eventual
handover of guerrilla weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein signed up to the code in September to gain entry for
the first time to all-party peace talks aimed at ending 28 years
of guerrilla violence and finding a political settlement in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The dissent within the IRA has caused particular concern about
the strength of the IRA truce -- renewed in July after a break of
almost two years. But the IRA said in a statement that the truce
was "totally intact."

<HEADLINE> Japanese Firms in UK Must Change Culture: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies in Britain
must fundamentally review the way they deal with their employees
if they are to be as successful in the 21st century as they were
in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion drawn by the accountancy firm Arthur
Andersen from its survey of 61 Japanese companies, which included
500 Japanese expatriates in Britain.
</P>
<P>
In particular, due to unique cultural issues, the report
suggests that Japanese companies may have to relax work styles and
blend local and Japanese skills together.
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies, the report proposes, should consider
developing a management style more aligned to recent changes in
the UK market place.
</P>
<P>
Rober Hodkinson at Arthur Andersen said, "Now that other
companies have responded to the challenge, Japanese companies need
to consider new areas of differentiation to compete effectively in
the next century."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Arabs Not to Quarrel With Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Arab countries should not launch media
campaigns against each other.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the criticism carried by Qatari media over
Egypt's lukewarm attitude towards an Arab-Israeli economic
conference to be held in Doha on 16-18 this month.
</P>
<P>
"Differences in views should not let people bear grudges
against each other and should not be allowed to drag them into
ridiculous quarrels," Moussa said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt-Qatar relations would be kept even at the least
possible levels so as not to adversely affect the always tense
inter-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
Cairo hinged its participation of the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) on progress in the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was also furious over a Qatari ban enacted last month on the
entry of nationals of 10 countries, including Egypt, to the Gulf
state as a security precaution for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Egypt recalled Ambassador Mohammed Menissi to Qatar, who left
Doha Friday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday that there is
not one nation that wants to send its leader to the MENA
conference and that "the Qatari people themselves are dissatisfied
with the situation."
</P>
<P>
The annual gathering, the fourth since 1994 as a spinoff of the
peace process, was designed to promote regional economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But it has been overshadowed by a crisis in the peace process,
which has been sparked by Jewish settlement building activities in
East Jerusalem since last March.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Demands Compensations from Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of
Information and Culture, Walter Ofonagoro, has called on Britain
to pay reparations to Nigeria for 500 years of exploration.
</P>
<P>
While receiving an interview by the News Agency of Nigeria in
Abuja on Friday, the minister said Britain should compensate
Nigeria for violating its human rights during the slave trade and
colonial periods.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is known as a major dealer in slave trade," he said,
adding "Those who colonized us by force can not accuse us of
human rights violations. They should hide their faces in shame."
</P>
<P>
Ofonagoro accused the British colonial rulers of imposing
racial segregation in Nigeria and discriminating against
Nigerians in their own fatherland.
</P>
<P>
The minister also defended the government's position in press
freedom, saying that the recent approval of licenses for nine
private radio stations was a concrete demonstration of press
freedom in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Britain have been having a sour relations in the
last few years, due to the latter's tough positions in democracy
and human rights issues.

<HEADLINE> 4 Bombs Explode in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Four bombs allegedly planted by
Israelis went off today in south Lebanon, killing a villager's 35
heads of livestocks. But no people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese National News Agency said that the bombs were planted
by Israeli troops in the suburbs of Nabatiyeh, the country's
southern city facing the Israeli self-styled "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The site of the explosions is just one kilometer away from the
border of the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone, which was set up
by Israel in 1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Following the explosion, the south command of the Shiite
Muslim Amal Movement, Lebanon's second most active anti-Israeli
military group, issued a statement, accusing Israel for violating
civilians rights.
</P>
<P>
But there were no comments on the blast from Israel and
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, which is spearheading the fighting to
oust the 1,200 Israeli soldiers from the buffer zone.

<P>
CAIRO, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Queen Beatrix of Holland is
scheduled to pay a three-day visit here from November 17 to fresh
up bilateral relations and European-Arab coordination in the
Mideast peace process, the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the MENA, Dutch Ambassador to Egypt
Ronaldo Rudotoday today voiced his country's endorsement of the
Egyptian efforts to support the Mideast peace process and open new
channels to face up to obstacles of the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Queen
Beatrix are expected to cover the current crisis of the Mideast
peace process and the European role in ending the stagnation, and
also ways to promote cooperation between the two countries,
especially in the economic domains, Rudotoday said.
</P>
<P>
The queen will be accompanied by a 17-member delegation led by
Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo, who will hold talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Holland offers Egypt 18 million U.S. dollars worth of annual
technical aid in the fields of water, agriculture, sanitary
drainage, woman and health care and environment, the Dutch
diplomat told MENA.
</P>
<P>
The annual bilateral trade volume stands at 1 billion florin
(500 million U.S. dollars), with Holland exporting 800 million
florin (400 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The northwestern European kingdom is the second largest
exporter of agricultural crops to Egypt after the United States,
he said, adding that agricultural and industrial equipment, means
of transportation, cereal, cheese and ships used to clear the Suez
Canal are among the other exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holland imports from Egypt vegetables, fruit,
cotton, chemical materials, pharmaceuticals, textiles and
petroleum.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Council on Military Reform Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A number of important military
reform issues have been fixed by the Russian Defense Council after
a series of recent bilateral and multilateral meetings, the
Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior Defense Ministry official, as many as 14
departments have had "troops of their own," into which draftees
were sent. Now, the source said, conscripts will join mainly the
armed forces, interior troops and the federal border service.
</P>
<P>
The senior official said one major result of these meetings was
the formulation of a number of points on border service reform,
according to which border districts would be abolished, regional
border service departments would be set up and border troops would
become a special border service contingent, with regional border
control departments no longer having heavy military equipment and
costly systems of logistics support.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this process will proceed in stages and will be
different at various sections of the borders of Russia and those
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries where Russian
border guards are on duty, the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that as a serious step toward military reform, the
Defense Council discussed how the troops of the Ministry for
Emergency Situations might be transformed into a State Rescue
Service element.
</P>
<P>
When it comes to alleviating the consequences of emergencies,
the transformed emergency troops would sharply step up their
interaction with special engineering, radiation, chemical and
biological defense units, the report cited the senior officail as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Council also discussed ways of reforming the
interior troops and turning them into a federal guard, subordinate
to the Interior Ministry, patterned on the carabineers' corps in
Italy, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the president has instructed Defense Council
Secretary Andrei Kokoshinand and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov
to draft appropriate documents with active help from the General
Staff.
</P>
<P>
The official disclosed that though real progress in military
reform is planning, the so-called "power departments" are still at
odds on quite a few points.

BERLIN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana proposed here today to set up a new, well-armed
international police force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on European affairs in Berlin today,
Solana said that the current multinational police force of about
1,700 police officers in Bosnia, whose mandate would expire at the
end of the year, were not in a position to cope with future
challenges.
</P>
<P>
"A regularly armed and well-funded international police force,
which would be available at short notice, would significantly
improve our ability of effective crisis management," said Solana
at the seminar organized by the German Herbert Quandt Foundation
and the British Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief today also reiterated his demand that the
multinational peacekeeping force SFOR should remain in Bosnia even
after its mandate expires in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tremendous mistake, a catastrophe, if the
international community did not maintain its commitment in the
coming months," he said.

JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 Israelis
tonight gathered at the plaza where former prime minister Yitzhak
Rabin was assassinated in Tel Aviv two years ago to remember him.
</P>
<P>
Today's commemorative rally is part of the extensively
memorial events for Rabin, which were launched on November 4 and
will last until next Wednesday, the assassination day according to
Hebrew calendar.
</P>
<P>
People from across the country chanted peace slogans and
holding signs reading "Peace Now" at the square, which was renamed
in Rabin's honor after he was shot dead at a peace rally on
November 4, 1995,
</P>
<P>
In the gathering, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak called on all
Israelis to remember Rabin and make efforts to bring peace to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Barak vowed to continue the peace process, which was started
with Rabin's landmark peace deals with the Palestinians, saying
that he will proceed with Rabin's work until the peace is achieved
and the violence is eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's widow Leah and other senior officials also attended
the meeting to pay their tribute to Rabin, who was felled by
right-wing religious gunman Yial Amir. Amir branded the former war
hero a traitor for handing to the Palestinians West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
Many Leftists accuse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
who vigorously opposed Rabin's peace deal while in opposition, of

that led to the murder" when he addresses the memorial Knesset

of walia ibex and red fox species in Ethiopia's northern Semein
Mountains National Park have been on increase, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a census conducted this year as saying that
walia ibex, which numbered 280 three years before, has reached
429 in the park, while the number of red fox which was estimated
at only two to five some years ago has reached more than seven.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, out of the 218 animals and bird species that dwell
in the park, 26 are endemic. The endemic animals include various
species of rats, red fox, gelada baboon and walia ibex while the
birds include abssinia cat bird and others.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rise in the number of endemic
animals to the reconstruciton of three camps in the park which
had been destroyed by war and tightened protection.
</P>
<P>
The park covers an area of 179 square kilometers and was
registered as world heritage by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organizations in 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, november 8 (Xinhua) -- The Baltic Assembly ended its
two-day session in Vilnius today with the adoption of 10
documents, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from Vilnius,
capital of Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Among the documents, three special resolutions concern
cooperation between the Baltic states with the European Union and
NATO and their relations with Russia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A document on Moscow's proposal on security guarantees for the
Baltic states and confidence-building measures said, "The Baltic
Assembly welcomes the Russian Federation's initiative to improve
relations with the three Baltic countries and states that
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia see their security within the
framework of European security system and EU and NATO membership."
</P>
<P>
The adopted resolution on the Baltic states' trans-Atlantic
integration called on the parliaments and governments of 16 NATO
member countries "to immediately move on to the next stage of
Alliance enlargement and include Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,
not laer than 1999, in the second group of countries invited to
begin accession talks with NATO."
</P>
<P>
The session's participants elected Ernest Jurkans of Latvia the
Baltic Assembly Presidium chairman to replace Lithuanian
parliamentarian Mecis Laurinkus.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President to Meet Sudanese Negotiators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi is scheduled to meet next Tuesday with delegations of the
Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
currently attending peace talks in Nairobi, sources close to the
talks said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the two Sudanese warring sides would meet
next Monday to draft a communique to be released after their
Tuesday meeting with Moi.
</P>
<P>
A Sudanese government source said that the peace talks would
resume early next year.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door peace talks started here on October 29. Both
sides have agreed to a news blackout on the talks which were
aimed at finding a solution to the 14-year civil war in Africa's
largest country.
</P>
<P>
However, it was disclosed that during the talks, the SPLA
raised a series of demands for resolving the civil war in a
document on November 5.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, southern Sudan should vote on
self-determination in two years and during that time the country
should be divided into a "confederation" of north and south which
will be governed by a central authority.
</P>
<P>
After plenary talks on Monday and Wednesday, mediator Kalonzo
Musyoka, Kenyan Foreign Minister, met Salva Kiir, head of SPLA
delegation and Sudanese government team leader, Foreign Minister
Ali Osman Mohammad Taha respectively.
</P>
<P>
The talks were brokered by Kenyan President Moi in his
capacity as chairman of the regional Inter-Governmental Authority
on Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
During an IGAD summit last July in Nairobi, the Sudanese
government accepted the Declaration of Principles drafted by IGAD
leaders in 1994 as the basis for peace talks, making it possible
to re-start the IGAD mediation for ending the civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and
made tens of thousands displaced since 1983 when the SPLA rose to
fight against Islamic-backed Khartoum power for a secular state
and more autonomy in Christian-dominated south.

BERLIN, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev today criticized the military doctrine of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), saying that it was
"still based on a possible confrontation between the East and
West."
</P>
<P>
The failure of NATO to adapt its military doctrine to the new
political realities was "a threatening factor and gives rise to
mistrust," Avdeyev was quoted by the German news agency DPA as
speaking at a seminar in Berlin today.
</P>
<P>
"There is a gap between the political philosophies of NATO and
its buildup as military instrument," he added.
</P>
<P>
As an example for a possible new approach, he reiterated
Moscow's proposal that Russia could work together with NATO to
create regional security systems for the Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
The seminar in Berlin, called the Europe Forum, was organized
by the German Herbert Quandt Foundation and the British business
daily Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the seminar today, a number of eastern
European leaders, including Romanian President Emil Constantinescu
and Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Boshkov, called for
joint efforts by eastern and western European nations to combat
organized crime.

KUWAIT CITY, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi today arrived in Jeddah, Red Sea port city of Saudi
Arabia, starting a multi-leg Gulf tour on a mission to boost or
mend ties with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He would deliver messages from Iran's President Mohammad
Khatami to Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during his visit, the Kuwaiti News Agency
quoted Iran's Ambassador to the kingdom Mohammad Ridha Nouri as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi would meet with the Saudi leaders and Foreign Minister
Prince Saud Al-Faisal Sunday in the capital Riyadh to discuss
regional issues and means of fostering bilateral relations in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
The current situations in the Middle East, the Gulf region,
Iraq, and Islamic issues of mutual concern would be high on the
agenda of their talks, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
After Saudi Arabia, Kharrazi will travel to the other five Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates and Oman.
</P>
<P>
His tour is apparently a part of the country's efforts in
trying to strike a good relationship with its neighbors while
addressing various problems, like territorial disputes and
religious affairs, with them.
</P>
<P>
Khatami had instructed Kharrazi to convey the GCC states'
leaders Iran's intention to defuse regional tension and coordinate
on issues of mutual concern, Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Iran's willingness "to forge good and strong ties
with the GCC states and keen on opening a new page of cooperation
and protection of mutual interests."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's tour signaled "a message of amicability, fraternity
and good intentions from the Iranian government to all people of
the GCC," the Iranian ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: No Real Progress in Washington Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Disputing Israel's positive
assessment of the just-concluded peace negotiations held in
Washington, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said no real
progress was made in the talks due to Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was speaking to reporters in Gaza upon his return from
Cairo where he briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the Washington talks held early
this week by Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat's
deputy Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen).
</P>
<P>
Arafat added that he was not surprised by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of the U.S. proposal on
suspending Jewish settlement activities. In Cairo, Arafat said
Netanyahu has dismissed the U.S. proposal on a time-out of the
settlement as "a joke."
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Arafat, Moussa also said that no
progress in the Washington talks were achieved even on minor
issues.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks were in sharp contrast to those made by Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, who said "great progress" was made in
the Washington talks, which he said have eliminated the atmosphere
of pessimism and provided the basis for holding further talks.
</P>
<P>
As part of ongoing U.S. efforts to break the impasse in
the peace negotiations, U.S. government announced today that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will meet with Netanyahu
next Friday in London and with Arafat in Geneva of Switzerland
one day late. Albright is to try to achieve progress on two
central issues of Israeli settlements and further troop
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the nine committees in charge of the talks on
implementing the interim agreements will reconvene Sunday to
continue negotiations on issues, such as the opening of safe
passage between Gaza Strip and West Bank, and opening of the
Gaza airport and seaport. The dispute over the security control
in the airport and seaport has prevented the sides from
reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
State-run Israel Radio quoted an official as saying that
the talks could not produce much progress before the
Netanyahu-Albright meeting, because only Netanyahu has the authority
to make concessions in Israel.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) --The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The wheeling and dealing on President Clinton's trade
legislation began in earnest as the House of Representatives went
into an unusual weekend session, trying to rewrite agriculture
provisions to gain more votes.
</P>
<P>
The measure would give the President the authority to negotiate
trade pacts that Congress could vote up or down but would not
amend.
</P>
<P>
-- Thousands of Israelis gathered from across the country in
Tel Aviv Saturday to commemorate the second anniversary of Yitzhak
Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
The vast rally underscored a profound rift over what has become
known as the Oslo process, a rift that has only deepened since
Rabin's death and the election of a Likud government.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- In the first of the Yangtze River's legendary three gorges,
the Chinese government inched closer today to realizing a vision
that combines ambition worthy of pyramid-building Pharaohs with
the destructiveness of open-pit coal mining.
</P>
<P>
The plugging of the world's third-longest river at its
steepest and most perilous point marked a major step forward in
the construction of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
-- Support seems growing for the creation of a new panel,
independent of the Department of Defense, to oversee the Pentagon's
investigation of possible chemical weapons exposures during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of such a panel is one of the two main
suggestions made Saturday by the Presidential Advisory Committee
on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Match Takes Lead in Whitebread Second Leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Match took the early
lead after the first 24 hours of the second leg in the Whitbread
Round the World Race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Match now has pulled out nearly 50 miles on her nearest
rival EF Language.
</P>
<P>
Jointly skippered by Sweden's Gunnar Krantz and New Zealander
Earle Williams, Swedish Match took a daring but decisive decision
shortly after the start, splitting from the rest of the fleet, and
has been reaping the benefit ever since.
</P>
<P>
Leaving Cape Town and headed for Fremantle in Western
Australia, while most of the fleet sat becalmed under the
mountains of the Cape peninsula, Krantz and Williams stood out to
sea and picked up enough breeze to carry them south.
</P>
<P>
Since nightfall on the first night, Swedish Match has had the
benefit of the stronger breezes, generated by a low pressure
weather system, and has been racing along at over 12 knots.
</P>
<P>
The fleet is now split into three groups, with Swedish Match,
and Paul Cayard's EF Language, winner of the first leg, heading
south, and making the best speed.
</P>
<P>
Behind them, British entry Silk Cut, America's Chessie Racing
and Merit Cup representing Monaco are taking a more easterly
course, possibly hoping to sail a shorter route, but currently
with less wind than the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The third group, which includes pre-race favourites, Toshiba,
Norwegian entry Innovation Kvaerner, the Netherlands' Brunel
Sunergy and the all women crew EF Education, are trying to follow
the leaders by digging deep to the south, looking for wind.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda not in Zimbabwe: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean official
today refuted earlier reports that two Zambian opposition leaders
are seeking political asylum in his country after last month's
abortive coup.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted the Zimbabwe Independent, one of the
country's leading business weeklies, as reporting Saturday that
Kenneth Kaunda, and Roger Chongwe are seeking political asylum in
Harare because they are afraid of returning home.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Zambian News Agency Zana, Tiriveai John
Kangai, Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia, said that he
talked to his government Friday and officials said they were not
aware of any request for asylum from Kaunda and Chongwe.
</P>
<P>
Kangai stressed that both of them are definitely not in
Zimbabwe any more, explaining that they simply passed through the
country in transit.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, former Zambian President and now leader of the United
National Independence Party, and Chongwe, leader of the Liberal
Progressive Front, now are out of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
They had left the country before a military coup aiming at
overthrowing Zamibia's elected government was staged on October
28.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba declared a state of
emergency in the country the day after the five-hour coup was
crushed to facilitate the investigations into the incident.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, while speaking to his supporters in the State
House, the president suggested that some opposition leaders may
be involved in the military coup and only the courts can decide
whether they are guilty or not.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Committee Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
representatives began here today their committee-level talks to
work out specific steps for breaking the deadlocked peace
process, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During their peace talks held early this week In Washington,
chief negotiator of Israel Foreign Minister David Levy and
Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen agreed to let
the committees to continue their negotiations on implementing the
Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
The committee-level talks, which will be held five days a
week, are to secure Israel's consent to freezing Jewish settlement
activities for a prescribed and mutually-agreed period and to the
further redeployment of Israeli troops in the West bank, the Radio
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Details of other issues, such as the construction of the
airport and seaport in Gaza and safe passage linking Gaza and the
West bank, will also be worked out by the committee-level talks,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) differed
totally on the outcome of the Washington talks under the aegis of
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Israel said that some
progress was made, but the PNA dismissed it as total failure.
</P>
<P>
Israel's troop redeployment and the halt of Jewish settlement
in the West Bank are the two main issues that Israel refuses to
make compromise so far. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
here on Friday that Israel will not make further concessions on
these issues unless the PNA gives something in return.
</P>
<P>
PNA Planning and International Cooperation Minister Nabil
Shaath said in Ramallah on Saturday that both Israel and the PNA
have agreed to form a special committee to discuss implementing
redeployment and settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The nine committees have been formed by the PNA and Israel to
discuss specific issues of the peace talks. PNA and Israel signed
the Oslo Accords in 1993, which stipulates the basic principles
for the settlement of the disputes between the two sides.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai King Bhumibul Adulyadej
today issued a royal decree, appointing Democrat Party leader
Chuan Leekpai as the country's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The royal decree was announced at the headquarters of the
Democrat Party in Bangkok, local media said.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Party, the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party, the
Social Action Party, the Solidarity Party, the Seritham (Liberal
Democratic) Party, the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) Party, the
Thai Party and some members of the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen)
Party (PTP) will form a new coalition government led by Chuan who
will be Thailand's 23rd prime minister.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Chuan, 59, assumed the post of
Thai prime minister. He first served as the prime minister between
September 1992 and July 1995.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement of his appointment, Chuan said he will
do his best to solve the problems facing Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his new government will cooperate closely with
the International Monetary Fund to win back the confidence of
investors.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister said he will have consultations with his
would-be coalition partners to discuss the lineup of the new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that he would be in the post for
three years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sanan Kachornprasart, secretary-general of the
Democrat Party, said the new government will be formed within two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
Chuan, widely believed to be an honest statesman of principle
by local media, replaces Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who resigned
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Chuan finally emerged as the country's new prime minister after
days of fierce race between him and Chart Pattana (National Party)
leader Chatichai Choonhavan.
</P>
<P>
Support from some parliament members, who defected from the
former ruling party, the PTP, is the key to Chuan's victory.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Saudia Arabia Seals Oil Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto ended his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia today
after sealing bilateral cooperation in the oil field, the Kuwaiti
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During their talks Saturday, Saudi King Fahd expressed hope to
increase oil trade to Japan, and Hashimoto promised to encourage
the purchase of the petroleum from the world top crude producer
and exporter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto proposed to renew the oil extracting concession
enjoyed by the Arab Oil Company, a leading Japanese firm, in a
neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The concession will expire before the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested forging new and wider partnership with Saudi
Arabia to cover political, economic, commercial, investment and
technical fields as a basis for stronger bilateral ties in the
next century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to hold a meeting of a joint committee in
Saudi Arabia late December to work out an agreement to protect
bilateral investments.
</P>
<P>
Japan has so far invested 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in Saudi
Arabia, while the figures of Saudi investment in Japan are not
available.
</P>
<P>
Japan imports 925,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi
Arabia, accounting for 20 percent of the its need.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade, mainly oil purchase by Japan from Saudi
Arabia, amounted to 11.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 with a favor
of some 7.7 billion dollars for the Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes US Military Moves Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
it opposed any military move by the United States against Iraq,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab-African Affairs
Mohammad Sadr made the announcement in a response to the
U.S. threat of using military means to force Iraq to accept
Americans for inspecting Iraqi arms program.
</P>
<P>
Sadr also urged Baghdad to abide by U.N. resolutions in order
not to give any excuses for U.S. military strike, saying that
based on the past experiences whenever Washington intends to
take a military action against a country, it first prepares the
ground for its attacks politically and internationally.
</P>
<P>
The developments in recent days indicate that the U.S. is at
this stage, he said, but with regards to the visit of a
U.N. delegation to Iraq and its talks with Iraqi officials, one
cannot say for sure that the U.S. military attack would take
place.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided earlier to bar U.S. weapon inspectors from
joining U.N. inspection in Iraq in response to a U.N. threat of
further sanctions if Baghdad continued to tamper with U.N. weapon
inspection missions.
</P>
<P>
The three-member U.N. delegation went to Iraq recently and
held talks with Iraqi leaders on the Iraqi-U.N. conflict. And
Iraq has agreed to suspend the execution of its decision to expel
the U.S. personnel in the U.N. inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Sadr also dismissed claims that Iran's stance toward the
Middle East peace talks has changed as said by Israel and some
western circles.
</P>
<P>
As before, Tehran does not recognize Israel and believes that
Palestine belongs to the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
About Tehran-Cairo ties, Sadr said the problems now gripping
the Middle East peace talks and the fact that Egyptians have
been convinced of the uselessness of talks have gradually
brought Egypt's stance closer to that of Iran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Iran-Egypt ties would improve in all
fields as a result of their close stance over the Middle East
issue, adding that Egypt is one of the largest Islamic countries
and Iranian officials pay attention to it.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt broke off their diplomatic relations after
Egypt signed the David Camp Accord with Israel in 1979, but
bilateral ties have been warmed up in recent years.

<HEADLINE> President Yeltsin Arrives in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
arrived here tonight by special plane, starting his two-day state
visit to China as guest of his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
This is Yeltsin's third state visit to China. The two heads of
state are expected to hold their fifth summit Monday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Yeltsin told reporters at the airport: "This is a
big success. The border demarcation alone made it worth coming
here." In addition, he added, he will meet Chinese leaders and may
sign a number of agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a kind of relationship with Jiang Zemin
which allows us to switch immediately to business conversation
without any preparatory talks," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Aboard the same plane were Yeltsin's wife, Naina, and Russian
Foreign Minister Evgeny M. Primakov. Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Boris Nemtsov, who is also accompanying Yeltsin on the
current China tour, arrived earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongli, chairman of the Chinese government reception
committee and minister of Finance, greeted Yeltsin and his party
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Chinese sources say that the two sides will issue a joint
statement, the fifth of its kind, and sign a package of agreements
on bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state will summarize experiences and
achievements of the development of bilateral relations, and confer
on major international issues and the promotion of an all-round
development of the Sino-Russian partnership of strategic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are expected to make an important announcement on
breakthroughs in eastern Sino-Russian border demarcations.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said, prior to his arrival in Beijing, that he is sure
that Yeltsin's visit to China will strengthen bilateral relations
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the main aim of the president's visit is to develop
relations with China that would become trustworthy and
strategically directed at cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Since the two leaders' first meeting five years ago, frequent
exchanges of high-level visits have made Sino-Russian relations
grow rapidly, and each summit has renewed and promoted bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the upcoming fifth Sino-Russian summit will
create positive and far-reaching influences on the development of
bilateral relations and the current international situation.

NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Charles Mukora, who coached
Kenyan Olympic gold medallist Kipchoge Keino, is building a
high-altitute international training center in Nanyuki, a garrison
town at the base of Mount Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The coach said Kenya's other two greats Henry Rono and Daniel
Komen would not have gone on to beat the world without
high-altitude conditioning.
</P>
<P>
Mukora, also chairman of the National Olympic Committee of
Kenya (NOK), said that Nanyuki, situated 2,300 meters above sea
level and 200 kilometers north of Nairobi, was expected to become
the ideal trainning center for the athletes all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Komen and German Dieter Baumann trained in Nyahururu before the
Athens world championships. Former world 800-meter record holder
Sebastian Coe of Britain was one of the earliest foreigners to
camp in Nyahururu.

<HEADLINE> Chuan Pledges to Restore Confidence of Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's newly-appointed
prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, said here today that the
restoration of investors' confidence and the stabilization of the
country's currency, the baht, are the priority of his government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held here after his appointment
by King Bhumibul Adulyadej, Chuan said he will do his best to
solve the problems facing the country and called on the people to
cooperate and help the government solve the country's problems.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he would cooperate closely with the
International Monetary Fund, which extended an aid package of 17.2
billion U.S. dollars to help Thailand solve its economic problems,
including the plunge of the baht and the liquidity problem of its
finance sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chuan pledged to carry out his policies with great
transparency and let the people know the truth.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibul issued a royal decree earlier this evening and
appointed Chuan as Thailand's 23rd prime minister to replace
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who resigned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan is expected to form a coalition government soon, which
might consist of seven or eight political parties - the Democrat
Party, the Social Action Party, the Solidarity Party, the Seritham
(Liberal Democratic) Party, the Palang Dharma (Virtue Force)
Party, the Thai Party or the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) Party.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Decide to Exchange Ambassadors Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey have decided to
exchange their ambassadors in ten days in order to normalize their
relations, Tehran radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Iranian deputy foreign minister
for Asia-Pacific affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh this morning after
returning from a visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh said that the decision was an essential step for the
two countries to normalize their relations on the eve of the
forthcoming summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) to be held here in December.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara-Tehran relations cooled down last February after the
Turkish government accused the Iranian Ambassador and other
diplomats of making public statements in favor of fundamentalism.
The two countries then called back their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Ankara agreed to resume their relations at the
highest level during a talk between foreign ministers of the
two countries on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in
New York last month.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh started his three-day visit to Ankara Thursday to
deliver a message from Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to his
Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh described his talks with Turkish officials as
positive, saying that he held talks with Turkish officials over
issues such as Iran's concern on Turkey's military actions in
northern Iraq and the Israeli-Turkish military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ankara gave positive response to Iran's concern on
the situation in northern Iraq, adding that Turkey promised to
withdraw its forces from northern Iraq in the near future and to
respect the full territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey launched a cross-border attack in northern Iraq late
September to clear the bases of Kurdish rebels who are fighting
for independence in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About the OIC summit, Aminzadeh said that the Turkish
government has decided to dispatch the highest level of officials
to attend the summit.

Kuwaiti Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Dakhil
Al-Dakhil said in a statement after a weekly cabinet session that

</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern and Near
Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk toured the region this week to
urge strongly the U.S. Gulf Arab allies to attend the fourth
annual MENA meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Kuwait said Indyk relayed to Gulf Arab leaders a
request by U.S. President Bill Clinton to send delegations to the
Doha conference which was boycotted by some Arab countries due to
Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce said earlier that it would not
participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Bahrain have not yet announced their stand.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Turns Back US Inspectors for Seventh Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- For the seventh day, Iraqi
authorities today barred the Americans from getting into sites
that the U.N. weapons inspection teams wished to inspect, Iraqi
News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an unidentified official source as saying that four
teams of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction headed Sunday morning for a
number of Iraqi sites to conduct inspection.
</P>
<P>
But they returned to their base in Baghdad soon after they were
told that the U.S. members on the teams would not be allowed to
participate in the field work.
</P>
<P>
This came three days after a team of U.N. envoys failed to talk
the Iraqi officials into backing down from their recent decision
on barring the Americans from joining in U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, however, has agreed to
postpone the expulsion of the U.S. weapons monitors until further
talks are held between him and U.N. officials in New York with the
aim to find a solution to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi newspapers attacked severely Richard Butler,
head of the UNSCOM for carrying out the U.S. hostile policy
towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers such as Al-Jomhouriya, Al-Thawra, Al-Qadissiya and
Babel said that Butler has unveiled his planned role in
implementing the U.S. anti-Iraq plan through his false allegations
that Iraq is concealing biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Butler served the U.S. plan also through his desperate defense
of the spying role of a U.S. U-2 plane in Iraq's airspace, said
the papers.
</P>
<P>
Iraq earlier called upon the commission to replace the U.S. U-2
plane at the disposal of UNSCOM with an Iraqi plane or with
another aircraft from any neutral country.
</P>
<P>
But Butler has ordered that the plane resume overflying Iraqi
territory from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The papers emphasized that Butler's instruction is designed to
provoke Iraq so that it can create an opportunity for the U.S. to
launch a new attack on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Pudong New Area Expands Greenbelts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Pudong New
Area in Shanghai are benefiting from increased greenbelts at the
rate of one square meter per year.
</P>
<P>
The average area of public greenbelts per person in Pudong has
increased to 5 square meters from 0.54 sq.m. four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The area plans to raise that figure to 8 square meters within
three years, increasing the overall area of public greenbelts to
1,056 hectares, said a local official. At that point, 35 percent
of the area would be in greenbelts.
</P>
<P>
The greening of the area has been part of the urban design
plan, the official said. Regulations stipulate
that all enterprises in the region should have greenbelts
accounting for one-third of their building coverage.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have spent nearly 100 million U.S. dollars
one moving seven companies and 3,500 families to build 100,000
square meters of greenbelt. At the time, the sales price of
neighboring buildings was 3,000 U.S. dollar per square meter of
floor space.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to greening the downtown area, officials
said, adding that belts along rivers and roads will also be
planted with trees and grass in the next three years.

MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia
defeated Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 to win
the Kremlin Cup tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win, to some extent, compensated to Kafelnikov who lost
last year's final at Moscow's indoor Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, the first seed in tournament, started out strong,
breaking Korda's serve in the second game. But then Korda, the
second seed, broke back in the next game.
</P>
<P>
Both players then held serve, sending the set into a
tiebreaker. The only other break came with Korda serving in the
third game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, 11th in the world rankings, had played Korda twice
before this year, beating him both times: in the finals at Halle
and in the semifinals on his way to winning in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
Korda, ranked 15th, has yet to win a tournament this year. He
was runner-up to Michael Chang in Washington in July.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Calls for Unity For Republic Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today urged republicans and monarchists in the country to
put aside their differences at next February's constitutional
convention to focus on devising a blueprint for a republic.
</P>
<P>
The two camps should not waste time trying to convert each
other or arguing the pros and cons of a republic, the prime
minister told the Nine Network, a local TV station.
</P>
<P>
Howard, an avowed monarchist, said the government wants to put
the status quo and a plan for a republic to Australians for a
vote.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister promised during his election campaign last
year that a convention will be held after his election on whether
Australia will become a republic and he will respect the choice of
the people.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the constitutional convention will decide next
February whether Australia should maintain the status quo or
become a republic in the year 2000, as proposed by Howard's
predecessor, Paul Keating.
</P>
<P>
With the share of British descendants in Australia's population
of nearly 18 million dwindling, the call for Australia to become a
republic is growing, particularly among immigrants of non-British
descendants.
</P>
<P>
But with 1.4 million Australians having a parent born in
Britain and about half of the population are British descendants,
opposition to dumping the British queen as Australia's head of
state is still strong in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said any model including a popularly elected
president is a recipe for chaos.
</P>
<P>
"What the convention should spend its energy doing is working
out whether agreement can be reached on the alternative to the
present system ... when ultimately there's a vote on this issue,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He declared that he is opposed to an elected president,
preferring one elected by a parliamentary majority, a model
advocated by Keating.
</P>
<P>
"You could have the anomalous system of a popularly elected
Liberal president with a Labor prime minister holding a slender
majority in the House of Representatives and being in the minority
in the Senate, you'd get nothing done," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Secretary and anti-republican Tony Abbott said
today that the country's constitution should be changed to make
the governor-general the head of state.

<P>
FUZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian
Province has become one of the nation's top three producers of
video compact disc players with an estimated production of 1.4
million units this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Commercial Houses Sell Well in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial metropolis, sold three million square meters of
apartment houses in the first three quarters of this year,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The selling of commercial housing in the city began in
1979. From then through September of 1997, 21 million square
meters of apartments have been occupied worth 40 billion yuan
(4.82 billion U.S. dollars), statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's apartment boom started in 1987. Last year, 3.94
million squre meters was sold.
</P>
<P>
Experts said apartment sales are expected to continue rising
since Shanghai initiated a large-scale reduction in interest on
housing loans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has worked out a series of real estate
reforms. A reduction in welfare housing and increased salaries
should further spur the sales of apartment houses, experts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unlikely to Be Allowed to Probe Malaysian Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today that
it is unlikely to allow the United States to investigate the
Malaysian company Petronas' business dealings with Iran for
allegedly violating an American law.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet will probably decide to disallow the
investigations from being carried out," Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying when asked to comment on a news report that U.S.
officials would travel to Kuala Lumpur by the end of the month to
conduct the probe.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U.S. Undersecretary of State for Trade Stuart
Eizenstat as saying in Rome that Petronas and four other companies
ran the risk of real sanctions if investigations found any of
their business dealings with Iran contravened the Iran Libya
Sanctions Act which requires the U.S. government to take action
against any company that invests more than 20 million U.S. dollars
a year in Iran's oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
The other four companies are Russia's Gazprom, France's Total
SA, Canada's Bow Valley and Indonesia's Bakrie Group.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia would not bow down to threats from other
governments to follow instructions given unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would not cut ties with any country due to pressure
from a third country, he said, adding that the long-established
relations between Malaysia and Iran have been developed in the
context of two sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is our right and we must defend our position," the
foreign minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said his government has not received any letter from
Washington on the matter but is ready to reply and state
Malaysia's position.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that Commonwealth heads of government had,
at their recent meeting, agreed to oppose any unilateral action
that goes against the spirit of free trade as promoted by the
World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Province Protecting Farmlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang, a densely-populated
province in east China, has stepped up its efforts to protect
cultivated land by issuing stricter laws and deepening
law-enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 1.5 million ha. of farmland has been brought under
legal protection, accounting for over 90 percent of the province's
total, to curb the decrease of farmland caused by industrial and
urban expansion.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, a series of farmland protection laws have been
issued in the province which clearly define for every village the
difference between farmland and land for non-farming purposes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people charged with illegal land occupations have
been seriously punished. Last year, over 1,000 brick kilns were
removed from cultivated land in the province. Zhejiang reclaimed
8,000 ha. of farmland last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Zhejiang produced 15.16 million tons of grain, six
percent more than the figure of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in charge of the matter expressed their hopes
that the efforts to curb the decrease of farmland would contribute
to the sustainable development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Zhejiang has an average of a mere
0.036 ha. of cultivated land per person, which is less than half
of the country's average.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Threatens End to Italians' Road Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has threatened not to
renew a road contract for an Italian company due to what was
described as "shoddy and disastrous" performance.
</P>
<P>
Works and Supply Minister Keli Walubita has directed Burrow
Binnie contractors to complete the delayed rehabilitation of the
Great East Road by December 16 this year, threatening not to
renew the contract if their performance does not improve, Sunday
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted him as telling Italian Ambassador to Zambia
Margherita Costa who was also in the inspection entourage touring
the project Saturday that rehabilitation work on the
17-million-US-Dollar project should have started in 1995, but
instead the contractors started it last year on the pretext of
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
He said Eastern Province is important economically because of
its agricultural potential. The province also connects Zambia to
Malawi and Nacala Port of Mozambique through which imports and
exports are ferried.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador urged the minister to reconsider renewing the
contract after it expires next month because Binnie is one of the
major road contractors in Italy.
</P>
<P>
She said the company is carrying out road construction and
rehabilitation in several neighboring countries of Zambia and
that they are happy with the work.
</P>
<P>
She wondered why it is performing badly in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Walubita said it is sad the contractor has failed to complete
the 210-kilometers-long project from Lusaka to Luangwa bridge
despite having enough funds for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> Coup Day Declared as Public Holiday in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has declared October 28 a public holiday for people to
remember last month's failed military coup, Sunday Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a crowd Saturday at the Kasama Airport in the
northern province, Chiluba said all the Zambians should not work
on the day to remember how they survived the military coup.
</P>
<P>
A small number of junior army officers and soldiers staged a
coup on October 28 to overthrow the Chiluba government and
announced at the state radio that the army had taken over the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the coup was crushed five hours after it happened
with most of the coupists being arrested.
</P>
<P>
"The law will take its course for what the enemies did on
October 28," said the president. "I thank you because on the day
of announcement, the whole nation was so silent as there was a
funeral. when we said the elected government will continue, you
were so happy."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated that no leader should rule Zambia for more
than 10 years as enshrined in the constitution, adding that the
clause, apart form avoiding past experiences, was meant to avoid
actions like the failed coup.
</P>
<P>
These remarks are widely believed to be directed against
Kenneth Kaunda, former president and now leader of the United
National independence Party, who ruled Zambia for 27 years from
1964 to 1991 and whose parents are Malawians.
</P>
<P>
A revised constitution which was ratified by Chiluba before
the 1996 general election provides that the president's tenure of
office is limited to two five-year terms and foreign nationals or
those with foreign parentage are prohibited form contesting the
presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's successful blockage
yesterday of the Yangtze River to build the mammoth Three Gorges
dam hit the headlines of Hong Kong newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
To complement the front-page story, the newspapers also rolled
out inner pages publishing special reports of the damming of the
river.
</P>
<P>
The banner headlines of the English-language Hong Kong Standard
 read: "The dream of China's ages becomes reality as mighty
Yangtze is finally tamed." The damming of the river also hit the
headlines of major Chinese-language newspapers, which all hailed
the grand project.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Ta Kung Pao and Sing Pao Daily News
 devoted nearly half of their front pages to the picture of two
trucks tipping the final loads of rock to complete the blocking of
 the world's third longest river.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at the dam site, and
facts and figures about the project were also given prominence.
</P>
<P>
Commentaries were released by Sing Tao Daily, Express News,
Hong Kong Daily News, Ming Pao Daily News and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The date of November 8, 1997 will go down in history as the day
 when the Chinese people made a very first step toward the taming
of the Yangtze River, the commentary in Express News said.
</P>
<P>
Only after the comprehensive national strength of China has
been greatly enhanced following some 20 years of reform and
opening up, can the grand damming project be undertaken, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Daily News said in a commentary that the decision to
build the cross-century project is a vote of confidence in the
country's economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Daily's commentary pointed out that the damming will
definitely benefit the people in the fields of electricity,
shipping and the development of the Yangtze River Valley.

LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The manager of Ferrari driver
Michael Schumacher said on Sunday that he was surprised by
allegations that rival Formula One constructors Williams-Renault
and McLaren-Mercedes colluded to arrange the finish of the final
Grand Prix of the season.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit shocked by all this -- I just hope it was only the
final race of the season that they had an agreement for," Willi
Weber told the Bild newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Times newspaper reported Saturday that its investigation
had unearthed two tapes of radio transmissions between pit crews
and drivers at the European Grand Prix at Jerez in Spain last
month.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed the tapes reveal that Williams and McLaren
team officials orchestrated the order of the first three cars over
the line and that their allegations have forced the sport's
governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile
(FIA), to hold an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Formula One Constructors' Association chief Bernie Ecclestone
told The Times: "This is hard to believe."
</P>
<P>
Weber too cast doubt on the story. "I'm wondering how Mercedes
could have acted to prevent (fellow German) Schumacher becoming
world champion."

A serious earthquake in the 1920s caused the pagoda to tilt. In
recent years, as the result of irrigation, the base of the pagoda
gradually sank. The heart of the pagoda had deviated from its
vertical line by more than 50 cm.
</P>
<P>
Chinese technicians installed an iron pedestal at the base of
the 200-ton pagoda and straightened it at a rate of 1 millimeter
per hour. The work took more than one year.
</P>
<P>
When the project is finished, experts say the pagoda will never
lean again.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown on Truants Results in 76 Arrests in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 8 (xinhua) -- Last Friday was indeed a
black Friday for truants in the U.S. state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
In the first local crackdown on truants, police officers in the
state arrested 76 students.
</P>
<P>
About 35 officers patrolled streets, roamed parks and scoured
malls to look for truants from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.. They hauled the
truants back to a command post to process paperwork and call their
parents.
</P>
<P>
Many Arizona cities and towns have curfews that apply to teens
and under the new Arizona truance laws, teens and their parents
may be subject to criminal conviction and fines.
</P>
<P>
This time 13 students were repeat truancy offenders, and eight
of their parents were cited for failing to send their children to
school. If convicted, the parents would face up to 500 U.S.
dollars' fine and up to 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
The youngest truant was a six-year-old who was found with his
10-year-old sibling. Three students who were stopped are in
elementary school, 25 in junior high and 52 attend senior high.
</P>
<P>
Of the truants, 16 students were arrested on misdemeanor
charges, including drug paraphernalia possession, and two others
on felony charges of possession of a dangerous drug for sale.
</P>
<P>
All truants were required to go to a full day of counseling
with their parents, according to local police who said that many
parents were unaware of their children's absence in school.
</P>
<P>
Arizona is not alone in combating truancy. According to a 1996
manual to combat truancy worked out by the federal government,
while no national data on the extent of truancy exists, in some
cities unexcused absence can number in the thousands each day.
</P>
<P>
The manual said that high rates of truance are linked to high
daytime burglary and high vandalism.
</P>
<P>
Several states in the country have daytime curfew during school
hours that allow law enforcement officers to question youth to
determine if their absence is legitimate.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Stick Stamps on Imports to Deter Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's government will step up
its anti-smuggling campaign by sticking import duty stamps on
imported bicycles, brandy and electric fans from next month.
</P>
<P>
As of Monday, December 1, all the three kinds of imports,
whether stored in warehouses, kept in shops or delivered will be
regarded as smuggled goods if they do not display the proper
import duty stamps issued by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Those imports which do not have proper invoices and bills of
lading will be regarded as smuggled goods and consequently
confiscated and auctioned, according to an inter-ministerial
circular jointly issued by the Customs Office and the ministries
of finance, trade and interior.
</P>
<P>
The Customs Office is responsible for applying the stamps to
imports right at the place of inspection and before customs
procedures are completed.
</P>
<P>
Importers and traders who have these goods imported and stored
in their warehouses before December 1 are obliged to submit
completed forms on the items to local tax offices or market
control boards.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry warned that any organizations or
individuals responsible for keeping or using the stamps will face
heavy fines if they permit their stamps to be stolen.
</P>
<P>
The fine in such cases will be equal to the total value of the
imports corresponding with the number of the lost stamps.

MAPUTO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of those
admitted into hospitals in Chimoio, a city in central-western
Mozambique are suffering from AIDS, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed by Inacio Barreto, director of the Manica
Provincial Health Bureau Saturday, according to "Domingo", a
Sunday paper published in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS related mortality rate is still on the rise, Barreto
said, adding that about 10 percent of the 500 AIDS patients in
the central hospital are children.
</P>
<P>
He said that 776 pregnant women in the city have been proven
positive to HIV, and the number is doubling every two years.
</P>
<P>
Chimoio is a city bordering Zimbabwe which is said to be a
heavily infected area, and the frequent communications between
people along the border have made the city one of the worst
AIDS-hit cities.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Maputo and Tete are also seriously hit by
the disease.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 900,000 of the 17 million population
of Mozambique are positive to HIV, which may lead to the fatal
disease of AIDS.

<HEADLINE> More German Investment, Trade to Enter Into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- German companies have pledged
to invest more than 500 million Zimbabwe Dollars (40 million U.S.
Dollars) in job-creating projects in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
They also promised to increase two-way trade between the two
countries by over 1.6 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (120 million U.S.
Dollars) during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
''The proposed investment and trade deals are the result of
initiatives by the Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC), the
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries and the government to woo
German investors who are known to be keen to spread their wings
in southern Africa,'' the ZIC said in the latest issue of the
Zimbabwe Investment Review released here today.
</P>
<P>
The review quoted German Ambassador to Zimbabwe Fraf Leutrum
as saying that southern Africa is a promising market for German
companies mainly because of its relative peace and stability and
wide ranging economic reforms being implemented in countries such
as Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said from investment missions in Germany and
Zimbabwe in September 1996 and May this year, it had been
concluded that new German investment in Zimbabwe worth about 530
million Zimbabwe Dollars (42 million U.S. Dollars) was expected
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
German firms were expected to export to Zimbabwe goods worth
up to 208 million Zimbabwe Dollars (16 million Dollars) while
Zimbabwean companies would export products valued at about 1.4
billion Zimbabwe Dollars (110 million Dollars) to the European
country.
</P>
<P>
German is Zimbabwe's third largest trading partner after South
Africa and the United Kingdom.

(ZCTU) has appealed to Zambians to monitor the running of
privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) so that
it can contribute to the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This was reaction to the government's sale of Nkana and
Chingola Metallurgical Complexes and Chingola Ore Dumps of ZCCM
to the Kafue Consortium of International Companies last Friday.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM President Fackson Shamenda said here Saturday that the
decision to privatize the mines is irreversible and that people
should keep their fingers crossed that they will continue to
benefit from the wealth.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times today quoted Shamenda as saying it is imperative
that people's interests in the mines should be protected and
hoped investors will run them profitably so that the Zambian
government earns enough funds to develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
"All Zambians should have an interest in the privatized mines.
The wealth belongs to the country and the country belongs to the
people... We should have keen interest to see that the operations
do not lead to manipulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He implored the new owners to maintain trade unionism in the
industry as workers will be the eyes of government and people,
"to see to it that we get al lot out of it."
</P>
<P>
"If the new owners say they are not interested in the union,
they will come in the morning and leave in the afternoon," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Association of Manufactures (ZAM) chairman, Mark
O'donnell said the privatization of the mines is long overdue,
saying everybody will benefit from the sale as the units will be
profitable.

<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is expected to arrive here later today for his third state visit
to China since he assumed the presidency.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Presidents Jiang Zemin and Yeltsin will have
their fifth summit.
</P>
<P>
From December 17 to 19, 1992, Yeltsin undertook his first China
visit. In their first summit, Jiang and Yeltsin agreed that the
stability and prosperity of the two countries are the
indispensable conditions for safeguarding the international peace,
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state signed a joint statement on the
foundation for bilateral ties, calling for China and Russia to
regard each other as "friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
From September 2 to 6, 1994, Jiang paid an official visit to
Russia. The two leaders signed the second joint statement,
claiming that the two countries are resolved to establish a
constructive partnership with a perspective towards the 21st
century, which is neither aligned nor directed to a third country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a series of important agreements,
including a joint declaration to the effect that the two countries
will not be the first to use nuclear weapons against each other
and shall end the targeting of each other with strategic nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin made his second China visit between April 24
and 26 in 1996, during which Jiang and Yeltsin signed the third
joint statement, proclaiming that China and Russia would develop
"strategic cooperative partnership geared to the 21st century and
based on equality and mutual trust." The two leaders agreed that
ties should be strengthened on the basis of "equality, mutual
trust, good neighborliness, cooperation, mutual benefit and joint
development."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to maintain frequent dialogues at
different levels and through various channels. They also decided
to set up hot lines respectively in Beijing and Moscow between the
two governments.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan
and Tajikistan signed an agreement on confidence-building in the
military field in their common border areas.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin visited Russia between April 22 and 26
this year, during which the two sides signed a joint statement on
the world multipolarization and the establishment of new
international order. The statement pointed out that the
establishment of a new and long-term relationship between China
and Russia, which is defined by international laws but not
directed at a third country, is "a major practice in establishing
a new international order."
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are expected to sign a fifth joint statement
and a series of bilateral cooperation agreements during Yeltsin's
forthcoming visit. The two leaders will also review the experience
and achievements in the development of bilateral ties, and confer
on major international issues and approaches for comprehensively
promoting development of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative
partnership.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are also expected to announce a major
breakthrough concerning demarcation of the eastern section of the
Sino-Russian border.

MOSCOW -- The Russian Foreign Ministry Saturday stressed that
Iraq should implement all the resolutions adopted by the U.N.
Security Council, including ending Iraq's efforts to prevent the
UN from engaging in its arms check up in Iraq, the Itar-Tass news

However, Russia remains in a position to oppose coercive
measures against Iraq for a solution to the current crisis between
Bagdad and the United Nations on the question of destruction of
Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Russia will try
its best to talk Iraq into changing its attitude on the UN Ad Hoc
Committee and allowing US check-up personnel to enter into Iraq,

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Starts Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' ruling
Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats) party today
began the first step to select a presidential candidate for the
May 1998 national elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first of two series of consultative meetings
with top national leaders here, President Fidel Ramos laid down
major challenges his successor will face for an effective
governance in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said his successor must accept a series of challenges,
including further reforms for sustainable development and
eradication of poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
"When I came to the presidency, the incidence of poverty was
recorded at about 41 or 42 percent, according to the United
Nations parameters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now the poverty level has gone down to 35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed the hope that the figure would go down further
at the end of his term in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The first consultative meeting was attended by more than 800
leaders from the Lakas-NUCD under the chairmanship of Ramos. At
the meeting, eight presidential hopefuls from the party were each
allocated 10 minutes to make a speech to present their platforms.
</P>
<P>
The eight are: Chairman Manuel Morato of the Philippine Charity
Sweepstakes Office, Speaker Jose de Venecia, Bulacan governor
Roberto Pagdanganan, Senator Ramon Magsaysay, Former Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa, Economic Planning secretary Cielito
Habito, Senator Heherson Alvarez, and Finance Secretary Roberto De
Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
The next consultative meeting will be held here next Sunday,
and will be attended by town mayors and vice mayors all over the
country, who are members of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The consultative meetings will provide the president the basis
on which to choose the standard bearer for the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The presidential candidate of the ruling party is expected to
be nominated in December.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, the president serves a
single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election.

<HEADLINE> Interest rate Cuts to Benefit Life Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The recent interest rate cuts
will offer an impetus to the expansion of the life insurance
industry while creating worries for underwriters, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The interest cuts in banking deposits in October will diversify
individuals' capital, prompting them to seek other financial
products for their investments, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to securities with high risks and return, life
insurance products become an attractive channel for individuals
because it not only provides security for people but also acts as a
way of saving to ensure the safety of personal money.
</P>
<P>
"The interest rate cuts are beneficial to the development of
China's life insurance industry in the long run," said Nysco Shu,
general manager of American International Assurance's Shanghai Co
(AIA).
</P>
<P>
People's Bank of China statistics indicate individual savings
deposits amounted to 4,413.9 billion yuan (531 billion US dollars)
by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
If ten percent of the savings deposits went into life insurance
in the next year, the premium income of the life insurance
industry would increase more than 40 billion yuan (4.82 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the continuous reduction in interest rates since 1996
has made the savings interest rates fall below the average assumed
interest rates of life products offered by various insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
The assumed interest rates of different life products now
average between 7.5 percent and nine percent, two to three
percentage higher than the interest rate of the one-year savings
deposit.
</P>
<P>
Since Chinese insurance companies are required to deposit their
premiums in banks or buy government bonds in line with government
regulations, the differences between the savings or bond interest
rates and the assumed interest rates of life products are the
major income sources for insurers.
</P>
<P>
Considering life products are long-term payment, insurers will
suffer losses if they pay their clients according to the current
assumed interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Some domestic insurance companies, such as Ping'an Insurance
Co. and the People's Insurance (Life) Co. of China Ltd, have
stopped selling some life products.
</P>
<P>
Ping'an is considering launching participating bonus life
policies to reduce operating risks. This policy is usually set at
a low assumed interest rate but can get bonuses according to
insurers' profits.

<HEADLINE> Freight Firms See Good Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The central government is
confident about the prospect of cargo shipping across the Taiwan
Straits despite various obstacles, according to a senior trade
official.
</P>
<P>
In April, 10 Fujian freight agents and six shipping firms were
approved to deal in cross-Straits trade.
</P>
<P>
Those enterprises have played an active intermediate role in
trade across the Straits since April, augmenting commodities
exchanged between the mainland and Taiwan, said Wang Hui, deputy
director of the Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation
(Moftec).
</P>
<P>
The freight route between Xiamen, Fuzhou and Kaohsuing was
formally started on April 19 when the China-owned, Saint
Vincent-registered Sheng Da made the first direct voyage across
the Straits in 48 years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated about 100,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units)
to 200,000 TEUs will be shipped via the route by the end of this
year, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Feedback from the Taiwan business communities has been
positive, and the six mainland shipping firms and 10 freight
agents have garnered better economic results than expected, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The route saves as much as 17 percent to 43 percent of the
shipping costs compared with that via Hong Kong, industry insiders
estimated.
</P>
<P>
The present shipping across the Straits is not direct shipping
links in the real sense, as cargo on the route is only allowed to
enter the offshore transshipment center in Kaohsuing, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted direct shipping links across the Taiwan Straits in
its real sense are not likely to happen in the near future due to
Taiwan authorities' repressive policies.
</P>
<P>
Trade across the Straits during the first eight months of this
year climbed 7.1 percent from a year ago to 12.08 billion US
dollars, according to customs statistics released in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Exports Still Grows in Spite of Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China's export will be able to
weather the recent currency devaluation in southeast Asia and
continue to grow about ten percent annually, said a Merrill Lynch
research report.
</P>
<P>
The report was issued amid heightening concern that China's
exports would be hurt seriously by the currency depreciation, and
a slowdown in export growth may drag the nation's economy into a
recession, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Such a scenario is unlikely," said Merill Lynch economist
Shawn Xu in his report. "For a large economy like China, internal
factors are far more important than external ones in determining
its overall economic health."
</P>
<P>
Many economists said the currency depreciation in southeast
Asia will sharpen the competitive edge of exports of these
countries and in turn weaken China's export competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the Southeast Asian countries will have less
competition than thought because their price competitiveness
gained from currency devaluations is offset by a shrinking profit
margin and will be further eroded by devaluation-induced domestic
inflation.
</P>
<P>
With a weaker currency, domestic producers have to pay more for
imported raw materials and parts, and thus take a cut in their
profit margin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after depreciation, imports cost more in local
currency, which in turn pushes up prices of domestically-produced
goods, including those for exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, countries whose economies depend on imports a lot,
such as the southeastern Asian countries, have great inflation
pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Historically, depreciation of Southeastern Asian currencies
had boosted these countries' exports but that did not seem to be
at the expense of China," the report said.
</P>
<P>
With dominant market shares, China enjoyed a comparative
advantage in labour-intensive goods such as toys, footwear,
garments and travel goods, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The Southeastern Asian countries appeared to have been
competitors of China in more capital-intensive and
technologically-sophisticated products, mainly electrical
machinery, optical goods and electronic products.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Implement Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
instructed police and provincial administration officers to
conduct in accordance with the newly enacted laws, the Sunday
Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Saturday, Head of the Public
Service and Secretary to the Cabinet Fares Kuindwa said that the
government was committed to the full implementation of the
reforms contained in the newly enacted laws.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi signed into law
the Constitution amendment Bill, the Statute Law Bill and the
Constitution Review Commission Bill.
</P>
<P>
The reform package had been brokered by the Inter-Parties
Parliamentary Group (IPPG) over the past month, which is composed
of MPs from both the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
According to the new laws, no licenses are required for public
meetings, but local officers commanding police stations must be
aware to be able to organize security.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Commissioner of Police has already issued
instructions to the police force on how officers should conduct
themselves in handling public meetings.
</P>
<P>
Kuindwa noted that the government had also instructed all
ministries and departments affected to take appropriate action to
implement the reforms.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, IPPG Secretary George Anyona urged the Kenyan
government to implement the three reform bills "in both letter
and spirit" in order to guarantee fair, free and peaceful General
Election.
</P>
<P>
"The acceptability, credibility and integrity of the General
Election will hinge on the full implementation of the IPPG
Reforms both in letter and spirit," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Studies to be Made on Bangladesh Arsenic Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- An 800,000-U.S.-dollar project is
to be taken up to carry out geological, hydrogeological and
geotechnical studies on the origin of arsenic contamination of
ground water in Bangladesh, World Bank (WB) sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The WB is coordinating the project funded by the British
Department for International Development, and the studies will be
conducted by the British Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a two-year program consisting of two phases," said
Babar N. Kabir, chief of the WB's Water and Sanitation Program, at
its Dhaka office.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the project, scheduled to start by the last week of
this month, is to find out where from arsenic is coming, he said.
The program would be carried out in collaboration with the
Bangladesh Water Development Board's Ground Water Circle,
Geological Survey of Bangladesh, and Dhaka and Rajshahi
universities.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project would involve a six-month
initial assessment of the cause and extent of the problem, and
would help the government and the WB in formulating auxiliary
projects for the second year of the 60-million-dollar "umbrella
investment program."
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, additional information would be provided
to verify the source and mechanism of mobilization of arsenic.
</P>
<P>
The studies will help determine the feasibility of certain
possible long-term mitigation measures such as use of deep
tubewells and the effect of continued use of uncontaminated wells.
</P>
<P>
The field level data collection will involve drilling of wells
in 30 districts up to a depth of about 300 meters for sediment
analysis. Accordingly, an evaluation map would be prepared to give
first-hand information for any reference during the implementation
of the project.
</P>
<P>
About half of Bangladesh's 120 million population in 43
districts have been affected by arsenic toxicity. The WB has
promised to provide 150 million dollars to Bangladesh to help
solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Play Positive Role in financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign financial institutions
have become an important part of China's financial system and a
major channel for absorbing foreign investment, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Since the first operational presence of foreign financial
institutions was approved in China in 1982, the state has been
following a policy of gradually opening to the outside world and
actively promoting the steps of financial reform, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To date, 23 cities and Hainan Province have allowed foreign
banks to set up operational branches. This covers almost all the
economically developed regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Insurance is open to the foreign sector in Shanghai and
Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the first Sino-foreign joint-venture investment bank
was approved in china.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, foreign financial institutions which met
certain requirements were permitted to engage in renminbi business
on a trial basis in the Shanghai Pudong Area. So far, nine
foreign banks have received permission for such deals.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the total assets of foreign banks in
China rose 56.3 percent from the end of 1995 to 29.9 billion US
dollars, while their deposits reached 3.9 billion US dollars, a
growth of 24 percent, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The total after-tax profits of foreign banks reached 183
million US dollars, rising by 31 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Most institutions begin to break even within two years of their
start-up, which indicates good conditions of the profit earning
for foreign banks, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions have promoted the absorption of
foreign investment, strengthened the competitive mechanism of
China's financial system and raised the level of the country's
financial modernization, the paper concluded.

However, Russia remains in a position to oppose coersive

its best to talk Iraq into changing its attitude on the UN Ad Hoc
Committee and allowing US check-up personnel to enter into Iraq,
the Itar-Tass report says.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Not to Shut Down Nuclear Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has handed a memorandum
to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
saying it will not close four nuclear reactors in the Kozloduy
power station next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the magazine Capital, the
memorandum said the safety of the four reactors has been
"fundamentally improved," so that they can operate safely until
2005 or 2007.
</P>
<P>
The four nuclear reactors have a combined generating capacity
of 12 billion kilowatt-hours. Their closure would disrupt the
balance of Bulgaria's power supply, the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The Kozloduy station, built in 1974, is the only nuclear power
station in Bulgaria. Its six nuclear reactors produce 42 percent
of the electricity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government signed an agreement in 1993 with the
EBRD to use its loan to improve the safety of the four reactors
and shut them down before the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Legislation on Foster-Care Adoptions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate passed
today a bill to speed up adoptions for abused and neglected
children.
</P>
<P>
Senator John Chafee, one of the sponsors of the legislation,
said it could affect some 500,000 abused or neglected children who
now live outside their parental homes.
</P>
<P>
"Many of these children will be able to return to their
parents, but many will not," Chafee said. "Too often, children who
cannot return to their parents wait for years in foster care
before they are adopted. In today's child welfare system, it has
become a lonely and tragic wait with no end."
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives passed similar legislation last
May. Chafee said minor differences between the two versions could
be worked out quickly so the bill could be sent to President Bill
Clinton on Sunday, when Congress hopes to recess for the year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last spring praised the effort, saying it will aid
administration efforts to find permanent homes for foster children.
</P>
<P>
The administration says just 20,000 of 450,000 children in
foster care in 1995 were adopted, and has set a goal of doubling
that number by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would speed up adoption process for children
who are victims of severe abuse when it is decided that the normal
"reasonable efforts" of states to find permanent homes are not
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which provides 100 million U.S. dollars over five
years, rewards states that increase adoptions with a bonus of
3,000 dollars for each safe adoption of foster children and 6,000
dollars for each adoption of children with special needs.
</P>
<P>
The bill promotes adoption of special needs children by
ensuring that they will receive health insurance coverage.

<HEADLINE> BSE Market Witnesses Poor Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bombay Stock Exchange
(BSE) market witnessed poor activity last week due to lukewarm
support from foreign institutional investors and the domestic
funds restricting their purchases to fundamentally good scrips.
</P>
<P>
Investors adopted cautious approaches and made token deals in
blue chips that were attractive to buying.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Gas Authority of India Ltd. issue caused
nervousness and the free fall of the rupee against the U.S. dollar
also weighed on sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The BSE market reacted strongly on Monday in line with the
sharp drop in overseas markets but recovered the next day on
revival of support from domestic institutions. Thereafter, trading
was dull and listless and prices showed two-way movements on
alternate bouts of buying and selling for the last three days of
the week.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index showed a fall of 55.92 points as it
ended at 3,747.32 from the last weekend close of 3,803.24. The
national index dropped by 24.95 points to 1,619.21 from 1,644.16
at the close last week.

<HEADLINE> FAO Chief Warns of Widening Gap Between Rich, Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Dwindling levels of development
aid to the world's poorest countries mean that the gap between the
wealthy and the poor is bound to widen, a U.N. official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Development aid continues to dwindle in real terms, having
hovered at a nominal 60 billion dollars in recent years. Aid to
the agriculture sector plunged from 16 billion dollars in 1988 to
10 billion in 1995, though there are welcome signs of a change in
direction," Dr. Jacques Diouf, director-general of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), told the 29th biennial FAO
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss the state of food and
agriculture in the world over the next week and also decide the
organization's Program of Work and Budget for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"The gap between rich and poor can only widen under such
conditions, both within and between countries," Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reason, Diouf mentioned the instability in some
parts of the world. "Armed conflict and food emergencies continue,
the one very often abetting the other. Peace may be a prerequisite
for food security, but there can be no peaceful life for
populations affected by hunger," he said.
</P>
<P>
The director-general described actions taken in the years since
the World Food Summit in Rome, which pledged to reduce the number
of the world chronically hungry and malnourished.
</P>
<P>
"Concrete field actions have been conducted, spearheaded by the
Special Program for Food Security which targets rural communities
in poor countries. The program is already operational in 24 of
these countries and formulation is under way in a further 42,
Diouf said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diouf also reviewed FAO's activities over the past two
years, emphasizing the high priority the organization gives to
promoting the role of women in development.
</P>
<P>
China's Agricultural Minister Liu Jiang emphasized at the
conference that China has always put food security as a top priority
in its economy.
</P>
<P>
China and FAO enjoy good cooperation, Liu said, adding that
China will support and cooperate with the U.N. organization.

<HEADLINE> Second Phase of Three Gorges Project Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 9 (Xinhua) -- The second
phase of the Three Gorges Project, the world's largest
hydro-power endeavor, has begun with the successful damming
of the Yangtze Saturday, a senior project official said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of a leakage-proof wall is expected to start
soon after the river-blocking Saturday, said Wang Jiazhu, deputy
manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The leakage-proof wall behind the upstream cofferdam is
expected to be completed next June, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
According to project design, the 17-year project comprises
three phases, The river-damming signaled the end of the first
phase and the beginning of the second-phase project. The second
phase will take six years to complete, till the operation of the
first generating unit in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The second-phase of the project is expected to be the most
difficult part of the whole project, and the amount of work
involved in intensive concrete pouring and placing accounts for
more than a half of the total, stressed Wang Jiazhu.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that when temporary shiplock is to be put to
use before the rainy season sets in next May, so that vessels can
still bypass a shiplock when the water rate in the diversion
canal reaches 20,000 cu m per second, which poses difficulties for
navigation, according to the deputy manager.
</P>
<P>
The work of installing part of the equipment has been completed
at present, he added.
</P>
<P>
The temporary shiplock will go into trial operation next
February, for a smooth operation on May 1 next year, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang disclosed that his company will make adjustments
for material supply during the second phase of the project. While
the contractors of the project will continue to supply
construction materials such as cement, timber and dynamite,
rolled steel will be purchased by placing order at fairs.

In addition, sniffer dogs, search lights and army units will be
installed at the checkpoints to prevent bombs, arms, ammunition
and LTTE rebels from slipping through the cordons.
</P>
<P>
The government has stepped up security both in the capital city
of Colombo and other parts of the country following the latest
bomb blast three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The blast was blamed on the LTTE, which has been fighting for
an independent state of their own in the north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
Members of the LTTE constantly infiltrate into the south to
carry out small group action, such as suicide bombings, while
their main guerrilla body engages government troops in the
Northern and Eastern parts of the country.

</P>

The newspapers and periodicals owe debts amounting to some 330

BANGKOK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Monks and other religious
leaders should play more active roles in the prevention of the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), social and medical
workers said at an international conference on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Religious teachings should be used to address the HIV/AIDS
problem, said some participants at the conference in Thailand's

</P>
<P>
Social and medical workers from 58 countries and regions
attended the meeting.

<P>
Mental needs are basic ones for human beings but they are
sometimes ignored, the participants were quoted as saying by local

</P>
<P>
Sometimes religious leaders can play a more important role in
fighting AIDS than doctors, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The morality of people should be strengthened so that they will
not risk their lives with HIV/AIDS since administering medication
is not enough, they added.

<HEADLINE> Three Government Ministers Appointed in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 8 (Xinhua) -- A major cabinet reshuffle was
announced here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jaroslav Sedivy, former ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and Belgium, was appointed as foreign minister
and Jindric Vodicka, former minister of labor and social affairs,
was appointed as minister of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Volak, who was former vice-chairman of the Civil
Democratic Party's Parliamentary Club, became minister of labor
and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
President of the Czech Republic Vaclac Havel, who was
hospitalized for his lung problem last Sunday, left hospital this
afternoon to appoint the three government ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is reckoned to be a major cabinet reshuffle since Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus came into power in July 1996. Up to now,
half of his 16 cabinet members have been changed or stepped down.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected resignation of former deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec on October 28 was widely regarded
as a result of rivalry in the Civil Forum headed by Prime Minister
Klaus.
</P>
<P>
President Havel returned to hospital right after the
appointment, without giving a press conference.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Rejects Clinton's Line-Item Veto Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives today voted 352-64 to reject President Bill
Clinton's line-item veto of 38 military construction programs in
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also voted 69-30 last month to restore funding for 36
of the 38 projects. Both the votes were well above the two-thirds
needed to overturn a presidential veto. But it was unclear whether
the two chambers can come up with a unified bill before they recess
for the year, possibly on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Clinton gained the line-item veto power to veto
individual spending items in bills while signing the bills to ensure
the administration moving in a new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the president exercised his new authority by killing
38 military construction projects in 24 states worth 287 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far the White House has vetoed 163 line-items against six
bills, mostly affecting military projects.
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the president used his authority to
cancel projects that were not requested in the budget and would not
substantially improve the quality of life of military service
members.
</P>
<P>
The House today also completed work on seven other bills to
finish its work and leave for its year-end recess Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It passed by voice vote the Reading Excellence Act, which
authorizes 260 million dollars over three years to help teachers,
tutors and parents to learn how to teach children reading.
</P>
<P>
It also passed by a vote of 291-125 legislation to authorize
agricultural research and education programs through 2002.

<HEADLINE> Different Views in Hungary on Entry into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Wide differences on the
question of Hungary's association with NATO emerged at mass
rallies across the country as the date for a national referendum
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister and Chairman of the Socialist Party
Horn Gyula asked his people to vote "yes" in the referendum next
Sunday on entry into NATO.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally held by his Socialist Party in the southern
city of Szeged, Horn said Hungary's entry into NATO could have its
national security protected, which he said will lead the country
to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said there will be no foreign nuclear presence in Hungarian
territory following the entry.
</P>
<P>
Also today, some opposition parties and organizations held
rallies, calling for boycott of the entry.
</P>
<P>
The "Munkaspart" party chairman, Thurmer Gyula, said at a rally
held in the central city of Szolnok that the government was
deceiving the Hungarian people on the entry issue.
</P>
<P>
Joining NATO would mean an increase of military expenditures by
at least three times and foreign nuclear deployment and military
presence in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Hungarians to go to the referendum in all
weather conditions to vote against entry into the military
alliance.

<HEADLINE> China Stays Second Largest Consumer of Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- China will remain the second
largest user of foreign direct investment after the United States
for a fifth consecutive year by the end of 1997, a senior trade
expert predicted.
</P>
<P>
Latin America and Southeast Asia are indeed rivals of China,
but the latter's market potential is still strong, said Sun
Weiyan, president of the China Transnational Corporations Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
"The reform of State-owned enterprises provides a new
investment niche for foreign investors, especially transnational
corporations (TNCs)," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to sell off myriads of small State-owned
enterprises (SOEs) to individual or institutional investors,
including foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Investors can even hold shares in larger SOEs seeking to raise
more funds, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
TNCs are coming to China and over time they will make up nearly
half of total foreign investment in China, Sun predicted.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, General Electric, Siemens and a number of other
transnational corporations have announced ambitious plans to
expand direct investment in China's automotive, power and
electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from a few domestic businesses, China has an
overall favorable policy towards TNCs, Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
"TNCs can put their hearts in their stomachs that they are
welcome," he said, citing China's urgent to upgrade its
technological level.
</P>
<P>
He added that TNCs should be allowed to invest in all sectors
except a few that pertain to State strategic interest.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Major Powers Reshape Their Relations (1) (by Lu Jin and Liu Yunfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's landmark state visit to the United States,
Jiang and Boris Yeltsin will hold their fifth summit after the
Russian president arrives today.
</P>
<P>
In just 10 days, across the Pacific and the Eurasia, the two
meetings of world leaders have caught the eyes of nearly everyone.
</P>
<P>
The visits reflect the fact that China is improving and
developing its relations with the world's two major powers -- the
United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The meetings also indicate that, in the background of profound
changes in the international situation, the three countries are
working to reshape their relations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their shared strategic interests -- maintaining world
peace and their own economic growth -- are stimulating the three
countries to coordinate their relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the results of President Jiang's U.S. trip,
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen stated that
as the world is developing toward multipolarization in the
post-Cold War days, China hopes all major countries can establish
a new pattern of relationships featuring non-mutual hostility and
non-mutual confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of relationship will benefit world peace, stability
and development, and might well be considered as a new way of
handling relations between major countries," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Ruisheng, deputy director-general of China's Center for
International Studies, said the development of the world situation
in the post-Cold War period once again proves that engaging in
confrontation and conflict and seeking world hegemonism run
counter to historical trends and will go nowhere, and that
pursuing peace and promoting development are the best routes to
the realization of national interests.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Dezhao of the center said that major powers are
gradually improving their relations through many years of seeking
answers, and current relations between them are becoming more
balanced, moving toward maturity, and are seen as in a relatively
stable state.
</P>
<P>
This favorable relationship between major powers reflects the
trend of global multipolarization, and will produce a positive
impact on world peace and development in the new century, he says.
</P>
<P>
In the post-Cold War period, common interests between China and
the United States have intensified rather than weakened. The two
have become indispensable trading partners, and the stable
political relations will help expand bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During President Jiang's U.S. visit, China and the United
States decided to "build toward a constructive strategic
partnership." As a result, Sino-U.S. relations have made tangible
progress in political, economic and trade issues.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Major Powers Reshape Their Relations (2) (by Lu Jin and Liu Yunfei) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Russian President Yeltsin visited China in April of 1996,
the two countries signed a joint statement declaring that the two
sides would develop a strategic and cooperative partnership of
equality and trust oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang paid a successful visit to Russia in April of
1997, during which Jiang and Yeltsin signed a joint statement on
the multipolarization of the world and the establishment of a new
international order.
</P>
<P>
In Yeltsin's upcoming China visit, the two countries will issue
another joint statement and sign several cooperative agreements.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the regular meetings between the two heads of
state, a similar mechanism between prime ministers of the two
countries was set in motion beginning at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the two partnerships -- China-U.S. and
China-Russia -- have prominent characteristics in common: both are
established on the basis of mutual understanding and with a view
toward the 21st century; both are moving toward stability and
forming a mechanism; the countries concerned strive for
multi-tiered and multi-dimensional cooperation, particularly in
economic, trade, scientific and technological areas; and they seek
common ground on major issues while reserving differences on minor
ones.
</P>
<P>
Both Sino-U.S. and Sino-Russian relations have developed as
they have because the three countries approach their relationships
with an eye on the new century and by proceeding from the
fundamental interests of their own people and the people of the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The current relationships between major powers stress
cooperation and consultation, and do not exclude each other. The
progress of certain bilateral relations will not harm the
interests of any third party.
</P>
<P>
In this way, this pattern of partnerships is totally different
from that during the Cold War period.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, commenting on the
China-U.S. summit, said Russia would like to see Sino-U.S.
relationships improve, and believed that it is a "factor of
stability of the international situation."
</P>
<P>
He said the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations will not affect
Russia-China relations, because Russia has very good relationships
with both China and the United States. He expressed the hope that
Russia's relationships with the two countries will develop further.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiong Zhiyong and associate professor Yang Chuang
from the Foreign Affairs College pointed out that the
establishment of stable bilateral relations between China and the
U.S., between China and Russia and between Russia and the
U.S. will help shape a new international political and economic
order.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Seeks UN's Impartial Role in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan underlines an
impartial, and neutral role of the United Nations in solving the
lingering Afghan problem, which is affecting peace and development
in the region, Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed said here today.
</P>
<P>
Describing outside interference in Afghanistan as the major
hindrance in the resolution of the Afghan crisis, Shamshad said
the U.N. and other concerned parties should exert their influence
to bring the conflicting parties within the negotiating range for
a lasting solution.
</P>
<P>
Outside interference is aggravating the conflict in
Afghanistan, which must be stopped for regional peace, he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop for economic and financial journalists
from news agencies of the countries of the Economic Cooperation
Organization (ECO), he said Pakistan is keen to see an early end
to the afghan conflict, "because, this problem is directly
affecting us."
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the impression that Pakistan is siding with the
Taliban militia, or interfering in the affairs of the neighboring
country. "In fact, we are helping all the Afghan groups to come on
the negotiating table for a permanent peace," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that restoration of peace in Afghanistan is
imperative for strengthening the role of ECO in socio-economic
development of central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Afghanistan provides the shortest possible transit
route for establishing gas pipelines among the ECO countries.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad hoped that countries in the region would play their
effective role in bringing the on-going hostilities in Afghanistan
to an early end.

<HEADLINE> New Era Predicted For Corporate Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The recent listing of
3.5-billion-yuan (421 million US dollars) in railway bonds in
Shenzhen is likely to mark a new stage for the flat corporate bond
market, which insiders said is bracing for a boost from
authoritative institutions.
</P>
<P>
Administrative departments are considering taking steps to
foster the corporate bond market -- another "leg" carrying
enterprises forward besides the stock market, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Promoting corporate bond distribution and trading is the
working focus in the coming years, said Zhang Dongsheng, deputy
director of the Financial Department under the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
As the central government embarks on an all-out campaign to
rejuvenate State-owned firms, corporate bonds have been set as a
major resort for feeding enterprises with sufficient capital.
</P>
<P>
The country is set to issue 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion
dollars) in corporate bonds next year.
</P>
<P>
The commission also will probe ways to expand floatation of
corporate bonds, for example, to distribute some bonds via the
trading network of stock exchanges, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested administrators should loosen control over the
interest rate and quota over corporate bonds, and develop mature
bond investors.
</P>
<P>
China started to issue corporate bonds in 1987. So far, the
country has floated 200 billion yuan (24 billion dollars), most of
which were used to fund State key infrastructure projects and
large State-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
However, the present corporate bond market is small and thin in
trading.
</P>
<P>
The railway bonds, which went public on October 31 on the
Shenzhen Stock Market, were the largest batch of corporate bonds
so far issued and listed in China.

66th match victory of the year, beating Pat Rafter 7-6 (7-3), 7-6
(7-3) Saturday to move into the final of the Stockholm Open tennis

</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Swede, who lost last week to top-ranked Pete
Sampras of the United States in the Paris Open, will take on
unseeded Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands in Sunday's final.

<P>
Siemerink cashed in on sloppy serving by Britain's Greg
Rusedski early in the decisive set to beat the second seed 4-6,
7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Rafter and Bjorkman, ranked third and fourth
respectively in the world, have played doubles for 18 months. It
was the fourth loss of Rafter in five matches against Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski, one of the heaviest severs in the game, started the
third set by double-faulting three times. That was only service
break Siemerink needed to win the match against the Briton.
</P>
<P>
Siemerink, 27, upset four-time former champion Boris Becker of
Germany in the second round and Wimbledon finalist Cedric Pioline
in the quarter-finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today released a program to address the mysterious illnesses that
hit many Gulf War veterans, promising treatment and compensation
and creation of a panel for monitoring Pentagon research into the
problems.
</P>
<P>
In a special report by the Presidential Advisory Committee, the
Clinton administration also pledged 13 million U.S. dollars for
new research into the Gulf War illness and a new health program
for the armed services.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the report, Clinton stated today that the
administration would find out the reasons of the illness and to
make public the facts when they are clear.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Gulf War veterans have reported sicknesses, fearing
that they were exposed to chemicals used during the conflict and
emissions from burning oil wells.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will establish a new benefits system to
ensure veterans receive treatment and compensation for all
illnesses linked to service in the Gulf, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president will also ask the National Academy of Sciences to
review the research into connections between Gulf service and
illness, and will work with Congress to legislate to guarantee
that benefits are maintained in future administrations.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments
will create a joint Force Health Protection Program, giving all
the members of the Armed Forces a comprehensive, life-long medical
record of illnesses and injuries.
