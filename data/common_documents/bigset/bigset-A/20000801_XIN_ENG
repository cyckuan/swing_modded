<HEADLINE> IOC Drug Experts Mull over New Methods to Detect EPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Drug experts began a two-day
meeting today at the Lausanne-based International Olympic
Committee (IOC) to review the scientific qualifications of the
proposed testing methods to detect recombinant, or synthetic,
erythropoietin, EPO, according to an IOC press release.
</P>
<P>
Those present at the meeting include six members of the IOC
Doping and Biochemistry of Sport sub-commission and seven external
experts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the French and Australian research teams,
both supported by IOC research funds, will report on the progress
of their respective projects. This meeting is one of two steps
these doping detection tests have to pass in order to be validated
for the Olympic Games, the second step being a juridical review.
</P>
<P>
As well as examining the ability of the tests to trace the drug,
the panel will have to be convinced that the procedures are
practical. The IOC sub-commission has also pointed out that the
chosen test must be acceptable both scientifically and legally.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Australians, the French say their test can
distinguish synthetically introduced EPO from naturally occurring
hormones using only urine samples. The Australian method requires
a blood test.
</P>
<P>
The use of EPO is reported to be widespread in sports which
require feats of endurance. The hormone helps increase the intake
of oxygen into the blood and has been successfully used by doctors
to ease difficult childbirths.
</P>
<P>
Despite EPO being on the IOC's list of prohibited substances,
no test has yet been judged sufficiently accurate to be officially
sanctioned. The Olympic panel is expected to give its verdict on
the French and Australian tests on Tuesday, although a final
decision may not be taken until the end of August.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Iranian FMs Discuss Regional Issues on Telephone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
discussed on Tuesday by telephone with his Iranian counterpart
Kamal Kharrazi the Middle East peace process, especially the issue
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation initiated by Kharrazi, the two
ministers dealt with international and regional issues affecting
the Islamic world, the question of Jerusalem in particular, state-
run Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks was part of the continued consultations between the
two countries on issues of mutual interest as Iran is the current
president of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, it said.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Islamic countries support the Palestinian position that
Israel should return Arab East Jerusalem it occupied in the 1967
Mideast War. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insists that Jerusalem, holy to Islam, Judaism and
Christianity, is its "eternal and indivisible" capital, a claim
which has never been internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Iran, who cut off diplomatic ties in 1979, have
recently been trying to remove obstacles to resume their relations.
They have lately expanded coordination on regional issues.

ADDIS ABABA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has earned over 853
million birr (about 140 million U.S. dollars) hard currency from

<HEADLINE> SADC Single Currency Depends on Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A possible single currency
for member states of the Southern African Development Community (
SADC) will depend on the level of their integration, South African
Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"SADC, as it integrates, will decide at what level it is and
what it can or can not do at that level," she told a news
conference in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"We can't say never or yes. It will depend on the level of
integration," Dlamini-Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that it had taken the European Union over 40
years to get to the point where it introduced the euro and even
now not all the EU countries had joined the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the upcoming SADC summit to be held in the
Namibian capital of Windhoek on Sunday and Monday, Dlamini-Zuma
said the presidents of member states are expected to give the
green light for a SADC trade protocol, laying the basis for a
regional free trade area.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 10 countries of the 14-member regional bloc
have ratified the protocol, which will take effect on September 1
and phase out tariff barriers for intra-SADC trade over the next
eight years.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails WTO Rules Over Row with US on Wheat Gluten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
expressed satisfactions Tuesday with a WTO panel's ruling in favor
of the European Union against the United States on wheat gluten
trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy over the result of the panel," Spokesman of
the EU executive Commission, Anthony Gooch, told reporters at a
daily news briefing.
</P>
<P>
A panel in the World Trade Organization ruled Monday that a U.S.
safeguard quota imposed on the import of wheat gluten falls foul
of WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
In the panel's report, the U.S. wheat gluten quota was found to
have violated the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. The Commission, EU'
s competition watchdog, expects "the U.S. to comply with the
ruling and withdraw the measure, bringing to a welcome close a
protracted and unnecessary trade dispute".
</P>
<P>
If the United States fails to withdraw the quota, the EU "will
have no option but to apply a compensatory tariff on the lucrative
trade in corn gluten feed within 5 days of adoption of the Panel
report by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body," the Commission said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wheat gluten, a nutritious mixture of plant proteins occurring
in wheat, is a co-product of wheat starch. Wheat starch and wheat
gluten are the two main outputs of the wheat processing industry.
Wheat starch is usually processed into alcohol or sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
Wheat gluten is mainly used in food processing applications. In
particular, it is an essential ingredient to develop medium-
quality wheat into bread-making quality, particularly in years
when the wheat harvest is of low to medium quality.
</P>
<P>
The United States introduced the safeguard measure in the form
of a quota on imports of wheat gluten from various sources,
including from the EU, on June 1, 1998. The EU, being the main
supplier of the product to the U.S., "was severely affected by the
measure which cut imports by 40%."
</P>
<P>
The EU requested a WTO panel on June 3, 1999 after "fruitless
consultations with the U.S. failed to lead to resolutions of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel also found that the quota applied to the second
exporter, Australia, was so generous that its trade had to expand
to fill the amount of EU's import cut. In addition, Canada was
unjustifiably excluded from the safeguard measure.
</P>
<P>
An existing WTO rule specifies that such a quota, if legal in
the first place, must be applied to all third-country suppliers
equitably, according to the EU executive.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Worldwide Campaign Against Counterfeit Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Microsoft is using new technology to support the campaign,
including an Internet monitoring tool that can search suspect
sites on the Internet. The campaign has already led to 64 criminal
raids and 17 civil lawsuits in 15 countries worldwide, the company
said. In the United States, where more than 3,000 Internet
auctions were taken down in July, Microsoft is announcing six
Internet anti-piracy lawsuits and two settlements Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new campaign comes as emerging technologies seek to make it
easier to distribute pirated copies of movies, music and software
on the Internet. "Ultimately we're going to need a combination of
new technology and new relationships between the public and
private sectors that protect the law-abiding interests of both
creators and consumers," Microsoft said in a statement. "The
protection of intellectual property rights on the Internet is
essential to encourage creative individuals and companies to
develop new products that will benefit consumers."

<HEADLINE> Chilean Supreme Court Starts Session on Pinochet's Immunity Privation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Supreme Court started
Tuesday morning its plenary session on immunity privation of
former military ruler, Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
The process was approved on May 23 by Santiago's Appeal Court.
</P>
<P>
Chile's highest law tribunal's session will extend for about
two hours and a half, and afterwards there could be a
pronouncement regarding the situation of the former commander of
the South American country's army forces.
</P>
<P>
The plenum is carried out under the strictest security, for
right outside the Supreme Court's headquarters there are many
sympathizers and opponents, waving banners and signs from their
own groups, distributed on streets alongside the building.
</P>
<P>
However, everything is calm in expectancy of the court's
decision, either ratifying or revoking the sentence to strip of
immunity the life-senator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hernan Alvarez, president of Chile's Supreme Court,
said that today's decision would be released immediately in case
of an "overwhelming decision" for or against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
If Pinochet is not stripped of immunity, the required inquiries
by Juan Guzman Tapia on the so-called "Death Caravan" by which the
privation of immunity to the former commander was required, will
be over.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the stripping of immunity is confirmed, Guzman will
be empowered to hold, interrogate and even process the former
ruler; this after ordering the application of medical examinations
to determine if Pinochet is in condition to face a trial,
something to which his family opposes to.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet returned to Chile in early March after 503 days under
arrest in Britain. He avoided extradition to Spain --where a judge
had wanted to try him on torture charges -- on the grounds that he
was too ill for a trial. Britain's drawn-out extradition decision
turned the world's news media spotlight on Pinochet's rights
record.
</P>
<P>
In May, a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet, 84,of
his immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed against that
ruling in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, judges heard testimony from lawyers
representing the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year rule
and from lawyers defending him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet ousted socialist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody September 1973 coup. More than 3,000 people died or
disappeared while Pinochet was president and tens of thousands of
other Chileans fled the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the most infamous incidents of the era involved the so-
called "Death Caravan," a military helicopter unit that blitzed
through northern Chile in October 1973 in search of union leaders
and left-wing supporters of Allende. At least 72 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
One widely held belief is that the Supreme Court will uphold
the previous ruling, which took away the general's immunity from
prosecution but Pinochet could ultimately avoid being dragged
through the courts because of poor health.

<HEADLINE> Arabs to Boycott Library Conference in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries will boycott an
international library conference in Jerusalem in mid-August by
reason that it is to be held on occupied Arab land, the Palestinian
representative to the Arab League said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The league has demanded suspension of the conference until the
Palestinians and Israel reach an agreement on a settlement of
Jerusalem, holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians, Mohamed Sobeih
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutions (IFLA), however, is going ahead with its annual
conference in Jerusalem on August 13-18, despite the pan-Arab
forum's objections, Sobeih said.
</P>
<P>
Arab library organizations would hold a rival meeting in Cairo
to coincide with the Jerusalem conference, he added.
</P>
<P>
An Arab League report has said that holding the library meeting
in Jerusalem violates the relevant United Nations resolutions.
According to the report, the IFLA has informed the league that it
understood Arab objections but could not change the venue of its
conference for logistical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem during the 1967 Mideast war
and the status of the city is now under negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state. But Israel insists that the city is its "
eternal and unified" capital, a claim which has never recognized by
the international community.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Oil-For-Food Chief on Fact-Finding Visit to Iraq EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The executive director of the
United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq, Benon Sevan, arrived
here Tuesday afternoon for a fact-finding visit.
</P>
<P>
This is his fourth visit to the sanctions-stricken country and
he is expected to stay here for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, he went straight into the Al-Rasheed Hotel in
central Baghdad without meeting the media. It is expected that his
visit will mainly focus on the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-
food program.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his trip to Iraq, Sevan released a statement, declaring
that the U.N. humanitarian program is no substitute for the
resumption of normal trade activity in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "There is no doubt that the situation for many
in that country is significantly better than it was when the first
oil was exported under the program at the end of 1996."
</P>
<P>
Sevan last visited Iraq in June 1999 to examine ways to increase
Iraq's crude exports under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old program is an exemption to the crippling U.N.
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell oil in return for food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the impacts of the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Ship Stopped from Crossing Turkish Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- An international row emerged after
a Romanian-flagged vessel "Enterprise" was not allowed by the
Turkish authorities to cross the straits linking the Mediterranean
Sea and the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday that the ship had to
anchor off the Dardanelles Strait on July 16 and is still remaining
there, with its load of 192,554 tons of iron, unable to enter the
Marmara Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities claimed that their action was justified
because the Romanian ship does not obey the international security
rules for strait passing.
</P>
<P>
Romanian officials at the Romanian Black Sea Port of Constanza
accused Turkey of failing to "abide by the Montreux Agreement,"
which defines the rules and regulations of ship passage through the
Turkish Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish officials said any ship whose length is more than
300 meters should get a report, which sets the conditions for a
safe passage, from either the Turkish Maritime Undersecretariat or
Istanbul Sea Traffic Control-Order Authority. Enterprise is 312
meters in overall length.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the report-rule was put in accordance
with the international security agreements and that Romanian
officials on the vessel refused to abide by this rule.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is surrounded by the sea on three sides: the
Mediterranean in the south, the Aegean in the west and the Black
Sea in the north. The three seas are linked by the straits,
consisting from southwest to northeast, of the Dardanelles, the
Marmara Sea and the Bosphorus.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets Top U.S. Trade Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
King Abdullah Bin Hussein met with U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky on Tuesday to discuss ways of enhancing
economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Barshefsky and Jordan's Deputy Prime
Minister and State Minister for Economic Affairs Mohammad Halayqah
briefed the king on the outcome of their two-day talks on a free
trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both officials believed that positive atmosphere dominated the
negotiations which will lead to necessary steps and legislative
procedures to help the agreement to come to force, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he hoped the agreement will provide an appropriate
climate to encourage leading U.S. and international companies to
invest in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The king said he was also keen to see the agreement as a vehicle
for the transfer of U.S. technology to Jordan and encouraging
greater participation in the economy by the private sector of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
For her part, Barshefsky commended the king's efforts to upgrade
the living standards of Jordanian citizens by trying to achieve
sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
She said the envisaged free trade agreement will have a
tremendous impact on developing various economic sectors in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Jordan Prime Minister Ali Abu
Ragheb, Royal Court Chief Fayez Tarawneh, and other ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said they hoped the free trade deal with the
U.S. could be signed in August or early September after technical
differences were solved, including labor laws, taxations and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to encourage greater flow of bilateral
trade, investments and technological transfers between the two
countries.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is to travel to Egypt on Thursday to hold talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the Middle East peace process, Barak's
office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet Mubarak in Egyptian Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria, in which Barak will brief Mubarak on the Camp David
summit and the two leaders will "discuss the results of the summit
and their ramifications," the office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Barak will return to Israel soon after the talks, the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
The two-week long three-way U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian summit
ended last Tuesday without any framework agreement on final-status
issues such as the status of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian
refugees and the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Barak was slated to hold talks with Mubarak last Friday, but the
visit has been postponed due to political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat stopped over in Alexandria last
Wednesday for talks with Mubarak on his way back home from the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denies Funding Bin Laden Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Tuesday denied
foreign reports that the Afghan Taliban authorities arrested three
persons who confessed that they were commissioned by Emir of Riyadh
Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz to assassinate Saudi dissident Osama Bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
The reports carried by London dailies on Monday are groundless
and fabricated, the Saudi News Agency quoted a Saudi official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudi Arabian Kingdom did not, and will not, adopt such
policies at any time or any place and under no conditions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia respects, and follows strictly, its open and
clear policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other
countries," he added
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of the Interior Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz said that
Bin Laden was not "a Saudi national" and that Saudi Arabia was "not
interested in him in the least."
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, an Afghanistan-based Saudi-expelled billionaire, has
been wanted by the United States for allegedly masterminding
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that claimed
dozens of lives in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israeli New President Sworn in With Calls for Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday inaugurated
its
eighth president Moshe Katsav, who called for different sectors of
the society to eliminate their differences and make joint efforts
for a better future.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, a candidate from the opposition Likud party who defeated
his rival Shimon Peres from the Labor Party in Monday's
presidential
election with a surprise 63-57 vote, said that conflicts, disorder
and hostilities that harass the Israeli society are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the tensions existing between the right- and left-
wing factions, the old and new generations as well as those between
the Jews and Arabs can be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
I will study the social crises facing the Israeli society,
particularly the tensions spurred by the widening gaps between the
rich and poor, said the 54-year old new president who is mainly a
symbolic figure.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, the first Likud candidate who ever won a presidential
election and who is a Sephardi with an origin in the Arab world,
said all the Israeli Arabs, who number 1.1 million, should enjoy
the status of partnership and contribute to the construction and
consolidation of the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Katsav said, is a developed state which is in the
process of development. Many things are still fettering its steps
forward. Thereby, all Israelis should make joint efforts for its
beautiful future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Katsav said it is better for the president
to focus on the internal problems in the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
Former president Ezer Weizman, who resigned on July 10 and
earned a name of being an "interventionist", attended the
inauguration ceremony and delivered a speech prior to that of his
successor.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old former general looked back on the major wars
that the country had gone through since its foundation in 1948 and
called on continued efforts to push ahead the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who often drew criticisms by airing pro-peace remarks
while in office, said that despite the failure of the Camp David
summit which ended last week and the difficult situation at the
moment, greater efforts should be made to promote the peace process
and regional reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He praised the peace efforts made by the leaders including late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his successor Ehud Barak and said
that great leaders can make history.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who was to have served till 2003, made the resignation
decision at the end of May after the state prosecutor issued a
report to finalize his gift-taking scandal. Katsav is the first
president in the country who will serve one seven-year term instead
of one five-year term with an option for another term.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Predicts New Elections Within Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- New general elections in Israel
could be held within months as the Israeli people can not accept
the concessions made by Prime Minister Ehud Barak to the
Palestinians, said opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The elections could take place by April, perhaps earlier, since
Barak lost his majority in the Knesset (parliament) last month and
offered to share sovereignty in Jerusalem with the Palestinians at
the Camp David summit, Sharon told a press conference organized by
the Foreign Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to the Israeli people that Jerusalem would be
the united capital of Israel, but he broke this promise at Camp
David, Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
The two-week-long summit at Camp David near Washington ended
last Tuesday without any framework agreement on final-status issues
such as Jerusalem, borders, settlement and refugees, but news
reports said that Barak had conceded the principle of shared
sovereignty in parts of East Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the
1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli leader had no right to make concessions in
Jerusalem given the Jewish people's deep attachment to the holy
city going back thousands of years," Sharon added.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that with him as prime minister, Israel would forge
a long-term interim peace agreement with the Palestinians to be
implemented step by step over a period of years as relations
developed.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said he could accept creation of an independent
Palestinian state in lands under Palestinian rule so long as the
sides came to terms on its nature and it posed no threat to
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected Barak's reported proposal to give up more than
80 percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian state could have no military forces, only police
in the numbers agreed upon previously, and Israel would control the
new borders of the Palestinian state to prevent the smuggling of
weapons along with the rights to fly over it, he added.
</P>
<P>
If Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were to declare a state
without an agreement, Israel would annex those parts of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip still under Israeli control, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Prefers Joint Ownership of Caspian Sea: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Tuesday that Iran prefers a joint ownership of
the Caspian Sea resources with other littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to accept a complete division of the Caspian Sea
among its five littoral states, with Iran having a 20 percent
share, Kharrazi told Victor Kalyuzhny, Russian President Vladimir
Putin's special envoy for Caspian Sea affairs.
</P>
<P>
The five littoral states of the Caspian Sea are Iran, Russia,
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The states have long
called for a legal regime to govern the Caspian Sea, which has high
potentials for oil, gas, navigation and fishery.
</P>
<P>
According to two agreements signed in 1921 and 1940 between Iran
and the former Soviet Union, the sea could be exploited jointly.
But since the break-up of the Soviet Union, newly independent
states such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have been
seeking a new legal status on the sea.
</P>
<P>
Iran prefers a joint ownership of Caspian Sea resources as
called for in the 1921 and 1940 accords, Kharrazi told Kalyuzhny in
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated Iran's stance that an
organization, comprising the five littoral countries, should be set
up to deal with the Caspian Sea issue.
</P>
<P>
Kalyuzhny for his part referred to Iran as "a strategic ally" of
Russia, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. He briefed
Kharrazi on his recent discussions with officials of other Caspian
Sea littoral countries.
</P>
<P>
The Russian special envoy arrived here Monday at the head of a
political-economic delegation. Immediately after his arrival, he
held talks with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American
Affairs Morteza Sarmadi.
</P>
<P>
Both officials stressed in the talks that the 1921 and 1940
agreements should be the basis for any legal regime for the Caspian
Sea.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi also noted in the meeting that Iran is willing to take
20 percent of the sea to speed up a solution to the Caspian Sea
problem.
</P>
<P>
Iran gives priority to a shared regime for the Caspian Sea which
could preserve collective interests of the sea and keep the region
away from destructive rivalry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Washington Area's July The Coolest Since 1918 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- It may be summertime, but
last month at least, the living in Washington area was pretty
breezy.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature was more than five degrees below normal
in what the National Weather Service said was one of the
Washington area's coolest Julys on record.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall was generally about two inches above normal and as
much as six inches above normal east of town, The Washington Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, it was the coolest July, with an average daily
temperature of 23.61 degree Celsius, since the summer of 1918's
average of 23.56. And the sun was able to push the thermometer to
32.22 only once in July.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the Weather Service said, the temperature in the
Washington area hit 32.22 degrees on 22 days in July. The average
is 14. This July saw but once, on July 10.
</P>
<P>
This month, though, is expected to see more of a return to
normal temperatures, the Weather Service said Monday, with the
usual hot-weather about to dominate summertime.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Public Hearing on Sierra Leone Gems Enters Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. public hearing on
illicit diamonds trade in Sierra Leone entered the second day
Tuesday here in a bid to probe the link between the illegal sale
of the precious stone from the West African nation and arms
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The two-day hearing, first of its kind, was requested in a
July 15 Security Council resolution imposing an embargo on diamond
exports from Sierra Leone for at least 18 months, unless the gems
are sold under a government certification system.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, experts in arms, aviation as well as government
officials from African countries are expected to discuss ways to
stop the trade in "conflict" diamonds and how to bring peace to
the war-torn Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In the first-day testimony, U.S. and British officials accused
the presidents of Liberia and Burkina Faso of helping Sierra Leone
rebels violate the United Nations embargo on diamond exports, a
charge diplomats from both African nations denied.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents have long personal ties to the leadership of
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and it was asserted
that they were facilitating the rebel group's diamond business and
supporting the rebel war through training, supply of personnel and
arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In a testimony, the British delegation, lead by British
Ambassador to the United Nations Jeremy Greenstock, alleged that
Taylor had recently held high-level meetings with RUF leaders in
Monrovia and Ouagadougou.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation said 40 percent of Sierra Leone
diamonds pass through Burkina Faso to the international market
while the rest passes through Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers also said Liberia and Burkina Faso have been
the main channels through which illegally exploited Sierra Leone
diamonds are exported and arms supplied to the RUF.
</P>
<P>
However, in their reactions, the representatives of Liberia
and Burkina Faso insisted that the allegations made against their
countries and leaders were not backed by evidence.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan said those accusing
Liberia must present evidence which Liberia will have to
scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso's U.N. Permanent Representative Michel Kafando
described the allegations against his country as rumors being
easily disseminated.
</P>
<P>
In early July, the United Nations Security Council banned

<HEADLINE> Albright Says No Internationalization on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here Tuesday that the "internationalization" on the
future status of Jerusalem, had been rejected as a possible
solution.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived here Monday evening, said at a joint
press conference here with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
that "at Camp David, the question of the internationalization of
Jerusalem was not the solution."
</P>
<P>
She said that, during the peace negotiations, the Palestinians
"weren't interested in the internationalization of Jerusalem but
in having an open city".
</P>
<P>
The "principal point" remains the "control of sacred sites,"
Albright said, adding that this was the "real complication".
</P>
<P>
Dini, for his part, said that "Italy, unfortunately, does not
have a magic formula to solve the impasse," but stressed that some
progress at least had been made during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time ever at Camp David both sides talked openly,
" Dini said, adding that the U.S. was playing a crucial role in
the Middle East peace process, which no other country could fill.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Albright also hold talks with Vatican diplomatic
Chief Jean-Louis Tauran, her hope from the Vatican is thought to
be for help in seeking to overcome the negotiating gap between
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
But the official communique issued by the Vatican contained no
hint if her hope was well-grounded.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit between Israeli leader Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat stalled on the issue of Jerusalem,
which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican, for its part, is sticking to its long-standing
call for an internationally-guaranteed special status for
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II renewed this call during the summit itself,
on July 23, stressing that, "the Holy See continues to believe
that only a special status, internationally guaranteed, can
effectively preserve the most sacred parts of the Holy City and
ensure the liberty of religion and practice for all."
</P>
<P>
Vatican established normal diplomatic relations with Israel in
December 1993 but - in line with the position of the international
community, anchored in UN resolutions - it did not recognize the
sovereignty of the Jewish State over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war
and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It has
insisted that Jerusalem be its undivided capital and is totally
opposed to the idea of an international mandate or an
international statute for the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, meanwhile, want East Jerusalem as their
future capital.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Tries to Go to Root of Conflict in Sierra Leone (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone diamonds were
once again brought into lime light as a U.N. sanctions committee
Monday opened a two-day public hearing in order to probe the link
between the illicit trade in gems in the West African country and
arms trafficking.
</P>
<P>
When a government geologist discovered diamonds in 1930 in
Sierra Leone, he could not have so wild an imagination that the
precious stone are being used to fuel a nine-year civil war
against both legitimate government and innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Lone gems, described as "the conflict diamonds" by the
international community, are at the heart of the tragedy in the
war-torn country. The precious resources have become the cause of
human suffering on a terrible scale, rather than a source of
wealth for national development.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Sanction Committee on Sierra Leone Monday
kicked off the public hearing, first of its kind, following the 15-
nation body's July 5 decision to impose a global ban on the
illicit trade in Sierra Leone diamonds, a move described by Alhaji
Mohammed Deen, minister of mineral resources of Sierra Lone, as "
the first time for the Council to go to the root of the conflict
in his country."
</P>
<P>
"For nine years, the people of Sierra Leone have suffered the
consequences of the illegal use of the nation's diamonds as a tool
for destruction rape, amputation, abduction, indiscriminate
killings and other atrocities against innocent civilians," the
minister told the public hearing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Sierra Leone is endowed with precious minerals
and other natural resources, especially diamonds, is not a bane.
The problem is how and for what purpose the proceeds derived from
these resources are used.
</P>
<P>
"It is bad enough when millions of dollars worth of our
diamonds are smuggled out of the country, when the Government is
deprived of revenue for its socioeconomic programs, and when the
masses of our people do not benefit from the resources," Sylvester
Rowe, Sierra Leone's deputy permanent representative to the United
Nations, told the public hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is worse, and a gross violation of human rights when
proceeds from the illegal exploitation and sale of our diamonds
are used to buy weapons to kill our people and prolong the
suffering of our people, including children who have been
virtually deprived of their future," he said. "So, at the heart of
the issue of diamonds is the link to trade in arms, ammunition and
other material to fuel the rebel war."
</P>
<P>
In early May, the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led
by Foday Sankoh who is currently under government custody in the
capital Freetown, violated a peace accord signed by Sankoh and the
government in July last year by taking more than 500 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the public hearing Monday, speaker after
speaker testified to the fact that President Charles Taylor of
Liberia and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso have been directing
the RUF's war strategy.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents have long personal ties to the RUF leadership
and it was asserted that they were facilitating the rebel group's
diamond business and supporting the rebel war through training,
supply of personnel and arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
In response, however, diplomats from the two West African
countries have denied the allegations, which they described as
rumors and not being backed by evidence.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the U.N. Sanctions Committee should go into great
details in its probe in order to provide convincing answers to the
following questions:
</P>
<P>
How does the RUF rebels procure arms, ammunition and other war
material, and what are their sources of origin?
</P>
<P>
What types of arms do these rebels procure?
</P>
<P>
How does the RUF pay for the arms and for the services of
those who train their combatants in the use of these weapons?
</P>
<P>
How does the RUF get diamonds? How does it sell them, through
what channels and to whom?
</P>
<P>
What role does RUF supports and surrogates play in diamonds
and arms transactions?
</P>
<P>
How does the RUF finance its external public relations
activities aimed at indirectly blocking resources for
international and regional peacekeeping efforts in Sierra Leone?
</P>
<P>
By faithfully answering the above-mentioned questions, the
Sanctions Committee can help choke off the financial resources for
the RUF to buy weapons or to drag on the conflict in Sierra Leone,
where a thriving gem-for-gun business fans the hard-to-end warfare.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Canadian Mint launched
its latest 25-cent coin Tuesday to underscore family value in the
country.
</P>
<P>
With a double wolf design, the new coin is a tribute to the
Canadian family, symbolizing togetherness, pride and integrity in
relationships, the country's Crown corporation stated at the
launching.
</P>
<P>
The design "reminds all Canadians that the family, a key
relationship in our lives, is the fabric of Canadian society, and
ties together individuals and communities from generation to
generation,"said Royal Canadian Mint President Danielle Wetherup.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the new 25-cent coin represents the final stage

<HEADLINE> Alitalia to Sue KLM for 250 Million Euros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Italian carrier Alitalia said
Tuesday that an attempt to heal the rift with its former strategic
partner, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, had fallen through and that it
would be pushing ahead with its plans to sue the Dutch company for
250 million euros.
</P>
<P>
The Alitalia board met Tuesday and told reporters afterwards
that directors had "taken act" of the failure of talks aimed at a
reconciliation with KLM, which abruptly announced its withdrawal
from the strategic accord with Alitalia on April 28.
</P>
<P>
The board said that it had suffered damages of more than 50
million euros as a result of KLM's "illegitimate" action and
wanted KLM to pay a penalty of 250 million euros.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia also repeated Tuesday that it had no intention of
giving KLM back the 100 million euros it contributed to the
renovation of Milan's new airport, Malpensa 2000, sticking to the
line that the motives cited by the Dutch carrier for breaking the
contract were "inadequate and contradictory."
</P>
<P>
It said that it wanted the case to be heard in Amsterdam, by an
international panel, in accordance with clauses contained in the
broken contract.
</P>
<P>
The panel would consist of three members, an Italian, a
Dutchman and the third from a neutral country.

<HEADLINE> UK Motorists Protest Over Petrol Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) - Millions of motorists in Britain
Tuesday sent a clear message to the Government by boycotting
garage forecourts in protest at soaring petrol prices.
</P>
<P>
They are following calls to "Dump the Pump" for 24 hours in a
nationwide show of fury at the sky-high cost of fuel - 70 percent
of which goes to the Government in tax.
</P>
<P>
The protest will then continue every Monday until the
Government finally puts the brakes on the increasing toll of
running a car.
</P>
<P>
According to a NOP Solutions survey recently, 57 percent of
drivers intend to support the boycott, which has been boosted by a
campaign called "Highway Robbery"for cut in the tax on fuel.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Transport Spokesman Bernard Jenkin said: "For many
families, the cost of running a car is now more than the cost of
their mortgage."
</P>
<P>
It was reported nearly nine in ten small companies support
Today's boycott. Many of the 13500 petrol stations were deserted.

<HEADLINE> Company Seeks Donors of DNA on The Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A California star-up called
DNA Sciences introduced a Web site Tuesday that will recruit
people to donate their DNA to help find genes that cause disease.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has James Watson, a discoverer of the DNA
double helix, as a director and James Clark, Netscape's founder,
as an investor, hopes to get 50,000 to 100,000 people to
contribute to its "gene trust" by appealing to their altruism, The
New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The knowledge we gain from the gene trust has the potential to
change medicine forever," the site, DNA.com, says. "But we can't
do it without your help."
</P>
<P>
The new effort reflects a big change taking place in genetics.
Studies to link genes to disease are starting to be done on an
unparalleled scale, involving far more people than ever before.
</P>
<P>
In the past, scientists usually found disease-causing genes by
studying a few families or some isolated village with a high
prevalence of a disease. Such genes have often been for rare
inherited diseases, in which a defect in a single gene is at fault.
</P>
<P>
But that technique is becoming less effective. The diseases of
most interest to drug companies and the public health, are common
ones like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's and
schizophrenia. It is believed many genes contribute to such
diseases, with each one having a small effect. To find these genes,
hundreds or thousands of patients might be needed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending Rebounds in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer spending posted
a strong rebound in June after two months of lackluster growth,
while manufacturing activity remained steady in July, suggesting
that the economy has yet to slow as expected by analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that consumer spending
rose by 0.5 percent in June, a slightly better-than-expected gain
following smaller increases of just 0.2 percent in April and 0.3
percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing Managers said
that its production index remained at 51.8 percent in July, ending
a four-month decline in a key gauge of future factory activity. A
reading above 50 percent means manufacturing activity will grow in
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in consumer spending outstripped American workers'
gain in incomes, which were up 0.4 percent in June. That was in
line with analysts' expectations and was a slight improvement from
a 0.3 percent income advance in May.
</P>
<P>
With spending rising faster than income growth, Americans'
personal savings rate slipped to 0.1 percent in June, its lowest
level since a similar 0.1 percent savings rate in March.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said that
construction spending fell 1.7 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 800 billion U.S. dollars. It marked the
third consecutive monthly decline after decreases of 0.2 percent
in May and 1.7 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The June rebound in consumer spending, which accounts for two-
thirds of total economic activity, was a further sign that the
economic slowdown many economists have been expecting has yet to
materialize.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the government reported that the overall economy,
as measured by the gross domestic product, was growing at an
annual rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter, even better than
the 4.8 percent growth posted in the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
That report has raised new concerns that the Federal Reserve
will likely feel the need to boost interest rates further when Fed
policy-makers next meet on August 22.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has boosted interest rates six times over the
past 13 months in an effort to slow economic growth and keep
inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Talk with Mubarak on Mideast Peace Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- President of the Palestinian
National Authority Yasser Arafat is scheduled to visit Egypt on
Wednesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak as part of his
tour of Arab nations, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will keep Mubarak posted on the latest developments of
the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and the outcome of his
current Arab tour, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco, Tunisia and
Algeria, which he left on Tuesday to return to Tunisia, and then go
on to Libya, in a bid to rally support from Arab countries for the
Palestinian stand.
</P>
<P>
He will also brief Mubarak on his recent visit to France, where
he held talks with President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, it said.
</P>
<P>
France is holding the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
European Union, which is keen on playing a role in mediating the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently travels to Egypt for consultations with
Mubarak on the Mideast peace talks. He last visited Egypt on
Wednesday on his way home from the Camp David in the United States,
where he failed to reach an agreement with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day Camp David talks centered on the most difficult
issues including Jerusalem, refugees, settlements and borders, but
the deal breaker proved to be Jerusalem, the contended holy city
for Judaism, Islam and Christianity.

<HEADLINE> Levy Urges Barak to Form National Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy again urged Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Tuesday to form a
national unity government with the opposition Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
"It is still not too late for Prime Minister Ehud Barak to form
a national unity government with all major political parties
including the Likud," Levy said after meeting with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Tuesday meeting with Barak was the third one since
Barak's return to Israel after attending the three-way Camp David
summit on Middle East peace last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Levy said he discussed with Barak about the chances and
possibility of forming a national unity government at the meeting,
and insisted he will resign from the government on Wednesday unless
Barak takes actions to form such a government, as promised on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the failure of the Camp David summit, Levy, along with
Israel's opposition parties, blamed Barak for making too many
concessions to the Palestinians, particularly on the proposed
settlement of Jerusalem, the holy city for Judaism, Islam and
Christianity.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the Arab East Jerusalem, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as capital of their future
independent states, while Israel insists that Jerusalem be its "
eternal and indivisible capital."
</P>
<P>
Barak met Levy at the Defense Ministry last Thursday evening in
Tel Aviv and Levy told Barak that he was considering to resign from
the government. On Sunday the two met again to try to solve the
tension between them.
</P>
<P>
Levy refused to attend the Camp David summit with Barak,
insisting that the time was not ripe for the summit because the
Palestinians were not ready to make compromise on key issues in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Levy's Gesher (bridge) party, which has two seats in the Knesset
(parliament), formed One Israel with Barak's Labor following the
general elections in May of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office issued a statement on Monday, saying the prime
minister will in the coming days start dealing with putting
together a new coalition government through contacts with various
elements.
</P>
<P>
Barak met Shas party leader Eli Yishai on Tuesday, but nothing
has been disclosed. Earlier Tuesday, a Shas spokesman said the
party will not object to discussing a new coalition government with
Barak if asked for.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Anti-Drug Police Seize Hauls of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
confiscated hauls of drugs in recent operations across the country,
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, the police seized 434 kilograms (kg) of
heroin packed in nine separate bags in a car in central Aksaray
province on Monday. Four suspects were captured.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the police impounded 3,152 roots of Indian hemp in
Islahiye township of southern Gaziantep province and incinerated
them.
</P>
<P>
In the biggest city Istanbul, the anti-narcotics team seized
200 kgs of heroin and 8,670 illicit drug pills. Seven suspects were
taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the police revealed a criminal gang which tried
to smuggle a considerable amount of heroin from Iran to European
countries via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Three days ago, the police stopped and searched a passenger bus
at the Ipsala Border Gate between Turkey and Greece, seizing 200
kilograms of heroin hidden in the cache of the bus. Four suspects
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Turkish chief police authority said that the
anti-narcotics police had launched "determined and successful"
struggle against illicit drug trafficking via the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued amid some newspapers criticising the
police of carrying out inefficient anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
The police authority summed up its latest operations and
dismissed the reports "unrealistic and baseless."
</P>
<P>

NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin spoke to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
telephone on Monday evening and personally thanked him for the
release of five Russian pilots from an Indian jail in the
northeastern coastal city of Calcutta, the Press Trust of India (

</P>
<P>
The five, convicted of illegal airdrop of arms in Purulia

Putin thanked Vajpayee for the helpful and positive attitude of
the Indian government in connection with the release of the pilots,
said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee conveyed to Putin that New Delhi's decision was in
line with good relations between the two countries and a
reflection of the deep friendship between the people, the PTI
quoted an Indian foreign office spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also said: "We look forward to President Putin's visit
to India in October this year," and assured the Russian leader of
a warm welcome and fruitful discussions during his stay in India,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, both leaders stressed the
importance of close Indo-Russian cooperation in combating
extremism and terrorism, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Two African Leaders Accused of Breaking Gem Embargo, NYT Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British representatives
accused the presidents of Liberia and Burkina Faso of helping
Sierra Leone rebels violate United Nations embargo on diamond
exports, a charge diplomats of both African countries denied, the
leading U.S. daily newspaper New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"American and British officials accused the presidents of
Liberia and Burkina Faso today of taking personal roles in trading
arms for diamonds in violation of a United Nations embargo," the
newspaper said. "The officials also said the two leaders had
helped Sierra Leone rebels to continue fighting their civil war."
</P>
<P>
Stephen Pattison, a senior U.K. diplomat, told a U.N. public
hearing Monday that Liberian President Charles Taylor received
diamonds in payment for arms he sent to Sierra Leone rebels in
recent weeks, while President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso sent
mercenaries to help rebels fight U.N. peacekeepers in return for
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke
accused Taylor of "fueling the conflict in Sierra Leone for his
own benefit," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council banned trading
in Sierra Leone diamonds in a bid to stop the financing of the
civil war in the West African country, but did not impose an
embargo on Liberia, a decision industry officials said made it
difficult to stop a flow of Sierra Leone diamonds to world markets.

BUCHAREST, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Archaeological excavations have
uncovered a 7,000-year-old Neolithic village in western Romania,
the local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Romania Libera said shelters, a necropolis,
and many ceramic items were found at the prehistoric site, which
is located in the Dudestii Vechi village, Timis county.
</P>
<P>
A human skeleton among the many discoveries has drawn the
attention of experts because it was found lying on its side. The
animal bones unearthed near the human skeleton can also be dated
back to the bronze age, which is considered a transition period.
</P>
<P>
The first Neolithic villages found in Romania are located in
the southern county of Dolj and central counties of Cluj and Sibiu.
</P>
<P>
The new archaeological discoveries in Timis are believed to be

<HEADLINE> HK Has Another Successful Artificial Insemination of Dolphin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Ocean Park, after
confirming the world's first successful artificial insemination of
a bottlenose dolphin last month, said on Tuesday it had another
successful dolphin artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
The new mother-to-be "Gina" and her pal "Ada" are expecting
their artificially-created baby in May 2001, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In April, researchers chose four female dolphins at the park
for artificial insemination. They confirmed last month that she-
dolphin "Ada" had a successful pregnancy by artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
Though the artificial insemination of the remaining two
dolphins failed, researchers said the successful artificial
inseminations of two bottlenose dolphins almost at the same time
is an exciting breakthrough in the study of dolphins in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Ocean Park and the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University began a joint research program to investigate the
reproductive physiology of dolphins and ways to control breeding
with the aim of maximizing their genetic health.
</P>
<P>
The program has been acknowledged as being at the forefront of
marine mammal care and breeding science.
</P>
<P>
Researchers are now able to access the maturity of each dolphin
and identify and monitor ovarian cycles in female dolphins, which
makes it possible for them to artificially create dolphin
pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Plagues Closely Related to Calcium, Iron-Rich Areas: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts say they have
discovered that the source of plagues usually contain high levels
of calcium and iron, a discovery which they say will help prevent
and control the epidemic globally.
</P>
<P>
Tan Jian'an, a research fellow with the Geographic Science and
Resources Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said
the calcium and iron-rich areas are semi-arid desert grassland in
tropical areas and temperate zones, semi-wet grassland (including
grassland in high and cold areas), and some wet and hot coastal
forests.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua today that their evidence was based on the
analysis of plagues that hit China in the past two centuries and
related research achievements by medical experts and geographers
from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Shupeng, an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said the finding was an "important discovery", by which
China can formulate better plague prevention and control
strategies.
</P>
<P>
According to their study, plagues have hit 638 counties in 21

<HEADLINE> "Field Museums" to Preserve Cultures of Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese professor proposed
recently that the authorities should set up "field museums" to
preserve and develop ethnic minority cultures, amid China's drive
to develop its western regions.
</P>
<P>
By setting up "field museums" authorities could preserve ethnic
minority cultural heritage in their original surroundings rather
than setting up museums in big cities.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Jinwen, a professor of China's Central University of
Nationalities, said that "the western development campaign" refers
to both economic and cultural developments.
</P>
<P>
He added that the moves to save the cultural heritage of ethnic
minorities are not only beneficial to ethnic unity, but plays an
important role in maintaining social stability in western China.
</P>
<P>
China's first "field museum" was set up in 1997 in southwest
China's Guizhou Province for the Miao minority. Other museums were
also set up later for the Hezhe people and the Elunchun people in
northeast China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
set up a modern technological system to produce artificial weather
in the western region which has experienced frequent droughts and
other kinds of natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
The artificial weather system, composed of advanced equipment
including aircraft and ground supportive facilities will be used
to increase water for local reservoirs, increase rainfall, and
combat forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The new system will set up provincial and prefectural
artificial weather bureaus, replete with aircraft, radars and
ground monitoring facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments are drafting plans for the new
system which is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists to See Heritage Sites Along Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH) plans to organize journalists from major
news organizations nationwide to see heritage sites along the
ancient "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six journalists from media organizations such as Xinhua
News Agency, the People's Daily and China Central Television, are
scheduled to participate in the expedition to northwest Gansu
Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
During their 5,000-km journey, the reporters will visit
Tianshui, a cradle of the Chinese nation, the world heritage site
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, the two ancient cities of Gaochang and
Jiaohe, and the Kizil Thousand Buddha Grottoes in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The "Silk Road", passing through Tianshui, Lanzhou, Dunhuang,
Turpan and Urumqi, was the most important commercial route linking
prosperous central China with foreign countries in central Asia.
The route is a treasure drove of cultural relics and of China's
heritage, archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) have organized several expeditions with
archaeologists and relics experts along the Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural ceremony, SACH's chief, Zhang Wenbin, said
that the west part of the country is abundant with precious relics
and flourishing cultures.
</P>
<P>
SACH is drafting a plan to preserve heritage sites in China's
western regions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, SACH organized an inspection tour to Hebei, Henan,
Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the administration said that they will send
media groups annually.

<HEADLINE> Minefield Hampers UNIFIL's Further Deployment in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A complete deployment of United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) had to be delayed for
several days by a minefield in south Lebanon, local newspaper An
Nahar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian UNIFIL sappers are clearing the minefield around
the village of Yaroun near the Lebanese border at a rate of 20
meters per hour, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Yaroun mines are removed, the correction of the last
border infraction will be certified and the Lebanese authority will

give the green light for the final stage of the U.N. deployment,"
An Nahar quoted an unnamed U.N. source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only then will Lebanese and UNIFIL officers be able to certify
that Israel has corrected the last Blue Line encroachment in that
district, the source said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Indian, Irish, Finnish and Fijian UNIFIL units have
completed their deployment in six locations in the area abandoned
by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
A plan has been made by the UNIFIL command and the Lebanese
army in meetings held at Lebanon's Defense Ministry on Monday for
extending the deployment into 13 other locations.
</P>
<P>
The next step will be the deployment of a task force of 500
Lebanese army troops and 500 policemen in the 750-square kilometer
liberated zone, who will take charge of security in all towns and
villages in south Lebanon. UNIFIL will focus on patrolling the
immediate vicinity of the borderline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanon is preparing to sue Israel for 40 billion U.
S. dollars at The Hague International Court of Justice. President
Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss are expected to discuss
the issue on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Hoss held a meeting on Monday with an official committee set up
to prepare and document Lebanon's case against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is expected to endorse the decision taken by Lahoud
and Hoss to sue Israel for the losses Lebanon suffered from
Israel's 1978 invasion of south Lebanon and its 1982 invasion of
Beirut.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Open Resident Mission in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved Tuesday the establishment of a Resident Mission in
Mongolia in a bid to boost policy discussions with the Mongolian
government and improve project implementation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the mission, expected to
open in the capital city of Ulan Bator by November, will be
staffed by two expatriate officers and four national officers.
</P>
<P>
"The Resident Mission will promote ADB's primary goal of
poverty reduction and related strategic objectives to achieve long-
term sustainable economic growth," said the release.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia became the first country to sign a poverty partnership
agreement with the ADB in March 2000, which sets specific targets
for reducing poverty within clearly defined time frames.
</P>
<P>
Since Mongolia joined the ADB in 1991, it has received ADB
loans totaling nearly 430 million U.S. dollars, mainly for
programs supporting reforms in the finance, industry, agriculture
and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
The ADB lending to Mongolia in 1999 totaled 50 million dollars.
Annual assistance to the country is expected to be maintained at
around 40 million dollars plus technical assistance, said the ADB.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's petroleum and gas

foreign investors since the formation of the current government in
October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Tuesday by Ministry of Petroleum
and Natural Resources said the investment will be made over the
next three years and includes 532 million dollars in the upstream
sector and 108 million dollars in the downstream sector.
</P>
<P>
This is a reflection of the growing confidence of investors in
the petroleum sector of Pakistan, said the release.
</P>
<P>
According to details, Shell U.K. will be participating in the
equity of Pak Arab Refining Company's (PARCO) White Oil Pipeline
project from Karachi to Multan in southern Sindh province to the
extent of 35 million dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Open to Wholesale Release of Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government negotiators
claimed a breakthrough Tuesday in talks for the release of the
remaining hostages held in Jolo, after the Abu Sayyaf expressed
willingness to release all the captives in one batch.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said the
negotiations, if handled properly, could result in the hostages'
release in two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the report of my emissary, Commander Robot is willing
to negotiate the hostages' wholesale release, which was unlike
before, when he only wanted the release of the hostages in batches,
with the female captives separate from the male ones and from the
French journalists," Aventajado said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
With negotiations at this stage, Aventajado advised Governor
Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao to stop
making irresponsible statements about the situation.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was quoted as saying that the Abu Sayyaf has collected
enough ransom from its freed captives to buy military equipment,
such as missiles.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado reminded Misuari that he had replaced him as chief
government negotiator in May. "It would be better if he kept out
of this. His interference would only muddle up things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also reiterated that the government continues to
remain firm on its no-ransom policy as he stressed that reports of
ransom payments to the Abu Sayyaf did not have, and will never
have, his stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
"There are groups who talk to the Abu Sayyaf on their own. But
as far as the government is concerned, we do not pay ransom to
anyone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 mostly foreign hostages from
Malaysian on April 23 and released seven hostages recently. Aside
from the hostages taken from Malaysia, the group is also holding
more than ten local preachers and three French journalists.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 2 Killed, 23 Injured in Bomb Blast in Indonesian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- At least two persons were killed
and 23 others, including the Philippine Ambassador Leonides Bacay,
injured in a bomb blast here on Tuesday noon.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded at 12:25 p.m. local time (05:25 GMT) in front
of the Philippines Embassy in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The blast damaged a wall of the residence of the Philippine
ambassador and the fence of the Bulgarian Embassy, and shattered
the glass windows of the General Election Committee building.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was felt up to 500 meters from the location and
formed a huge black mushroom-shaped smoke.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta police officers said the bomb blast was suspected
coming from a minibus. The police is still tracking the identity
of the minibus.
</P>
<P>
They considered it was not a terror action. "We are still
investigating this case," Jakarta police chief Inspector General
Nurfaizi said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion just took place as the country's four most
influential politicians -- President Abdurrahman Wahid, Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputri, Speaker of the House of
Representatives Akbar Tandjung and Chairman of the People's
Consultative Assembly Amien Rais-- were holding a meeting in
Yogyakarta, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
Rais told reporters after the meeting that the bomb blast was
part of the effort by certain group to damage the image of
Indonesia in the eye of international community. He urged the
security officer to find the actors of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that the bomb blast was aimed at discrediting the
Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab expressed regret about
the bomb explosion. He said he believed the incident would not
disturb bilateral relations between Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said he suspected certain foreign parties were involved
in the incident but declined to elaborate. The bombing might have
been perpetrated by people who wanted to discredit Indonesia
internationally, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main Muslim separatist group in the Philippines,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), denied that it was
behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency quoted spokesman of the MILF as saying
that the MILF was not involved in the bomb blast in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred amid rising worry about security
situation in the capital ahead the annual session of the Assembly
which is due to be held here on August 7-18.
</P>
<P>
It was the second explosion rocking the Indonesian capital in
less than one month. The first explosion hit the Attorney General'
s Office here on July 4.

<HEADLINE> Duncan Unlikely for Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Tim Duncan has notified NBA
officials that he probably won't play in the Olympics, according
to the San Antonio Express-News today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that members of the U.S. national team
selection committee are still trying to persuade Duncan to
participate in the Sydney Games, but that it appears unlikely he
will change his mind.
</P>
<P>
Duncan, one of the biggest prizes in this year's free-agent
pool, has said he will re-sign with the San Antonio Spurs,
reportedly for three years. The 24-year-old forward led the Spurs
to their only NBA title in 1998-99, but missed last season's
playoffs with an injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
Duncan underwent surgery to repair torn cartilage in the knee
May 24, but did not begin a full rehabilitation regimen until two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Although Duncan has not had any significant setbacks, he would
have little time to rest before next season if he played in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic team begins practice August 25 in Hawaii, and the
gold-medal game is scheduled for October 1, just days before most
NBA teams open training camp. The month-long Olympic schedule also
would require Duncan to be away from his father, who was in
hospital recently.
</P>
<P>
Duncan would be the third player to leave the latest Dream Team
in the past five months. Tom Gugliotta and Grant Hill won't play
because of injuries. They were replaced by Vince Carter and
Shareef Abdur-Rahim.

<HEADLINE> EPO Tests for Sydney Olympics Clear First Hurdle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) medical commission on Tuesday gave their nod to a
joint blood and urine test for the banned performance-enhancing
drug erythropoietin (EPO) for use at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
After spending two days examining research on two tests, a
urine-based method developed by a French laboratory and a blood
sampling control devised in Australia, a 15-member panel of doping
experts and scientists decided at Lausanne that the two methods
were complementary and could be reliably used to detect the drug.
</P>
<P>
Athletes will be subjected to both urine and blood tests, both
of which must come back positive to prompt sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The tests still must receive the stamp of approval from the IOC
's juridical commission, which will review the legal aspects.
Final approval will come at the IOC executive board meeting in
Lausanne August 28-29.

The trade would also send Otis Thorpe, Tim James and Rodney

The key player was Jones, 28, because the Hornets were on the
verge of losing him without compensation. He was considering a
free-agent offer from Chicago but wants to play in South Florida,
where he grew up and has a home.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taliban Accuse Opposition of Launching Fighting in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia Tuesday accused opposition United Front of launching the
recent fighting in the northern province of Baghlan.
</P>
<P>
The radical Islamic militia, which controls over 80 percent
territory of Afghanistan, also dismissed as propaganda the press
reports that Taliban forces have either killed civilians or burnt
houses.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Taliban embassy in Islamabad said that after
the defeat of the offensive launched by the United Front in the
Nahreen district of Baghlan, the opposition has unleashed
propaganda of innocent civilians being killed and houses burned.
</P>
<P>
"This baseless propaganda is merely carried on to falsely
reflect the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as an oppressor and to
overshadow and conceal the fact that the opposition triggered the
conflict itself," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban established its regime based on southern Afghan
city of Kandahar and called the regime as "Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan", which is recognized by three countries including
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The statement said after opposition commander Bashir Baghlani
was arrested by Taliban early last week, the opposition launched
an offensive on Taliban's positions.
</P>
<P>
"They thought that by doing so, men still supporting Bashir
Baghlani will join them. However it was a miscalculation on their
part," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It further said the offensive was just a retreat for the
opposition and on a counter offensive by Taliban, the frontlines
were broken and consequently they lost Nahreen.
</P>
<P>
By capturing Nahreen and neighboring Borka last week, Taliban
have managed to slash a major supply line from Tajikistan to
opposition positions north of Afghan capital of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Currently both the factions are building up forces and
preparing for more fighting in Baghlan and neighboring Takhar
province, latest news from Kabul said.

effort before Nikki Hudson made it two on 23 minutes.

got going with goals from Tang Chunling on 52 minutes and Shen
Lihong two minutes later.

the pace and put the game beyond doubt when Renita Garard chipped
in with a 64th minute field goal.

Alyson Annan completed the scoring with a penalty corner on 70
minutes.

FUZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A 700-ha zone was opened today for
South China tigers in the Meihua Mountains in southeast China's
Fujian Province as part of a national effort to protect the rare
tiger species from extinction.
</P>
<P>
The Meihua South China Tiger Zone, believed to be a natural
habitat for the most endangered tiger species, is located in the
State-level Meihua Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
A 1990 survey conducted by China's State Forestry
Administration and the World Wildlife Fund showed the existence of
wild South China tigers in the mountain area.
</P>
<P>
A local official said China aims to turn the zone into a South
China tiger nature reserve in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The zone has already introduced six South China tigers from
other places and plans to release them to the wild soon.
</P>
<P>
Chinese zoologists estimated that there are some 20 to 30 South
China Tigers in the wild. Another 53 are in captivity around the

<HEADLINE> China's Summer Grain Output Drops 11 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's summer grain output has
decreased 9.3 percent over the same period last year to 107.5
million tons, according to a report released today by the China
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
The report said that only six out of the 26 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities nationwide that grow summer
crops saw a rise in outputs, while the rest saw their outputs drop.
</P>
<P>
The summer grain output in East China's Jiangsu Province
decreased by 2.96 million tons, while the output in Shandong,
Anhui, Hebei, Hubei and Henan provinces reduced by 2.58 million
tons, 1.58 million tons, 750,000 tons, 700,000 tons, 500,000 tons,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the drop in output mainly to the
reduction of summer grain acreage and severe drought that hit most
parts of the country since spring.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the country's summer grain acreage was
cut by 5.1 percent over the same period last year to 29.52 million
hectares, resulting in a drop of 5.94 million tons of summer grain,
accounting for 54 percent of the total summer grain reduction.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers reduced their summer grain acreage because the
central government has abandoned protective purchase price for
poor quality grain. Grain market price has been low as a result of
the country's grain harvests.
</P>
<P>
The drought is the most severe one since 1990. In Hebei, north
China, 1.2 million hectares of farmland was hit by drought and 50,
000 ha of crops were completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
However, China's oil-bearing crops output this year saw a 10.9
percent rise to 10.59 million tons due to further expansion of
acreage. Statistics show that the acreage of summer oil-bearing
crops totaled 6.87 million hectares, up 6.5 percent over the year-
ago period.

<HEADLINE> Defeated Peres Calls for Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Following a humiliating defeat
in the presidential election in the parliament Monday, Israeli
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres called for early
elections on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The appeal echoed other top Labor party officials, such as
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat and Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh, who said earlier that if the ruling party cannot pass
something like Peres for the presidency, it will not be able to
pass other things.
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old former prime minister, a leading Israeli dove
concerning the Israeli-Arab peace process and a Nobel Peace
Laureate for his peace efforts, was dealt with a severe blow in the
Knesset (Parliament) Monday afternoon when he was defeated by
unknown Likud candidate Moshe Katsav in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Peres said he was
disappointed at the loss, however, he could not blame anyone for
that. He said he would rather forget the past and look forward to
the future.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that before the secret ballot, he had "guaranteed"
65 votes from the 120 legislators, excluding the 17-member Shas
party. However, the voting result turned out to be a Katsav
majority of 63-57. Peres said he still does not understand what
happened behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
However, the defeat was not his major reason for calling for
dissolving the Knesset, he implied. The coming three months will
determine the fate of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and an
agreement should be reached with the Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
To his surprise, Peres said, Prime Minister Ehud Barak displayed
a great willingness to push forward the peace process in the summit
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David last
month.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Barak should show the same courage to dissolve the Knesset
because the current parliament lacks majority for an Israeli-
Palestinian accord.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Peres withdrew his cabinet resignation letter
to Barak, which was tendered on Sunday to meet legal requirements
to compete for presidency. Thus he has regained his Regional
Cooperation portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Several Labor party officials has suggested to appoint Peres
foreign minister if incumbent David Levy makes good of his threats
to leave the government because of the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the possibility, Peres said Tuesday he now has no
interest in being foreign minister, the role he played in Yitzhak
Rabin's cabinet from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Peres said he will go on vacation Tuesday afternoon, so he can
not attend the presidential inauguration ceremony due to take place
at the Knesset Tuesday night. Nevertheless, he congratulated Katsav
on his stunning victory.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Decision on Partial Privatization of Bangladesh Airlines  Finalized  by Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Bangladesh Monday
finalized its decision on partial privatization of the national
carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines, ignoring ongoing protests by
its employees.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Monday night, the Biman Board of Directors gave
the final nod to its earlier plan to convert Biman Bangladesh
Airlines into a public limited company (PLC).
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, forty per cent of the Biman shares will
be offloaded to a strategic partner which is not a business rival
of Biman. Nine per cent of the stakes will go to the Biman staff
while the government is meant to hold the remaining 51 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The plan further said that no South Asian airlines would be
allowed to purchase the stakes, as they are considered as Biman's
competitors. Airlines of the countries having no diplomatic ties
with Bangladesh will also be barred from bidding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the steering committee of the five trade unions of
Biman continued their protests against the government's plan to
turn the national airliner into a PLC. they staged a sit-in
demonstration in front of the Biman headquarters in the capital
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, the committee leaders claimed that
they will not allow the planned conversion of Biman into a PLC
under any circumstances. They also asked the government to
withdraw its "conspiratorial decision".
</P>
<P>
As part of their week-long agitation program, the steering
committee Monday handed over a memorandum to the managing director
of Biman in protest against the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The Biman has been losing considerably over the last few years
and its market share has been steadily dwindling mostly because of
poor management and high competition from foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
As per recent reports, the Biman has been losing more than 20
million U.S. dollars each year on average for the period 1991-92
to 1998-99. It has lost it's market share of passengers by 15 per
cent from a high of 57.08 per cent in 1991-92 to 41.69 per cent in
1998-99 to foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
In the area of cargo handling, it's market share has dwindled
by nearly 28 per cent from a peak of 60.45 per cent in 1991-92 to
36.33 per cent in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the Biman's handling of cargo is reportedly
causing a substantial export loss. The exporters have been
complaining that because of untimely and late delivery, they
failed to get fair price.
</P>
<P>
The reports on Biman also show that because of poor service
performance and scheduling, more Bangladeshi passengers are now
flying by foreign carriers. Out of a total number of passengers of
1,993,155 in 1998-99, the Biman carried only 830,947, or 41.69 per
cent while the bulk of the passengers totaling 1,127,000 or 58.31
per cent were carried by foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
As Biman failed to carry the majority shares of the business,
Bangladesh has reportedly lost an expected income of one billion
dollars in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Experts here pointed out that unless the management of Biman is
improved and basically restructured, this divestment of shares is
not likely to improve the performance or profitability of Biman.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Accuses Tamil Rebels of Using Civilians as Human Shields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on
Tuesday accused the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) rebels of relocating and using civilians as human shields in
rebel-controlled northern regions against air strikes by
government troops.
</P>
<P>
"LTTE has begun to move a large number of civilians from their
villages to relocate them around LTTE camps in Mullaitivu,
Kilinochchi, Pooneryn and Elephant Pass in a bid to use them as
human shields against air interdictions," said a statement issued
by the government's Special Media Information Center.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the LTTE's strategy also aims to tarnish the
image of government troops and gain international sympathy. It
said the relocation has caused severe hardships among the
civilians who are being exposed to government troops attacks.
</P>
<P>
The rebels' new move comes as Sri Lanka is taking delivery of
more jets and helicopter gunships to boost its battle against LTTE
rebels who are fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said the air force has pressed into service
four new Ukrainian MiG-27 aircraft that were being deployed on
bombing missions to blunt a recent rebel advance in the northern
Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
They said the air force has yet to take delivery of a fleet of
Israeli-built Kfir fighter jets that were ordered in May when the
military went on massive arms shopping spree after losing several
key army camps to rebels.
</P>
<P>
Government troops are also banking on an additional nine Mi-24
helicopter gunships to give greater air support in a future
offensive. Two Mi-24 helicopter gunships are expected shortly
while another seven are on order.
</P>
<P>
After ferocious fighting in April and May in the Jaffna
peninsula, a lull in the fighting ensued but analysts see it as
simply the calm before the storm. Government troops and LTTE
rebels have cashed in on the lull to prepare for war and a
showdown is on the cards.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has launched a massive recruit drive and the latest
batch of recruits believed to number over 1,000 are expected to be
battle-ready by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The government statement said the LTTE rebels are using
civilians as pawns in their fight. Civilians including women,
elderly and children as young as seven years are forced to take up
weapons and undergo military trainings.
</P>
<P>
"School grounds have been turned into combat training camps
apart from the thick jungles where training usually takes place,"
said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Manila Condemns Bomb Attack in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government strongly
condemned Tuesday the bomb attack on the official residence of the
Philippine Ambassador to Jakarta that reportedly killed three and
injured several others, including Ambassador Leonides Caday.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore in the strongest possible terms this apparent
terrorist bombing at the residence of our ambassador in Jakarta,"
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that while the perpetrators have yet to be
identified, the Philippine government is confident Indonesian
authorities are going to get to the bottom of this deplorable
incident.
</P>
<P>
"The gruesome attack can only be described as dastardly and
cowardly. Its perpetrators deserve the severest condemnation of
the entire global community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora, who is chairman of the Office of the President's
Executive Committee, the government caretaker while Philippine
President Joseph Estrada is on an official visit to the United
States said he hoped the terrorist attack is not in any way
connected with the current problem in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the president, who is now winding up his U.S. visit,
has been informed of the incident and has expressed shock and
regret over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Latest report from Jakarta through the Philippine Department of
Foreign Affairs (DFA), said Caday, a career diplomat and a former
DFA undersecretary, is now in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
Caday, along with his Indonesian driver, suffered multiple
injuries from the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the envoy's car was about to enter the residence
at Jalan Imam Bonjol in Central Jakarta at around 12:29 p.m. (5:29
GMT) when the explosion occurred.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia and opposition alliance forces are preparing for more
fighting in northern provinces of Takhar and Baghlan, the Afghan
Islamic Press (AIP) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based agency said Taliban were building up forces
to take the town of Ishkamish in Takhar while forces loyal to
chief opposition commander Ahmed Shah Masood were preparing to
retake the Nahreen district of Baghlan which fell to Taliban last
week.
</P>
<P>
Masood has brought thousands of soldiers to the area from his
strongholds of Panjsher valley and Andarab of Baghlan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which control over 80 percent territory of
Afghanistan, have moved 500 soldiers from Mazar-e-Sharif to Kunduz
province also, AIP said.
</P>
<P>
In probing attacks late Monday, Taliban managed to capture
three rival military posts in the Ishkamish area.
</P>
<P>
Masood forces have fortified defensive positions in Ishkamish
after Taliban cut off a major supply route connecting Tajikistan
with opposition frontlines north of Kabul last week.

<HEADLINE> Air France's Concorde Planes to Remain On The Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- All of Air France's five remaining
Concorde supersonic jet planes will remain grounded until a new
order is given, after experts meeting on Monday in Paris failed to
explain the disastrous crash of the Concorde this past Tuesday or
make any new proposals on security measures.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the General Direction of Civil Aviation under
the French Ministry of Transport said Tuesday that primary
proposals on safety measures will be given by experts to the
Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The minister will then make a decision on a possible resumption
of Concorde flights.
</P>
<P>
Air France suspended all Concorde flights after one of its
planes crashed last Tuesday in Paris, killing 114 people, 96 of
them German tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Accident Investigation, which is in charge of
investigating the crash, is now trying to establish a probable
scenario of the accidents by linking known elements, including the
explosion of one or two tires, an intensive fire, the breakdown of
an engine, and problems with the undercarriage.
</P>
<P>
Experts from France and Britain held a meeting on Monday until
late in the night on extra security measures for the Concorde, but
the meeting ended without issuing any declarations.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Lifting of Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that the economic sanctions against Iraq
imposed 10 years ago should be lifted and the U.S.-British should
stop bombing the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic daily Al-Hayat published in
London, Vedrine said that the continuation of the bombings against
Iraq is "useless and not understandable," and that the sanctions
against Iraq have become "cruel, inefficient and dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"Cruel because they punish exclusively the Iraqi population and
the weakest of them. Inefficient because they don't touch the
regime which is not pushed to cooperate. Dangerous because they
nourish the resentment of "the embargo generation," this
generation of the young people who only know war and hardship," he
said.
</P>
<P>
These sanctions also risk to destroy the social cohesion of
Iraq and in the mid-term threaten the stability of the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The necessary regional security should be ensured by other
means than embargo," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is counting on the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1284 to have U.N. arms control re-established
and sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted in December 1999 to renew the
cooperation between the U.N. and Iraq over arms inspection while
promising to suspend the sanctions in case Iraq cooperates.

<HEADLINE> Princess Anne Calls for Removal of Team Sports from Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Princess Anne, president
of the British Olympic Association, has called for team games to
be removed from the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Princess told a news conference Monday: "There are too many
team games. I don't think they should be part of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's a distortion in terms of numbers. If you are trying to
rationalize the Games for the future you should cut out team games.
"
</P>
<P>
She added: "Other people would say 'don't be ridiculous, no-one
would watch it if there were no team games'. But there is a
concept that if you're not winning at football or cricket then the
rest of sport is a waste of space. We always have this problem."

<HEADLINE> Shirvington Says American Sprinters Are "Soft" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The American sprint team for the
Sydney Olympics is "soft", said Australian 100 meters record
holder Matt Shirvington.
</P>
<P>
"Usually the US sends three men to the Olympics who
consistently run under 10 seconds but this time two of the three --
Jon Drummond and Curtis Johnson -- rarely break that barrier," he
said in a column for Sydney's Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
"The American sprint team coming to Sydney is soft. With the
Americans below their best, the field is wide open."
</P>
<P>
Shirvington said he felt more optimistic about his chances at
the Games after watching the US Olympic trials, but acknowledged
Maurice Greene was virtually untouchable.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to line up against him and think 'I'm going to beat
that man' but if I can run fast in the next few weeks that will be
exactly what I'll be thinking at the Games."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Transport, Communications and Civil
Aviation Ibrahim Mohamed El-Demiri said the decision on issuing new
licenses for the establishment of private sector airline companies
has been put off. It will be made until an assessment of the
current status of the already existing airline companies is
finished. He said the private sector companies working in the field
of aviation will undertake maintenance works at EgyptAir hungers
instead of neighboring harbours.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt and Switzerland signed documents Monday under which the
Egyptian-Swiss Development Fund will provide Egypt with 15 million
Egyptian pounds (4.29 million U.S. dollars) to finance five
economic and social development projects. The projects deal with
education, women, jobs and environment in various Egyptian
governorates.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Sameh Samir Fahmi said Egypt

investments in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Monday stressed the

Walker in the coastal town of Alexandria.

<HEADLINE> Shas Still Wants To Join Coalition: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Shas party will not
object to discussing a new coalition government with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak if asked for, said a Shas spokesman here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If Barak invites Shas to discuss the formation of a new
government, Shas will go out of good manners, Yair Peretz told
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Shas spokesman also said Shas is also interested
in new elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the presidential elections on Monday, Barak said he
intends to begin consultations in the coming days for the formation
of a new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Barak have said that the chances of the new
government including Shas are slim in view of the recent political
developments in the country and the results of the failed Camp
David summit.
</P>
<P>
The Monday presidential elections were the frontpaged stories of
all Israeli newspapers on Tuesday with some reports saying Shas "
has played an important role" in the election of the Likud's
candidate Moshe Katsav as the new president of the state.
</P>
<P>
Labor's candidate Shimon Peres, a former prime minister and
Nobel Peace Prize laureate, lost the election to Katsav with a vote
of 57 to 63 in the 120-member Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Peres's loss to Katsav was seen as a defeat of the government to
the opposition. Analysts said Peres was the victim of a fatal
situation in the Knesset that is hostile to Barak.
</P>
<P>
Top-level Labor party officials are calling on Barak to consider
new elections instead of forming a new coalition. They said that
following Peres's loss in the presidential election, the current
situation can not continue.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is such that if we cannot pass something like
Shimon Peres for the presidency, we will not be able to pass other
things, and if we cannot pass other things, we will have to ask for
a majority from the people," Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
told Barak following the presidential elections on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat on Monday also told Barak to
consider elections.
</P>
<P>
Shochat said he does not see how he will be able to advance work
on the 2001 state budget bill.
</P>
<P>
But Barak's office issued a statement Monday night, saying Barak
is not preparing for new elections.
</P>
<P>
"The rumors of an intention to bring forward new elections have
no basis, and at the beginning of the next week the prime minister
will start dealing with putting together a government through
contacts with various elements," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Barak himself continued to insist he intends to move ahead
toward reaching a permanent-status agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Amid the flurry of political activities at the Knesset on
Monday, U.S. ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk met with Barak and
Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami to examine future steps
between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Invited to Invest in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia invites more
Malaysian investors to explore the wide-ranging business
opportunities in the country, Cambodia's Ambassador to Malaysia
Keo Puth Reasmey said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said "now we are a member of ASEAN we need to really look at
the productivity side," adding that Cabodia hopes Malaysia will "
help us to be more competitive."
</P>
<P>
One of the sectors earmarked for foreign participation is the
tourism and hospitality industry, the ambassador told reporters
after the opening of a seminar entitled "Doing Business in
Cambodia".
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments would help spur Cambodia's economic growth
and provide jobs to its people, Reasmey said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Malaysian investors to transfer their
expertise to Cambodia and to go into joint ventures with Cambodian
companies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76 Malaysian companies have so far invested in
Cambodia in the areas of infrastructure development, power
generation, tourism, property development, banking, education and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, which joined the ASEAN as its 10th member in April
last year, could provide Malaysia with raw materials and primary
commodities needed for its industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia currently imports natural rubber, timber, apparels and
rice from Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between two countries is still minimal with
Malaysia's exports to Cambodia in 1999 totaling 144.92 million
ringgit (38.13 million U.S. dollars) and its imports amounting to
40.63 million ringgit (10.69 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> German Business's Asia-Pacific Convention to Be Held in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth Asia Pacific
Convention and Exhibition of German Business will be held in
Malaysia next month, Malaysian-German Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (MGCC) President Muhd Feisol Hassan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 businessmen of the "Who's Who" in the German industry
would be attending the three-day convention which begins from
September 18 to discuss business prospects in the Asia Pacific
region, he said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The convention would discuss issues concerning the Asian region
that would be of crucial interest to German organizations of
various industries doing business here, he said.
</P>
<P>
The convention has been held biannually since 1986 in selected
Asian key partner countries like China, Japan, Indonesia,
Australia, South Korea and India, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Every two years, the top executives of major German companies
would come to this region and re-define their investments
strategies for the years to come including identifying the best
countries and areas to invest," he said.
</P>
<P>
With so many major German companies present in this country, he
said the MGCC has arranged several matchmaking sessions to bring
together both the Malaysian and German companies, focusing on
technology transfer, trade business, joint venture, venture
capital and direct investment.
</P>
<P>
There are over 300 German companies already in business in
Malaysia with interests in the areas of telecommunications,
engineering, petrochemical, manufacturing and the electronics
industries, with a total investment of over 6 billion ringgit (1.
57 billion U.S. dollars) so far.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's First-elected Senate Meets for the First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The first-elected Thai Senate, or
upper house of the parliament, officially convened for the first
time on Tuesday, after its 200 seats were completely filled late
last month.
</P>
<P>
Starting at around 1000 AM local time, the newly-completed
Senate elected Sanit Vorapanya, a senator from Lopburi province,
as the President of Thailand's first-ever elected Senate, with 115
votes of support.
</P>
<P>
The role of the senatorial president include ensuring smooth
proceedings in Senate meetings, coordinating with related agencies,
such as the House of Representative (lower parliamentary house),
and receiving complaints from voters who seek to oust political
officials.
</P>
<P>
He is also authorized to confirm royal commands for
appointments to constitutional bodies, such as the Constitution
Court and Election Commission and to give a casting vote on
deciding if a Senate vote should be tied.
</P>
<P>
The country organized its first senatorial election on March 4,
which was part of a political reform, aimed to eliminate vote
buying and other irregular practices, and create free and fair
elections eventually.
</P>
<P>
The March 4 poll was, however, followed by four senatorial by-
elections in some provinces due to suspension of elected
candidates for found evidences of frauds and forms of vote buying.
</P>
<P>
The 200-seat Senate was completed in late July, after the last
elected candidate in the northeastern province of Ubon Rachathani
was unanimously endorsed by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Constitutional Court ruled that an incomplete
Senate could not be convened or official start its duties, which
include monitoring and inspecting performances and ethics of
elected politicians, and depriving them if any suspected case or
allegation of corruptive practices was verified.

MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Three persons were killed when a
bomb exploded in a carnival fair in Monkayo, Compostela Valley
province in the southern Philippines Monday evening, the official

Police said the bomb could be a home-made one or one kind of a
hand grenade. It was lobbed at the back of a health center near
the municipal building premises.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Tuesday, led mainly by high-priced information and technology

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
While recent declines made Tokyo share prices weak enough to
lead investors to buy, Monday's sharp rise in the Nasdaq boosted
overall share prices higher in Tokyo on Tuesday, among which were
information and technology issues. The nonferrous metal, air
transportation and real estate sectors marked sharp gains too,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Food makers, particularly beer brewers, also drew buying amid

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Group Asks Japanese PM Not to Visit Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese Buddhist group on
Tuesday urged Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori not to make an
official visit to Yasukuni Shrine, a leading Shinto shrine
dedicated to Japan's war dead, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan Buddhist Federation, a group comprising 103 Buddhist
organizations across Japan, said the shrine is a purely religious
facility that pays homage to those who died in various wars.
</P>
<P>
"An official visit to the shrine by the prime minister and
other official figures violates 'freedom of religion' and 'the
separation of religion and politics' as stipulated by the
Constitution," the group said.
</P>
<P>
The shrine, which is located in central Tokyo, was a bastion of
government-sponsored Shintoism and a symbol of Japanese militarism
before and during World War II. It enshrines some 2.4 million
Japanese military personnel and officials who died in wars after
1853.
</P>
<P>
The shrine is particularly controversial because seven Japanese
class-A war criminals hanged after the end of World War II are
among those enshrined.
</P>
<P>
Visits to the shrine by the former Japanese prime ministers and
other government ministers have drawn criticism from Japan's
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Distilled Liquor Dating Back 800 Years: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- New findings have shown that the
Chinese developed the technique of distilling liquor in the 12th
century.
</P>
<P>
The findings overthrew the previous conclusion that the
technique was introduced from Arabian countries in the 13th
century.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists recently unearthed a bronze distillation device
in central China's Hubei province, which is believed to be the
earliest vessels for liquor distillation found in China.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists experimented with the device and found that
the vessels can be used to make liquor from rice. When raw rice is
boiled in the pot, an evaporated alcoholic liquid will rise to the
dome, where it cools, condenses and flows into a grooved vessel.
</P>
<P>
The technique, a breakthrough in alcoholic beverage production,
was possibly developed by Taoist practitioners who made use of
distillation to prepare medicine, according to Feng Changhai, a
historian in Harbin of Heilongjiang Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Welfare lottery is playing an
increasingly bigger role in China since it appeared 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, a total of 39.52 billion yuan worth of
lottery tickets had sold since welfare lottery was introduced into
the country on July 28, 1987.
</P>
<P>
Over 11.87 billion yuan of social welfare funds had been
collected as a result. Out of which, 1.5 billion yuan had been
turned to the state as a special disaster relief fund and eight
billion yuan been spent on welfare works.
</P>
<P>
Welfare lottery has provided impetus to China's welfare
development.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that
from 1987 to 1997, governments at all levels invested 1.41 billion
yuan into urban welfare facilities, while welfare lotteries
provided to it 4.1 billion yuan during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Welfare lottery has been a major factor that prevented the
country's public welfare from falling far behind the fast economic
development, said an official with the China Welfare Lottery
Center.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to money collected from welfare lottery, over 81,000
welfare projects, including special education for mentally-
retarded children, have been established across the country. (

At present, the Ministry of Civil Affairs collects 2.5 percent
of the lottery sales for a special social welfare fund, which has
financed the rebuilding of 103 children welfare institutions and
treated some 2,000 disabled children.
</P>
<P>
Welfare lottery has indirectly pushed forward China's economic
development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, welfare lottery has expanded to cover 95 percent
of the country, employing over 74,750 people.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of welfare lottery also showed that the country
's lucky winners will not hesitate to spend their windfalls from
welfare lottery.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of the respondents said they would spend
the money right away to buy houses or cars, according to the
survey by the China Welfare Lottery Center.
</P>
<P>
Some economists were much encouraged by the results of the
survey, noting that lottery will be a boost to the country's
domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that nearly four billion yuan will be spent on
domestic consumption if 10 billion yuan worth of welfare lotteries
are sold each year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Seeks Extradition of Drug Suspect from Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Cyprus is
seeking the extradition of a young female national being held in an
Egyptian prison for being accused of trying to smuggle drugs, local
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maria Antoniadou, a 19-year-old woman from Nicosia, had been
found carrying 3.5 kilograms of "bango," a cheap and low-grade
variety of marijuana popular in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested by Egyptian police on her way back to a Cyprus
cruise ship late last Tuesday. Police said they found the drugs
concealed in a secret compartment in her suitcase.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Foreign Ministry Director Michalis Attalides Monday met
with Egypt's Ambassador to Cyprus Mar Mohammed Med Wali, and
submitted a written suggestion for Antoniadou to be extradited to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Wali, however, did not comment on the possibility of
Antoniadou's return to stand trial in Cyprus, saying it is being
handled by the Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
"I think the case is serious because it is related to drug
smuggling. It has affected national security for both Egypt and
Cyprus, especially for Cyprus because the drugs were coming to
Cyprus from Egypt," Wali said.
</P>
<P>
Security officials in Port Said of Egypt said that Antoniadou
could face the death penalty if convicted in Egypt and that the
woman had been under surveillance for some time "on suspicion of
smuggling illegal substances."
</P>
<P>
A suspected accomplice named by Antoniadou as Petros Koromias
was arrested Sunday in Cyprus' southern coastal Limassol town.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Defying expectations, Likud Knesset (Parliament) Member Moshe
Katsav was elected Israel's eighth president by the parliament
Monday, defeating Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres by a
vote of 63 to 57 in a second ballot.
</P>
<P>
Katsav, the first president who was not nominated by the Labor
party, will be sworn in Tuesday evening for one seven-year term at
a festive ceremony at the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
"This victory is first and foremost an expression of the will of
the nation to unify and heal Israeli society," Katsav said. "The
MKs were aware of Peres' international stature, but it seems they
wanted a different style."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The real target of the presidential vote was not Shimon
Peres, although he was the one to pay the price, sources in the
hardline Likud party and the ruling One Israel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Peres was the victim of a fatal socio-political situation in a
Knesset or parliament that is hostile to Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, said the sources. Indeed, the Knesset showed Barak that
as far as it is concerned, he is impotent.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the prime minister admitted Monday that if
Barak reaches an agreement with the Palestinians during the recess
period, he will take the country to elections, since it is clear to
him that the Knesset will not pass the referendum law he desires
for.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Republican delegates opened their four-day national
convention in Philadelphia Monday for officially choosing Texas
Governor George W. Bush as Republican presidential candidate. The
convention approved the Republican Party's 2000 platform Monday.
</P>
<P>
The political program contained few surprises on the Middle
East, calling on the U.S. to ensure that Israel maintains a
qualitative edge in defense technology and promising that the next
Republican president will officially recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital by immediately beginning the process of moving the
U.S. Embassy there upon taking office.
</P>
<P>
On peace negotiations, the platform said America could "use its
prestige to encourage discussions and negotiations, but peace must
be negotiated between the parties themselves."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government survived no-
confidence motions Monday, the last before the Knesset (Parliament)
goes to a three-month recess Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak indicated Monday that his government is in need
of urgent help, calling on MKs to rise above politics and be united
behind him.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Likud party Monday for foiling attempts to
establish a national unity government that could lead the country
to peace and a secure future.

<HEADLINE> China to Extinguish Biggest Coal Mine Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to put out the
country's biggest coal mine fire in its northwest Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in four years.
</P>
<P>
The blaze has been continuing for dozens of years at
Liuhuanggou, 40 kilometers away from this capital of Xinjiang. It
emits hundreds of tons of harmful gas and materials into the air
every day, seriously polluting the city and the nearby rivers and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
Coal fire is a natural phenomenon of geological changes that
raised the buried coal layer above the ground. The coal layer can
automatically burn when there is a suitable condition in the open
air.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigades will drill wells and infuse water into them to
extinguish the fire, which has already burned out 42 million tons
of coal over the past years, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The job will cost 98 million yuan (11 million U.S. dollars),
and 725 million tons of coal are expected to be saved if the
campaign succeeds.

<P>
CHONGQING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
unearthed 2,000 rare relics during an emergency campaign to save
relics in the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
Shao Weidong, a local relics protection official, said that
archeologists from 15 provinces have excavated 61 key sites and
investigated a two-million-sq-m area since the massive rescue
started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The world's biggest dam will be erected in the Three Gorges on
the Yangtze River in 2008, and floods are expected to damage all
the historical sites and buried relics in the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that all the important relics will be unearthed and
evacuated before the floods come.
</P>
<P>
Findings have shown that the Three Gorges is a treasury of
buried relics, with the oldest Neolithic site being dated back to
8,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have even unearthed some tools in Wushan in the
Three Gorges, which are believed to be used by primitive human
beings two million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The area is especially famous for its Three Kingdoms sites in
the 3th century, when warlords fought decisive battles for the
power to rule China.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that at least 87 historical sites, including temples,
grottos and pavilions, will be relocated.
</P>
<P>
A number of cities and counties in the Three Gorges have
employed specialists to battle against relics smuggling and tomb
robbery, he added.

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's sheep numbers at
July 1, 2000 declined by 0.8 percent to 45.3 million from the
level of the previous July, according to a survey by New Zealand's
Meat and Wool Economic Service to estimate the livestock numbers
on hand at the start of the 2000-2001 farming year.
</P>
<P>
However, its beef cattle numbers lifted by 0.8 percent to 4.68
million, said the survey, which was released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, sheep numbers are now at their lowest level since
July 1, 1957," Brian Speirs, chief economist for the Meat and Wool
Economic Service said in the survey.
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, beef cattle numbers are now at their highest
since 1997 when beef numbers fell sharply due to drought and low
prices,"he added.
</P>
<P>
At July 1, 2000, breeding ewe numbers were up 1.7 percent on
the previous year. Numbers increased in all regions except
Marlborough-Canterbury on South Island, where sheep were probably
displaced by a large increase in beef cattle.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook for the lamb crop in the spring of 2000 is good.
Pastoral conditions have been favorable in most regions during the
1999-2000 season, putting sheep in good condition and leading to
expectations of a good lambing percentage," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Beef cattle numbers on North Island were static, while numbers
on South Island increased.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans to Regulate on Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to work
out the country's first local regulations on museums soon,
according to today's Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's
Congress has discussed a regulation draft for local museums, which
details the registration and cancellation of museums, collection
and disposition of their exhibits.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing leads other cities in the number of museums,
it lacks high-quality ones, Mei Ninghua, director of the Municipal
Cultural Relics Administration, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some local museums are poorly equipped and cannot
well protect its collections, while some others do not appeal to
visitors at all.
</P>
<P>
Mei believed that the legislation will help strengthen the
museum management and bring the exhibits into full play.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now boasts 2.26 million articles on show in 112 museums.

BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Information Minister
Goran Matic said Monday that the state security forces have
arrested four terrorists who were instructed to assassinate
President Slobodan Milosevic by the United States and NATO.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Belgrade Monday, Matic said that the
terrorist group had admitted that they had been instructed to
assassinate Milosevic or commit terrorist activities on Yugoslav
territory.
</P>
<P>
The reporters were shown all the documents and weapons found
with the four terrorists and a video confession. Matic denounced
the United States and NATO for plotting terrorist activities in
Yugoslavia and their attempt to overthrow the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
All the four terrorists are Dutchmen, one of the four is a
professional soldier. They had been well trained by the British
SAS and then organized for subversive operations and
assassinations, Matic said.
</P>
<P>
Matic went on to say, "Yugoslavia has an organized system of
security, which is capable of providing adequate protection to the
people, the state and the political system of the country."
</P>
<P>
"No hired guns, military adventurers, special troops or groups
will ever penetrate our system of security and protection," he

<HEADLINE> Perkins May Continue to Swim After Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Dual Olympic gold medallist Kieren
Perkins says he might continue to swim after the Sydney Olympics
with the Commonwealth Games in Manchester a possibility.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500m Olympic champion was widely expected to end his
career after Sydney Olympics, but 27-year-old Perkins aimed at the
next Commonwealth Games in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Perkins won the 1,500m at Barcelona and memorably at Atlanta,
after which he had planned to retire, and is likely to become the
first male swimmer who wins three consecutive Olympic gold medals
in the same event.
</P>
<P>
He still holds the world record of 14:41.66 he set at the 1994
Victoria Commonwealth Games, although that could fall to rival
Australian Grant Hackett in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Perkins rates Hackett favorite to win the event but is also
wary of little-known Ukrainian Igor Chervynskiy.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Chervynskiy upset world champion silver
medallist Emiliano Brembilla of Italy to win the 1,500m at the
recent European Championships in Helsinki in the third fastest
time of the year, after Hackett and Perkins.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Dominique Van Roost of Belgium
turned out as giant killer as she out played Japan's Ai Sugiyama
in Monday's first round of the Acura Classic tournament in
Carlsbad of California.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost, who has two wins over No. 2-ranked Lindsay Davenport
this season, opened with a 6-2, 7-6 (4) victory over Sugiyama.
</P>
<P>
The win put Van Roost into the second round, where she faces
top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland on Tuesday. Hingis, along
with the other seeded players, did not play Monday.
</P>
<P>
Van Roost, ranked 15th in the world, is still battling through
the loss of her mother, who died of cancer in March. Despite the
wins over Davenport, including a first-round victory at the French
Open, Van Roost admits it's been hard focusing on tennis.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati, a two-time champion in this event, blew a
first-set lead, then was steamrolled by Elena Likhovtseva of
Russia 6-4, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Capriati led 4-3 and was up 40-0 on her service
in the eighth game before Likhovtseva took over the match.
Likhovtseva won the second set in just 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Capriati said: "She played well the whole match. The first set
was close. I felt I was pretty much in control. Then I lost it. I
kind of had a letdown after that and that boosted her confidence."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Grants Payment of Interim Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
allocated 4.3 billion rupees (54.8 million U.S. dollars) for the
payment of an interim allowance to public sector employees,
government pensioners and social beneficiaries to be effective
from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary to the Treasury P.B. Jayasundera was quoted by the
official Daily News as saying that the cabinet approval had
already been granted for the allocation of 2,160 million rupees (
27.5 million dollars) to public sector employees, 1,695 million
rupees (21.6 million dollars) social beneficiaries and 450 million
rupees (5.7 million dollars) to 300,000 government pensioners.
</P>
<P>
He said persons who receive a daily wage will be granted an
allowance of 28.57 rupees per day for a maximum of 21 days per
month.
</P>
<P>
The granting of interim allowance is in response to public
grievances over rising cost of living resulted from the recent
depreciation of the country's currency rupee and price hikes in
electricity, gas, diesel and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Jayasundera added that further to this interim allowance, the
government would also consider the payment of additional
allowances in accordance with the recommendations of the
Presidential Commission for Salaries and Wages for the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
The government's move is viewed as a vote-gathering strategy to
boost the ruling party's popularity as President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has said the 11th parliamentary elections will be held
during the first week of November after the current parliament is
dissolved on August 24.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Price Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC basket oil price has
experienced a four-week drop, with the price of the so-called OPEC
basket of seven different crudes falling down to 25.6 U.S. dollars
per barrel last week from 27.85 dollars the previous week, OPEC
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price is already very close to the OPEC reference price of
25 dollars per barrel, said the Vienna-based OPEC secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The oil price on the international market began to go down at
the beginning of this month after Saudi Arabia, the world's top
oil producer and exporter, declared an immediate increase in its
daily oil output. Compared with the first week of this month, the
OPEC price dropped by 3.89 dollars. OPEC announced in March and
June its decisions to raise its oil output in a bid to curb the
exorbitant oil price, which however gained little effect.
</P>
<P>
The sustaining plunge has aroused concerns among some OPEC
members. OPEC President Ali Rodriguez over the weekend warned of a
crash in oil prices this winter due to oversupplying.
</P>
<P>
"If it is found to be true, we would be returning to the events
of 1998 and 1999," he said, referring to the price slump those
years. The OPEC price once dived below the level of 10 dollars
then.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Supports EC Proposal on WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
thrown its support behind the European Commission's proposal to re
launch a new round of talks for global trade liberalization in the
World Trade Organization framework this year, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the new round of trade talks must have a specific
agenda that will benefit the country (Indonesia), the Jakarta Post
daily Tuesday quoted Minister of Industry and Trade Luhut
Pandjaitan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we support the EC's proposal to re launch talks this year,
but under the condition that will have a clear-cut agenda," said
the minister Monday here at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Luhut said Indonesia's stance was revealed during a meeting
between President Abdurrahman Wahid and European Trade
Commissioner Pascal Lamy last week.
</P>
<P>
Lamy visited Indonesia as part of a series of official trips to
key developing countries to lobby for a new attempt to launch a
round of trade talks after the failure of the Seattle WTO
conference last December.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Director General of International Industry and
Trade Organization Cooperation Hatanto Reksodiputro said Indonesia
demanded the new trade talks to benefit not only the
industrialized countries but also developing countries, which make
up two-thirds of the 135 member countries in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"It must ensure the balance in serving the interests of both
industrialized and developing countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hatanto said Indonesia wanted the agenda for new WTO talks to
include specific topics like antidumping and investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Indonesia does not want the labor
standardization issue to be raised at the new round of trade talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
"We will close the camps on our side of the border soon,"
Foreign Affairs Minister Alwi Shihab was quoted by national
newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said the president had agreed to shut the camps after
calls from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan at
a regional foreign ministers meeting in Bangkok last week.
</P>
<P>
The foreign calls followed last week's killing of one U.N.
peacekeeper from New Zealand by a militia gang who crossed the
border.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he believed the international community would
fully support the closure of refugee camps as it was in line with
their demands on Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate when the camps, which shelter about 140,
000 refugees, would be shut, saying the Cabinet would soon discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that he would also discuss the plan with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on August 19.
</P>
<P>
East Timor broke away from Indonesian rule last year after a U.
N.-supervised ballot. The result of the vote triggered a bloody
backlash by anti-independence militiamen who went on a rampage
across the half-island territory.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Shape U.S. Foreign Policy 2000 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA, the United States, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The
Republican Party of the United States affirmed Monday that it will
pursue a policy of "new realism" in the presidential campaign
aimed at maintaining "principled American leadership" through
strengthened military buildup, enhanced alliance, expanded trade
and resolute diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"A Republican president will identify and pursue vital American
national interests. He will set priorities and he will stick to
them," says the GOP (Grand Old Party, the Republican Party in U.S.
politics) platform for presidential campaign 2000, which was
adopted at the Republican National Conference that opened here
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Calling themselves "the party of peace through strength," the
Republicans vowed to "transform America's defense capabilities for
the information age" by spending more and investing wisely with "
new concepts, new strategies, and new resolve."
</P>
<P>
According to the Republican blueprint, the GOP will try to set
up a cover-all missile shield that could protect all the 50 U.S.
states, American's deployed forces overseas, and its friends and
allies threatened by "outlaw states" or accidental launches.
</P>
<P>
The GOP stance is in contrast with the Clinton administration
which advocates the establishment of a partial and limited missile
defense system in some region of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"America must deploy effective missile defense, based on an
evaluation of the best available options, including sea-based, at
the earliest possible date," the document says.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans also showed a tougher stance on the Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, threatening to withdraw from it
within six months if negotiations collapse with Russia on changes
in the mechanism the two countries built up in 1972.
</P>
<P>
While the platform calls for a re-examination of the
traditional policy of "nuclear balance of terror" with Russia and
for continued reduction of nuclear arsenal, it insists on
rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, dismissing it as "not
verifiable, not enforceable," and not enabling the U.S. to "ensure
the reliability" of its nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
In the platform, the Republicans drum up a strong support for "
open markets," "free trade," and "the free flow of information"
around the world, and they also call for efforts to overhaul
international financial institutions for sustainable prosperity in
the upcoming decades.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Shape U.S. Foreign Policy 2000 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The GOP wants to see NATO "strong, cohesive, and active" and
supports its continued enlargement, the platform says. A
republican president, it adds, would make even greater efforts to
cooperate with the trans-Atlantic military bloc in dealing with
geopolitical issues in the Middle East and Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Russia, the platform stresses that "the
United States needs patience, consistency, and principled reliance
on democratic forces."
</P>
<P>
The GOP makes it clear that it will strengthen American
alliance with Japan, "a key partner" in the Pacific region, to
keep "an important foundation of peace, stability, security, and
prosperity in Asia," says the republican platform.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the GOP reiterates its willingness to pursue a
"one-China policy" in the future, which has been carried on for
more than two decades by six U.S. presidents, including republican
presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
The republican presidential campaign platform also lays out its
four priorities in the Middle East and Gulf region, one of the few
hot spots that America sees as related to its vital national
interests.
</P>
<P>
"First, we seek to promote and maintain peace throughout the
region. Second, we must ensure that Israel remains safe and secure.
Third, we must protect our economic interests and ensure the
reliable flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. And fourth, we must
reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the region,"
the platform says.
</P>
<P>
It warns the Palestinians not to declare a unilateral
declaration of independence and asserts that "the United States
has a moral and legal obligation to maintain its embassy and
ambassador in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Last week, not long after a U.S.-mediated summit failed between
the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, the Clinton administration
threatened to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem
if the Palestinians unilaterally declare independence by September
13.

<HEADLINE> Susi Awarded Honorary IOC Diploma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Susi Susanti, one of Indonesia's
top badminton stars, has been awarded an honorary diploma by the
International Olympics Committee (IOC) for her wonderful
achievements displayed throughout her career.
</P>
<P>
The award was presented by Wismoyo Arismunandar, chairman of
the Indonesian Olympics Committee, here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you. I could not have been here for the IOC award if I
had not enjoyed the full support of everyone concerned during my
career. And I wish my juniors every success when they compete in
Sydney," Susi was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Susi is a former world badminton star. Her best performance
was at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics where she, and her then-fiancee
Alan Budikusuma, won Indonesia its first gold medal in the four-
yearly world sporting showcase. The couple are now married with
one daughter.
</P>
<P>
Susi began her international career in 1983 in the Jakarta Open.
But it was in the doubles event that she starred by winning her
first international title.
</P>
<P>
In the years that followed, she went from success to success,
winning the Asian under-15 championship twice. She then rode on
into senior competition by taking out the world championship title.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the West Javanese star carved herself an achievement
which had never before been achieved by an Indonesian woman, when
she won the All England on her second attempt. She was beaten in
the final on the first occasion.
</P>
<P>
However, her phenomenal achievement came two years later when
she won a gold medal in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Susi announced her retirement last year.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Forest resources in south China
's Guangdong Province are on the increase in the past 15 years,
according to Guangdong's Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
The province's forest area had more than doubled, from 4.6
million ha in 1985 to 9.3 million ha last year. Its forest
coverage rate had also increased from 27.7 percent to 56 percent
in the same period, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The province launched a ten-year afforestation program in 1985,
and since then its forest area has scored a year-on-year increase
of 660,000 ha. Up to now, Guangdong's forest increase has
surpassed forest consumption on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The province has now established a sound ecological system
consisting of water-conserved forests covering 70 percent of the
provincial area, 3,400-km coastal protection forests, and shelter
forests in 208,000 hectares of farmland in 35 counties.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has issued a series of regulations to
punish those involved in destroying forest resources or other
related illegal activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first large-scale patent
trading market will go into trial operation here this month, today
's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The patent market will be "a bridge between patentees and
investors", offering patent holders a public trading place to
translate their research findings into real products, said an
official with the State Intellectual Property Office.
</P>
<P>
Patentees had no place to sell their ideas before the
construction of the trading center, which leads to the low number
of patents resulting in actual products, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than one million patents have been approved and more than
700,000 patents have been publicly announced since China issued
its first Patent Law 15 years ago. And new patents grows at a rate
of over 100,000 units every year.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Guozhuan Patent Trading Market is jointly
constructed by the State Intellectual Property Office, the Beijing
Patent Bureau and the Dongcheng District government of Beijing,
with a total investment of 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The market will set up a service system providing global
archives of related patents and its own website to offer on-line
service, the official said.

BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's reform on the civil
service has put an end to the so-called "iron rice bowl " of civil
servants, and opened up careers for other people, today's China

</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 workers, who once owned the "iron rice bowl"

<P>
In the same period, 13,267 workers and farmers were recruited

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Contraceptive bills for men have
been successfully tested by Shanghai experts working with
Edinburgh University in the first experiment of its kind in the
world, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great breakthrough in the process of helping
husbands share the burden of contraception in the new century,"
Zhu Huibing, vice-director of Shanghai Institute of Family
Planning Technical Instruction, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Edinburgh University of Scotland also revealed part of the
research report last month.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, 30 men in their 30s, all married with children,
took part in the research which ended in March. They took one or
two pills containing progestin every day for periods ranging from
six months to one year.
</P>
<P>
Progestin is a synthetic hormone combination commonly used by
women to prevent pregnancy. "This is the first time to apply
progestin to men in the world," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The effects were clear. Over 90 percent of the volunteers
stopped producing sperm during the period of experiment.
</P>
<P>
After they stopped taking the pills, they all recovered their
sperm production two or three months afterwards, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> No More Rice Imports This Year: Indonesian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- As rice stocks are still
plentiful,there was no need to sign any more rice import contracts
in 2000,according to Indonesia's National Logistics Agency (Bulog).
</P>
<P>
"Bulog's existing rice stocks are still plentiful and our rice
harvests this year are very good. So we won't sign any new
contracts this year. Our existing stocks are much higher than the
demand," Bulog head Rizal Ramli was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the biggest rice buyers in the
international market, and the move is likely to affect Thailand
and Vietnam, the country's biggest suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia bought around 3.6 million tons of rice last year, or
about 13 percent of the rice sold on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Ramli said rice from existing contracts will still continue to
arrive in the country, but gave no details on how much rice was
yet to be imported.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unhusked rice production is expected to increase to
51 million tons in 2000 from 49.5 million tons in 1999.

<HEADLINE> China to Popularize Water Saving Technologies in Yellow River Irrigated Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the birth place of the Chinese nation, the Yellow River has
been called by Chinese as the "mother river" for several thousand
years. However, 18 consecutive years of seasonal drying-up of the
river has set emergency alert to the nation.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of the river's seasonal drying-up, according to
Chinese experts of water conservancy, may be the severe waste of
its water resources, the ecological environment destruction, the
exhaustion of water sources, and the warmer climate.
</P>
<P>
The water saving technologies to be adopted in the Hetao
irrigated area on the top of the river's Great Bend include
spraying and drip-drip irrigation methods and the use of drought
resistant crop breeds. China plans to reduce the annual water
consumption on the 570,000 hectares of land in Hetao from 5.2
billion cubic meters to 4 billion cubic meters by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China has earmarked over 20 million yuan (nearly 2.5 million U.
S. dollars) on building a water saving demonstration region in
Hetao.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia also plans to increase the price for irrigation
water from the present 0.01 yuan per cubic meter to 0.05 yuan. The
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Gansu Province in the Yellow
River Valleys will also follow suit.

<HEADLINE> IOC to Decide EPO Tests in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- With one-and-a-half month to go
before the Sydney Olympic Games, The International Olympic
Committee is to declare Tuesday whether a hormone EPO test will be
carried out in the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
finally approved a test for the drug which has been the illegal
endurance-booster of choice for cheating athletes for years.
</P>
<P>
The 15-person panel of IOC medical commission on Monday is
hearing testing reports from a French laboratory and some
Australian researchers for the banned hormone EPO, an illegal
endurance-booster of choice for cheating athletes for years.
</P>
<P>
It is said that natural and artificial EPO can be differentiate
by the French laboratory while the Australian reports that they
can detect changes in blood caused by use of EPO.
</P>
<P>
the IOC he panel must now decide whether to approve one or both
of the tests for use at the Sydney Olympics slated from September
15 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
EPO, or erythropoietin, was used in the 1980s to treat anemia
in kidney patients and it boosts the production of oxygen-rich red
blood cells. Experts say it can improve performance by 10-15
percent if take by athletes.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe EPO is one of the most widely-used performance-
enhancing drugs, but until now there has been no reliable test
because the drug is also produced naturally in the body.
</P>
<P>
The IOC is concerned about "false positives," where a clean
rider could be wrongly accused of using banned substances, and
will not approve the test until evidence shows it is reliable.
</P>
<P>
If one or both of the tests are approved at this meeting, they
will then be considered by the IOC's legal experts. Final approval
would come at the IOC executive board meeting in Lausanne August
28-29.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality,
southwest China, is building its urban light railway which
traverse through aerial defence tunnels dug more than 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
These tunnels were used to evade air attacks by the Japanese
invaders during the World War II (1939-1945), and later used for
similar purposes in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
These dotted tunnels cover a total area of one million square
meters under this famous "mountain city".
</P>
<P>
The starting point of the light railway is located at a
historical site where several thousands of local people were
killed by bombardment of Japanese war planes.
</P>
<P>
To day, however, some of these tunnels have been developed into
summer resorts, some become warehouses and more have been turned
into underground department stores and recreational centers.
</P>
<P>
The department store underground the Chongqing Railway Station
covers 30,000 square meters in area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Chongqing collected 700 million yuan (84.3
million U.S. dollars) from leasing these tunnels last year. At the
same time, more than 7,000 people found jobs in this underground
world.
</P>
<P>
Li Maowen, an official from the municipal government, said that
when people travel by train through the tunnels, it is always the
reminder of the history.

<HEADLINE> Sacred Mountain and Lake in Tibet Attract Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Kangrinboqe and L. Mapan Yumco,
worshipped as the holy mountain and sacred lake by Tibetans, have
become new tourist attractions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To make full use of local tourist resources, Tibet has opened
two specially designed tourist routes to the holy mountain and
sacred lake, built new roads and opened hotels, tea houses and
restaurants with Tibetan flavor in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists to the two places last year exceeded 20,
000, of whom, 3,200 came from outside China.
</P>
<P>
The 6,600-meter-high Mt Kangrinboqe, in Burang County of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, is one of the highest peaks of Gangdise
Ranges. As the four sides of the mountain are perfectly
symmetrized, it looks like a pyramid and therefore is deemed as
the center of the world by Buddhist worshipers in China and India.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Send Przhevalski's Horses Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China is making preparations for
sending Xinjiang wild horses, also known as Przhevalski's horses,
back "home", hoping that re-acquainting them with their native
surroundings would solve the problem of degeneration of this rare
species.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of more than 20 Xinjiang wild horses are being
raised in a fenced pasture area of 200 hectares, for the purpose
to improve their "capability of taking care of themselves" in the
wild, said sources from the Xinjiang wild horses breeding center,
the largest of its kind in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The center, located in the Jemisar County of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, now has 98 Przhevalski's horses.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang wild horses were first known by the outside world in
the 1770s when a Russian explorer discovered the rare animal in
Xinjiang. A German came to Xinjiang in 1890 and caught 52 wild
horses. However, only 28 of them survived after they traveled a
long journey to Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 Przhevalski's horses now live in different countries
are all offsprings of the 28 survivors, including those in
Xinjiang, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The rare animals disappeared in this westmost region of China
due to excessive poaching and deterioration of local environment
during a period of 100 years before 1986.
</P>
<P>
To save this rare animal, China introduced 18 Przhevalski's
horses from the United States, Britain and Germany starting from
1985.
</P>
<P>
At present, 88.9 percent of the wild horses bred in the
Xinjiang wild horses breeding center have survived, much higher
than 25 percent rate in other countries, said Ma Dan, deputy
director of the center.
</P>
<P>
However, the rare animal is facing the problem of degeneration
due to inbreeding and the fact they have lived in captivity for a
long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggested that it is better to import Przhevalski's
horses from abroad to avoid inbreeding or send the rare animals
back "home".
</P>
<P>
The Przhevalski's horses have existed on earth for 60 million
years, and is now the only species that has survived in the world,
according to experts.

<HEADLINE> People Rush to Genghis Khan's Home to Evade Sunstroke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of thousands of visitors
are rushing to northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where
Genghis Khan had fought and lived, to evade the terrible sunstroke
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments say that most cities in north China
have been experiencing one of the hottest summers in history,
however, temperature in Inner Mongolia is five degree centigrade
lower compared with Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Many experts hold that it was the cold weather that forced
Mongolian hordes on grassland to evade southern cities for food
and treasure, and finally built their huge empire.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 years ago, when Genghis Khan's offspring conquered
China, The Mongolian Plateau was the place where the Emperor and
nobles spent the summer. When the weather turned hot, they left
capital Beijing and rushed to Shangdu, a temporary capital that
was rich in forest and grass.
</P>
<P>
"It is cool here. I have entered the Heaven," said Zhang Lin, a
tourist from Beijing. He added that he eyed Inner Mongolia as his
Xanadu.
</P>
<P>
Railway stations and airports are jammed with people from
different parts of the country. Liu Hongyan, an official with the
local aviation administration said that 80 percent of the planes'
seats are usually occupied.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jun, deputy general of the Inner Mongolian Branch of China
Youth Travel Service, said that his company has received more than
2,000 people since June, with most of them from Beijing and
Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Besides comfortable weather, beautiful grassland and authentic
Mongolian tradition are two things attracting heartland tourists,
who are longing for natural scenery, ethnic dances and chaste
girls. Many of them like to visit the mausoleum of Genghis Khan
located in the Il Yu League.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Inner Mongolia have entered into an agreement to
invest 100 million yuan (12 million U.S. dollars) to develop
tourism in the region.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

like trade talks and sight-seeing activities will also be held
during the fair.
</P>
<P>

economic exchanges between eastern and western regions of China,
help further open up western China, but also help central and west
Chinese regions to export more.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Rejects to Host Trial of S. Leone Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Ghana' s President Jerry Rawlings
on Tuesday dismissed the possibility of trying Sierra Leone' s
rebel leader Foday Sankoh in his country.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I remain the President of Ghana I will not allow
that monster to be tried here," Ghana News Agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings made the remarks during talks with the
visiting UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, who is a Ghanaian, in
the country' s capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
"That man is fit for the psychiatric hospital or a zoo. I hope
media reports that he might be tried in Ghana are speculations,"
Rawlings said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was arrested in Sierra Leone' s capital Freetown in mid-
May following his men' s attack on the UN peacekeeping force in
the north of the country and later on the demonstrators in front
of his Freetown residency.
</P>
<P>
Recently the western countries led by the United States drafted
a resolution proposing the UN security council to put Sankoh on
trial on charges of offense against humanity. The proposal has
received the support from Sierra Leone government.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed or amputated by
the Revolutionary United Front rebels led by Sankoh during a nine-
year civil war which was put to an end with the signing of the
Lome peace agreement in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Annan lauded Ghana's role in peacekeeping
operations in West Africa, saying these have been difficult taking
into account of the limited resources.
</P>
<P>
"We have received some support from developed countries but
this has not been enough," said the UN secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would use his visit to discuss matters of common
interest to both Ghana and the UN, especially peacekeeping in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan arrived in Ghana's capital on Saturday night kicking off
a five-day official visit, the first to his home country since his
election as the UN secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Report on Geographical BSE Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
published Tuesday its final opinion on the geographical risk of "
mad cow" disease together with detailed assessment reports for 23
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU conclusions said the geographical risk of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) "has tended to stabilize or
decrease since 1994 or 1996" in all countries where BSE is already
found: Britain, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands,
France, Portugal, Switzerland and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The analysis is based on a qualitative model developed by the
EU's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC). The model was applied to
information provided voluntarily by the 23 countries.
</P>
<P>
The SCC came to the conclusion that "BSE is likely present at
the levels below the detection limits of their surveillance
systems in Italy, Spain, and Germany and unlikely but not excluded
in Austria, Finland and Sweden".
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of Switzerland, actual cases of BSE have
not been discovered in any of the nine third countries that were
assessed so far," the European Commission, EU's executive arm,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The SSC also concluded that it is highly unlikely that BSE
could be present in Australia, Chile, Norway, New Zealand,
Argentina and Paraguay. However, the SSC considers that "it is
still unlikely, but can not be excluded that BSE is present in the
U.S.A. and Canada."

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Situation in Sierra Leone as Dangerous and Volatile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday said that the situation in Sierra Leone has
remained "dangerous and volatile" despite some improvements.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, circulated here
Tuesday, Annan said, "The threat posed by RUF (the Revolutionary
United Front) remains a matter of grave concern."
</P>
<P>
"So far, it has shown no credible sign that it would be ready
to resume the peace process and it has continued to attack UNAMSIL
(the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone) and pro-Government
forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL, after the setbacks suffered early in May, has
demonstrated its capacity assertively, especially since the
successful operation conducted recently to rescue the military
observers and peacekeepers surrounded by RUF at Kailahun in
eastern Sierra Leone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A key objective of the United Nations in the months to come
will, therefore, be to continue to build on the recent successes
of UNAMSIL and to enhance the strength, cohesiveness and
effectiveness of the Mission, as well as to adjust its operational
structure to enable it to cope with the current hostile
environment and to deter RUF from pursuing the military option,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In early May, RUF, headed by Foday Sankoh who is currently
under the government custody in the capital Freetown, violated a
peace accord signed in July last year by taking more than 500 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing an end to the ordeal of the people of Sierra Leone
and achieving a durable peace throughout the country and the
region remains the overarching goal of the international community,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving this goal requires the disarmament, demobilization
and reintegration of all combatants; the restoration of Government
authority throughout the country, including control over all
natural resources; the establishment and/or strengthening of the
main national institutions, including the democratically
accountable armed forces and a national police force; democratic
elections and respect for human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the present circumstances, such objectives can be
achieved only with dedicated commitment, resources and patience on
the part of the Government of Sierra Leone, its regional partners
and the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
In early July, the Security Council imposed a global ban on the
illicit trade in diamonds from Sierra Leone, a move to choke off
the financial sources for the RUF rebels to buy weapons to fight
the rebel war.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's FARC Criticized After Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) has been criticized for its most recent
offensive against remote villages in the interior of the country
at the time when peace talks are being held with the government.
</P>
<P>
The shared position in separate declarations by Interior
Minister Humberto de la Calle, Defense Minister Luis Fernando
Ramirez as well as leaders of the Catholic Church and the People's
Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
Since a month ago, the FARC has launched a series of attacks
against small villages, where they destroyed police headquarters
and public buildings, with an outcome of tens of victims, many of
them civilians hit in cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
"FARC ought to move from words to deeds and stop recurring to
terrorist activities because they will not only lose national but
also international support," warned the minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
The official added that "it is impossible to make propositions
of cease-fire or a truce on the one hand, and to attack civilian
settlements, to murder policemen and soldiers, and to carry out
kidnappings on the other."
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Humberto de la Calle demanded that the
guerrillas show "true signs of peace and respect to the
International Humanitarian Law, which includes policemen and
military as well."
</P>
<P>
The FARC has held amidst the armed conflict negotiations with
President Andres Pastrana since last October as part of a process
that initiated on November 1998.

<HEADLINE> IMF Lifts Suspension of Sudan's Voting Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has lifted a seven-year-old suspension of Sudan's IMF
voting rights in a further step to restore the country's standing
with the institution, the IMF announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement that it made the move in
recognition of Sudan's progress since 1997 in implementing
appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies under the IMF-
monitored reform programs and in repaying IMF credits.
</P>
<P>
A first step in the country's complete reintegration came on
August 27 last year when the IMF executive board lifted its
declaration of non-cooperation against Sudan, which had been in
place since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the "de-escalation" process was aimed at
encouraging IMF members with long-standing arrears to the IMF to
establish a record of policy adherence that will eventually enable
them to regain full access to IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
The executive board's latest move also restores what the
statement called Sudan's "related rights," which according to an
IMF official refers to Sudan's right to express its opinion within
the institution.
</P>
<P>
The board earlier this month determined that Sudan's
performance under a 1999-2001 reform program had been "
satisfactory both in terms of policy implementation and payments
to the Fund."
</P>
<P>
"Nonetheless, it will be important for the authorities to
maintain the current momentum in successfully implementing the
medium-term staff-monitored program in terms of macroeconomic and
structural policies, to increase payments to the IMF as committed
for 2000 and 2001, and to further improve relations with other
creditors," said IMF deputy managing director Shigemitsu Sugisaki.
</P>
<P>
"This would help provide a basis for a comprehensive resolution
to Sudan's arrears to the IMF and to its debt problem," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Supreme Court Ends Session with No Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Supreme Court ended
its plenary session Tuesday afternoon with no pronouncement on
Augusto Pinochet's immunity privation case.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the plenary session that lasted almost three
hours, all of the 20 lawyers of the Supreme Court would have
reached an agreement on a sentence, and even would have voted on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
President of the Supreme Court Hernan Alvarez said that
Pinochet's privation of immunity appeal was agreed upon, and that
during the week, the plenum of the lawyers  of the highest court
would meet to release a sentence.
</P>
<P>
Although the senior judge did not deny or confirm whether the
lawyers voted on the Pinochet case, judge Guillermo Navas said at
the gates of the court's building, "We have not voted yet, but
only reached an agreement and that's it."
</P>
<P>
Also, the plaintiffs taking the case against the former
military commander appeared optimistic that the Supreme Court
confirms Santiago's Court of Appeals decision, which stripped
Pinochet of his immunity.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the defense reiterated the innocence of the retired
general, insisting to deny that Pinochet had links during his
military regime with the "Death Caravan", centered on the 154
accusations presented up to now in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the reunion, Alvarez, said that the court's
decision Tuesday would only be released to the public in case
there existed a "conclusive voting" for or against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
According to the news agency ORBE, the judges would have
agreed on the status of Pinochet already, but will wait until next
week to release the information, for it's probable that Tuesday's
decision would have been "narrow."
</P>
<P>
In May, a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet, 84, of
his immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed against that
ruling in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, judges heard testimony from lawyers
representing the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year rule
and from lawyers defending him.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet ousted socialist President Salvador Allende in a
bloody September 1973 coup. More than 3,000 people died or
disappeared while Pinochet was president and tens of thousands of
other Chileans fled the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the most infamous incidents of the era involved the so-
called "Death Caravan," a military helicopter unit that blitzed
through northern Chile in October 1973 in search of union leaders
and left-wing supporters of Allende. At least 72 people were
killed.

Pastrana to talked about bilateral economic relations and the "
Plan of Colombia."
</P>

Both ministers reiterated in the press release that they will
keep on negotiating a foreign investment promotion and protection
accord.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela To Invest 70 Bln Dlrs for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Energy and Mine
Minister Ali Rodriguez said Tuesday that 70 billion U.S. dollars
will be invested during the next 10 years for the development of
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Rodriguez, the most important challenge of the
current government is to push forwards economic development by
raising productivity.
</P>
<P>
As for the energy issue, a great part of the effort will be
emphasized by the national government, for instance, on the Anco-
Jose gas pipeline project in the state of Anzoategui, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the second half of the year, there will be new strategic
partners participating in power generation firms, like Enelven and
Enelco.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to count with the participation of Semda (
System of Energy of Monagas and Delta Amacuro) and Enelbar (
Electric Energy of Barquisimeto).
</P>
<P>
To the energy and mine minister, all these plans will be
carried out as a fundamental step to enhance the country's economy,
and will increase national and foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez considers as necessary a reform to Venezuela's tax
system. It is a must to simplify tax collection, increasing
benefits and reducing income tax, added Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Tsohatzopoulos Stresses Importance of Cyprus Issue to Greek-Turkish Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos Tuesday stressed the importance of the Cyprus
problem to the relations between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A basic prerequisite for positive development in Greek-Turkish
relations was Turkey's contribution to a fair solution of the
Cyprus problem, which was also what the European Union (EU)
required, Tsohatzopoulos said after talks with his Cypriot
counterpart, Socrates Chasikos, in Athens.
</P>
<P>
He stated that there was no prospect for Turkey's entry into
the EU if the neighboring country did not contribute and make
concessions on Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
eastern Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
coup with Athens.
</P>
<P>
This had to be understood as it was a firm position and non-
negotiable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing Turkish troops' advance in the buffer zone on the
eastern part of Cyprus as "an unacceptable development," the Greek
minister said that a process was underway between the U.N. and
Turkey to deal with the situation following pressure exerted by
Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chasikos said that the defense effort by Cyprus
was continuous despite the ongoing talks between the two
communities on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Greece and Turkey have been strained for
decades over their territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem, but the two long-time rivals have since last June
taken some steps to better their relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece has complained that Athens has done enough to improve
its relations with Turkey, but the neighboring country has failed
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeated that relations between the two countries
cannot be normalized until a final solution of the Cyprus problem,
but Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Monday that he never
viewed Cyprus as a common problem for Greece and Turkey.

MONTEVIDEO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's state-owned company
UTE has signed an accord with the Spanish firm Endesa and the
Franco-German Alstom to build a power generation megacentral and
an electricity connection line with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Analysts described it as an important step towards the energy
integration of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) composed by
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan company said Tuesday that the power center having
a 780 megawatts capacity will be built in the city of Paysandu,
378 kilometers northwest of Montevideo, using natural gas coming
from Argentina as fuel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the electricity line, with a capacity of 1,000
megawatts, will extend from this center to Gravata in Porto Alegre,
capital of Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state.
</P>
<P>
With these projects, the integration of electricity systems of
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay will be fulfilled, and will enable a
better use of the region's energy, said the development director
of the Spanish company Endesa, Jose Ignacio Larrazobal.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 26.3 Million U.S. Dollar Disbursement to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has approved a 26.3 million U.S. dollars disbursement
to Tanzania under a program supported by its Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF).
</P>
<P>
According to an IMF statement issued on Wednesday, the IMF
Executive Board has completed the first review of Tanzania's
arrangement under PRGF. The completion of this review enables the
release of about 26.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Executive Board's discussion on Tanzania, IMF
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chairman Shigemitsu Sugisaki
said Tanzania should be commended for the strong implementation of
its macro-economic program.
</P>
<P>
"It resulted in annual real growth of 4.7 percent in 1999 and a
decline in the inflation rate to less than 6 percent in June 2000.
The authorities also made important progress in structural reform
in the financial, petroleum, and telecommunications sectors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Tanzania to continue its structural reforms in the
areas of privatization, financial sector and external
liberalization for achieving sustained growth and poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, the IMF renamed its concessional
facility for low-income countries, the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility, as PRGF.
</P>
<P>
It was intended that the PRGF-supported programs will in time
be based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in
a participatory process involving civil society and development
partners, and articulated in a poverty reduction strategy paper.
</P>
<P>
The new decision was also to ensure that each PRGF-supported
program is consistent with a comprehensive framework for macro-
economic, structural and social policies to foster growth and
reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
The PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent,
and are repayable over 10 years with a five-and-half-year grace
period for principal payments.

JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- South African Parliament
Wednesday praised the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)
and the South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal
Birds (SAFCCB) for their success in dealing with the world's worst
ever oiled penguin disaster.
</P>
<P>
On an official visit to the penguin relief center at Salt River

"We are very grateful and very, very proud of SAFCCB and IFAW,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
A cargo ship carrying 1,400 tons of crude oil sank near Cape
Town on June 23, causing the largest ever oil leaking accident in
the coastal region and posing great threat to nearly 70,000
penguins.
</P>
<P>
With the help of IFAW and SAFCCB, now all oiled penguins have

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Concerned Over Kabila's Violation of Lusaka Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed great concern over Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
repeated violation of the Lusaka peace agreement, according to
reports reaching here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Foreign Affairs Minister Andr Bumaya said on Tuesday
that Kabila's intention to violate the peace accord is manifested
in the brutal attacks on the rebel held positions and the
rejection of the new peace mediator.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace agreement was signed in the capital of Zambia
in July and August last year by warring parties involved in the
conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for the inter-Congolese dialogue remain poor."
said Bumaya while addressing diplomats in Kigali on the security
situation in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Bumaya noted with disappointment that the DRC officials had
reportedly walked out of the Political Committee meeting held in
Lusaka last Friday when OAU-appointed facilitator Ketumile Masire
addressed the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign affairs minister called on the United
Nations to immediately probe the claims that Kabila intends to use
dangerous biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said earlier that if the rebels attack his positions by
using biological weapons, he will respond with the same artillery.
</P>
<P>
Bumaya said that Kabila's act was non-acceptable in the
International Humanitarian Law and that it deserves an immediate
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda fight alongside with different rebel factions
in the DRC to oust the government led by Kabila in Kinshasa while
Kabila is supported by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.

Salim of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Senegalese
President Maitre Abdoulaye Wade have called for a speedy process
in the establishment of the African Union, according to an OAU
press release issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a Tuesday's private meeting in Dakar, Senegal, Salim and
Wade underscored the importance of a speedy signing of the
Constitutive Act of the African Union adopted by the 36th OAU
Summit in Lome, Togo, in July this year and emphasized the need of
sensitizing African public opinion, including African
intellectuals and the civil society in general, on the African
Union
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Wade informed Salim of plans to have a meeting
of African intellectuals with the objective of having their input
on the best ways and means to ensure the implementation of the
Constitutive Act of African Union in Dakar before the next OAU
Extraordinary Summit scheduled to be held in Sirte, Libya, next
year.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that some 500 intellectuals both within the
continent and Africans in the diaspora will be invited to such a
meeting, the release said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the issue of the establishment of the African
Union, the two leaders also discussed the situation of conflicts
on the African continent and efforts being made to resolve them.
</P>

Wednesday for Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, en route back to Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> WHO's Anti Smoking Efforts Undermined by Tobacco Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Health
Organization (WHO) claimed on Wednesday that its tobacco control
program had been undermined by international tobacco companies
which secretly tried to discredit the United Nations health agency.
</P>
<P>
The report, drawn up by a four-member committee of experts
including South African public health expert Fazel Randera,
revealed that the companies viewed WHO as one of their foremost
enemies.
</P>
<P>
It said tobacco companies instigated global strategies to
impede WHO's ability to carry out its mission, sought to pit other
U.N. agencies against WHO, and tried to convince developing
countries that WHO's tobacco control program was carried out at
the expense of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The attempted subversion has been elaborate, well financed,
sophisticated and usually invisible," the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
Randera said much of the information in the report was culled
from tobacco company documents made public as a result of court
cases against the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the report detailed how tobacco companies used experts
in particular fields to try to influence not only the WHO, but
other world organizations, and how the media was used to put
forward the views of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"I was taken aback by the consistency and the manner and the
enormous resources that the tobacco companies utilized to
undermine the WHO as a global health organization concerned with
the health of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Randera said the report cautioned the developing countries that
as they mounted their public health campaigns on issues such as
AIDS, they should not forget the impact of smoking on health of
their populations, particularly women and children.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that the WHO would find ways of helping
people in developing countries who took up the struggle of
litigation against tobacco giants to share in the expertise
enjoyed by claimants in recent cases in the United States.

LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings on
Tuesday conferred the state honor of the Companion of the Order of
the Star of Ghana on Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General, in
recognition of his "unwavering efforts and indomitable spirit
toward the achievement of world peace".
</P>
<P>
The president said at the conferring ceremony that "your
initiative, high sense of duty, exceptional skill and performance
were ingredients that led to your appointment as Secretary-General,
the first Secretary-General to emerge from the ranks of the
International Civil Service, thus bringing honor and respect to
yourself and Ghana."
</P>
<P>
Rawlings also said "Ghana would continue to devote its
resources, inadequate and strained as they are, to manage
conflicts in Africa with a view to removing the factors, which
hinder and undermine peace, security, stability and development,
according to a report by Ghana News Agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke about the crippling debt burden of
developing countries and their lack of access to the international
market and said efforts to redress these imbalances are still too
hesitant and tentative.
</P>
<P>
He urged the rich countries to do more to remove elements of
the international system, which militate against the advancement
of the developing world, particularly Africa, to save humanity
from eventual catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in response that he had taken great pride in Ghana's
progress in democracy and economic development. "Wherever I have
traveled I have only heard praise for our country," he said.

LAGOS, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A 7-member corruption probe
committee has suggested that the president and his deputy in the
upper chamber of Nigeria's top legislature should resign, for
accepting kickbacks and unauthorized "welfare packages".
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Wednesday said the Senate would discuss the
suggestion on Thursday, a copy of which had also been forwarded to
the Attorney-General of the federal government.

kickbacks in a street light project and computer purchase with
combined value of 273 million naira (about 2.48 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabweans Flock to AIDS Testing, Counseling Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention and
Support Organization Wednesday said more people are coming for HIV/
AIDS testing and counseling as the pandemic takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the organization Evelyn Serima told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that "the number of people seeking our
services has more than doubled mainly because of awareness
programs since we started in 1998."
</P>
<P>
She said the sexually active age group of between 19 and 39
years were the major users of the services.
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to know their HIV/AIDS status either because
they want to get married or want to plan for the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
The major challenge facing the organization was lack of support
facilities in the community for people living with HIV/AIDS that
would enhance their behavioral change.
</P>
<P>
The organization charged 150 Zimbabwean dollars (three U.S.
dollars) for both HIV/AIDS testing and counseling as it was being
supported by the Dutch government. Market rates for the services
were about 1,000 Zimbabwean dollars (20 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two centers in Harare and Chitungwiza
near Harare. The organization is planning to open a new testing
and counseling center in Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe soon.
</P>
<P>
About 56 percent of hospital beds in all urban hospitals have
been occupied with patients suffering from HIV/AIDS related
diseases.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people are dying of AIDS every week in Zimbabwe out
of an estimated population of 12.5 million people.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs Funds to Fight Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Prime Minister
has required 4 billion Uganda shillings (2.6 million U.S. dollars)
to urgently buy relief food for the famine-stricken areas in
Uganda, the New Vision reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Tom Butime said
the request had been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
In a ministerial statement to the Parliament, Butime said the
Karamoja region in the northeastern Uganda was the worst hit by
drought and almost 90 percent of the population in Moroto District
in the region are facing food shortage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Butime dismissed recent reports that over 100 people
had died of starvation, saying that 2.6 billion Uganda shilling (1.
6 million U.S. dollars) had been used to purchase emergency relief
food in the April-June period.
</P>
<P>
He said that 11 out of 45 districts in the country had been
severely affected by the drought, adding the estimated crop yield
in the affected districts stood at 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on district leaders to ensure that only the
most needy people get relief food aid, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Encourages Crows Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 107,225 Indian
house crows have been killed in Dar es Salaam over the past nine
years to prevent the birds from transmitting disease to other
birds and man, a conservation official was quoted as saying by
local newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paul Nyiti of the Wild Life Conservation Society of Tanzania (
WSCT) said Tuesday that over 200 birds, which are voracious
scavengers and predators, are either killed or trapped every week
in the city.
</P>
<P>
He said individuals and non governmental organizations played a
key role in the project aimed at wiping out the destructive bird.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyiti, 50 Tanzanian shillings (some 0.06 U.S.
dollar) was paid to an individual for every head of crow killed
and half the rate on the eggs.
</P>
<P>
Nyiti said his organization was considering devising cheap
means of killing the birds, especially through the usage of a safe
and well-tested poison at dump sites.
</P>
<P>
Indian house crows, formerly known as scavenger hawks, were
introduced to Zanzibar 1891 from Bombay in India with a belief
that they would help in cleaning the city by picking waste
materials.
</P>
<P>
The black crows, which are known for their notoriety in praying
on other birds' nests, migrated to Dar es Salaam from Zanzibar in
the mid-1970s and reproduced at a horrifying rate.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Kenya rose during
July due to the depreciation of the shilling, the Central Bank of
Kenya said in a weekly update issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said average inflation rate rose to 6.5 percent in
July from 5.9 percent in June and all other indicators of
inflation similarly rose.
</P>

The bank also attributed the inflation to the high cost of
fuel, power products and a decline in the supply of basic food
items.

However, the bank said, the shilling rallied against major hard
currencies last week following the resumption of aid to Kenya by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
It rose to 74.61 shillings last week against the dollar from
76.03 shillings in the previous week, against the British pound
the shilling gained more than a shilling to close at 112.88
shillings from 114.61 shillings in the previous week.

NEW YORK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
with the blue chips rising Tuesday as fresh economic reports eased
fears of higher interest rates, but with the tech shares falling
on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 84.97 at 10,606.95.
The blue chip index rose 10.81 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 81.47 at 3,685.
52, giving up most of its 103.99-point gain in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 7.27 at 1,438.10.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks rose as three reports showed fresh signs
of the slowing economy after six rate hikes since June last year
and therefore calmed the worries about more rate hikes, which were
sparked last Friday after the Commerce Department reported the
stronger-than-expected economic growth of 5.2 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported Monday that construction
spending fell 1.7 percent in June, the third consecutive monthly
decline. Meanwhile, the National Association of Purchasing
Managers said in a separate report that activity in the nation's
industrial sector stayed in July.
</P>
<P>
In the third report, the Commerce Department said the personal
spending rose by the stronger-than-expected 0.5 percent but the
prices Americans paid for goods overall were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Disney and Coca-Cola led the Dow's advance. Share of utilities,
pharmaceuticals and petroleum equipment makers were also higher.
</P>
<P>
But Internet and telecommunications stocks dragged the Nasdaq
index lower as investors took profits from a big rally in the tech
sector Monday. Cisco and WorldCom fell.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 7.33 at 647.96 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 5.48 at 911.92. But he Russell 2000 index of

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
Tuesday made a pronouncement to enhance its trade exchange with
China and to support the entrance of this Asian giant in the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
This stance was manifested by Mexican Foreign Secretary (
Minister) Rosario Green during a conference in the auditorium of
the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing, according to a communique
of the Mexican Foreign Secretariat (Ministry).
</P>
<P>
Green and her counterparts from Colombia and Chile, Guillermo
Fernandez and Soledad Alvear, (the three countries make up the "
troika" delegation of the Group of Rio) are paying a visit to
China from July 31 to August 14 to deepen the links between the
Latin American bloc and the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Green said that out of the 8.3 billion U.S. dollars of yearly
trade between China and Latin America, 2 billions or 24 percent go
to Mexico, which represents an incentive to strengthen the links
between both nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the links between Mexico and China
evolved since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1972 and
have included the visits of Mexican presidents Luis Echeverria in
1972 and Ernesto Zedillo in 1996 to the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that Mexico and China have signed 11 cooperation
accords on traditional Chinese medicine, ethnic issues,
agricultural development and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Green said that in the days to come, Mexico will receive 88
Chinese historical pieces to be shown in the National Anthropology
and History Museum, and in exchange China will receive at the same
time Maya culture pieces from Mexico to be exhibited at the Museum
of the Century in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican foreign minister talked with Chinese State
Councilor Wu Yi about many issues of common interest regarding
trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Green reiterated the support of Mexico for the entrance of
China to the WTO and examined issues regarding future direct
investments by China in Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers of the troika delegation of the
Group of Rio analyzed in China the perspectives and opportunities
of strengthening understanding and relations between both parties.

<HEADLINE> Japan To Invest 50 Mln Dlrs to Build Uruguay's Harbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese group Kambara
will invest 50 million U.S. dollars to build a harbor in Uruguay
specially to process and export wood in Nueva Palmira Port, it was
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The initiative of the Japanese firm was shown to the president
of the National Port Administration (NPA), Edison Gonzalez Lapeyre.
</P>
<P>
Kambara is currently participating in Uruguay's fishing sector
and bought 27 years ago a 12-hectare surface near Nueva Palmira
Port.
</P>
<P>
Lapeyre considered the project to be interesting "because in
the short run the country will have to move an enormous wood
production and does not possess yet the required infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, at Nueva Palmira Port there are two pierces for bulk
cargo, wood and citric transportation purposes only.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the sea terminals experiencing a growth process
due to its location near Rio de la Plata and the Atlantic Ocean
exit.

BRASILIA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Landslides caused by heavy
raining have left 12 dead and thousands homeless in northeast
Brazil, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Downpour starting last Saturday and continuing through Tuesday
has already caused more than 100 landslides which have covered

</P>
<P>
Since the climate phenomenon will continue for over 48 hours,
which means more problems and deaths, authorities recommend people
to take necessary precautions.
</P>
<P>
At Recife, with over 1.35 million inhabitants, more than 1,000
people have had to leave their houses, most of them located in the

<HEADLINE> German States To Join Efforts In Combating Hate-Motivated Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's federal states have
decided to work more closely in crackdown on the hate-motivated
crimes against foreigners and Jews by right-wing extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
DPA, the German News Agency, quoted sources at the states
interior ministries as saying that among others, measures will be
taken to intensify efforts to warn youths about the dangers of
right-wing extremist groups, watch closely the right-wingers and
increase protection for Jewish institutions.
</P>
<P>
The moves followed a series of attacks on foreigners and
Jewish immigrants in recent months. According to latest official
statistics, there were 157 anti-Semitic offenses registered
between April and July this year, compared with 110 for the same
period last year.
</P>

German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder has announced that he plans
a two-week trip later this month through eastern Germany, where
high unemployment is believed to be a contributing factor to

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Elite Optimistic About Online Copyright Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Almost three out of four film
and television producers in Hollywood believe that copyrights can
be protected on the Internet despite the major concern about
online piracy, San Francisco-based magazine Red Herring reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That optimistic opinion is found in a survey of 70 high-ranking
members of the Hollywood creative community.
</P>
<P>
Copyright protection has emerged as a major issue for the
entertainment industry, as demonstrated in court battles in the
United States against providers of file-sharing technology. The
Motion Picture Association of America estimates that piracy costs
the industry 250 million U.S. dollars annually, and that figure
could rise dramatically if file sharing of video content becomes
more widespread.
</P>
<P>
Despite the possibility that file sharing could hurt the
revenues of film and television production, 70 percent of
producers think that copyrights can be protected online, ensuring
they are properly compensated for their creative efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Red Herring study also found that producers who are
involved to some degree in online production are even more
optimistic about copyright protection, with 82 percent of them
expressing the opinion that online copyrights can be protected.
</P>
<P>
"On the subject of copyright protection, while the results show
that the creative elite feel copyrights will be protected online,
the underlying message was that they simply must be, in order for
the industry to further embrace digital media," said the magazine,
commenting on the survey results.
</P>
<P>
The Internet allows the possibility for producers to bypass
traditional distribution channels, such as movie studios and
television networks, and distribute content to consumers directly.
The producers surveyed are willing to consider severing their
relationships with studios and networks in the wired world, but
only if their partners have the right expertise. Fifty-five
percent of producers who said they were involved with online
production favored handling online distribution themselves,
compared with only 26 percent of producers who are not involved
with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
While low bandwidth and slow download times limit the
convenience of online video now, most producers say that broadband
pipes will begin to have an impact on online distribution in the
next five years. Fifty-nine percent of survey respondents say most
entertainment will be delivered online within the next five years,
while 11 percent say the shift will never occur.

<HEADLINE> EU Faces Barriers for Entering U.S. Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said in
a report published Tuesday that European and foreign-owned firms
still face considerable barriers when seeking access to the U.S.
market for communication services.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the
barriers exist particularly in the satellite services and the
mobile services sectors.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is not in line with the market access policy
advocated by the U.S., and provides a competitive advantage to the
significant number of U.S. companies that have already access to
the European market in these fields," the commission said in the "
Report on United States Barriers to Trade and Investment in 2000."
</P>
<P>
The EU executive also identified a number of U.S. laws and
policies on Internet and electronic commerce which could "impact
negatively on the business of European companies, particularly in
the fields of Internet domain names and cybersquatting, encryption
and patentability of software and business methods."
</P>
<P>
The report said a number of European satellite companies have
encountered serious problems to serve the U.S. market. "
Proceedings by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on
spectrum allocation and licensing have not been carried out in an
objective, transparent, timely and non-discriminatory manner,
which raises concerns regarding compatibility with the U.S. WTO
commitments," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the encryption issue, the EU executive expressed concerns
about the U.S. regime, considering that "a combination of the
continuing constraints on the export of strong encryption products
and on the interoperability of systems employing such technology
inhibits not only trade in encryption products but, more
importantly, the effective growth of electronic commerce."
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, many modern encryption techniques are patented and
licenses may be required to allow sales of European products in
the U.S. Thus, significant barriers to international trade in
encryption products without key recovery continue to exist," the
EU said. It pointed out concerns in this area among others, such
as mobile communications, digital television, foreign investment
and radio communications.
</P>
<P>
The EU annual report provides an update on all major obstacles
that EU companies face when exporting and investing in the United
States. It also draws attention to persisting U.S. unilateral and
extraterritorial legislation, abusive use of U.S. trade policy
instruments and export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc "attaches the utmost importance to market
access barriers in emerging sectors, notably in information
technologies."

<HEADLINE> 27 Million Europeans Expected to Have Broadband Access by 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Broadband Internet has to
date been unavailable and unaffordable in Europe, but change will
come in the next a few years, a U.S. market research firm
predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.2 percent of European households had broadband Internet
access in 1999, and this number will grow to 18 percent or 17
million broadband subscribers by 2005, said a new report from
Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
According to Forrester, the shift to broadband will require
scale, scope and brand strength that independent Internet service
providers (ISPs) and broadband startups can't handle, driving a
shakeout that favors telcos and cablecos. Competition will
radically expand coverage as cablecos and telcos battle it out.
Forrester expects access prices to sink below 30 U.S. dollars a
month in 10 of 17 European countries by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Content will be the main driver for mass-market broadband
penetration starting in 2003, Forrester said. Today's broadband
users seek a better Web experience despite the stiff price.
Although the price cuts will help double the number of subscribers
in Europe, the firm said, compelling new content will be the key
to attracting the average person to broadband.
</P>
<P>
Scandinavia is expected to match the United States in 2005 with
broadband penetration levels between 36 percent and 40 percent of
households. Germany's broadband penetration will reach 25 percent
by 2005, and lower penetration levels are expected in the U.K. and
France.
</P>
<P>
Forrester expects cable modems and copper technologies like
asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) to share 80 percent of
the total European residential broadband market by 2005, with ADSL
in the lead with 53 percent of all broadband connections.

<HEADLINE> Genocide Film to Promote Reconciliation Among Rwandans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The "100 DAYS" Genocide film that
is due on the market early next year will enhance unity and
reconciliation among the Rwandans, said film producer Eric Kabera
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Rwanda News Agency as saying that the 100 Days
film shot on the location, in Rwanda using actors who witnessed
the genocide, will unveil the reality since people speak freely
using graphics.
</P>
<P>
"The feature film brings the reality closer than the
traditional media. With the film you can identify and descry all
the events graphically by use of emotional pictures," Kabera said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the prime target of the film was to let
Rwandans reconcile amongst themselves. The genocide film will
enhance communication and bring the deniable to become acceptable
and once that is done, people can realize the truth and reconcile.
</P>
<P>
According to the film producer, the 100 DAYS film will act as
the first mobile monument ever since genocide was implemented in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"This is a Rwandan expression of the Genocide reaching out...It
is a compelling and chilling drama, with strong characters to
which people from all cultures can relate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 100 DAYS film is a feature film by British cameraman and
director Nick Hughes, who five years ago while working as a news
cameraman, witnessed and filmed Rwanda's government-sponsored
ethnic cleansing campaign that led to the extermination of about
500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutu opposition.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to tell the story effectively, Hughes and Kabera
decided to hire local actors who actually survived genocide
attacks. They still bear the scars of murderous events and all
have lost family members to the armed militia known as the "
interahamwe".
</P>
<P>
According to Kabera, the film follows a teenage girl, her
boyfriend and their families as the slaughter unfolds with the
full endorsement of an evil French priest and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The film has attracted funding from private Rwandan investors,
he said, adding that Hughes' production company is also financing
the full length feature. Over 2 million U.S. dollars is to be
spent at all levels of production, including cash, equipment and
crew.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabera is concerned that with the filming now complete,
there is a task of making sure 100 Days reaches audiences in
Africa, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
Discussions are underway with distributors and the drama
opening to the film festival audiences will be due early next year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the movie will first be shown in cinemas, then it will
be made available to television stations and networks around the
world.
</P>
<P>
There is already significant interest in the film, which
promises to leave a lasting impression to the human tragedy on an
epic scale, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans to Be Removed From Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday said the government will start removing war veterans
from white-owned commercial farms this month.
</P>
<P>
The government would first target war veterans on farms
designated for resettlement, he told reporters after holding
bilateral talks with South African President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"Within this month, we will have completed the removal of the
war veterans on farms earmarked for resettlement," he said,
stressing "there is a process to acquire land according to the law.
"
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government recently announced that it had
earmarked at least 3,000 farms for resettlement including 804
farms it had already published.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has been under pressure to remove the war veterans from
the farms they occupied since February this year.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans cited the disparity in the land ownership in
which about 4,500 white farmers own more than 70 percent of arable
land as the main reason for occupying the farms.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Mbeki said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
offered to lead the international community in search of a
solution to the Zimbabwe's land problem.
</P>
<P>
"We have received letters in the last few days from Annan
saying he wants the land issue in Zimbabwe to be addressed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said some governments have already agreed to work with Annan
to resolve the land impasse in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that the land problem in Zimbabwe would
affect South Africa since the two countries have the same land
tenure systems.
