STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Doubles player
Nicklas Kulti is suffering from a chronic back injury and is

<HEADLINE> GCC Foreign Ministers Prepare for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states started here today a
two-day meeting to prepare for the upcoming GCC summit scheduled
on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was inaugurated by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and attended by all his
counterparts from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
Oman and Bahrain, as well as GCC Secretary General Jamil
Al-Hujailan.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Al-Sabah talked about a number of
regional issues of common concern for the GCC states. He praised
the recent tour of the GCC countries by Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi who asserted Tehran's willingness to open a new
chapter of good neighborly relations with the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Iran's relations with the Gulf states
would achieve active and substantial progress on the basis of
mutual respect, good neighborhood and non-interference of each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Islamic summit due in Tehran on December 9-11
would help boost confidence and solidarity among the Islamic
nations for the sake of collective stability and security, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the stalemated Middle East peace process, the
Kuwaiti foreign minister said the GCC states would continue to
urge Israel to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories,
including Jerusalem, the Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon
according to U.N. resolutions and on the basis of land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the recent Iraqi crisis, the minister said "we
express our utmost satisfaction with the return of all inspectors
of the U.N. Special Commission (in charge of eliminating Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction) as this would effectively contribute
to preserving security and stability of the region and avert
further hardships for the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
He said that "our states took a united and solid stand toward
this crisis, meaning backing up the international stance to deter
the Iraqi regime from causing new dangers and crisis in the
region."
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq to comply fully with all the U.N. Security
Council resolutions related to its seven-month occupation of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, upon their arrival at the Kuwait International
Airport, foreign ministers of the other five GCC countries told
reporters that the GCC always takes a unified stand on urging Iraq
to fully comply with all U.N. Security Council resolutions
concerning Iraq, for this is the only way for it to return to the
international arena, and to relieve its people of sufferings under
the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Israel to go back on the track of the Middle
East peace process through activating the land-for-peace formula
and return all the lands it occupied from the Arabs.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Centrist Parties Lack Support: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The hopes for most of Ukraine's
centrist parties to win the March 1998 parliamentary elections
darken due to the powerful and popular opponents on the left and
right, political analyst said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is serious danger that many centrist parties will lose
the elections because none of them is influential enough to
attract a majority of people who are inclined to vote for the
centrists," said Mykhail Pogrebinsky, director of the Kiev Center
for Political Research and Conflict Studies.
</P>
<P>
A recent opinion poll conducted by this organization showed the
communists could win about 18 percent of votes. An October survey
by Socis-Gallup gave similar results for the moderate nationalist
Rukh party. Nonetheless, the 10 leading centrist parties could
gain support from only 23 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 percent of those asked had not yet decided which
party they would support.
</P>
<P>
A few centrist parties like the Democratic party or the
People's Democratic Party are likely to win at least 4 percent of
the votes because of their popularity and thus qualify to sent
deputies to the next parliament.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Row Strains Qatari-Egyptian Ties, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Exchanging criticism over
an aborted coup attempt and an economic conference in Doha, Qatar
and Egypt, the two Arab allies recently became estranged from each
other and left out their relationship in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The war of words between them also suspended a meeting of the
eight-member Damascus Declaration states which had been scheduled
in Doha on December 1 to 2.
</P>
<P>
With the upcoming trial by Qatar on 110 people, including two
Egyptians accused of involvement in a failed coup attempt in Qatar
in February last year, their quarrels would likely to reach a high
tide.
</P>
<P>
Qatar said Monday that the two Egyptians, identified as Attiya
Badri Attiya and Ahmad Tawfic Said, will go on trial in absentia
on Wednesday for their role in the aborted bid to topple the
Qatari government.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin Jassin Bin
Jaber al Thani claimed the two Egyptian suspects are from the
Egyptian army and he implicated Cairo in the coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt denied the claim and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has asked Qatar to clarify urgently its foreign minister's
comments.
</P>
<P>
"(Egyptian) Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has summoned the Qatari
ambassador in Cairo and asked him to clarify his government's
position within 48 hours," Egypt's evening daily Al Messa quoted
Mubarak as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also pointed out that the two Egyptians suspected of
involving in the coup attempt are "retired army officers who had
temporary work contract with the Qatari government."
</P>
<P>
The row on the failed coup attempt is only part of the recent
war of words between the two countries. Doha and Cairo also
quarreled about Mubarak's remarks in his tour to some of the Gulf
countries earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is dissatisfied with Israel's participation in the fourth
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference hosted by Qatar
on November 16 to 18. During his Gulf tour, Mubarak described the
conference as "meaningless" due to Israel's failure of honoring
peace deals with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, who tried to convince the world that the Doha
conference would "give new impetus" to the stalled Middle East
peace process, felt under the weather over the Egyptian
president's different tune.
</P>
<P>
Its displeasure was translated into anger when Mubarak told
Gulf media during his visit to Bahrain on November 7 that "even
Qatari people are unhappy" to convene such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Doha criticized Mubarak's address for meddling in Qatar's
internal affairs and it warned Cairo against making indiscreet
remarks.
</P>
<P>
The row was escalated when Qatar announced to ban the entry of
air passengers from Egypt and other nine countries as one of its
security measures for the Doha conference. Egypt announced to
boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Press blasted the ban, saying the decision has hurt
Egyptian people's feelings. Qatari media also publicly expressed
its grievance over Egypt's boycott.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Damascus Declaration states has to be
delayed due to the nearly-one-month row between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Damascus Declaration Group, which was formed in the immediate
aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War to develop security and political
links, groups eight countries, namely, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Syria and Egypt. They
were allied against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Fawaz al Attiya, spokesman of Qatar's Foreign Ministry
announced that consultations are under way to fix a new date for
the meeting after Moussa said he can not attend on December 1
to 2 because of "tension" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Attiya also disclosed that so far, there has not been a third
country who expressed its willingness to mediate between Egypt and
Qatar.

<HEADLINE> UK Promises to Help Sports Replace Tobacco Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government
has promised to help wean sports off tobacco sponsorship
after Prime Minister Tony Blair met representatives today on
tobacco ban issue.
</P>
<P>
Leading figures from sports set to be hit by the
measure--such as golf, ice-hockey, darts and snooker--had a
45-minute meeting at Downing street to discuss the problem
they face.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco sponsorship has become a hot potato for Blair's
government since it decided three weeks ago to propose an
unlimited exemption of tobacco advertising ban for Formula
One motor racing from an EU directive now under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The decision was followed by news that Formula One chief Bernie
Ecclestone had donated one million pounds (1.7 million U.S.
dollars) to Blair's Labor party before the May 1 general election
in which the Labor was swept to power.
</P>
<P>
The representatives reportedly told Blair they were
worried that the three or four-year timescale which has been
spoken of for phasing out tobacco sponsorship might not be
long enough.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Blair defended his decision to exempt
Formula One because of its global nature and cited support
for his stand among other EU governments.
</P>
<P>
He also promised expert help for sports in attracting
sponsorship from other sectors of the economy.

<HEADLINE> UN/ECE Publishes New Guide to Decontaminating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) has just published a Compendium of
Soil Clean-up Technologies and Soil Remediation Companies.
</P>
<P>
The compendium, first of its kind, is intended to help
authorities to select the technology best suited to their soil
contamination problems and to choose companies to carry out the
clean-up, UN/ECE said in a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
"Contamination of soil by chemicals has created major social
and economic problems worldwide," said UN/ECE. "Leaks from ageing
industrial plants, uncontrolled waste disposal, or contamination
as a result of engineering errors are some instances of how sites
can become highly dangerous."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, today there are existing technologies which
can clean up these sites and make them perfectly usable again for
economic or social purposes, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the two-part compendium, the new guide describes 19
well-established commercial soil remediation technologies, which
have been grouped into two broad categories: in situ and ex situ
and further classed according to the method used, chemical,
physical or biological.
</P>
<P>
The compendium contains a list of over 500 soil remediation
companies in 19 countries from North America to eastern Europe,
with addresses, and phone and fax numbers.

<HEADLINE> EU Willing to Play Political Role in Asia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has an
interest and the capability to play a political role in Asia, said
a senior official of the 15-nation union today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of the European Institute for Asian
Studies, Emiliano Fossati, EU director for south and southeast
Asia relations, said that EU also has the will to take the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The director was speaking on behalf of EU Vice-President Manuel
Marin who is responsible for the union's external relations.
</P>
<P>
Fossati told conference participants that it would be
unthinkable for Europe to underestimate the importance of Asia.
"China, India and Indonesia play a role on the world stage."
</P>
<P>
"Whether we look to Asian countries individually, or in the
context of a regional or global forum, it is clear that Asia's
voice must be heard in today's world, and in the discussion of the
global issues which will determine tomorrow's world," said the
director.
</P>
<P>
Asia is playing and must play an important role, according to
Fossati, in such fields as environment, global warming, terrorism,
drugs, international crime and United Nations reform.
</P>
<P>
Asia also has an essential role to play in helping establish a
new post-Cold War order, said Fossati, in contributing to
disarmament and confidence-building and in ensuring that China
integrates smoothly and confidently into the regional and global
scene.
</P>
<P>
Fossati cited as instruments for complementary dialogues the
established cooperation between EU and Asia in fields such as
science and technology and education as well as development
cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that an increased mutual understanding can be achieved
as an increased emphasis is placed on Asia-Europe cooperation in
terms of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The European Union emphasized, in its 1994 decision on a new
strategy toward Asia, the importance of strengthening the union's
economic presence in Asia, of broadening political and economic
relations with Asia, of continuing to promote the development of
the less prosperous countries and regions and of contributing to
the spread of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The European Institute for Asian Studies held its two-day
annual conference here to fathom out to what extent EU member
states share a common perception regarding their relations with
and interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The institute, a non-profit association founded in July 1989,
aims at highlighting the importance of Asia in the future external
relations of the European Community and at developing a center of
expertise on contemporary Asian affairs and on relations between
European Community and its partners in Asia.

<HEADLINE> S. African GDP Growth Down Sharply in Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's GDP
growth nose-dived to only 0.3 percent in the third quarter of the
year, compared with 2.4 percent in the second quarter, Central
Statistics Service said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a widespread slide in real output
of most of the economic sectors, but particularly in
manufacturing, electricity, gas and water, and construction.
</P>
<P>
After annualized growth of 5.4 percent in both the first and
second quarters, the seasonally adjusted real GDP of the
secondary industries declined by 0.5 percent in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing production declined by one percent following
excellent growth in the previous periods.
</P>
<P>
The tertiary industries -- mainly trade and services --
contracted by an annualized 0.1 percent, against a growth of 1.4
percent in the second quarter. Trade and catering declined by 1.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Annualized figures showed that the economy expanded 1.8
percent in the first nine months this year compared with the same
period last year.

JOHANNESBURG, November 25 (Xinhua) -- A Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC) member of parliament, Patricia de Lille, today

The African National Congress (ANC) majority in the National
Assembly voted 183 to 87 to suspend de Lille for 15 parliamentary

Mortgage rates in October averaged 7.29 percent, the lowest
since February 1996.

<HEADLINE> Asia Seen as Major Foreign Direct Investor: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Asia is emerging as a major
foreign direct investor (FDI) in developing countries while
continuing to be the most dynamic and growing region in the
world, an United Nations expert has said.
</P>
<P>
Fujita Masataka of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) made the statement today when he addressed a
U.N. sub-regional workshop on Asia-Africa trade and investment
diversification and networking which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"At least three of the newly industrializing economies:
China's Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan province of
China are now outward investors," Fujita said, adding, "China and
several south-east Asian economies have joined ranks of countries
with sizable outward FDI, albeit a level lower than the inward
investment they host."
</P>
<P>
Africa had begun receiving attention from Asian trans-national
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Korea was the largest investor among
developing Asia, investing 265 million U.S. Dollars by 1995,
followed by China and India, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in Asian FDI to Africa was a result of
realization by Asian firms that Africa had potential and their
full involvement was to the mutual benefit of both continents.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing investments from Asia brings about benefits to
both regions. Asian countries have shown a higher propensity to
save than any other regions and prospects of continuing high
growth of income are good," Fujita noted.
</P>
<P>
In many Asian countries, he said, savings exceeded investment
and Africa could benefit from Asian capital surpluses as well as
its entrepreneurial dynamism.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Africa, with a wealth of natural resources and
large untapped markets, could meet demand by Asian firms.
</P>
<P>
Increasing mutual FDI flows were in the interest of expanding
world trade through opening new market opportunities, expanding
them and deriving maximum benefits from the comparative
advantages in the two regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, efforts continue to address fundamental economic
and social problems as well as regulatory and other obstacles to
investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, the regulatory and business environment is becoming
increasingly favourable as regulatory regimes are liberalised."
</P>
<P>
On average, he said, Africa's share of developing country
inflows had more than halved, from 11 percent during 1986-1990 to
five percent during 1991-1996 as a result of political unrest,
armed conflict and changes in economic policies that affected
business calculations of expected returns and risk.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes to Improve Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped to gradually
improve its relations with neighboring Turkey, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece had asked Luxembourg's Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker to convey Athens' stance to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Juncker, who is holding the current European Union
Council presidency, will visit Ankara on Thursday to discuss with
the Turkish government the start of negotiations between the
Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities to implement U.N.
resolutions on Cyprus as well as the need to encourage leaders of
the two communities to hold talks on the issue of de-escalating
the arms race on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
For Greece, Reppas said, the conditions were that Turkey should
first recognize the jurisdiction of the international court of
justice, contribute in every possible way towards a speedy
resolution of the Cyprus problem and to restore a climate of good
neighborly relations with Greece.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish
government should comply with the framework created by the
relevant U.N. resolutions and the summit agreements of 1977 and
1979 on a resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been trying hard to
better their strained relations this year, but no real progress
has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> South-South Coop Boosts Malaysia Trade with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's trade with African
countries has been on the increase in recent years since the
campaign for South-South cooperation was initiated in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Syed Waseen Ahmad, associate research fellow of the Malaysian
Institute of Economic Research, today told delegates at a
five-day U.N. sub-regional workshop on trade and development in
Harare that Malaysia-Africa trade registered an average annual
growth rate of 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's exports to African countries increased at an
average annual rate of 35.4 percent during 1993-96, while imports
grew at 51 percent per annum during the same period," Ahmad said.
</P>
<P>
Despite rapid growth of trade with African countries, total
trade was a small fraction of Malaysia's total world trade, he
said, adding that there was tremendous scope for improvement.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Malaysia's investments in African countries were
in services, petroleum sectors, infrastructure and industries, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian President in Burkina Faso for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings is in Burkina Faso on his first official visit in ten
years to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries became frosty in October
1987 when Lamizana Sankara, close friend to Rawlings, was killed
in a coup led by the current President Blaise Compraore.
</P>
<P>
But now the relation seems to be warming up again as Rawlings
was reported today drinking and dining at the same table with
Compraore, the man he formerly said he had nothing to do with,
according to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state greeted warmly on Monday when Rawlings
arrived at the International Airport of Ouagadougou, capital of
Burkina Faso, where the Ghanian leader was also given a 21-gun
solute.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, who later addressed the national assembly and
visited some factories and museums, said his visit was long
overdue and it was time to put the past behind.
</P>
<P>
Part of his visit was to hold talks with Compraore about the
sub-regional problems, Rawlings added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, many people in Burkina Faso expressed
their welcome to Rawlings' visit, saying it's time to forgive and
forget and let the two countries enjoy a period of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supporters of Sankara are expecting Rawlings to
visit the cemetery where the former revolutionary leader is
buried.
</P>
<P>
At the time of Sankara's assassination, a week-long period of
mourning was announced in Ghana under Rawlings and the circle in
the capital of Accra was immediately renamed Sankara Circle.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Orders Halt to Arranging Summit With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu has stopped efforts to arrange a summit with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is reportedly unhappy with
Israeli policy on the peace process, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli officials as saying that Netanyahu
ordered his aides to stop trying to arrange the meeting with
Clinton a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The order was made after former United States Ambassador to
Israel Martin Indyk said that Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright are losing patience with Netanyahu and
demanding for progress in the peace process next month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said that Israel's reluctance to push
forward the peace process is hurting Washington's efforts to drum
up Arab support for its actions against Iraq in the recent crisis
over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has already expressed his displeasure with Israel's
handling of the peace process by refusing to meet Netanyahu
when the latter visited the United States early the month.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu's communications adviser David Bar-Illan
today denied the report that Netanyahu had given up his efforts
to arrange a meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"He has not given up at all. What he has said is that
he thought meeting of this kind is beneficial primarily for
the peace process and for making progress in it, and that
both countries should be and are obviously interested in having
such meeting," he said, adding that a date for the
Netanyahu-Clinton meeting would be found.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan criticized the notion that the Netanyahu-Clinton
meeting is a favor for Israel. "We don't see it as a
favor. It's something that can undoubtedly advance the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also complained about the quickness by other governments
in forgetting the trauma that Israel suffered from the recent
terror attacks launched by anti-Israeli Islamic militants that
killed 25 people in two central Jerusalem markets. He insisted
that any progress in the peace process should be linked to
the Palestinian fulfillment of the signed agreements by fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Meretz party lawmaker Ran Cohen
demanded Netanyahu explain urgently to the Knesset (Parliament)
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee his decision to stop
arranging a meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In what considered to be a gesture made under increasing
pressure from Washington, Netanyahu is proposing redeploying Israeli
troops from further 6-8 percent of West Bank in the second
of the three-stage pullbacks stipulated by the Hebron agreement
in January.
</P>
<P>
But it remained unclear if he could get it through his
rightist Cabinet and the Knesset since the decision of further
pullouts has drawn strong opposition from some ministers and
lawmakers of the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is to discuss the proposal formally with senior
Cabinet ministers Wednesday. He has also been launching a
diplomatic offensive to try to drum up support from foreign
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Following the dispatch of his attorney Yitzhak Molcho to Gaza
to meet Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday night, Netanyahu
will send Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and diplomatic adviser
Uzi Arad Wednesday to Cairo to enlist support from Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is expected to reject the Israeli
decision, because the scope of redeployment falls far short of
what it hopes to gain.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Official Calls for Increased Africa-Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa and Asia should
increase bilateral trade as it is increasingly difficult for
products from the two continents to enter markets in the
developed countries, an official from the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said today.
</P>
<P>
Djisman Simanjundtak, an official with the UNCTAD division of
investment, technology and enterprise, told delegates attending a
five-day sub-regional workshop in Harare that Africa and Asia
needed to develop fully the potential for networking in
investment and trade which existed between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
This would greatly boost trade between the two continents
whose products were difficult to enter markets in the
industrialized world, which have high demands for production
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the volume of trade between Africa and some Asian
countries such as Indonesia had doubled in the last six years,
more could still be done to further increase it.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD official said one of the strongest economic
policies any country could adopt was responding quickly to
changing economic trends, hence the need for Africa and Asia to
move in that direction.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop which opened on Monday seeks to exchange
experience on trade and investment diversification and networking
between Africa and Asia and facilitate contacts between business
people from the two continents.

<HEADLINE> Flood Relief Operations Under Way in Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Humanitarian deliveries are
under way in the flood-affected southern regions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has distributed
700 quintals of sorghum, maize and cooking oil to 1,500 families
in the regional capital of Middle Jubba, Bu'ale on Monday. Two
motor boats belonging to WFP were also involved in distributing
the food to the isolated remote areas of the region.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) has
succeeded in providing medicine, food, shelter materials and
blankets to over 50,000 people affected by the floods in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Over 13,000 people have been assisted by the ICRC in Beletuein
in central Somalia, in addition to 10,000 others in the town of
Luq as well as 20,000 people in Bur Dhubo village in the last
three days.
</P>
<P>
A total of 170 tons of assistance goods from ICRC which
consist of high protein biscuits, food, medicine and plastic
sheets for 41,000 flood victims in Middle Jubba region, are about
to be concluded in three days time.
</P>
<P>
A 22 truck convoy from the ICRC which left Mogadishu a week
ago got stuck 60 km from the inundated town of Jilib, and was
then reloaded on boats to reach the flood victims in the towns of
Jilib and Marerrey.
</P>
<P>
According to the regional information department of ICRC, a
total of 230 tons of relief, medical supplies, and emergency
water and sanitation equipment have been airlifted from Kenya to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"A lot has been achieved so far, but tens of thousands in
Bu'ale, Beletuein, and Middle Jubba region remain in critical
situation," said Patrick Berner, head of the ICRC delegation in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Despite enormous difficulties, the relief emergencies continue
as the Somali businessmen seem to be participating the rescue
operations of the flood victims. A group of Muslim scholars and
businessmen were moving all over the capital Mogadishu, with loud
speakers calling on the people to donate food, cloths and money.
</P>
<P>
So far, tens of tons of food and clothes were collected by
volunteers from the imams of the mosques and committees from the
business community.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains continue to cause more fatalities and damages in
new places in southern and central regions of the country. In the
central towns of Dhusamareb, Guri-el and Mataban, four people are
reported to be dying every day due to flood-related diseases such
as malaria and severe diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry of faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid
said they organized 20 Somali doctors and several groups of
volunteers to take part in the relief efforts of lower and middle
Jubba and lower Shabelle regions. The ministry also said it's
ready to provide travel guides to relief agencies so that they
can reach the besieged areas.
</P>
<P>
Despite the extensive relief operations, there are still
people on top of hills and trees waving clothes to the relief and
surveillance planes passing on top of them. These people are in
the besieged villages of Gedo, middle and lower Jubba and Bay
regions.

<HEADLINE> Africa is Losing on Commodities Trade: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa is losing out on
international commodity trade with the exception of agricultural
raw materials and the iron and steel sub-group of minerals where
it has out-performed the world export growth trend, an UNCTAD
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele Kohler from the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) said at the division meeting on
international trade and commodities that in several dynamic
product markets, African countries have been faring well and
succeeded in garnering an increased world market share.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, he said, for some product groups, African
exporters had been displaced by more competitive suppliers in the
course of a tough competition over declining markets.
</P>
<P>
More disturbingly, he said, African exporters had also
experienced setbacks in growing commodity markets because they
had been displaced by new entrants from the developing world.
</P>
<P>
However, he told the five-day U.N. regional workshop on
Asia-Africa trade and investment diversification and networking
which opened here on Monday, that prospects for commodities were
not as dismal as they were often portrayed.
</P>
<P>
"Several commodity categories, most clearly foods, displayed a
marked increase in world trade in the 1990-1994 period, and the
growth rates of exports from developing countries for the major
commodity categories had outstripped world trends in all
groupings of commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of Africa's slower performance in world trade might be
due to displacement effects, with intra-Africa trade absorbing a
larger share than earlier.
</P>
<P>
About 70 participants from 13 African countries attended the
workshop which will end on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian
president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today addressed the Ethiopian
parliament, the house of people's representatives.
</P>
<P>
President Scalfaro said the determination of the Ethiopian
people to recognize their differences, and their willingness to
live together is a victory of justice and human intelligence.
</P>
<P>
He said these differences in experiences, values and cultures,
of the Ethiopian people, nonetheless, have a common denominator,
and this is represented by their request, a request for justice
and equality.
</P>
<P>
Many parts of Africa are still waiting for peace, justice,
democracy and respect of human rights, the president said, adding
that Ethiopia, with her ancient civilization and progress in
recent years, can serve as a guarantee of democracy and stability
to the horn of Africa and the entire continent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Later, the president visited the Italian community school in
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel to Implement Agreements Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, Palestine, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Referring to
Israel's new proposal on the second-phase troop withdrawal from
the West Bank, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman
Yasser Arafat today urged Israel to implement the signed
agreements between two sides over the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference after meeting visiting
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, Arafat said that the
signed agreements should be "implemented actually and honorably,
nothing more, nothing less."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he only adheres to the original Oslo
timetable, saying that "I'm not asking for the moon. I'm asking
only what has been signed and what has been agreed upon in the
White House."
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who had met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
Monday and will visit Egypt Wednesday, said that France will make
its efforts to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment proposal, by which Israel will transfer 6 to 8
percent of the West Bank, was push forward Sunday by Netanyahu on
condition that the third-phase pullout be suspended till the final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
And upon the completion of the second proposed redeployment,
the PNA would control 35 percent to 37 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed in January this year, Israel
had to complete its first-state and second-stage troops
redeployments in the West Bank by March 5 and September 7 of this
year respectively and the third-stage redeployment must be
completed by August of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have said that 90 percent of the West
Bank should be transferred to PNA by the time the two sides
approach final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But no official deployment was carried out by the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
And on another development, Israeli Military Intelligence chief
Moshe Ayalon told Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee today that Arafat believes that the United
States is sitting with him against Israel and he is artificially
slowing down the peace process in order to keep American pressure
on Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Islamic resistance group Hamas has not
given any commitment to PNA to refrain from terrorism, and it can
be expected to carry out new terror attacks if there is progress
in peace negotiations in order to torpedo it.

<HEADLINE> France Announces Closure of UNITA Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The French government
announced in Paris today the closure of UNITA's office in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Angola News Agency, the
decision was announced by French foreign ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The French government closed Demain Angola, the representative
office of Angola's former rebel movement in line with the United
Nations Security Council resolution to impose sanctions on the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The order will be published on the official newspapers in
recent days, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although its official name is not the UNITA office, Demain
Angola actually represents the former rebel movement, he noted.
</P>
<P>
France is the second European country after Portugal which has
closed UNITA office.
</P>
<P>
In view of UNITA's failure in accomplishing the tasks embodied
in the Lusaka Peace Accord, the U.N. Security Council adopted a
resolution on October 28 to impose sanctions on UNITA which
include the closing of UNITA's offices in foreign countries and
banning UNITA leaders from visiting abroad.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Offers Urgent University Funding amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Amid large-scale student
protests, Germany's federal government agreed today to provide 40
million marks (23 million U.S. dollars) in emergency fundings to
modernize the country's university libraries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bonn government also asked the local governments
of the country's 16 federal states to raise the same amount to
improve the financial situation of university libraries.
</P>
<P>
A proposal made by the Free Democratic Party, the junior
partner in Bonn's ruling coalition, to raise the country's 1998
education budget by 70 million marks (40 million dollars) to 15
billion (8.6 billion dollars) was rejected by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party during a parliament
debate today.
</P>
<P>
The decision on emergency university fundings was made as a
compromise to university students who have held large-scale
demonstrations in several German cities over the past few weeks in
protest against reductions in government education spendings.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, tens of thousands of students continued their
protests nationwide. A mass rally involving 20,000 to 30,000
students has also been planned on Thursday in Bonn.

<HEADLINE> Repatriatlion of Congolese Refugees Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of Congolese
refugees in Kigoma Region in northwest Tanzania has re-started
following improved security in the eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) suspended
the exercise late September because of the deterioration of the
security situation in the eastern part of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Exercise to repatriate 600 refugees started last Thursday aboard MV
Liemba vessel, said Anthony Moga, the repatriation officer in Kigoma
for UNHCR, according to a report by The Guardian today.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two governments held a meeting recently, at which
the Congolese side assured their hosts that the refugees would be safe if
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements are still being made with the Tanzanian Railways
Corporation to hire a second vessel, the MV Mwongozo, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, with a capacity of 800 seats, was undergoing repairs
in recent months and is now navigable. It is plying between Kigoma
and Mpulanga port in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,003 refugees had been repatriated by the time the
repatriation was suspended in late September. Approximately 51,400
out of the 74,000 Congolese refugees camped in Lugufu and Nyarugusu
in Kigoma Region had until last month registered themselves for
voluntary repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees have expressed willingness to go home, wishing
to start a new life after more than a year of warfare, Moga said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Wants Israel to Redeploy from Credible Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Egypt is closely following up Israel's
further redeployment offer and hopes that it covers "credible"
area.
</P>
<P>
"Such redeployment must involve a credible area to save off a
repetition of what happened in the first redeployment process,"
Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the Hebron agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) in January this year, Israel should have
completed the first stage pullback by March 7 this year, and the
second stage by September 7.
</P>
<P>
However, due to disagreement over the scope of the first stage
redeployment, the first and second stage pullbacks have been
delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Monday that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing a proposal to offer the PNA 6-8
percent of West Bank areas now under sole Israeli control in the
second phase of the three-stage pullbacks as stipulated in the
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
The figure was higher than the 2 percent previously offered by
the Israeli government but still far short of the 20 to 25 percent
Palestinians have demanded.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Oslo agreement provides for redeployment to
take place over three stages in accordance with maps A, B, C. In
this way, only a small part of land would be discussed at the
final stage along with the question of the refugees and Jerusalem,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, asked what good a meeting with Israeli envoys in Cairo
Wednesday could do, advised to "first listen to what they would
say before judging whether there was a serious offer to save the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dany Naveh and Uzi Arad, Netanyahu's
foreign policy advisor, will hold talks in Cairo with Egyptian
president's Political Advisor Osama el-Baz today and with Moussa
Wednesday, according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine's one-day visit to
Egypt Wednesday, Moussa said let wait and see what France would
offer for salvaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine's talks with Moussa will be based on the outcome of his
talks with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine has visited Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas
on his three-nation tour of the region. He will complete his
mission with another tour, scheduled to begin on January 12, which
will include Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

cooperate in regional gender activities from November 26 to 28,

benefits are shared, and each group's access to resources and
decision- making structures, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Implementing Iraqi-Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 25(Xinhua) -- Iraq today called for the
implementation of the Iraqi-Russian agreement reached on November
20, official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued after President Saddam Hussein chaired a
joint meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and the
National Command of the ruling Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted an official spokesman as saying following the
meeting that Iraq held that the Iraqi-Russian agreement on
November 20 should come into effect and that all its legitimate
demands should be met.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi-Russian agreement, Russia will actively
contribute -- provided that Iraq will implement the relevant
U.N. resolutions -- to getting the sanctions imposed on Iraq
lifted soon, and will seek to enhance the effectiveness of the
UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling mass
destruction weapons) taking in view Iraq's sovereignty and
security.
</P>
<P>
After a joint statement was issued according to the agreement,
Iraq allowed all the U.N. arms inspectors to return to Iraq to
resume their mission, ending a three-week crisis triggered by
Iraq's decision to expel U.S. inspectors in the U.N. inspection
teams.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that all aspects of the current political
situation were discussed at the meeting, adding that necessary
measures regarding the situation had been adopted. But he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. administration should learn the right lessons
from the recent events in order to keep Iraq, the United States,
the region and the world away from crises or perhaps disasters.
</P>
<P>
It is quite clear that any positive outcome to this end will
not be achieved unless the Unite States abandons its hostile
stance against a complete lifting of the embargo, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also called for the use of other surveillance planes used
by the UNSCOM so that the United States will not be the sole
country using the U-2 spy plane, said the spokesman.

LONDON, November 25 (Xinhua) - Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown unveiled this afternoon plans
for a major shake-up of Britain's tax and welfare
system.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a pre-budget consultation paper to
parliament, Brown said that Advanced Corporation tax
(ACT) would be abolished in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I can announce that in the budget the main rate of corporation
tax will be cut by 1 percent to 30 percent from April 1999," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor also called for restraint in wage,
saying, "the worst sort of short-termism would be to pay
ourselves more today at the cost of fewer jobs tomorrow".
</P>
<P>
"Wage responsibility is a price worth paying," Brown
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Government was determined to remove the
barriers to work facing those on welfare.
</P>
<P>
Among the changes would be a working families tax
credit "paid through the wage packet directly to families
on low income," the Chancellor added.
</P>
<P>
Brown also told MPs that from next April, every lone
parent coming onto benefit would be offered help to find
work.

<HEADLINE> Cameroonian Women Urged to Join in Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Cameroonian Minister of
Public Health Charles Etoundi has called on non-governmental
organizations to mobilize to take part in the fight against AIDS,
Radio Cameroon said today.
</P>
<P>
Etoundi was speaking in the economic capital Douala this
morning at the launching of activities marking the fifth National
AIDS Day to sensitizing the public on the HIV (AIDS virus) under
the theme: " effective implication of women and women's
associations in the fight against AIDS in Cameroon".
</P>
<P>
AIDS has been a major concern among the Cameroonian women. A
recent study indicates that 45 percent of prostitutes in Douala
are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The minister said women must be brought to the main stream of
the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
While launching the national sensitization day on the negative
effects of the HIV virus Monday in South Province, the minister
revealed that among the 1,485 number of declared AIDS cases in
1996 in Cameroon, 831 are women, that means 56 percent of the
patients are women. The most affected age group is between 18 and
25 years old.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the vulnerable ability of women
resulted from their extreme dependence on men, lack of education
and the lack of economic resources.
</P>
<P>
In Cameroon, provinces like the West, Northwest and Southwest
are the most hits.
</P>
<P>
The national sensitization activities came ahead of the World
AIDS Day to be celebrated on December 1. It will run from 24 to
29 of this month.
</P>
<P>
The sensitization is aimed at raising public awareness with
testimonies from HIV infected persons, exhibitions on the disease
and health talks.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government will not issue bonds in
December because of higher than expected earnings from the
privatization program, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli Finance Ministry as saying that

BEIRUT -- Lebanese Byblos Bank, one of the country's largest
banks, has agreed to a merger with Banque Beyrouth pour le
Commerce (BBC), a medium-sized bank, in a deal rumored to be worth
around 120 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A press report said today the move is the latest in a series
of central bank-sponsored consolidation in the country's banking
sector that has seen two other small banks selling up to larger
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The deal will result in a combined operation with a capital of
250 million U.S. dollars, and a market share of around 8 percent
of total deposits and 7.5 percent of loans, local newspaper the
Beirut Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Iskandar, director of Beirut-based rating agency Fins,
said smaller banks that incorporate into larger ones benefit from
services and technologies they find too expensive to develop on
their own.
</P>
<P>
The new bank, which retains the name Byblos, will become the
third largest bank in the country ahead of Banque Audi and behind
Banque du Liban et d'Outre-mer and Banque de la Mediterranee.
</P>
<P>
Byblos's profits are expected to top 30 million U.S. dollars
this year and its market capitalization is estimated in excess of
600 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Willing to Play Political Role in Asia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has an
interest and the capability to play a political role in Asia, said
a senior official of the 15-nation union today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of the European Institute for Asian
Studies, Emiliano Fossati, EU director for south and southeast
Asia relations, said that EU also has the will to take the
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The director was speaking on behalf of EU Vice-President Manuel
Marin who is responsible for the union's external relations.
</P>
<P>
Fossati told conference participants that it would be
unthinkable for Europe to underestimate the importance of Asia.
"China, India and Indonesia play a role on the world stage."
</P>
<P>
"Whether we look to Asian countries individually, or in the
context of a regional or global forum, it is clear that Asia's
voice must be heard in today's world, and in the discussion of the
global issues which will determine tomorrow's world," said the
director.
</P>
<P>
Asia is playing and must play an important role, according to
Fossati, in such fields as environment, global warming, terrorism,
drugs, international crime and United Nations reform.
</P>
<P>
Asia also has an essential role to play in helping establish a
new post-Cold War order, said Fossati, in contributing to
disarmament and confidence-building and in ensuring that China
integrates smoothly and confidently into the regional and global
scene.
</P>
<P>
Fossati cited as instruments for complementary dialogues the
established cooperation between EU and Asia in fields such as
science and technology and education as well as development
cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
He said that an increased mutual understanding can be achieved
as an increased emphasis is placed on Asia-Europe cooperation in
terms of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The European Union emphasized, in its 1994 decision on a new
strategy toward Asia, the importance of strengthening the union's
economic presence in Asia, of broadening political and economic
relations with Asia, of continuing to promote the development of
the less prosperous countries and regions and of contributing to
the spread of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The European Institute for Asian Studies held its two-day
annual conference here to fathom out to what extent EU member
states share a common perception regarding their relations with
and interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The institute, a non-profit association founded in July 1989,
aims at highlighting the importance of Asia in the future external
relations of the European Community and at developing a center of
expertise on contemporary Asian affairs and on relations between
European Community and its partners in Asia.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Calls for Humanitarian Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC) in Sierra Leone today complained that they have
failed to get humanitarian assistance as outlined by the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today at the State House in the capital
Freetown, a senior officer said that according to the timetable
which sets April next year as the deadline for it to step down,
there should have been the commencement of humanitarian
assistance on November 14.
</P>
<P>
"But we did not see any humanitarian assistance," he said, quoted
by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"It was not our fault," the officer added, reiterating that the
AFRC would continue to be fully committed to the peace agreement
signed in Conakry, Guinea last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, all people with guns in Sierra Leone will be
disarmed beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
But agreement has not been reached as to whether the armed forces
of the country should be disarmed between the AFRC and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The AFRC is also opposed to the dominance of Nigerian troops in the
west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) which is enforcing economic
sanctions against the junta.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate is in
Freetown to make preparations for the second phase negotiations
between the AFRC and the ECOWAS Committee of Five which represents the
sub-regional body to deal with the Sierra Leonean crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the AFRC official, an assessment team of the ECOWAS
committee should visit in Freetown Thursday to justify what should
be done.
</P>
<P>
The team should consist of Kouyate, ECOMOG Force Commander
Major-general Victor Malu, senior United Nations representatives and
some high-ranking Nigerian military officials.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the coordination between the UN and ECOWAS, both
imposing sanctions on the junta to force the restoration of the
legitimate government toppled in the coup.
</P>
<P>
On reports that the muscle building by the AFRC military junta, the
official said there are reports that ECOMOG is building up manoeuvre
and logistics, and transforming them between the occupation force in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It was more than enough for enforcing economic sanctions against the
country, he added.

<HEADLINE> ECO to Promote Cooperation Despite Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Onder Ozar said here
today that the organization would spare no efforts to promote
economic cooperation despite facing some serious difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ozar said that during the
coming years the ECO would focus its works on infrastructural
development in member states in order to pave the way for
regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Outline Plan adopted by the ECO members in
Almaty, the capital of Kazakhstan, in 1993, he said, the
organization will build a network of transportation and
communication and remove the barracks on the way of trade among
member states.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1964 as Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD)
and renamed in 1985, the ECO has ten members, namely Afghanistan,
Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Ozar said the ECO has made achievement in the construction of
railway and oil and gas pipelines in the ECO member states,
adding that transportation projects would help the inland
Central Asian countries to reach the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A new transit accord on simplification of custom and tariff
procedures would take effect next month in a bid to accelerate
transport of goods among the ECO members, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ECO secretary general admitted that the ECO was
facing some serious problems, including the lack of technical
know-how, financial and managerial means and foreign capitals.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need for ECO members to coordinate on their
national polices in order to promote their cooperation, saying
that the lack of necessary information about member states also
retains the development of economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The volume of total exports of the ECO members in 1995
registered at 61 billion U.S. dollars, he noted, but the figure
of exports among the ECO members stood at 3 billion dollars,
accounting for less than five percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ozar said that the ECO foreign ministers would hold a meeting
in Tehran next month on the sideline of the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) slated for December
9-11 to exchange views on the future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Ozar also stressed that the ECO would promote its functions
through cooperation with international and regional organizations
such as the United Nations, the OIC, the European Union and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Denies Being Attacked in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir, Egypt's national
flag-carrier, today refuted reports that the company's office in
Switzerland has been attacked by families of the victims in the
Luxor massacre, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted an official source of the company as saying
that EgyptAir's office in Zurich was not exposed to any violent
attack.
</P>
<P>
"Such rumors are circulated by biased parties with the aim of
undermining Egypt's tourism industry," said the source, whose name
was not given.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said, the Information Office in Geneva
canceled inauguration ceremony and a reception which are due to be
held Friday on the occasion of the opening of the two-week
Egyptian Cinema Festival in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation was decided because of the mourning in
Switzerland for the Swiss killed by Islamic militants on November
17 in Luxor, a tourist site 560 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Of the 58 foreign tourists gunned down by the militants in a
Pharaonic temple in Luxor, about 40 are Swiss nationals.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has warned its travelers to stay away from
Egypt. Two leading Swiss travel agents, Kuoni and Imholz, canceled
all holiday trips to Egypt for the next month.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,300 people have been killed in Egypt since 1992 when
the Islamic militants began to wage a war against the secular
government for establishing an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The Luxor massacre was the deadliest attack on foreigners by the
militants over the past decades with the aim to hit the country's
vital tourist industry.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Solution to Dispute Over Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its hope
that the dispute between the United Nations inspectors and Iraq
over inspection sites could be solved in a pragmatic manner.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman suggested that the U.N.
inspectors and Iraq solve their dispute through direct discussions
between the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the chairman of the
United Nations special commission on disarmament in Iraq (Unscom),
Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to interfere into these discussions because one
risks to diminish the chances that a reasonable and balanced
agreement be concluded," said foreign ministry spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Iraq continues to bar Unscom inspectors from 63 sites,
including President Saddam Hussein's numerous presidential
compounds. Baghdad today accused the United States of intending to
provoke a new crisis by insisting on the inspection of these
sites.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman suggested that the Unscom sign with Iraq an
agreement on inspection of "sensitive" sites, similar to an
agreement reached in 1996 between the Unscom and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tarek Aziz over inspection of "sensitive" and
presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1996 agreement does not seem to subject Iraqi
presidential compounds to inspections.

JERUSALEM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's monthly number of
unemployment reached an average of 179,000 during the third
quarter of the year, the highest since April 1994, latest official
figures show.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate reached 8.1 percent during the period, or
1.5 percentage point more than that a year ago, said a report of
Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics available today.
</P>
<P>
The report said over the past 12 months, the number of
unemployment has risen by 36,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report added that the civilian work force also
rose to 2,220,000 in the third quarter of this year from 2,173,000
in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his concern about the figures, Bank of Israel
Governor Jacob Frenkel advised the government Monday not to raise
taxes as part of its 1998 state budget package because this could
lead to stunted economic growth and increased number of
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Accuses Iraq of Evading Arms Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today continued his attack on Iraq, alleging that
Baghdad still evaded and deceived U.N. weapons inspectors in their
efforts to dismantle facilities of mass-destructive weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq continues to evade and deceive United Nations inspectors
who are working to destroy Iraq's program to build these weapons
of mass destruction," Cohen said at a news conference on the
occasion of releasing a Defense Department report.
</P>
<P>
The report described what the United States called the
international threat of proliferation of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and how the United States would respond to the
threat.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Iraq "may have produced" enough of the deadly
biological weapon VX and it could kill everyone on Earth.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam (Hussein) may have produced as much as 200 tons of VX.
And this would of course be theoretically enough to kill every
man, woman and child on the face of the Earth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said U.N. inspections on Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction would continue as long as it needs.
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term project. This is not something that is
going to be over in a very short period of time as Saddam Hussein
would like to believe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen repeated U.S. assertions that it wanted to exhaust all
diplomatic pressure on Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions before
resorting to military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Military force is always an option but it is something we
would reserve only as a last option," he said.
</P>
<P>
But once military force is used, it would not just be a
"pinprick" on Baghdad, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Meets Sudanese Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa met here today with John Garang, leader of Sudan's largest
rebel group, the Middle East News Agence reported today.
</P>
<P>
This meeting came as part of Egypt's consultations with Garang,
who arrived here Monday, and listen to his views.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters earlier today that different views of
Sudanese parties should be considered when the situation is
related to south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that Garang will hold talks with the opposition
leaders in northern Sudan for the first time in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Garang, leader of Sudan's main rebel group Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), is expected to meet with President Hosni
Mubarak during his first visit to Cairo, which is partly to brief
Egyptian leaders after the rebels' first peace talks in three
years with the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
Garang's visit came less than a month after Sudanese Vice
President el-Zubeir Mohammed Salih met with Mubarak here in a bid
to improve the strained ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Cairo and Khartoum virtually ground to a halt
after Egypt accused Sudan of involving in a 1995 assassination
attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, Sudan denied
the charge.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA led by Garang has been fighting against the Sudanese
government since 1983 to press for more independence for the
southern third of Sudan. So far, it has refused to sign peace
treaty with the government.

<HEADLINE> Greek Economy Praised for Significant Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece's economy has in the
past four years made significant progress towards participation in
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Greek National Economy
and Finance Minister Yannos Papantoniou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual economic conference which opened here
today, Papantoniou said that the country's inflation and the
fiscal deficit had dropped from 12.3 and 13.8 percentage points of
GDP in 1993-1994 to the present 4.7 and 4.2 percentage points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece's economic growth rate is running at 3
percent, with prospects of reaching 3.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that the public expenditure containment policy was
founded mainly on limiting public sector hiring and the decision
to merge and abolish public sector agencies would be completed
next year.
</P>
<P>
As for the recent international financial crisis and its
impacts on the Greek economy, he said that Greece had moved out of
the "high risk country" category and would soon belong to the "low
risk country" category.
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in interbank and deposits and loans rates
was temporary and the rates would soon return to their pre-crisis
levels, he said, but added that the policy of fortifying the
drachma, through raising interest rates, would be applied again if
necessary to protect the national currency.

<HEADLINE> UN Cyprus Envoy Calls for Turkish Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's
special envoy for Cyprus Diego Cordovez today urged Turkey to take
a flexible stance on the protracted Cyprus issue, the Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Turkish Deputy Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, Cordovez said that the U.N. hopes Turkey
would change its mind about the European Union (EU)'s involvement
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We wish the continuation of negotiations between the two
sides in Cyprus after the presidential elections in Greek Cypriot
side," Cordovez said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. representative indicated that rescinding Turkey's
objections to EU's accession talks with Cyprus will contribute to
the settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate objective of the U.N. is a bi-zonal federation
in Cyprus as a full EU member, he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU has embraced Cyprus into the ranks of the prospective
candidates for its enlargement process, in which Turkey was not
given a position.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a political, economic and military supporter of the
Turkish Cypriots, said that Cyprus has no right to apply for the
EU membership on behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the weak of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here late Monday, Cordovez made it clear that
the U.N. respect of the two sides in Cyprus does not mean that the
world body sees northern Cyprus as a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is only recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ecevit said that Turkey will do its best to help
the U.N. solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the Cyprus problem could only be
settled on the basis of recognizing the equal status of the two
sides, adding that Turkish Cypriots never give concessions on
principles.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the EU for preparing for accession
negotiations with the Cypriot government, describing it as a
fatal blow to the settlement to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N and international community have been making efforts
for a solution to the Cyprus, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Competitive in Switchboard Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has become competitive
in exporting program-controlled switchboards because of years of
effort in developing its own technology.
</P>
<P>
After a decade of research on program-controlled switchboards,
China not only can meet domestic demand but can also export to
developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, according
to Peng Xiaofang, an official with the Planning and Construction
Department of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the switchboards in the country's national
telecommunications network are made in China because of increased
market share by Chinese enterprises, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Six major producers in China can manufacture various types of
program-controlled switchboards, she said, catering to customers'
specific needs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese switchboards are competitive with overseas products,
and are superior technologically in some aspects, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
To support the export of switchboards, China should consider
providing financial services including a buyer's export credit to
the six Chinese manufacturers, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese manufacturers have won nearly 92 percent of orders for
switchboards this year, Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China will need program-controlled
switchboards with a total of at least 20 million lines in each of
the coming years, equal to the total number of switchboards now in
operation in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Population Growth to Fall to 1.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of
population in Pakistan is expected to drop by one percent to 1.7
percent over the next five years, Minister for Population Welfare
Syeda Abida Hussain said today.
</P>
<P>
The government has set the target of reducing the population
growth rate from 2.7 percent to 1.7 percent over the next five
years and the plan has won the backing of the National Assembly
which adopted a resolution last week in this regard, Abida told a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Abida admitted that Pakistan's 36-year-old population control
program had failed to achieve desired results as it lacked
political commitment.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution passed by the National Assembly,
Pakistan will promote the concept of two-child families by
providing incentives such as free education up to the university
level for children of such families.
</P>
<P>
Population education would be made part of the education
curriculum, she said. Similarly, functional and effective family
planning education should be introduced in the curriculum of
medical colleges and paramedical training institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mother and child health programs will be
strengthened and concerted efforts will be made to bring down
maternal and infant mortality rates, she said.
</P>
<P>
Abida said that skill development programs should be initiated
for women's economic empowerment and legislation should be enacted
to ensure equal opportunities for women and prevent
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
She also said that resources allocation for the government's
population plan must be enhanced and capable public functionaries
should be assigned to implement this plan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has the fastest population growth rate in the region
and is the seventh most populous country in the world with a
population of 140 million.
</P>
<P>
On average, a Pakistani family has six children, according to
Abida. If no adequate steps are taken, Pakistan would become the
fifth most populous country in the world by the turn of the
century.

<HEADLINE> IAEA Participates in Arms Inspections in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) team today took part in the arms inspections
carried out by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Iraqi News Agency
(INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA team arrived here Tuesday on a 10-day monitoring
mission, the INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Amin, Director General of
Iraq's National Surveillance Department (the Iraqi counterpart
of the UNSCOM), as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Amin, 13 teams belonging to the UNSCOM inspected
today 19 sites in Iraq. They received "complete cooperation and
support" from their Iraqi counterparts in charge of the sites
they visited, Amin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that cameras and radars were used during the
inspections. He termed the U.S. accusations that Iraq possesses
forbidden weapons as "lies."
</P>
<P>
Since they resumed their work on November 22, the UNSCOM arms
inspection teams have inspected 65 sites inside and outside
Baghdad, and no problem has arisen between Iraqi authorities and
the inspection teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraqi newspaper Al-Jomhouriya stressed that Iraq
would not allow the UNSCOM arms inspection teams to get into the
Iraqi sites which symbolize Iraq's national sovereignty. It
called on the U.N. Security Council to implement its resolutions
which stipulate that Iraq's national sovereignty should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions, which barred Iraq from exporting
oil, its economic mainstay, cannot be lifted unless the arms
inspectors verify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of
mass destruction in accordance with U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Release 500 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei today announced that he had agreed to
release 500 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs), Iranian official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to release the group of Iraqi POWs was made by
President Mohammad Khatami in a letter to Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that he made the proposal as a "humanitarian
measure" to mark the "Eid-e Mabas" on Friday, the anniversary of
Islamic Prophet Muhammad's appointment as the last messenger of
God.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exchange of the POWs of the 1980-88 war
between the two countries had been far delayed due to the lack of
cooperation by the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the humanitarian nature of the issue, we hope that
the release of the POWs during this auspicious occasion would
herald the final conclusion of the issue," he said, also
expressing hope that the Iraqi government would fully cooperate to
solve the problem of POWs.
</P>
<P>
However, the IRNA did not mention when and how the Iraqi POWs
would be released.
</P>
<P>
Iranian has claimed that some 15,000 Iranian POWs were still
held in Iraq and accused the Iraqi government of making no
response to Iran's humanitarian measures of releasing Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi side repeatedly dismissed the allegation of
any Iranian POWs in Iraq. Charge d'affaires of Iraqi embassy in
Iran Salah Noori Samarmad earlier this month claimed that Iraq had
released all Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people were killed in the eight-year war
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Gong Xiaobin Scores 49 Points to Lead Shandong's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Gong Xiaobin scored a
season-high 49 points to lead Shandong Flaming Bulls to a 88-78
victory over Lianhang Eagles in the China Basketball Association
League second-round match here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Ducks wildly beat last season's runners-up Liaoning
Hunters 81-80 when American guard Marlin missed the last free
throw after he shot a three-point just before the buzz to run the
game into extra-time.
</P>
<P>
Gong, winner of Best Technique Award last season, added four
boards for Shandong's second straight win in the road. He shot 27
of Shandong's 38 points in the second half to keep his team, the
fourth in 1996-97 season, from a 8-26 surge of opponents with 3:15
minutes to run.
</P>
<P>
"He played hard and he was spectacular," Shandong's coach Ye
Peng said of Gong after the tie.
</P>
<P>
Liu Tie, one of last year's All-Star players, contributed
triple three-points and a jumper of his 15 in the late comeback of
Lianhang. Hu Haidong added double three-points and Liu Jingbin,
draining the highest 19 points in his team, ended the match with
his team's sixth three-point in the last three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Ji Minshang fueled a 34-13 run with a layup and a free throw of
his 14 to give an early lead to Shandong, who finished the first
half with 50-25.
</P>
<P>
Although five of Lianhang scored double-point in their debut in
the Shijingshan Stadium, the Air-Force team shot much lower from
the field (32-73) than their rivals (37-64).
</P>
<P>
"We succeeded in blocking the quicker Lianhang and played a
impressive half," Ye said. "But we failed to stop their
three-points in the second."
</P>
<P>
Lianhang's coach Chen Daohong, former head coach of China's
women national basketball team, said: "Our players were too much
nervous in the opening half, but we made it better when we came
back."
</P>
<P>
The other Wednesday's highlight in Beijing saw Liaoning almost
snapping a 24 points deficit (30-54) in the second half as they
tying the game at 77-77, but failing to make advantage on
Beijing's seemingly-fatal mistake.
</P>
<P>
Shan Tao scored the game-high 23 points and Ba Teer added 17
boards for Beijing. Marlin shot 11 free throws of his 20.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other matches, Shanghai Oriental edged Jiangsu
Dragons 84-81, Guangdong Tigers trounced Shenyang Army Lions
85-59, August First Rockets downed Jinan Pegasus 80-68 and Sichuan

<HEADLINE> Noted Writer Celebrates 94th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ba Jin, the most prominent
living writer in China's modern literature, celebrated his 94th
birthday Tuesday in a Shanghai hospital.
</P>
<P>
In a large reception room of the hospital, the silver-haired
literary master met with guests, wearing a new light-yellow coat
and sitting in a wheelchair. He appeared paler and fatter than
when he last appeared in public in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen Changben, a member of the secretariat of the Chinese
Writers' Association, brought news from Beijing that construction
on the Museum of Chinese Modern Literature is under way.
</P>
<P>
Ba, who initiated the museum's construction, donated most of
his lifetime savings and all royalties he receives to its
construction.
</P>
<P>
"This museum is what I most care about now," Ba said. "I wish I
could be there when it is finished."
</P>
<P>
Chen invited Ba to Beijing for the museum's ribbon-cutting when
the first phase of construction is completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ba's family sources said that the old man, obviously in high
spirits, ate a small bowl of spicy noodles for lunch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Noodles, symbol of longevity, are traditional birthday food for
Chinese, while spicy foods are favored by Ba's home province in
southwestern China -- Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Sources within the publishing houses said that the 10-volume
"Complete Works of Ba Jin's Translation" and a collection of Ba's
letters to friends would soon be released to mark his birthday.
</P>
<P>
A native of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, Ba's real
name is Li Feigan. He has written novels, short stories, prose and
essays.
</P>
<P>
His most famous works include "Family," "Spring," "Autumn,"
"The Trilogy of Love," "A Dream of Sea" and "Autumn in
Spring". After the 10-year Cultural Revolution, he published the
retrospective work, "A Record of Random Thinking."
</P>
<P>
Ba is one of the few writers in China who lives not on
government pay but on royalties only. On his 80th birthday he
said: "I've lived on royalties all my life. It is the readers who
have supported me."

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns Turkey on Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia would consider a cause
of war an attempt by Turkey to prevent the transfer to Cyprus of
S-300 Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles, a senior Russian
diplomat has warned.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Georgi Muradov said according to
international law, when a country bombards another country's ships
this is considered a "casus belli."
</P>
<P>
Muradov made the remarks Tuesday night at a Larnaca Rotary
Club gathering, radio of the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat had earlier this year warned Turkey of
"casus belli" in response to the Turkish threat not to allow
ships carrying the missiles through the Bosporus Strait.
</P>
<P>
Muradov said his country would in no way confine its military
cooperation with the legitimate government of Cyprus, noting that
the current situation in Cyprus did not result from the deal to
purchase the missiles but from the 1974 Turkish invasion and the
continued partial occupation of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 23 years ago when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government signed a contract early this year with
Russian manufacturers for the purchase of surface-to-air S-300
missiles, scheduled to be deployed by mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> International Aid Agencies Evacuate from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Three international aid
agencies have evacuated their international staff to Nairobi
Tuesday following the abduction of two Italian agronomists from
Deganley Village, 25 km north of the capital by Somali gunmen
three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers serving the agencies of MSF-Spain, CISP (Italian)
and the French aid agency ACF, were relocated temporarily to the
neighboring country of Kenya in protest against the brief
abduction and looting of the office appliances of Cooperazione
Italiano Nord-Sud (CINS) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two abducted men were later released after clan elders and
politicians intervened with the matter.
</P>
<P>
The expatriate workers of the three agencies began evacuating
on Monday and continued until yesterday with a large escort to
the Issaley Airstrip, 15 km north of the Somali capital, where a
small chartered plane of European Union was awaiting.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources also said that the agencies were annoyed
by the imposition of a new tax on their vehicles crossing the
green line that divides Mogadishu. They confirmed that the
factional gunmen controlling the checkpoints across the green
line have asked the aid agencies to pay 10 U.S. Dollars for each
vehicle crossing the line.
</P>
<P>
So far, a few agencies including those who relocated their
staff have rejected paying any such fees which they consider as
extortion money. Instead, they have chosen to use two vehicles
when crossing the green line, one in north Mogadishu to bring the
staff to the green line and the other in south Mogadishu to pick
them up.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in north Mogadishu, home for most of
the aid workers, has been worsening ever since the Sharia Islamic
Courts collapsed late last year.
</P>
<P>
This new evacuation was prompted by farmland dispute between
two armed Somali groups within the supporters of Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, which has claimed the lives of nine people and wounded
nine others. The fighting between the two groups have spread to
the headquarters of CINS in Deganley village thus causing the
abduction of the two Italian workers and the death of two of its
local staff.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers' evacuation is taking place at a time when the
humanitarian agencies are most needed in the country due to the
heavy rains and floods that devastated especially the southern
and central regions of the country. More than 1,300 people are
believed to have died in the waters and nearly half a million
people are made homeless since the rainy Deyr season began more
than a month ago.

<HEADLINE> Russia Supports Increasing Iraq's Oil Export Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia stands for raising the
efficiency of implementing the U.N. Security Council's "oil for
food" resolution on Iraq, Russian Foreign Ministry's spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that first of all Iraq should be given an
opportunity to spend the revenues from oil sales more actively on
buying food, medicines and other humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
For this, all bureaucratic barriers hampering the acceptance of
applications for humanitarian goods supplies to Iraq by the
U.N. sanctions committee should be removed, Nesterushkin said.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, while discussing ways to improve the mechanism
of the "oil for food" resolution, it should consider the
possibility of increasing the oil export quotas on for Iraq in
order to enlarge the volume of purchased humanitarian goods for
the Iraqi population suffering from an almost seven-year economic
blockade.
</P>
<P>
Moscow strongly opposes the curtailment of the U.N.
humanitarian operations in Iraq and will not change this basic
position, Nesterushkin said.
</P>
<P>
The "oil for food" resolution was adopted in December 1996 and
extended in June 1997. In accordance with it, Baghdad is allowed
to export, for six months, crude oil and petroleum products worth
2 billion U.S. dollars and use the money to buy first-necessity
goods from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Russian companies had concluded contracts on supplying Iraq
with sugar, tea, dry milk and hyjgiene means.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Likely to Complete Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian mines minister
Christon Tembo said here today that the privatization of the
country's copper mines is likely to end by the first quarter of
next year.
</P>
<P>
He told a news briefing that about 130.5 million U.S. dollars
has been raised so far out of the four packages of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) that have been privatized so
far.
</P>
<P>
He described the on-going privatization process as successful
and said that the donor community is happy with the pace.
</P>
<P>
Kansanshi copper mines in Northwest province was offered for
sale to Cyprus Anax of the United States at a cash consideration
of 28 million dollars, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Luanshya mine was offered for sale to Binani Industries of
India at a cash consideration of 35 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Power division was offered for sale to Copperbelt Energy
Consortium comprising two British companies at a cash
consideration of 50 million dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have been no retrenchments in the mines
that have been privatized except at the power division.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said the privatization will not affect miners employment
and social services like schools, hospitals and sports
facilities, adding that the facilities will continue to be there.
</P>
<P>
The copper mine privatization is expectd not only to
resuscitate the ailing copper production but also to boost the
economic growth of the related sectors, which supply the mines
with various goods and services. The copper mining production
earns the country 80 percent of its exporting earnings.

"Modern scientific and technological means should be adopted in
research and education," Li said.
</P>

<P>
LUANDA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The "Week for the Disabled"
was launched today in the Angolan capital Luanda in a bid to draw
concern from the whole society to the disabled group.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Ivo Ferreira de Jesus, an official
from the organizing committee of the campaign, urged all people
in the country to work together in solving the problems facing
the disabled and to protect them in their interests.
</P>
<P>
Despite much efforts in this regard, the situation now facing
the disabled people is quite worrisome due to the limited job
opportunities for them, he said.
</P>

Jesus believed that a law should be adopted to ensure disabled
people the rights to employment, study and living.

<P>
The week-long activity sponsored by government institutions
and some organizations for the disabled, includes lectures,
visits, sports games so as to arouse more concern to the problems

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno departed Tuesday for an
official trip to Mexico without announcing whether she would ask
for independent prosecutors to investigate fund-raising telephone
calls by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Ms.Reno has until December 2 to decide whether to refer the
matter to outside counsels, although her senior advisers have
recommended that she reject that option, Government officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The 18 leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum declared support for international rescue packages for the
troubled economies of the three member states and any others that
might need it.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- D.C. Police Chief Larry D. Soulsby resigned Tuesday, less
than two hours before the police lieutenant with whom he shared a
cut-rate luxury apartment was charged with extorting money from
married men who frequented gay bars.
</P>
<P>
-- The Administration rounded out its lists of negotiators for
next week's international conference on global warming.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal

The top U.N. inspector is to go to Iraq soon to seek access to
presidential palaces Baghdad has ruled off limits. Iraq's foreign

improprieties. The government-formed Independent Review Board's

divert union funds to his 1996 election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Urged to Contribute to Housing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President
Simon Muzenda today challenged commercial banks, insurance
companies and pension funds to finance housing development
programs to reduce the acute shortage of accommodation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the five-day National Housing Convention in
Zimbabwe's northern resort town of Victoria Falls, Muzenda said
the government strongly felt that financial institutions had an
obligation to contribute to the housing needs of the people,
since their profits came from the people's contributions.
</P>
<P>
Although the government created a housing fund to provide
affordable loans to local authorities in the early 1980s, by 1988
it became clear that the state alone could not cope with housing
needs in urban areas due to the extensive rural migration to
urban areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president noted that any housing development could
not be sustainable without the participation of the indigenous
people who had been marginalized for decades.
</P>
<P>
"The government needs the contribution of the private sector
in terms of capital, expertise and technology for economic
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has an urban housing backlog of 670,000 units, which
has been projected to reach 1.1 million units by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The National Housing Convention, which is being attended by
more than 150 participants from the government, private sector
and local authorities, is seeking to solve the problem of housing
in both urban and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> GCC Foreign Ministers' Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory meeting
for next month's summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states ended here today with what Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah described as "positive results."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah, chairman of the GCC foreign ministers' meeting,
said in a statement that "I am pleased to express my happiness in
reaching positive results which will be reflected in the important
recommendations that will be submitted to their excellencies the
leaders in their meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we held elaborate discussions on a number of
economic issues, and relevant recommendations were taken in this
regard for reference to the next summit."
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman held their 65th round
of four closed-door sessions at Kuwait's Bayan Palace from
Tuesday to Wednesday since the regional political and economic
alliance was founded in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah told the foreign ministers that "your
accomplishments will support our march toward a framework which
is unified and harmonious in its points of view and ideas."
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministers agreed that a plan proposed by
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah to set up a GCC
Consultative Council (Shura) allowing experts from all walks of
life in the six countries to raise recommendations for integrated
regional developments would be referred to the GCC leaders during
their forthcoming summit.
</P>
<P>
On regional issues, Sheikh Sabah said that the foreign
ministers discussed the Middle East peace process and they called
on the United States to exert pressures on the Israeli government
led by Benjamin Netanyahu to abide by previously signed
agreements with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah said the ministers expressed hope that the
GCC-Iranian relations, which were strained over the past two
decades and started to warm up this year, would improve in
the future for the interests of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC foreign ministers shared the same concern over
Iraq's non-compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions
related to Iraq, noting that the GCC leaders held that the only
way for Iraq to alleviate hardships of the Iraqi people was with
full adherence to these resolutions.

country's development process due to its impact on the health of
the people.

Penza said the Zambian government believes that through
provision of clean water the health of the nation would be
ensured and thus productivity, as a healthy nation is a
productive nation.

HANGZHOU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of

requirements for the official use of telephones were urged
beginning next year.

mobile telephones purchased at public expense.
</P>
<P>
With the province's economic development, the use of mobile
telephones has become widespread among government officials and

labor activist leader Kwon Young-gil, is expected to join the race
to compete with the major three.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts predict that the presidential election
scheduled for December 18 will be a competition between "two
strong ones and one medium," which refers to Kim Dae-jung, Lee
Hoi-chang and Rhee In-je.
</P>
<P>
Under the revised election law, massive outdoor campaign
rallies will be banned, and the major three candidates will
instead appeal for support through television debates beginning
today, which will help lower the huge amount of money spent on
rallies.
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic crisis, mainly resulting from the sharp
fall in value of South Korea's won currency, is expected to be a
major campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
A former Supreme Court judge, Lee, 62, backed by Cho Soon, a
former Seoul mayor and a respected professor of economics at the
Seoul National University, is promising to achieve "clean politics
and a powerful economy."
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader Kim, who is making his fourth bid for the
presidency at the age of 72, is claiming that a transfer of power
to the opposition is the best solution to overcoming the economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Rhee, 49, a former Kyonggi Province governor who is the
youngest of the three candidates, is stressing the need for a
change in the nation's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
The election contrasts with previous ones in that the ruling
camp has been divided into two groups supporting Lee and
Rhee. Splits were the trademark of the opposition during the
previous presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that an opposition candidate has
maintained a lead over his rivals in popularity in the run-up to
the election.
</P>
<P>
The latest popularity surveys conducted separately by seven
major dailies and television networks showed opposition leader Kim
is still in lead with a static 35 percent support rating.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim appears to have so far failed to increase his
ratings to 40 percent or more which would ensure his victory in
the election, despite his alliance with Kim Jong-pil's
conservative United Liberal Democrats and recruitment of Park
Tae-joon, an effective figure in the country.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the polls showed that Lee has become Kim's closest
rival, with his approval ratings rising to more than 30 percent,
two to five percentage points more than Kim's.
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose approval rating once sharply dropped to less than 20
percent due to allegations about his son's attempts to avoid
military service, dramatically regained popularity and surpassed
Rhee's following his New Korea Party's merger with the opposition
Democratic Party led by Cho Soon.
</P>
<P>
Since Rhee resigned from the New Korea Party to run the
election after his failure to get the party's nomination, his
support rating has begun to plunge because both the NKP and the
NCNP accused his party, led by President Kim Young-sam, of
influencing the public polls in favor of Rhee.

<HEADLINE> UNDP, Zimbabwe Sign Civil Service Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The UNDP and the Zimbabwean
Ministry of the Public Service Labour and Social Welfare
concluded here today a 56 million Zimbabwe dollars (four million
U.S. dollars) technical assistance support programme for the
second phase of the Zimbabwe civil service reform programme.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, UNDP resident representative Carlos
Lopes said, "to consolidate the gains made to date on the civil
service reforms programme (CSRP), the Zimbabwe government is to
launch the second phase of its public service change management
reforms."
</P>
<P>
It was hoped, he said, that the successor reform programme
would help enhance the re-definition of the role of the
government in market-based economic system.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the new programme will continue the change
management training and capacity building activities through
various initiatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNDP was convinced that civil service reforms were paramount
instruments for enhancing the capacity of the public sector to
effectively implement broad national development programmes with
poverty reduction bias.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Lopes said, UNDP was fully committed to
supporting the Zimbabwe government's public sector reforms and
capacity building processes.

<HEADLINE> HK PLC Completes Second Reading of Fund Schemes Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) today completed the first and second
readings of the Provident Fund Schemes Legislation (Amendment)
Bill 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bill was tabled by Rafael Hui Si-yan, secretary for
Financial Services of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Hui called on members of the PLC to support the bill because
the mandatory provident fund schemes can provide most of the
workers in Hong Kong with economic guarantees after their
retirement.
</P>
<P>
The bill was drafted on the basis of the Mandatory Provident
Fund Schemes Ordinance adopted in August 1995 by the then
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance ruled that both the employees and their employers
hand in every month an amount of money that is worth five percent
of the monthly incomes of the employees to join the provident
fund. The employees can get the money back after their retirement.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the government has made efforts to draft
the detailed provisions of the mandatory provident fund schemes,
Hui said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the government has set up an official
consultation framework which includes a 13-member Consultation
Committee and a 22-member Professional Committee in an effort to
make the schemes practical and effective.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to complete the third reading of the bill in this
legislative year and put the mandatory provident fund schemes into
operation from 1999," Hui said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Ministerial Meeting Opens in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) opened its 103rd Ministerial Meeting
here this evening with delegates from 11 OPEC member countries
attending.
</P>
<P>
The delegates will discuss the organization's administration
and finance as well as the agenda for the six-day meeting after a
simple opening ceremony at the Dharmawangsa Hotel in the south of
Jakarta, meeting sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, an increase in OPEC's production
ceiling and preparations for a conference on climate changes will
be the main topics of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some OPEC members have proposed to raise the production ceiling
from the current 25.033 million barrels per day (bpd) to 27
million bpd. But other members said OPEC should maintain its
production quota at the current level.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members will participate in the Third Conference of the
Parties (COP) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change,
which begins in Kyoto, Japan, next week.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto meeting is expected to adopt "a protocol or another
legal instrument" for restricting greenhouse gas emissions beyond
the year 2000 by the richer countries of the world, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
OPEC has expressed grave concern about the COP's outcome, which
may include the widespread introduction of emission-reduction
measures, which, in turn, could have a serious economic impact on
fossil fuel producers.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting will also discuss the organization's
restructuring, oil price development and oil production of member
countries, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will hold closed-door sessions and bilateral
consultations starting tomorrow and the result of their
discussions will be announced on December 1 at the closing
session, sources at the meeting's secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC groups Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Iraq,
Gabon and Ecuador, but the last two members are not attending the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Latvian President on Latvia's Russian Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Latvian President Guntis
Ulmanis said that he plans to continue to fight for Latvia's
Russian population to become Latvian citizens despite criticism
from parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ulmanis made these remarks in an interview to Swedish newspaper
Svenska Dagbladet during his two-day visit to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The present Latvian law on citizenship allows only a few
generations of Latvian Russians to apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Ulmanis said that although aware of the importance of political
stability, he wanted to see the start of a discussion on this
problem.
</P>
<P>
The president is leading a campaign for early negotiations to
join the EU and underlines the importance of flexibility on the
part of the EU, which only admitted Estonia in the first round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU based its exclusion of Latvia on old facts
and figures when the country found itself in the midst of a bank
crisis and had yet to begin privatizing.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's proposal to form a Russian-Baltic pact,
Ulmanis said that this is a surprise, and he admitted that this
brings back bad memories for all three Baltic states, but he
supported cooperation with Latvia's neighbors on other levels.
</P>
<P>
According to Ulmanis, Latvia is applying for membership of
NATO, but spends the least among the three Baltic states on
defense.
</P>
<P>
He maintains that Latvia does not feel threatened but wants to
join NATO in order to avoid conflicts in the next century.

<HEADLINE> China, Italy Stress Economic and Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
in Beijing today that China is willing to expand its economic and
trade cooperation with Italy and welcomes Italian enterprises to
set up joint ventures or exclusively funded projects here.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during a meeting with Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini and Foreign Trade Minister Augusto
Fantozzi, who presided over the opening ceremony of a large
exhibition sponsored by the Italian government Tuesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his belief that the exhibition, "Italy Today,"
will play an active role in deepening mutual understanding between
people of the two countries and in stimulating bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Italy enjoys an advanced industry which covers well-known big
enterprises as well as small- and medium-sized companies in fields
such as light industry and textiles, the premier said, which makes
them competitive in the world market. China is willing to continue
to increase its economic and trade cooperation with Italy on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, while currently pushing forward its
socialist modernization drive, is increasing its economic, trade,
and technical cooperation with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation is possible between not only large
enterprises but also small ones, Li said, adding that the Chinese
government will grant preferential treatment to those cooperating
in high-tech and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the world is speeding up its pace towards
multi-polarism, the European Union (EU) is playing a significant
role in world issues. China is willing to strengthen its friendly
co-operation with all EU countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the relationship between Italy and China has been
very close. More than 300 enterprises are participating in the
exhibition, which demonstrates that the government as well as the
business community of Italy is optimistic about the Chinese
market, and active in cooperating with China, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
These entrepreneurs will consult with their Chinese
counterparts and seek to expand their cooperative means during
their stay, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dini stressed that Italy is willing to advance bilateral
cooperation in various sectors.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Seizes 36.5 Kilograms of Pure Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police seized 36.5
kilograms of pure heroin in eastern Turkey, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that acting on a tip-off, Turkish police teams
belonging to Van and Malatya Security Directorates found the drug
in a truck from Yuksekova town of Hakkari province bordering Iran.
</P>
<P>
The police followed and stopped the truck near Kurubas village
and found 36.5 kilograms of pure heroin in their search, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
The police detained driver in connection with the drug
trafficking, added the agency.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish police have also seized 231 kilograms of hashish in
southeast of the country in their recent operations, according to
a statement issued today by the Diyarbakir Security Directorate.
</P>
<P>
The drug was also seized after searching a vehicle driven by a
drug smuggler and arrested him with his accomplice when they
buried a bag of hashish near the highway linking Diyarbakir and
Mardin.
</P>
<P>
The police also raided the village of Guvercinlik in Diyarbakir
and confiscated 10 bags of hashish, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, Turkey has been a major country through
which drug traffickers carry their goods from drug producers in
Afghanistan onto Europe. In 1996, Turkey seized 4.4 tonnes of
heroin, accounting for 40 percent of the world's total haul, 12.3
tonnes of hashish, 233 kilograms of opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine
and 1,157 kilograms of base morphine.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
here today with Pierre Osho, Minister of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation of Benin.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Chinese government attaches importance to its
relations with Benin and other western African countries, Li said
that relations between the two countries have proceeded smoothly
in 25 years of their bilateral diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have cooperated in international
affairs, adding his appreciation for Benin's "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and Benin -- following the principles of equality,
reciprocity and common development -- have conducted sincere and
friendly cooperation, and China is satisfied with the smooth
progress in bilateral economic and trade cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China had provided Benin with economic aid, and
that it will continue to offer such support for Benin's economy
within its capacity.
</P>
<P>
China's aid is limited, which is only an expression of the
Chinese people's friendship toward the people of Benin, said Li,
pointing out that in the future enterprises of the two countries
should be the mainstay in bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's reform of its policy on providing aid for foreign
countries offers new opportunities for business communities of the
two countries, Li said, and that the Chinese government actively
encourages China's enterprises to explore cooperation with their
Benin counterparts.
</P>
<P>
If a project is profitable and can meet the demands from both
sides, China will take it into consideration with a positive
attitude, said Li, who also expressed his hope that the Benin
government can support the joint ventures of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Osho said that Benin and China have a traditional friendship,
which is deeply rooted in the Benin people, and his country will
make its efforts for strengthening bilateral friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Li on the third meeting of bilateral economic
and trade mixed committee between China and Benin.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his satisfaction with the results of the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Wednesday unveiled stock market pump-priming measures calling for
infusion of cash to help arrest rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Financial and Economy Minister Lim Chang-yuel said that from
Thursday on banks will be instructed to use their trust funds to
buy shares, and allow trust-investment companies to liberalize
interest rates of securities-related deposits in order to expand
the base of equity investment.
</P>
<P>
He also said trust-investment companies will be allowed to
establish spot funds of about 2 trillion won (1.8 billion
U.S. Dollars) to invest in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The minister will authorize trust and investment companies to
deal with bonds under repurchase agreement to help them bolster
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The minister expects the boosting package to clear the way for
the inflow of about 3-4 trillion won into sagging stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul bourse has been falling in recent days and the
interest rates have increased with the yield for three-year
maturity bonds shooting up to 18 percent, market dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the arrival of chief International Monetary
Fund (IMF) delegate Hubert Neiss in Seoul today, bilateral
negotiations over the amount and terms of emergency bailout loans
appeared set to get into full swing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first contingency of IMF delegates has been engaged in
their fact-finding works at the Ministry of Finance and Economy
for the third day, screening over 70 kinds of detailed financial
statements of domestic banks, merchant banks and stock brokerages.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF delegates asked intensive questions over how the
government-initiated bad debt liquidation and depositor insurance
funds will work," said Kim Woo-suk, a spokesman for the Korean
delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to the government officials, the IMF bailout is
expected to arrive here in the middle of next month.

<HEADLINE> Tokuyo City Bank in Japan Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Tokuyo City Bank, a second-tier
regional bank based in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, today became the
fourth financial institution in Japan to collapse this month.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which is burdened by huge bad loans, announced it had
abandoned efforts to restructure and would hand over operations to
Sendai Bank, another regional bank, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry announced today that
they would extend special loans to protect customers who have
accounts with the failed bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that another financial institution has
collapsed, but we have secured protection of bank transactions and
all savings," Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We will take all measures to avoid this from spreading,"
Mitsuzuka said.
</P>
<P>
Tokuyo City Bank, which deals mainly with medium-sized and
small enterprises, was burdened with about 59 billion yen (about
465 million dollars) in bad loans at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Because market confidence in Japanese financial institutions
has declined since the November 1996 bankruptcy of Hanwa Bank, a
regional bank in Wakayama, western Japan, Tokuyo City Bank has
been faced with massive deposit withdrawals, banking sources said.
</P>
<P>
The recent collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co. also had a
negative impact on Tokuyo by making it more difficult to secure
operating funds on the money market, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Tokuyo is the fourth financial institution to collapse in Japan
following Sanyo Securities Co., Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and
Yamaichi Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
The Tokuyo City Bank situation reflects the recent declining
confidence in the Japanese financial system weighing on smaller
financial institutions, the banking sources said.

the general managers of the MMDA and the two water companies in an
effort to tackle the water shortage caused by the El Nino
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Through the hotline, the MMDA will coordinate with the
companies in monitoring and reporting water abuse, illegal
connections and leakage in the city.
</P>
<P>
Due to the drought brought about by El Nino, water supply to
Metro Manila has been reduced by 10 percent and will have another
cut of 18 percent before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
If the situation continues to worsen, the water supply in the
city will be limited to two to three hours a day until the rainy
season comes in July next year, the MMDA said earlier.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Renew Ties with Arab: Zyuganov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov said here today that Russia is ready to renew its
ties with the Arab world and wishes to benefit from Cairo's
experience in its 16 years of reform.
</P>
<P>
"The scene is now set for promoting Russia's ties with Arab
states, particularly Egypt," he told reporters after talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on bilateral ties and Egypt's
economic reform, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia is keen on contributing to projects in Egypt, said
Zyuganov, adding that a fund for cooperation and friendship
between Russia and Arab states has been set up.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov arrived here Monday for a three-day visit, and would
leave here today for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Zyuganov held discussions with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa on the stalled Middle East peace process and
the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the agency that Russia is
satisfied with its efforts to contain the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last week accepted a Russian proposal to allow the United
Nations arms experts back to continue their mission of eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Russia in return would work for the lifting of the crippling
economic sanctions the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Foreign Nuclear Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An official at the China
National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) says that construction work on
the Guangdong Province's Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station, which
started in May, has provided 20,000 job opportunities for the
French and that China too has benefited from the co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay nuclear power station in Guangdong Province was
the first example of Sino-foreign nuclear technology
co-operation. It began operation for commercial purposes in 1994,
with a capacity six times that of the Qinshan nuclear power
station.
</P>
<P>
It provided 20 percent of the electricity needed by Guangdong
and Hong Kong, an amount equal to the energy provided by six
million tons of coal a year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, two more nuclear power stations have
been built with Sino-foreign co-operation in energy-starved
eastern China, the CNNC says.
</P>
<P>
One senior representative of France's Matra Datavision Corp.,
one of China's biggest nuclear technology suppliers, said at a
recent meeting in Hunan Province that some of the software
developed by the French company can be used for other sectors like
aviation and machinery and is practical.
</P>
<P>
An executive with the U.S.'s Westinghouse says the company is
interested in co-operating with China and that the nuclear reactor
made in the U.S. is just what China needs, the question is when to
export it to China.
</P>
<P>
China currently has nuclear technology co-operation with
France, Canada, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that if China wants to raise the capacity of
its nuclear power stations to 20 million KW in 2010, it will need
60 billion U.S. dollars worth of equipment and technology.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Proposal for Safe Use of Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today adopted a proposal for
an action plan on promoting the safe use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The plan, covering the years from 1998 to 2001, identifies the
main areas where the Commission believes concrete measures are
needed and could be supported by the EU, says a press release
issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a European network of centers, known as hot
lines, will be created to allow users to report content which they
come across during their use of the Internet and which they
consider to be illegal.
</P>
<P>
The plan points out that self regulation and content-monitoring
schemes should be developed by access providers, content providers
and network operators.
</P>
<P>
The plan urges for internationally compatible rating and
filtering schemes to be used to protect users, especially children
against "undesirable" content.
</P>
<P>
It envisages measures to increase awareness of the
possibilities available among parents, teachers, children and
other consumers and help them choose the "appropriate" content
while surfing the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, northeastern Liaoning, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Dalian
Wanda extended its unbeaten record to 50 games in China's
professional soccer league after beating Sichuan Quanxin 4-0 here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dalian, which now has 42 points with six rounds remaining this
season, is poised to win the league title. Shanghai Shenhua is a
remote second at 26.
</P>
<P>
Dalian opened the scoring in the fourth minute on a Zhang Enhua
header in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao scored in the area four minutes later to make it 2-0
for the hosts before break.
</P>
<P>
In the 57th minute, the Sichuan goalkeeper parried a Dalian
shot but the ball landed just in the path of teenager striker Wang
Peng for him to score.
</P>
<P>
Star striker Hao Haidong completed the mauling with two minutes
remaining, when he received a long pass from Niklas Nylan in
midfield and made a sole run down center to net.
</P>
<P>
The game had been put off to Wednesday because of the conflict
with an Asian Club Championships match against a Hong Kong side on
November 20.
</P>
<P>
In another rescheduled match, Beijing Guo'an edged Qingdao
Hainiu 1-0 on a 62nd goal in an away match.
</P>
<P>
This match was moved up because Beijing is to meet Japanese
side Kawasaki Verdy in Asian Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals on
December 3 and 11 on a home-and-away basis and would not be
available for the league competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of India's Congress
party began a crucial meeting this evening to decide whether to
withdraw support for the United Front government led by Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Congress Working Committee, the highest
decision-making body of the Congress party, is likely to take a
decision on the party's threat to withdraw support to the Gujral
government, which relies on the support of the Congress to
survive, Congress party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has issued an ultimatum to the United Front,
demanding the ouster of three government ministers who are from
the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK) party, a key constituent in
the 13-party Gujral minority government.
</P>
<P>
An investigative report last week claimed that the DMK was
linked with the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv
Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Gujral, however, rejected the Congress party's demand on Monday
but agreed to negotiate to seek a way out of the current political
deadlock.

CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab justice ministers are
working to finalize the blueprint of an Arab agreement on fighting
terrorism at a two-day meeting that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The 13th session of the Arab Justice Ministers Council is also
discussing a number of other issues, including the Arab agreements
on juvenile delinquence, on criminal and civil procedures.
</P>
<P>
But featuring high on the agenda is the ratification of the
Inter-Arab Anti-Terrorism Treaty, which was endorsed by a
committee stemming from the Arab interior and justice ministers
councils during its meetings in the Egyptian capital in September.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement includes a number of provisions on
enhancing inter-Arab cooperation in the face of escalating
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
It calls for extraditing criminals and exchanging information
that would prevent terrorist crimes in any member state of the
agreement, and urges conducting joint studies and research for
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The bill also incorporated a provision that legitimate struggle
against occupation is not considered among the terrorist crimes
according to the International Law principles, a reference to Arab
fightings against Israel in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to come into effect 30 days after its
ratification and submission to the Arab League Secretary General.

LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior British intelligence
official said today the government would take new measures to
crack down on illegal immigrations.
</P>
<P>
National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) Director-General
John Abbott said his department will combine with the immigration
service to foil increasing attempts to smuggle people through
frontier controls and provide them with false documents.
</P>
<P>
"What concerns us is that our intelligence sources suggest
organized criminals are moving more and more into this line of
business," Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
"There's quite a lot of evidence that people trafficking in
drugs are also trafficking in human beings," he said, adding that
racketeers are charging from illegal immigrants 2,000 to 10,000
pounds (3,350 U.S. dollars to 17,000 dollars) each for smuggling
them into the country.
</P>
<P>
Abbott said that in 1991 just 60 attempts to smuggle in illegal
immigrants were detected while last year the figure had rocketed
to 600.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigrants are smuggled into Britain mainly from
Russia, eastern Europe, Africa and the Indian
sub-continent.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeking New Social Security Scheme for the Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
today that the Philippine government is looking for a new social
security scheme that would "cover the poor and the disadvantaged
group at a fair and affordable cost."
</P>
<P>
In a speech read for him at the 11th International Social
Security Association Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific
held here, Ramos said his government has been consulting with
social security institutions to seek "a more unified and
comprehensive approach" in fulfilling the people's social security
needs.
</P>
<P>
"This approach will consider proposals which have been advanced
for the privatization of social security schemes and we are
conducting intensive consultations with the institutions concerned
on this matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two major social security institutions in the Philippines
are the Social Security System (SSS) which has more than 18
million members nationwide and the Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS) which covers about one million civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the country's social security system still needed to
undergo reform because social assistance was limited and "there
are no pensions...for the very poor and the handicapped."
</P>
<P>
The country's limited resources have prevented the government
from providing adequate assistance to a large population, he said,
adding that the SSS and GSIS can only offer modest benefits, with
minimum pensions at only about a third of the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which opened on Monday, will end tomorrow.

BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese notary organization
is in the process of certifying material evidence and testimony
provided by more than 2,000 victims, survivors and witnesses of
the Nanjing Massacre.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuying, 79, was stabbed 37 times by Japanese soldiers on
Dec. 19, 1937 when she resisted their rape attempts. She was among
the first group of 150 survivors to testify in front of a video
camera.
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, Li appeared as a victim in a court
trying chief Japanese war criminals including Yasuji Okamura.
From 1937 to 1945, Okamura was commander-in-chief of the Japanese
expeditionary forces in China and enforced the extremely brutal
policy of "burn all, kill all, loot all."
</P>
<P>
"Those survivors who have provided ample and strong evidence
will be given a legal certificate which will serve as a legal
document and be preserved at the Museum of Nanjing Massacre," said
a staff member from the Nanjing Municipal Notary Association.
</P>
<P>
The first bundle of 150 notary documents will be handed to the
museum on Dec. 13 in memory of the 60th anniversary of the slaying

<HEADLINE> Speculators Accused of Using Indian Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Commerce Minister B.
B. Ramaiah today accused currency speculators of taking advantage
of the current political crisis in the country to devalue the
Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, they (speculators) are behind this weakening of
the rupee," the minister was quoted by the Press Trust of India as
saying at an international conference held here.
</P>
<P>
"Even in March when the United Front government faced a crisis
before H. D. Deve Gowda was replaced by Inder Kumar Gujral as
prime minister, the speculators had played the same game," he
said, referring to the three-week political crisis beginning on
March 31 when the Congress party withdrew support to the Gowda
government.
</P>
<P>
The current political crisis was triggered last week when an
investigative report linked the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), a
major constituent of the ruling United Front, with the
assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party, which lends crucial outside support to the
United Front minority government, has demanded the ouster of three
DMK ministers, warning that the party will otherwise withdraw
support to the government.
</P>
<P>
The current political impasse, however, led to active
speculations on the foreign exchange market in the country with
the rupee sliding to an intra-day historical low of 38.55 against
the dollar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian currency recovered on intervention by the Reserve
Bank of India to close at 38.07/12 later on Monday, before it slid
further to end at 38.30/33 rupees per dollar yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The rupee opened at a further record low this morning at 38.72
rupees against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ramaiah, however, ruled out any immediate action to tackle the
speculators, saying the government will wait for two or three days
for the situation to clear up before it can do something.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand International Science Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China will take an active part
in international competition and cooperation, while at the same
time effectively introduce key technology from developed countries
and encourage export of the nation's high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaoqi, director of the International Science Cooperation
Department under the State Science and Technology Commission, said
today that China will face both new opportunities and challenges
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said China will accelerate the introduction of key
technology and invite experts in related fields, while
simultaneously joining developed countries in the development of
new industries related to digital televisions, global satellite
communications, trans-genetic animals and plants, gene therapy and
artificial intelligence systems.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that China will also expand regional scientific and
technological cooperation with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) members.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that China successfully hosted the first
conference of the APEC Industrial Park Network in September
indicated the operational status of the network Chinese President
Jiang Zemin advocated at last year's APEC Summit.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed to the success of Jiang's visit to the
U.S. earlier this month, and noted that two leaders decided
to strengthen cooperation in the realm of environmental
protection, science and technology, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the two sides have also introduced programs to ensure
the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing scientific and technological cooperation with EU
countries is also one of China's major foreign cooperation tasks
for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that China will formally sign the Sino-EU
Cooperation Agreement and accelerate efforts to promote full-scale
cooperation in the biology, energy, telecommunications,
aviation, aerospace and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
China will also create favorable conditions for training and
sending outstanding young scientists to countries in Western
Europe, the United States, Russia and various other countries to
participate in scientific research programs, or to otherwise
complete training programs offered by major laboratories in the
said nations.
</P>
<P>
He said China will strengthen cooperation with major overseas
companies and financial groups, and will welcome the establishment
of cooperative or jointly funded Sino-foreign research
institutions and high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
China has accelerated efforts to establish special funds for
promoting Sino-foreign cooperation throughout the
nation. The country will attract both government and private
funding in this respect, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, China is currently establishing two
data banks, one of which will provide information related to
foreign technology, personnel and project funding China is
seeking, with the other introducing China's new technology and
high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
The data banks will be hooked to the Internet in the first half
of next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open 30
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics abroad over the next
decade, according to the State Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (SATCM).
</P>
<P>
SATCM Director Zhang Wenkang said his administration is
drafting a ten-year (1998-2007) foreign exchange and cooperation
program to improve cooperation in the sector and enable more
traditional Chinese herbs to enter the world market.
</P>
<P>
The draft program discussed at a recent national meeting on
foreign exchanges and cooperation calls for designating 10 TCM
producers for participation in foreign cooperation, according to
today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The companies will enjoy preferential treatment in attracting
foreign funds and technology, and will receive state support to
promote the development of new medicines and enter the world
market, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
SATCM plans to expand exchanges and cooperation with foreign
universities over the next ten years in order to establish ten-odd
formal TCM education institutes in foreign countries, according to
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of foreign students studying TCM in China
has reached the highest level in recent years. TCM networks have
served tens of thousands of foreign patients.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country exports Chinese medicine valued at
over 600 million U.S. dollars annually to 130 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
China has established exchange and co-operation relations with
more than 40 countries.

<HEADLINE> El Nino to Cause Fish Output to Drop in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) --- Seven regions in the
Philippines are expected to experience a 20-40 percent drop in
fish production during the oncoming El Nino episode, a senior
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Output of local fish staples such as sardine, mackerel and
"galonggong" will decline by 5 percent and "bangus" by 12 percent,
according to Rafael Guerrero, director of the Philippine Council
for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
"Our catch for small pelagic fishes such as 'galonggong', which
contribute 40 percent to our marine fisheries, is expected to drop
due to El Nino as it had also been adversely affected during the
1982-1983 and 1992-1993 El Nino events," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fish catch in this area dropped by 5 percent during the
1982-1983 period and by 3 percent during the 1992-1993 El Nino
episode.
</P>
<P>
Tuna fishery will be worst hit as the warming up of surface sea
water now by about 6 degrees centigrade is already affecting
surface-dwelling or pelagic fishes like tuna, according to
Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
Guerrero urged the fisher folk to enhance fish production in
ponds and cages in non-drought prone areas to compensate for the
El Nino-induced shortfall in fish catch in the affected regions.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams US Duplicity in Forbidden Weapons Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today accused the United
States of deliberately failing to name Israel as a possessor and
manufacturer of weapons of mass destruction in a report worked out
by its Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Pentagon listed four countries in its report as possessors
or manufacturers of chemical and biological weapons, but left out
Israel, which has one of the largest buildup of the weapons, said a
spokesman of Iraqi Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraq News Agency (INA), the spokesman
said U.S. biased attitude reflects that it adopts double standards
in it foreign policy and in dealing with international issues.
</P>
<P>
He contended that on the one hand, the U.S. is pressing Iraq,
which has destroyed all weapons of mass destruction, on the other,
it overlooks Israel, despite its full awareness that the Jewish
state possesses and is manufacturing forbidden weapons.
</P>
<P>
The policy of duplicity persistently exercised by the U.S. has
damaged its credibility as a regional peace broker and cast doubts
over its fairness in world affairs, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lieutenant General Amer El-Saadi, an adviser of
Iraqi President Saddam, described a statement made by of
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen as naive, unscientific
exaggeration and intended to incite a hysterical campaign against
Iraq, INA reported.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Tuesday that Iraq may have produced 20 to 200 tonnes
of lethal nerve gas VX and other deadly toxins.
</P>
<P>
El-Saadi denied that Iraq has ever produced or is currently
hiding a single gram of nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
He called Cohen's allegations groundless, among the lies of the
U.S. political and propaganda campaign against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thirteen teams of the U.N. weapons inspectors left
their headquarters early Wednesday, the fifth day in a row since
their return to Baghdad, for a number of sites they intended to
check.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has vehemently accused Iraq of hiding secretive
programs of developing biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The New People's Army (NPA)
rebels have agreed to release a police officer and an army officer
they took hostage earlier this month, Philippine Solicitor General
Silvestre Bello said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Bello said the final
arrangement for the release of the two government personnel will
be revealed to the government by leaders of the NPA rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The NPA finally decided to free the hostages after the
government peace panel agreed to resume the formal peace talks
between the two sides, Bello said.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended the talks after NPA guerrillas
attacked at least three police stations, killing several policemen
and abducting the two officers.
</P>
<P>
Bello said the government peace panel is expecting the release
of the two persons not later than December 4. He added that if the
NPA fails to keep its word, the government will not push through
the holding of the formal peace talks in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
NPA founder Jose Sison, who is living in exile in the
Netherlands, said earlier that he had allowed government
negotiator Jose Yap to meet with an NPA representative in Manila
to discuss the "implementing guidelines" for the release.
</P>
<P>
Sison was quoted by local news reports as saying the NPA has
finally decided to release the two captives as a "goodwill
gesture" to the government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A falling gold price added
to the Australian dollar's woes today as the deepening economic
crisis in Asia kept pressure on the currency.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar settled at 68.55 U.S. cents, from 68.71
late yesterday.
</P>
<P>
A dip in the gold price below the crucial 300 U.S. dollar level
and news of further collapses among Japanese financial

U.S. cents in offshore dealings.
</P>
<P>
The Australian currency continued its fall early in the local
session to 68.36 U.S. cents as gold also came under pressure in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion in Sydney closed at 298.25 U.S. dollars per fine
ounce from 302.7 U.S. dollars yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"All eyes are basically focusing on this Asian turmoil and now
gold has taken a bit of a dump," Citibank Australia senior dealer
Geoff Last said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.15 Japanese yen from 87.72
previously in Sydney and at 1.1984 Deutsche marks from 1.1956.

<HEADLINE> Silk Sales Drop in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The sales of silks in Macao have
dropped by about 30 percent this year as a result of fewer tourist
arrivals, the Macao Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
Macao silk shop owners say the sales declined as the number of
tourist arrivals went down by 13 percent in the first nine months
of the year. Some 40 percent of their customers are travelers from
outside Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local customers also bought less silk this year as the overall
economy has been in the doldrums for the third year, the owners
say.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has four shops dealing in silk and silk products and
they all have a history of more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the silks come from China's inland and some are from
Italy while high-quality silks are mainly products of Sino-Italian
joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Silk prices range from 90 patacas (about 11.54 U.S. dollars)
per yard to several hundred patacas a yard. Currently, those that
cost less than 200 patacas (about 25.3 dollars) a yard are most
popular, they say.
</P>
<P>
The owners say the prices have risen by about 10 percent over
last year as imports have become more expensive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local customers tend to be younger over the past
several years.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir on Next Year's APEC Meeting in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will host the
next informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) leaders scheduled for November 17-18, 1998 when three new
members -- Russia, Vietnam and Peru will be admitted, an official
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has extended
invitation to the APEC leaders in Vancouver to attend the sixth
APEC Leaders' informal meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Mahathir particularly mentioned the
participation of Russia in APEC which he said would "add spice" to
the leaders' discussions.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's presence would make the grouping more interesting and
balance the different interests in APEC," he was quoted as saying
at a press conference after the conclusion of the fifth APEC
leaders' meeting in Vancouver which agreed to impose a 10-year
moratorium on membership beginning 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Russia has been looking to the West and "it's
about time that they engage in the East."
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuala Lumpur meeting next year would review the
trade and investment facilitation process and ensure that
developing countries benefit from human resource development,
technology sharing and economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He said that equity and poverty alleviation as an integral part
of sustainable development would also be on next year's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said next year's meeting would lead to the formulation
of an APEC agenda for science, technology and industry for the
21st century and would also address the importance of cooperation
and emergency preparedness in times of natural disasters such as
the forest fires in Indonesia which have created a blanket of haze
in neighboring ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
APEC's ministerial meeting set for November 15-16 would
finalize the early and voluntary liberalization of nine sectors --
gems and jewelry, environmental products and services, fish and
forestry products, toys, medical equipment, chemicals, energy and
telecommunications -- for implementation in early 1999, he said.

<HEADLINE> Forum Launched Against Indian Parliament Dissolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- First-time members from
various political parties in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the
Indian Parliament, today announced the launch of a forum to
campaign against the parliament's dissolution, the Press Trust of
India said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to launch the forum was made at a meeting of more
than 50 members of parliament from various parties.
</P>
<P>
It came at a time when the current political standoff between
the ruling United Front and the Congress party threatened to lead
to the dissolution of the 11th Lok Sabha elected in April-May last
year.
</P>
<P>
The political crisis was triggered by Congress' threat last
week to withdraw its crucial support to the United Front minority
government led by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral if it does not
drop three ministers from a regional party allegedly linked with
the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The newly-launched forum would put pressure on various
political parties to find a solution to the present political
impasse and mobilize support against the dissolution of the Lok
Sabha, said forum convener P. Kodanda Ramaiah.
</P>
<P>
Fresh members of parliament in India usually wish to serve a
full five-year term, a precondition for them to secure relevant
treatments including pensions from the government.
</P>
<P>
The forum has the tacit approval of the leadership of the
respective parties, Ramaiah said, rejecting media suggestions that
it was manipulated by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
He said the forum's leaders will call on Lok Sabha Speaker P.
A. Sangma to press their demand.
</P>
<P>
The forum has so far collected signatures from 150 members of
parliament who are against the dissolution of the 545-seat house,
Ramaiah said, adding that it hopes to get more members to sign it.

<HEADLINE> HK to Host Regional Conference on Marketing Market Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will host a
regional conference on marketing and market research next week to
showcase Hong Kong's capabilities in the field of market research.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), the
conference, "Researching the Asian Markets of the New Millennium",
will be held on December 5. Co-organizers are the Hong Kong
Institute of Marketing and the Market Research Society of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The marketing and market research sector, growing at some 20
percent annually, ranks one of the fastest growing services
industries in Hong Kong, a highly services-oriented economy, TDC's
assistant executive director of services promotion Alan Wong told
a press briefing today.
</P>
<P>
The TDC's first regional marketing and market research
conference will discuss various cultural, managerial and
operational issues encountered by market researchers and marketing
professionals in the Asian markets, with special emphasis on
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as a regional center of marketing and market
research and as a gateway to the services sector of the inland
areas and other Asian markets will be highlighted, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
HK's Deputy Secretary for Trade and Industry Tam Wing Pong will
deliver a keynote speech at the conference.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the conference, there will be a small-scale
exhibition joined by top-notch market research companies to
demonstrate their latest services and expertise.
</P>
<P>
According to a TDC report, the main services exported by more
than 3,000 local market research companies are research work for
clients based outside Hong Kong and sales of data about the Hong
Kong market to overseas customers. In terms of where the studies
are carried out, the Chinese inland areas and the rest of Asia
represent the biggest selling points for Hong Kong-based
firms.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Bans Eight Merchant Banks From Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
suspended some business of eight merchant banks today as part of
its efforts to deal with the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These banks, which are all being troubled by huge amount of
nonperforming loans, were banned from borrowing foreign currency
funds and granting foreign currency loans.
</P>
<P>
The repayments of existing foreign currency loans of the eight
banks were possible for the time being, said a spokesman for the
Ministry of Finance and Economy.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has applied to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a bailout loan of 20 billion U.S. dollars to save its
plunging financial market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has welcomed the application but will require the
country to implement stringent self-rescue programs as a
precondition to get the loans.
</P>
<P>
South Korean and IMF officials have being negotiating on the
terms and amount over the IMF assistance since Monday and the
negotiations are expected to last at least two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the government instructed 12 of the nation's
30 merchant banks, including the eight debt-ridden banks, to solve
problems related to their foreign currency businesses by the end
of next month.
</P>
<P>
The 12 merchant banks were asked to merge with sound companies,
turn over foreign-currency assets and liabilities to other firms
or resolve foreign-currency strains fundamentally through the
asset-backed-securitization formula.
</P>
<P>
Firms failing to carry out the instructions by the end of the
year will be barred from engaging in new foreign-currency business.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in nonperforming loans in the merchant-banking
sector has been caused mainly by big corporate bankruptcies since
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
As merchant banks have been wrestling with swelling
nonperforming loans, their credit ratings have plunged, leaving
them unable to borrow money abroad, worsening the nation's balance
between supply and demand of foreign currency.

SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is now the acting prime minister,
said today that his country has not set a limit on the amount it
will use to support the Indonesian currency, the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
This help is in addition to the 5 billion U.S. dollars in
standby loans offered by Singapore, Lee was quoted by the local
television as saying after a business award ceremony.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that Indonesia has not yet asked to draw on
the 5 billion dollars line of credit offered by Singapore as part
of a package of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He also said he had nothing to add to comments made by
Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu and by the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) regarding the loan.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister and the MAS said earlier that the credit
from Singapore is a "second line of defense" following the IMF
package of 23 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But over the weekend, Indonesian newspapers reported that
Indonesia would use the money to help private sector companies,
the television report noted.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Lee stressed that Singapore's position is that
the money is available as "balance of payment" support for the
Indonesian government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: APEC Informal Leaders' Meeting Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China is
satisfied with the fruitful outcome of the 5th informal leadership
meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the conclusion of the
meeting, Qian said the meeting has made headway in five aspects,
including reaffirming the APEC approach that acknowledges
diversity, moving forward with economic and technical cooperation
and agreeing to proceed with the principles of consensus and
voluntarism in trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 18-member regional forum also agreed on the
necessity of strengthening financial cooperation and decided to
accept Peru, Russia and Vietnam as new members.
</P>
<P>
The Vancouver Declaration instructs the ministers to work on an
APEC agenda for scientific and technological cooperation into the
21st century and reports to next year's informal leaders' meeting,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders' meeting decided to set up a special economic and
technological cooperation mechanism, whose responsibility will be
guiding and coordinating activities in the field.
</P>
<P>
China has long been supporting the three countries' bid for
APEC membership, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
When asked on China's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO), Qian said negotiations are already under way, and delegates
from China and the United States will soon meet in Geneva to hold
further discussions.
</P>
<P>
"When President Jiang Zemin met with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, they both expressed the intention to speed up the process
in the hope that the two leaders will be able to further promote
the process next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Qian reiterated China's one-China policy
and the policy of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the cross-Straits negotiations, he said both sides
can discuss everything under the framework of one China, but first
of all, Taiwan should not be opposed to one China.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation in the legal regime with the United States, Qian
said China's minister of justice had visited the United States not
long ago.
</P>
<P>
APEC, an economic forum launched in 1989, now groups Australia;
Brunei; Canada; Chile; China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan;

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Denies Arms Supply to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior Ukrainian
official has refuted allegations of his government's deliveries
of arms and other items to Sierra Leone under an embargo imposed
by the United Nations and west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Konstantin Grischenko, deputy foreign minister of Ukraine,
said in the Nigerian capital of Abuja today that his country
would ensure the full implementation of the relevant U.N.
Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The council, endorsing a sub-regional economic sanctions
against the military junta in Sierra Leone, announced early last
month arms embargo on the country in a bid to force the junta to
hand over power to the legitimate government it overthrew in the
May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
However, the sub-regional peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG
later accused Ukraine of selling fighter planes and providing
mercenaries to help the junta.
</P>
<P>
The minister's denial is the first official reaction of the
Ukrainian government to the month-long allegation.
</P>
<P>
At the end of Grischenko's two-day visit to Nigeria, a
statement was issued, saying the two countries agreed to foster
closer ties in the political, economic and cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will endorse the whole gamut of bilateral
agreements reached during the visit, according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> French Wine Tastes Good in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- French wine has become a
favorite with a rapidly increasing number of Hong Kong people who
come to believe that drinking wines is good for health and
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
France is dominating over the fast growing wine market in Hong
Kong, where nearly two out of three bottles of still wine were
imported from France in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics show that 12.6 million bottles of
French still wine were shipped to Hong Kong between January and
June this year, almost double the total for the whole year of
1996.
</P>
<P>
Though a considerable amount of the imported wine is for
re-export to other parts of Asia, the local consumption has
registered tremendous growth since the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
The amount of wine consumed by Hong Kong people, measured by
duty-paid imports of wine, surged by 22 percent from the previous
year to reach 5.88 million liters in 1996. The momentum continued
into the first half of this year, when local consumption rose
sharply by 90 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The remarkable growth indicates the great market potential,"
said Alain Ponsard, managing director of the Hong Kong Office of
the semi-government SOPEXA, partly supported by the French
Ministry of Agriculture to promote the country's food and beverage
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, less than one liter of wine is consumed per head
per year, said Ponsard, while the worldwide average consumption is
eight liters per person per year.
</P>
<P>
"More and more Hong Kong people have come to realize that
drinking two or three glasses of wine every day is good for
health, and the concept of health has helped them develop an
interest in good wine," said the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
Increasing personal incomes also enable people in Asia to
afford a variety of wines, ranging from cheap Vins de Table for a
dozen HK dollars to expensive Appellations d'Origine Controlee
(AOC) for more than 10,000 HK dollars (1,280 U.S. dollars) a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
"For some people, wine is a symbol of status and wealth," said
Ponsard. "While for most ordinary people, especially young ones,
drinking wine is fashionable."
</P>
<P>
The market is luring, but the competition is fierce, said
SOPEXA's Hong Kong Office head, who has been busy with French wine
promotion activities one after another since he took the Hong Kong
post last January.
</P>
<P>
Other wine-brewing countries, such as the United States,
Australia, Italy, Chile and Spain, all made a foray into Hong
Kong, which plays a pivotal role in the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work hard to keep the leading position of French
wine, long known for its traditional quality," said
Ponsard.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Alerts on Import of Poisoned Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
ordered a stop to possible importation of poisonous meat from the
United States contaminated with a deadly organism, the Midweek
Concord reported today.
</P>
<P>
Esherichia Coli (E. Coli) has been confirmed by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a deadly organism which causes
bloody diarrhoea, while some victims, mainly young children, may
develop haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).
</P>
<P>
HUS is supposed to lead to kidney damage and failure with
long-term chronic consequences and even death in some cases.
</P>
<P>
Although no African country is known to have reported the
presence of the pathogen on its shores, the Nigerian government
has raised fears that the contaminated meat may be brought into
the country.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Gidado Idris, secretary to the government of the
federation, has written a letter to the ministry of health,
stating that a meat packaging firm based in Nebraska of the
United States "is reported to have products contaminated with E.
Coli bacteria".
</P>
<P>
The letter warned of the possibility of the meat entering
Nigeria through the black market, especially with the approach of
Yuletide which might spur unscrupulous importers to flood the
market with the contaminated meat.
</P>
<P>
The government fears were hinged on several instances of toxic
waste arriving in the country as genuine imports, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
To beef up scrutiny, more security measures were installed
last week at the country's seaports and airports, as well as the
land borders with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Security agencies have been particularly requested by the
government to be extra vigilant concerning food items arriving in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria Port Authority has initiated moves to ensure that
the infected American meat is not brought into the country by
sea.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 26 (Xinhua) -- FIFA on Wednesday was
urged to investigate allegations by Costa Rican referee Rodrigo
Badilla that he was offered cash to help the United Arab Emirates
beat Japan in a World Cup Asian zone qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Peter Velappan, general-secretary of the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) who revealed the allegation, said he was
concerned about the attempted bribery.
</P>
<P>
Badilla alleged he was offered 50,000 dollars to help UAE win
the match, the AFC said.
</P>
<P>
Velappan said in a statement: "It is in the interest of both
FIFA and the AFC to delve further into the allegation as we are
determined to wipe out such practices from the sport."
</P>
<P>
Velappan said the appointment of referees, match commissioners'
and security officials for the World Cup matches was the
responsibility of FIFA and this was the reason for asking the
world body to investigate the allegation.
</P>
<P>
The game between Iran and Japan ended in a 1-1 draw but Japan
qualified for the finals after beating Iran in a one-leg
play-off.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Not Seeking IMF Bail-Out: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
today that the Philippines is not among the countries covered by a
proposed 68 billion U.S. dollar International Monetary Fund (IMF)
bail-out program for beleaguered Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was reacting to a Manila newspaper report that the
Philippines was among the countries that would be covered by the
program, a news release from the Presidential Palace said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that the Philippines is not included in the
bail-out. Precisely, the Philippines has been singled out as a
good model for those which have been under IMF tutelage," Ramos
said in an overseas teleconference with his Cabinet who gathered
at the palace.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines has an extended fund facility
balance available under the original IMF program which is not a
bail-out but a "regular program that we voluntarily entered into
with IMF."
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippines is "not in the same league" as South
Korea, Indonesia and Thailand which need an immediate IMF bail-out
to restore their ailing economies.
</P>
<P>
But he said the acceptance by the three countries of the IMF
bail-out sends a good signal to the international investors.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the
Philippines are "very strong."
</P>
<P>
"We are performing better than the others in Southeast Asia and
that is the assessment here in Vancouver by APEC leaders as well
as by business groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was in Canada's Vancouver for APEC's informal leadership
conference.

The government has planned a budgetary expenditure of 10.7

<HEADLINE> Joint Team Surveys Flood Areas in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The flooding in the
Northeastern Province of Kenya is the worst in the region since
1961, the Daily Nation today quoted a senior U.N. official as
saying after a recent tour of the province.
</P>
<P>
A joint team comprising representatives of donors, aid
agencies and the Kenyan government overflew parts of Tana River
and Garissa districts in Northeastern Province which was declared
a disaster zone by President Daniel arap Moi earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The team led by the World Food Program (WFP) also visited
Dadaab refugee camps, where more than 120,000 Somali and Sudanese
refugees are located.
</P>
<P>
Mike Sackett, WFP's regional manager for the Horn of Africa,
said that "this appears to be the worst flooding to have affected
the eastern border region of Kenya since 1961."
</P>
<P>
The team observed that to the south of Bura in Tana River
District, the flooding appeared to be at its peak and there is
evidence that the floods are beginning to recede further north.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR) is planning to fly aid to more than 120,000
refugees trapped by rising flood waters in camps in northern
Kenya.

Flooding has cut off camps at Dagahaley, Ifo and Hagadera,
close to the border with Somalia, and food stocks in the refugee
camps will run out in mid-December, according to UNHCR
spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR is planning to fly in fuel, clean drinking water,
emergency food supplies, 10,000 emergency shelters and 20,000
blankets.

<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States President Bill Clinton Tuesday pressed
Japan to relaunch its economy, saying that the revitalization of
the Japanese economy is the key for the stability in Asia. But
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto responded by suggesting
that "one make difference between the diplomatic problems and the
problems in Japan." Clinton made the demand at a time when Japan
stopped buying American products massed at home market for several
months as the American trade deficit with Japan amounted to 40
billion U.S. dollars over the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea's trade unions, including the powerful FKTU
which rallies one million workers, are hostile to the austerity
measures being taken by the government in the face of the
country's economic crisis. Union leaders said that it is the
employers of big companies that are responsible for the economic
crisis, but the government is dumping it upon workers. They also
fear that the crisis will result in a 20 percent lay-off of the
staff in such big companies as Hyundai, Daewoo, Samsung and
Dongha, in the austerity measures which came along with the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Asia went deeper into the krach and the Japanese yen fell to
128 for one U.S. dollar, the lowest in five years on Tuesday. The
Tokyo stock exchange lost five percent and the Bank of Japan
offered a loan of 6.2 billion dollars to cover the withdrawals by
clients of the Yamaichi Securities, which went bankrupt this
week. Meanwhile, South Korea is waiting for aid from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), while the governor of the
central bank already has judged the insufficient offer of 20
billion dollars by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
-- Before leaving the French Guyana after a three-day visit to
the overseas department in the Amazon region, French President
Jacques Chirac called for the promotion of a local "culture of
enterprise." "What is lacked here, it is the spirit of enterprise
and the people here have a mentality of the assisted," said
Chirac.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore musical, Chang &AMP;
Eng - The Musical, will premiere in Beijing on December 9,
Artistic Director of Action Theater Ekachai Uekrongtham announced
at a press conference as the local theater launched its Beijing
season here today.
</P>
<P>
The director said the musical will premiere in China on
December 9 and play till December 11 at the magnificent 1,800-seat
Century Theater in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the National Opera and Ballet of China, a
Singapore contingent of 55 will recreate the musical on the
Beijing stage, he said. The contingent comprises 33 performers,
the original creative team, musicians and key stage crew.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by a 31-member orchestra from the National Opera &AMP;
Ballet of China, Chang &AMP; Eng - The Musical will be performed in
English with Chinese subtitles, he added, pointing out that it
will be the first full-length English language musical to be
staged in China.
</P>
<P>
The musical from Action Theater Singapore is based on a true
story of the original Siamese twins whose lives spanned more than
six decades across three continents in the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Joined at the chest by a mysterious band of flesh at birth, the
world-famous Siamese Twins Chang and Eng were destined to spend
every moment of their lives together. Condemned by their neighbors
as a bad omen during their childhood, they were saved by the love
of their mother and were invited to appear before the King of
Siam. Subsequently brought to America and exhibited as special
attractions, they fell in love with and married two American
sisters and went on to father 21 children.
</P>
<P>
Chang &AMP; Eng - The Musical was originally commissioned by the
National Arts Council Singapore for the Festival of Asian
Performing Arts in June 1997. It premiered to packed houses at the
Victoria Theater Singapore and was widely acclaimed by critics
around the region.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the response, Action Theater re-staged the
musical in August this year and enjoyed full houses throughout the
return season. An orchestra from the National Opera and Ballet of
China provided musical accompaniment for both seasons of the
musical in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Beijing season of the musical marks Singapore's
largest theatrical export up-to-date and is the largest cultural
collaboration of its kind between Singapore and China, Action
Theater said.
</P>
<P>
At the Singapore media launch of Chang &AMP; Eng's Beijing season,
Chinese Ambassador to Singapore Mdm Chen Baoliu congratulated
Action Theater for its efforts in bringing the musical to China.
</P>
<P>
Chang &AMP; Eng's debut "sets yet another good example of friendly
collaboration between artists of our two countries", she said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the musical's debut in China, Liu Thai Ker, Chairman
of Singapore's National Arts Council said the Beijing season of
the musical will herald a new chapter of cultural exchanges
between Singapore and China.

<HEADLINE> PUK Criticizes KDP of Cease-fire Violation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) today accused another Iraqi group the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) of cease-fire violations by bombing two PUK
villages in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shazad Saib, PUK representative in Turkey, told Xinhua, "The
KDP forces bombed two villages in our region in northern Iraq
Tuesday evening", showing that the KDP did not comply with the
cease-fire declared by itself.
</P>
<P>
The KDP said in a statement Monday that it had decided to halt
military activities as from 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on
November 24.
</P>
<P>
But the cease-fire is conditional upon that the pro-Iranian PUK
prevents Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels and
any other third party from carrying out military attacks against
the KDP positions or against the civilians across the cease-fire
lines in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A KDP delegation led by its senior official Sami Abdurrahman
who is in charge of the peace talks with the PUK was in Ankara
Tuesday for discussion with Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, backed by Ankara and Baghdad, is calling for
resumption of the Ankara peace process sponsored by the United
States, Britain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, the PUK official told Xinhua that the Ankara peace
process is dead as Turkey has sent troops to northern Iraq and
supported the KDP against the PUK.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has been deprived of exercising
sovereignty in northern Iraq since the end of the 1991 Gulf War by
the Western allied forces which had created a no-fly zone
there. The Iraqi government forces are not allowed to entered the
area where Iraqi, Iranian and Turkish anti-government rebels have
been operating as a base.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has kept its security forces in northern Iraq since May
to destroy the bases of the PKK rebels who have been launching
cross-border attacks against military targets in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly blamed the PUK for close ties with the
PKK which has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for a
Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.

According to a new poll conducted by the Field Institute
November 12 and 13, only 31 percent of the state's residents have
cleared drains, fixed roofs or taken any other precautions. Barely
a fourth of the 1,006 people surveyed said that they think El Nino
is something to take seriously, and just 11 percent think their
own region will be hit hard.
</P>
<P>
Since September the message widespread in California is to be
prepared for the wettest winter. What has captured the media and
public is whether the current phenomenon would produce the extreme
weather effects similar to those during the last disastrous El
Nino event in 1982-83.
</P>
<P>
But most people who responded to the survey said they were
doing no more than they do every year. "Not many believe the
consequences will be very serious," the Field Institute said.
</P>
<P>
There are a small percentage of more cautious people have
brought radios, flashlights, batteries and other emergency
supplies. Some four or five percent of the residents said they
have bought personal gear such as raincoats, boots or extra
blankets, and such equipment as generators, water pumps or
sandbags.

<HEADLINE> Men Urged to Help Combat Female Circumcision in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Men have a crucial role
to play in fighting female genital mutilation, delegates have
appealed at a seminar held in the north Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner Joseph Mbwiliza made the
appeal on Tuesday for concerted efforts to curb female genital
mutilation, which is rampant in some parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime against women, and people should feel
responsible to fight the bad culture among the local community,"
he said, adding that men should spearhead the war.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner urged elderly people in the region to support
a reform of customs and traditions which suppressed women,
according to a report by the Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
Mbwiliza commended non-governmental organizations formed in
the region specifically for fighting outmoded traditions,
including female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders should also join the campaign against female
genital circumcision, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar was organized by the Regional Network for
Fighting Female Circumcision specifically for marking the Human
Rights Day.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Geoffrey Chelangwa of Mawenzi Hospital said
that female circumcision was being practiced by some staff at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I know some of the nurses are practicing it at the hospital
and several children have undergone circumcision," he said,
adding that it was not ethical for the hospital staff to practice
it.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the campaigns conducted by various groups
against the practice, the problem was still rampant in the areas
of Uru, Kibosho, Machame and Same.

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Business Jet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's first private business
jet is scheduled to make its maiden flight from Changsha,
capital of central China's Hunan Province, to Beijing within a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The fuselage of the white jet, owned by the Hunan Yuanda
Air-Conditioner Corporation Ltd., is roughly 13 m. long and four
m. wide. The eight-seat aircraft features modern office
equipment and a mini-bar.
</P>
<P>
The company purchased the executive jet from Cessna Aircraft
Co., the largest U.S. manufacturer of executive jets. The
twin-engine Citation, which has a flight ceiling of 12,500 meters,
can cruise at 704 km per hour and has a range covering the entire
Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to purchase the jet was based on both our
capability and demand. We carefully considered the pros and cons
of purchasing the jet, and in no way we acted on a whim,"
said Yuanda General Manager Zhang Jian.
</P>
<P>
The decision will undoubtedly enhance Yuanda's work
efficiency and help the company better serve customers, said
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The company, established in 1992 and now the leading
air-conditioner manufacturer in China, led its sector in 1996
profits.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft will enhance Yuanda's image, and will
serve as a sound advertising tool, according to Zhang.

LUSAKA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy has donated to Zambia 3
billion Kwacha or about 2.25 million U.S. Dollars worth of rice
to help the country meet its food needs, Zambia Daily Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The consignment of 1,870 tons of rice together with two
tractors were received on Tuesday here by Zambian Vice-president
Godfrey Miyanda from Italian ambassador to Zambia Margherita
Costa.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony, Miyanda said that the donation is extremely
important and timely to Zambia as it has come at a time when
there are reports of hunger from some districts due to reduction
in grain output in the 1996-1997 agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
He assured the Italian government that the Zambian government
will properly account for the donation and warned officials that
will be involved in the distribution of the food not to abuse it.
</P>
<P>
"All those responsible should ensure that the food is
delivered to the right places without a single grain going to
waste," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also called on farmers to heed warnings
from weather men on the impending drought as a result of the El
Nino and ensure that they change their crop pattern to suit the
weather.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Zambian authorities have decided
to import 270,000 tons of food to fill the demand gap and
stabilize the country's food market.

past six years," Reodica said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1996, the health chief noted, the confirmed cases
of malaria were reduced from 86,392 to 39,855.

Department of Health through its regional field offices in
collaboration with 824 local government workers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Although funding for the program has been drastically reduced,
"the achievement in control and prevention is significant,"
Reodica said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is also in step with the World Health
Organization target of a 50 percent reduction in Malaria cases in
the Western Pacific region in the year 2000, she added.
</P>
<P>
The health department has recently officially declared the
elimination of Malaria in 13 provinces out of 78 provinces in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said that out of the remaining provinces where malaria
is endemic, 16 have infection rates of less than one per l000
population per year, three have had no indigenous case in the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The malaria problems in the country are mainly concentrated
among farmers, forest workers, charcoal makers, migrant workers
and settlers in hard-to-reach communities, including provincial
boarders, cultural minorities slash and frontier areas, she said.

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Business Aircraft (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The aircraft, christened the "Yuanda", will be operated by
China Southern Airlines. Yan Mingchi, an official from the
Department of Restructuring, Regulations and Enterprise
Supervision of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
said that private aircraft must be covered by CAAC's industrial
administration and operations must be carried out by qualified
civil aviation enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhou A'rong, deputy director of the CAAC Air Traffic Management
Bureau, said that the appearance of private jet aircraft will in
no way create chaos in the nation's flight patterns.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic management departments will approve all flight
plans and pilot assignments, and will schedule all flights upon
receiving required information. Related departments will ensure
that private aircraft safely reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that private planes, which are usually small and have
a lower flight ceiling, can make full use of space.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jie, an economist from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, noted that China has more than 100 enterprises with the
capacity to purchase private aircraft. He noted that companies in
various sectors have gained strong financial capabilities over the
past 20 years since the introduction of the reform and opening
policies.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources noted that Yuanda has also purchased a
helicopter for short distance travel. The company will also use
the helicopter to provide services related to emergency aid,
disaster relief and geological research.
</P>
<P>
Yuanda paid some 100 million yuan for the Citation, the
helicopter and auxiliary facilities, with annual maintenance fees
expected to approach ten million yuan.

<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has experienced seven
major population changes during the 1990s, according to Chinese
Demographer Zhang Weimin.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the aging population has accelerated, Zhang said. The
number of people at or above the age of 65 will hit 90 million by
the year 2000, or seven percent of the country's total population.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the fertility level for women has dropped
indicates slower population growth, according to Zhang, who made
the comments in a report to the 23rd International Population
Conference held in Beijing in October.
</P>
<P>
The nations has also witnessed a falling mortality rate, with
the average life expectancy rising to 69.5 years, or an
average of 67.36 years for males and 71.89 years for females.
</P>
<P>
The education level of the population has improved, according
to today's Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that the number of people working in
the service sector continues to increase.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of unmarried people to the total population is
declining, with more couples enjoying stable marriages and family
relationships. Nuclear families (three members) account for 61.67
percent of the total population.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Water Shortages Challenging Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- In addition to the peso
devaluation, another major topic of conversation by the Filipinos
recently is the water shortages, a dire consequence brought about
by the El Nino, an abnormal weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Metro Manila have already felt the pinch. Water
supply to the city has been reduced by 10 percent from 3,300
million liters per day to 2,800 million liters, due to the sharp
decline of the water level at the Angat reservoir, the main water
resource for Manila.
</P>
<P>
At present time, the reservoir's water level was standing at
183 meters, 19 meters below the normal level. It is falling
sharply due to the drought brought into the country by the El
Nino.
</P>
<P>
Some residents, dissatisfied with the fact that air, no more
water, comes out of their taps, are illegally "exploring" the
water resources conserved for fire extinguishing.
</P>
<P>
However, the worst is yet to come. Officials with the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System said water supply to
Manila will possibly be reduced by as much as 40 percent in the
coming dry season.
</P>
<P>
If the situation worsens, water supply will be limited to two
to three hours a day and at the worst, faucets will only flow
every other day until the rainy season comes in July next year.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit areas are Bulacan and Pampanga, two provinces
lying to the north of Manila. In Pampanga, plants have dried up in
farms that developed wide cracks on the ground. Agricultural
officials said as a result of the drought, there will be a
reduction in yield by 25 percent in rice crops this year.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the drought, local farmers were encouraged to
plant crops that require minimum water to complete its life cycle
like corn and sorghum and grow rice variety in low lying areas and
upland crops like corn, legumes and root crops in elevated areas.
</P>
<P>
Bearing in mind the serious consequences of the El Nino,
President Fidel Ramos has repeatedly cited the urgency for water
conservation and recycling in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I urge everyone to start conserving and recycling water
because any lack of this precious resource can bring about dire
consequences to our daily lives," he said recently after
inspecting a dam project in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos had released at least 200 million pesos (six million U.S.
dollars) for the digging of more deep wells and building of small
water-impounding reservoirs. Meanwhile, he ordered the air forces
to conduct seed-clouding operations when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers also
called on all local government units to immediately implement
urgent measures to conserve water and take necessary steps to
protect water resources.
</P>
<P>
"We must immediately put into action practical water
conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and
allows us to recycle water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said local government units should ban the drawing of
water from communal waterworks system for watering lawns, gardens,
campuses, parks and for pressurized car washes while monitoring
the use of all public deep wells, fountains and springs to ensure
that water from these sources are properly utilized, preferably
only for cooking and other basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
The local governments should also undertake information
campaigns to disseminate water conservation measures and to
explain the El Nino phenomenon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that industrial users should have their own water
sources so as not to prejudice the water available to the general
public or unduly deplete communal water systems such as rivers and
lakes.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government has accepted an offer from the
United States, deciding to put up U.S. water purifying systems in
25 areas to convert polluted water into potable water.
</P>
<P>
"We will be very, very thankful for any assistance from any
country with regard to the cleaning up of river water, lake water,
foreshore water for the potable, industrial and commercial
purposes," President Ramos said.

HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa
Development Community (SADC) women's expo ended here Tuesday with
participants calling for more regional trade fairs as it had been
proved that networking was the way forward.
</P>
<P>
For the past five days some Harare residents have had the
opportunity to view high quality products produced by women
groups from the region in the expo, which was organized by the
U.N. Development Fund for Women under the SADC gender program and
participated by women from 13 countries.
</P>
<P>
These included mining products, gemstones and jewellery,
ceramics, carpentry products, textiles, leather products,
paper-based products and processed foods.
</P>
<P>
Prizes for the best stand, best products and best
demonstration were presented to winners by Elenore Mamabolo, wife
of South African High Commissioner to Zimbabwean Kingsley
Mamabolo.
</P>
<P>
Closing the expo, Kingsley Mamabolo said the expo had
correctly focused on small-scale producers to which the bulk of
women's economic activities were discernible.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale producers constituted a vital component of the
economies of SADC states. Mamabolo regretted the serious problem
of illegal immigrants which he said threatened to stifle the
vibrant aspect of economic integration and cooperation as more
stringent immigration and visa regulations were put in place.
</P>
<P>
She called for more trade fairs to promote trade in the
region.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- In the last 10 years, the
business volume of technology contracts has increased 30-fold in
Ningbo, a port city in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the technology contracts in the city
reached 140 million yuan last year, as against 4.7 million yuan 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the real figure could have been higher
since many deals were made and registered elsewhere, and were not
included in the statistics released by the city's Administration
Bureau of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
An official survey reveals that the ratio between input and
output of these technology contracts is as high as 1 to
25. Experts say technology purchases offer a promising economic
return.
</P>
<P>
Technology transactions also have brought profits to research
institutions. The Ningbo Research Institution on Environmental
Protection, for example, signed 4.27-million-yuan in technology
contracts last year, earning a profit of 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have also introduced technology
and attracted technological personnel. Local officials singled
out Dacheng Chemical Fiber Company (Group) of Ningbo, which
benefited from 16 high-tech contracts and recorded an output value
of 240 million yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Minister Backs Govt on Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's only white minister
Timothy Stamps made a plea in parliament on Tuesday to his fellow
white commercial farmers to release land required to resettle
thousands of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
The British born Health and Child Welfare Minister said in a
ministerial statement, ''I ask my colleagues in the commercial
farming sector whether they have thought of the plight of the
poor.''
</P>
<P>
''Let's not exploit our neighbors, let us share our resources
and ensure progressive development of land free from racial
class. Let us learn from history and not relive it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said he was concerned landless people were being driven
to already over-crowded urban centers, resulting in deterioration
of health conditions in many of these centers, citing the capital
Harare and its dormitory town of Chitungwiza.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the problems in urban centers were because
other people who had access to land denied this right to those
who had nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he agreed unequivocably with the government
move to reclaim land for the sake of the landless, adding that
there was need for land redistribution in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe has already promised the nation the
government will this year acquire over five million hectares to
resettle over 100,000 families who have been waiting for land
since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide tour in October, Mugabe said land for
resettlement will be taken from white commercial farmers before
the end of this year, and already the government has designated
1,171 farms countrywide for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said compensation would be paid for the improvements
made on the farms only. The government would not pay a cent for
the soil.
</P>
<P>
He said the British could compensate ''its children'' if it
wanted to, although Britain has already indicated it will not
sponsor any land reform program where land has not been bought
under the willing-buyer willing-seller basis.

BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Eight coronary heart disease
patients in the Anzhen Hospital in Beijing have successfully
undergone an operation called Transmyocardium Laser
Revascularization (TMLR).
</P>
<P>
Seven of them have recovered and are out of hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Kechang, a miner in Anhui Province whose heart disease was
once diagnosed as incurable, was the first to receive the
operation. He is now out of hospital and able to work after a
40-minute operation and a 16-day recovery period.

The eight coronary patients, all middle-aged or elderly, had
also suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes before their
operation.
</P>
<P>
TMLR, introduced from the United States by Anzhen Hospital, is
a new procedure. Surgeons make a small incision on the chest and
then use a laser to drill "channels" in the blood-deficient part of
the heart to improve blood circulation in that area.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 78 hospitals in the world can perform TMLRs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural and sideline
product processing industry in east China's Jiangsu province has
become a major magnet for Chinese and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, one of China's largest grain producers and exporters
of farm produce, has committed itself to making its food
processing sector more open to the outside.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the province held a trade fair in Hong Kong
recently, during which 168 agricultural cooperative projects were
signed with overseas investors for an investment of 770 million
U.S. dollars. The food-processing sector received the dominant
part of the investment.
</P>
<P>
Sources with concerned departments in the province have
reported that Sino-overseas joint ventures have emerged in a large
number in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Lianyungang and other cities in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Taizhou City has built Asia's largest vegetable processing line
with a Taiwan investor. The joint venture, at a cost of
20 million U.S. dollars, is capable of processing 300 tons of
vegetables a day.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: APEC Takes Another Step Forward (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) informal leaders' meeting
concluded here today with the passage of a Vancouver Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "Connecting the APEC Community",
stresses the equal importance of promoting economic and
technological cooperation (Ecotech) and trade and investment
liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also offers concrete measures for enhancing
Ecotech and trade and investment liberalization among APEC
members, widely seen as another step forward for APEC.
</P>
<P>
While identifying several sectors for advance liberalization,
the declaration notes that liberalization should be carried out
voluntarily and within the time framework set by the second
leadership meeting in Bogor, Indonesia. Flexibility, conditional
and partial involvement should be allowed and non-discriminatory
principles should be kept.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to set up an Ecotech subcommittee
within the high official meetings. Although the mechanism is at
its initial stage, and cannot fully meet the demands of developing
countries, it is undoubtedly a good start.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1989, APEC has been trying to
strengthen Ecotech on the basis of co-existence and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Following the passage of the Economic Vision Statement at the
first APEC informal leaders' meeting in Seattle, the United
States, in 1993, leaders from APEC members issued the Declaration
of Common Resolve at their second meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, the
Action Agenda at their third meeting in Osaka, Japan, and the
Manila Action Plan at their fourth meeting in Subic, the
Philippines. The goals and measures made and revised for APEC
development are becoming more practical and feasible.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of a new century, the trend of economic
globalization is increasingly strengthened, which provides both
opportunities and challenges for member economies.
</P>
<P>
APEC, which represents the most actively-developing region in
the world, is also facing major difficulties, including the
weakness of Ecotech.
</P>
<P>
But since APEC members are at different levels of development
and their modes of economy are various, these countries have
different interests and difficulties.

<P>
For instance, the developed members are more enthusiastic about
advancing sectoral liberalization than Ecotech preferred by the
developing members.
</P>
<P>
As a member of APEC, China has made great contributions in
promoting trade and investment liberalization and the Ecotech in
the regional forum.
</P>
<P>
China's advocacy for enhanced Ecotech reflects the reasonable
demand of the the developing members of APEC. China has always
maintained that trade liberalization should include technological
and trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
In order to quicken and deepen the reform and opening-up
process, and to seek regional cooperation and common prosperity,
China has twice voluntarily lowered its tariff rates and decided
to join or partially and conditionally join advance liberalization
of some sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chineses President Jiang Zemin proposed at last year's APEC
informal leaders' meeting to establish an APEC-wide network of
science and technology industrial parks to facilitate the sharing
of experience and information exchanges in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the Vancouver meeting, Jiang said APEC should adopt an
Agenda for Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the
21st Century, which is of great importance to enhancing Ecotech in
the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Jiang announced that China decided to accede to the Information
Technology Agreement and to lower its average tariff on industrial
products to 10 percent by 2005. He also proposed to hold the 9th
APEC informal leaders' meeting in Shanghai, China, in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The importance of taking "the APEC Approach," raised by Jiang
at the fourth APEC meeting, was reiterated in the Vancouver
declaration, which called it an "entirely new approach" to
international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Approach calls on APEC to respect the diversity of its
members, acknowledge their divergence in the level and stage of
development as well as the consequent differing interests and
needs, lay emphasis on flexibility, step-by-step progress and
openness, adhere to principles of equality and mutual benefit,
consensus, seeking common ground, while putting aside differences,
as well as voluntarism, and combining individual with collective
actions.
</P>
<P>
On the recent financial instability in Southeast Asia, the
speakers at the meeting believed that through some necessary
adjustments, the current difficulties will be overcome, which will
lay a solid foundation for a new round of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They also called for continuous efforts to realize the goals
set by the meeting.

SHIJIAZHUANG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Handan Iron and Steel
Group has recently begun to build a production line for sheet steel
with continuous casting and rolling, the first of its

<P>
At a cost of 3.3 billion yuan, the production line is expected
to turn out one million tons of hot-rolled steel annually.

<HEADLINE> Indian Rupee Weakens Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian rupee lost
further ground to close at 38.30/31 rupees against the U.S. dollar
on Tuesday even as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pumped in 100
million dollars in the forward markets, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the day at 38.08/14 rupees per dollar, the rupee
weakened further on sustained corporate demand which saw the
currency touching an intra-day low of 38.40.
</P>
<P>
In a strategic move, the RBI embarked on cooling the forward
markets and pumped in an estimated 100 million dollars in March,
April, May and June maturities.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the central bank intervention, six-month
maturities cooled on Tuesday by 60 basis points to close at 6.5
percent levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior official of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has said market forces should be allowed to decide the value
of the rupee in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
According to ADB Director and Chief Economist V. V. Desai, it
would be hard to stabilize the currency through the process of
intervention "which at times might prove counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
Desai said the experience of the Southeast Asian markets has
amply shown the inability of central banks to stabilize the
respective currencies through intervention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the present drop in the value of the Indian rupee,
Desai said various factors are responsible including the impact of
the fall of currencies in Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Airline Cancels Europe-Panama Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Dutch Airlines
(KLM) will cancel its flights that have linked Panama and Costa
Rica with Europe for 37 years, a spokesman of Panama's air
navigation sector said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman gave no details of the reason, but hinted that
the growing trade deficit in the company may have resulted in the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The reservations systems of the Dutch Airlines will stop
working on March 26, 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a shame for the two countries that the only
direct flight between Europe and Central America will retreat
after more than 30 years of uninterrupted service.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch company will maintain a representative office in
Panama.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the airline's service will affect Panama's
producers, specially the export of sea products, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But, Juan Bulnes, president of the Association of Sea Product
Producers, Processors and Exporters, said that the cancellation
would not do too much harm for local exporters because only 5
percent of the total shipments are sent to Europe through Dutch
airliners.
</P>
<P>
Bulnes complained that the Dutch airline company has higher
prices for Pamana's exporters than the British colonies.

KATHMANDU, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali rupee today was
devalued by about 50 paisa on the heel of Tuesday's devaluation of
51 paisa.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) today reset the buying and selling
rates of the greenback at 60.75 rupees and 61.35 rupees
respectively from Tuesday's 60.26 rupees and 60.86 rupees.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth time for the Nepali rupee to devalue in three
months and the NRB, the country's central bank, has floated 44.1
million U.S. dollars to prop up the currency.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Nepali rupee (NR) is the inevitable
outcome of the Indian rupee's (IR) fall against the dollar, as the
NR is pegged to the IR at a fixed rate of 1.6:1.
</P>
<P>
The IR continued falling against the dollar Tuesday due to the
country's political crisis.

The issue became an important central topic in today's Security

</P>

States immigration laws, describing them as outstanding
achievements for all Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the signing of the amendments to the U.S.
immigration laws by U.S. President Bill Clinton last week, more
than 150,000 Nicaraguans will get their legal residence," Aleman
said during his monthly press conference at the Presidential

</P>
<P>
He described the event as an outstanding achievement of great
importance for all Nicaraguans.
</P>
<P>
He said Nicaraguans securing permanent U.S. residency will
become a political and economic power and will benefit Nicaragua a
great deal. The majority of Nicaraguans in the U.S. live in Miami,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
Aleman said because of the new amendments, Nicaraguans living
in the United States will be able to invest more money in their
home country. The airlines, hotels and the economy as a whole will
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Aleman added, "we hope for a significant increase in household
remittances to Nicaragua for the next year."
</P>
<P>
Official figures show Nicaraguans living in the U.S send more
than 200 million dollars a year to their families in Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro to Hold Early Elections to Defuse Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Assembly of Yugoslavia's
Republic of Montenegro passed a resolution here today to hold
early parliamentary elections in 1998, in an effort defuse a
political crisis over presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the early parliamentary elections
will be held during mid April-May next year.
</P>
<P>
In the second round of presidential elections held on October
19, Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who is head of the ruling
Socialist Democratic party, was elected president by a moderate
majority.
</P>
<P>
But result was not accepted by incumbent President Momir
Bulatovic and his supporters within the same party, charging that
the presidential elections were irregular. And, they demanded new
presidential elections and early parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution for early parliamentary
elections indicated that the two factions within the ruling party
were able to reach a compromise on settlement to the crisis over
the presidential elections. But the basic differences of the two
major political forces have remained.
</P>
<P>
Today's resolution said that the government of Montenegro and
all parties in the parliament are required to finish the drafting
of formal documents on the parliamentary elections by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe and the Yugoslavia Federation will be engaged to offer
consultations on the elections, according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the assembly voted to reject a draft initiated by
President Bulatovic's faction demanding the revocation of the
October elections and the holding of new presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro and Serbia are the two republics making up today's
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Makes Up Stand on Climate Change Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will join other
developing countries at the upcoming Climate Change Summit to
reject demand that it make "new commitments" to preventing global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The National Committee on Climate Change of Thailand met
Tuesday and agreed on a number of hard-line positions which
Thailand will take at the summit, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Along with rejecting new commitments, Thailand will not
consider carrying out "joint implementation" projects to prevent
global warming until the year 2000. It will also call on
industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse
gases to 15 percent below the 1990 levels by the year 2010, and by
an additional 20 percent by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 developing countries, a group collectively known
as the G-77 plus China, that are signatories to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change have banded together to push for
these demands at the third conference of parties to the treaty,
which will be held in Kyoto, Japan, from Monday to December 10.
</P>
<P>
The biggest issue at Kyoto will center on what binding limits
the industrialized countries will agree to for their emissions of
greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has proposed limits of 15 percent below
 the 1990 levels by the year 2010, while Japan has suggested cuts
to five percent below the 1990 levels. The United States, the
world's leading producer of greenhouse gases, wants to set targets
equal to the 1990 levels.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Stock Market Taking on Large State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Three large State
enterprises listed on the Chinese stock market in the past two
weeks may mean a better future and a new period of growth,
according to Chinese economists here.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern Airlines listed 300 million shares last week,
Anshan Iron and Steel listed the same amount on Monday, and
Shanghai Automobile, the same today.
</P>
<P>
Although some analysts worry that listing very large companies
may draw too much money and destabilize the young market, many
others see the action as good for the market.
</P>
<P>
A trillion yuan will be needed to renovate China's 400,000
large and medium-sized state enterprises, so they have been
encouraged to raise that amount on their own. And the stock market
listings indicate the authorities' awareness of the important role
the stock market may play in reforms, which may lead to improved
management in addition to providing much-needed funds, according
to a Chinese economist.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese stock market by now has a number of large state
enterprises, instead of only the medium-sized and small firms it
listed in its primary stage of development.
</P>
<P>
The government also slashed the bank interest rate and unveiled
securities investment regulations recently, meaning more funds
available and greater investor confidence, paving the way for the
easier listing of large enterprises and demonstrating the
determination of the authorities to develop a more mature stock
market.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Mulls Revising Monetary Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank is
looking at revising monetary growth targets for 1998 due to a
projected lower economic growth of the country.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be consistent with the inflation rate and growth
targets," local press today quoted a ranking bank official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Monetary growth, particularly on reserve money, was originally
expected to range from 13 percent to a high of 14 percent for
1998, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Reserve money refers to the currency in circulation and bank
reserves lodged with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the monetary targets will have to be correspondingly
adjusted to accommodate changes to a lower gross national product
(GNP) growth and higher inflation rate targets.
</P>
<P>
These economic indicators are vital components in drawing the
need money to fuel business expansion without overhitting the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Other sources disclosed that reserve money expansion could be
between 11 percent and 11.5 percent based on the revised GNP and
inflation rate figures.
</P>
<P>
The government has lowered the expected GNP growth to a range
of between 5 percent and 5.3 percent and raised the inflation rate
to a range from 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent in 1998 in line with
the projection of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- "Building a peaceful, modern
and developed nation is the principal duty of the nation at
present," said Myanmar leader Senior General Than Shwe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing executive members of the Union Solidarity
Development Association (USDA) here Tuesday, Than Shwe, chairman

<P>
This was the first open speech given by the chairman since the
formation of the SPDC on November 15 which replaced the former
State Law and Order Restoration Council.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, who is also patron of the USDA, noted that the basic
requirement of building a modern and developed new nation is
internal political stability which should be realized by building
a consolidated nation based on organizational strength, official
paper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
He expected the USDA to play a leading role in guarding against
all "attempts of interference in the internal affairs in new

CARACAS, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-five people were killed

He urged people to take preventive measures in swimming pools,
fountains and in refrigerators, as well as flower vases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> hke - APEC to Strive for Sustainable Growth, Equitable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic leaders
from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's 18
members said today that they will continue their efforts to
achieve sustainable growth and equitable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Certain of the dynamism and resilience of the region, we
underline our resolve to achieve sustainable growth and equitable
development and to unlock the full potential of the people who
live here," the leaders said in a declaration issued at the end of
the fifth APEC informal leaders' meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The declaration noted "the concrete results" achieved this year
in implementing the trade and investment liberalization
commitments the leaders set out at Philippines' Subic Bay last
year.
</P>
<P>
"As Individual Action Plans remain the core mechanism for
APEC's trade and investment liberalization activity, we reaffirm
our commitment to their annual improvement," Jean Chretien,
Canadian Prime Minister and host of this year's event, read from
the eight-page document.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the action taken to accelerate by two years the
timetable for the identification of sectors for early voluntary
liberalization, a decision that underlines their commitment to
advance the pace of liberalization in the region and globally.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to their ministers' recommendation that
voluntary early liberalization be taken in 15 sectors, with nine
to be advanced for implementation beginning in 1999, the
declaration said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce business costs, red-tape and delay, the leaders urged
the acceleration of trade and investment facilitation through
APEC's Collective Action Plans.
</P>
<P>
They also "undertake to work in a determined fashion" to
achieve a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization
negotiations on financial services by the agreed deadline of
December 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
To enhance economic and technical cooperation, the leaders
agreed to direct their ministers to formulate an APEC Agenda for
Science and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st Century,
and present it to them at their next year's meeting in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
With the declaration entitled "Connecting the APEC Community",
the leaders also offered a vision for the region in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made toward "connecting APEC's instruments",
"connecting with our constituents", "connecting" the economies,
commerce, science and technology, issues and the people of
Asia-Pacific, the leaders pledged.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Resources Along Nanning-Kunming Railway (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China has started a massive
campaign to develop natural resources along the Nanning-Kunming
Railway in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The railway, which crosses some economically less-developed
but resource-rich areas in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is scheduled for official
operation on December 2.
</P>
<P>
Imformed sources say that China plans to spend as much as 800
billion yuan (one billion US dollars) on resources development in
the region by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China has China's largest amount of aluminum ore,
half the country's phosphorus deposits, and more than ten billion
tons of coal. But, studies show that only 0.1 percent of the coal
has been developed, and the rate for phosphorus ore is still lower,
at 0.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
The area along the Nanning-Kunming railway is regarded as a
source of treasure. A Chinese Academy of Sciences study found
that, of the country's 44 natural resources indices, the area has
17 in the first category and 11 in the second category.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou will become a coal base with an annual output of 38
million tons, by developing a number of new coalfields
in the Pannan and Louxia areas, according to Wang Guangxian,
Guizhou's deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
After the Tianshengqiao and Panxian power plants are completed,
another thermal power plant will be built at Xingyi, bringing the
combined generating capacity of Guizhou to nearly four million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, gold bases will be set up in Lannigou and
Getang to produce 15 tons annually, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Leaders Want Quick Restoration of Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Economic leaders
from the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
said here today that financial stability must be quickly restored
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our economies and the international community as a whole have
a strong interest in seeing a quick and enduring restoration of
financial stability and healthy and sustainable growth," they said
in a declaration issued here at the end of the fifth APEC informal
leaders' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific region has been battered by a financial
turmoil since July. Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea were
forced to seek bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The crises also caused repercussions in the global stock
markets and shattered confidence in emerging markets in Asia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
As in the eye of the storm, some APEC members are particularly
keen to see concrete measures would come out of today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are resolved to work together to address these shared
challenges," Jean Chretien, Canadian Prime Minister and host of
the event, read from the document.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is critically important that we move quickly to
enhance the capacity of the international system to prevent or, if
necessary, to respond to financial crises of this kind," it stated.
</P>
<P>
Initiatives were developed recently in Manila, which include
enhancing mutual surveillance, intensifying cooperation, asking
the IMF to adopt new mechanisms and setting up a cooperative financial
arrangement to supplement the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Though short of immediate, concrete actions, the leaders did
their best to ensure the confidence in the region's future.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the fundamentals for long-term growth
and prospects for the region are exceptionally strong," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that the prospects for continuing economic growth in
the region are strong, and that Asia-Pacific will continue to play
a leading role in the global economy," they noted.
</P>
<P>
To ease concerns that the liberalization process would be
derailed by the current crises, the leaders stressed that there is
no need to slow down.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, APEC members were committed to an ambitious goal of
free and open trade and investment in 2010 for developed countries
and 2020 for developing ones.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that open markets bring significant
benefits and we will continue the pursuit of trade and investment
liberalization that fosters further growth," they insisted.

<P>
The phosphorus industry is important in Yunnan Province, which
completed the first phase of a large phosphorus industrial base
earlier this year, with an annual capacity of 180,000 tons of
yellow phosphorus, 500,000 tons of sulphuric acid, and 1.2 million
tons of double superphosphate.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang says that an effort will be made to
develop hydro-electric power on the upper reaches of the Jinsha,
Lanchang, and Nujiang rivers, making western Yunnan an important
hydro-electric power source.
</P>
<P>
A large nonferrous metals base will also be built near the three
rivers, He told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Pingguo Aluminum Mine of Guangxi has reported a yearly
production capacity of 300,000 tons aluminum oxide and 100,000
tons of electrolytic aluminum, following the completion of its
first-phase, making the autonomous region China's largest aluminum
industry base.
</P>
<P>
Local transport conditions, however, greatly restrict the
development of resources. So, Guangxi is developing ports in its
southern part to provide a sea outlet for the resources of
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
People along the Nanning-Kunming Railway have long been poor in
the midst of all this wealth. Out of the 20 million people in the
area, 15 million, or a quarter of China's total impoverished
people, live below the poverty line.

<P>
BANGKOK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
an additional budget cut of 23 billion baht (575 million U.S.
dollars) for the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Science and Technology Ministry this time saw the biggest

</P>
<P>
This was the third time that the Thai government cut the
budget, which now stands at 800 billion baht (20 billion dollars).
</P>

100 billion baht (2.5 billion dollars) in August.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, confirmed that Singapore had pledged 10 billion U.S. dollars
to Indonesia to help the country overcome the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's 10 billion dollar assistance consists of 5 billion
dollars for stabilization of the exchange rate and the remaining 5
billion dollars for balance of payment support," the bank said in
a press statement issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Monetary authorities on both sides "are still discussing the
use of 5 billion dollars set aside for exchange rate
stabilization," the statement said. "The usage will be linked to
small-scale businesses, cooperatives, labor-intensive industries
and exports."
</P>
<P>
The remaining 5 billion dollars will be used to support
bilateral balance of payments, the withdrawal and usage of which
are connected to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reform
package, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has collected 23 billion U.S. dollars in aid package
from IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the
country's external assets to restore the country's economic
condition.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Indonesian currency rupiah has dropped by more
than 40 percent this year following the monetary crisis in the
Southeast Asian region.
</P>

that Indonesia will soon receive the first 3 billion U.S. dollars
of the total 23 billion dollars of the IMF-led package.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Learning to Deal With Different Kinds of Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers, who have long
been accustomed to a planned economy, are finally getting more
adept at dealing with China's new combined economy, the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
One of many ways they have to learn to cope with the
ever-changing market is in the basic notion of production based on
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Other ways include: adjusting to the shifts of the market;
joining other households in a combined effort; streamlining
production, processing and sales; and keeping abreast of market
shifts through the use of information.
</P>
<P>
Chen Baosheng, a peanut salesman in one of the country's major
peanut markets in Anhui Province, is a successful businessman who
sells his peanuts not only inside China but also to the Repubic of
Korea, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he often would have mounds of peanuts rotting and
going nowhere. The situation changed only after he spent some time
doing market research and came home with a handful of contracts.
</P>
<P>
As China edges its way into the information age, farmers have
opted for telecommunications and electronic media as a means of
getting rich. Flower growers in Shandong province, for example, do
business via the Internet to make deals on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
In some major agricultural provinces like Henan, Jiangsu and
Shandong, households are joining together to increase their
competitiveness in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government's role in all this has been
changing and, more often than not, it acts as a bridge between
farmers and markets.
</P>
<P>
The Jian'ou Information Center for farm and sideline products
in Fujian province, which was established by the local government
and co-operatives, provides free information services for farmers
and offers a helping hand in setting up projects that are tailored
to the ups and downs of the market.
</P>
<P>
Still, although Chinese farmers are getting a better
understanding of market changes, they still need help in better
understanding the market and avoiding risks, experts say.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Colombo Port, the nerve center
of Sri Lanka's economy, has handled 1.5 million containers since
the beginning of this year, according to port officials.
</P>
<P>
The earlier estimate for the year had been around 1.3 million
containers.
</P>
<P>
However, improved productivity in the port, increased
popularity of Colombo for transshipment trade and better economic
growth this year, enabled the port to handle more containers, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by the end of the year the port would have
handled a record 1.6 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units).
In 1996, 1.3 million TEUs were handled.
</P>
<P>
Ports Minister M.H.M. Ashraff said at a ceremony held by the
port authorities Tuesday that it was a historic event.
</P>
<P>
He said the present government was pursuing a policy of making
Sri Lanka a shipping hub, a strategy necessary for the country to
face emerging challenges successfully.
</P>
<P>
The port began handling containers in 1985. It was able to
handle 1 million containers a year only in 1995, according to port
officials.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Reaffirms Support for Baltic Countries' NATO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden said on Monday it
supported the three Baltic countries in a bid to be among the
first wave invited to join the European Union (EU) early next
century.
</P>
<P>
The EU had recommended including only one of the three --
Estonia -- in the first wave, but the final decision is yet to be
made in a summit meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and visiting Latvian
President Guntis Ulmanis said following their meeting that they
agreed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania should take part in the EU
membership talks beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Ulmanis paid a two-day working visit to Sweden which ended
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Persson said he and Ulmanis also discussed their countries'
relationship with Russia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin will
visit Sweden next week.
</P>
<P>
Ulmanis reiterated his country's preference for NATO membership
over a Russian offer to guarantee its security.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly proposed to provide a security guarantee
to the Baltic region in an attempt to dissuade the three Baltic
countries -- all former Soviet republics -- from seeking entry
into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The European Commission -- the EU's executive body -- agreed in
July to recommend the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland,
Slovenia and the Mediterranean island country of Cyprus as the
first wave of countries to join. Reports said Latvia and Lithuania
were not included because of economic problems.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has to be approved by the heads of government of
all EU members at a meeting in December when the final decision
about who will be in the first wave will be made.

remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, about 50,000 mines have been removed in

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Control Efforts Pay Off Along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 26 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to control
soil erosion on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have
greatly improved the regional environment and local residents'
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent working meeting on soil erosion control
held here, the efforts have also promoted the local economy.
</P>
<P>
After eight years of soil erosion control, the acreage of
farmland suffering from erosion has decreased by 30 percent and
the percentage of vegetation coverage increased by 18 percentage
points, according to Song Baorui, governor of Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output value in the area has increased by 10
billion yuan and the per capita income of farmers doubled, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-sand sliding system set up in the area plays a key
role in safeguarding 300,000 people and several billion yuan worth
of fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The project began in 1988, when experts estimated that 35
percent of the total land area in the region had suffered from
soil erosion.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian national
coach Mario Zagallo recalled striker Bebeto to the national team
after an absence of more than two years on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bebeto, who last played for his country in a friendly against
Slovakia in 1995, was named in the squad for a friendly away to
South Africa and the Confederation Cup in Saudi Arabia next month
even though he has played only one competitive match in the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
Romario, Bebeto's striking partner in Brazil's 1994 World Cup
team, was also picked but was warned by Zagallo that his
international career would end if he committed any acts of
indiscipline.
</P>
<P>
Sao Paulo goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni, who has scored three goals
this year from free kicks, was the only uncapped player in the
squad.
</P>
<P>
Zagallo also included Leonardo from Italian club AC Milan, who
refused to release him for last month's friendly against Wales,
claiming he had already played five friendlies this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Zagallo avoided picking any players based
with Brazilian clubs who are involved in the closing stages of the
local championship.

<HEADLINE> Environments: Pollution May Lead to Childhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Childhood cancer and some
other children's diseases in the United States may be linked to
environment pollution, an environmental group said today.
</P>
<P>
Air and water pollution and lead, pesticides and cigarette
smoke in the children's environment may be the leading cause of
the diseases, reported the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whether there is a direct link between these
exposures and the increase in children's illnesses, but it
certainly warrants careful study," said Lawrie Mott, the NRDC's
senior scientist, at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that asthma rates were tripled in the 1980s and
childhood cancer increased by 10 percent over the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The report listed lead, air pollution, pesticides,
environmental tobacco smoke and the contamination of drinking
water as the leading causes to children's diseases.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, 900,000 U.S. children have blood lead
levels exceeding those set as safe by the Centers for Disease
Control. Pesticides residues are commonly found in fruit and
vegetable samples and believed as the cause of certain childhood
cancers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, it said, almost 18 million youths under age 10 lived
in areas with unhealthful air. And 8 million children under five
are exposed to cigarette smoke in the home and more than a million
children become regular smokers themselves each year.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1995, 45 million Americans drank water from
systems that fell short of the Safe Drinking Water Act standards,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group urged the U.S. government to take broad
steps to safeguard the next generation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Touches 5-year High Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar jumped to a
5-year high against the Japanese yen before retreating somewhat
Tuesday as Japanese stocks plunged on the closure of a major Tokyo
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also rose sharply to a one-month high against
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The dollar peaked at 127.96 yen -- its highest level since
August 1992 -- as Tokyo's main stock index plummeted 5.1 percent
after traders returning from a three-day weekend reacted to
Monday's collapse of Yamaichi Securities.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. currency gave back much of its early gains as
traders locked in profits from the dollar's recent rise and some
worried that Japan's central bank would intervene in the market to
support the yen.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 127.07 yen, up
from 126.80 late Monday, still a seven-month high despite its
retreat. The U.S. currency also was traded at 1.7485 marks, up
from 1.7375.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also gained against the British pound. Sterling
fetched 1.6770 U.S. dollars, down from 1.6906 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday:
1.4105 Swiss francs, up from 1.4053; 5.8515 French francs, up from
5.8162; 1,713 Italian lire, up from 1,702; and 1.4224 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.4204.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investors Not to Pull out of Asia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite the temporary setback
in some Asian economies, U.S. manufacturers will not pull out of
the region, a leading U.S. research company has found.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report on 1996 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Trends of U.S. Manufacturers released here today, Deloitte &AMP;
Touche Consulting Group said Asia-Pacific continues to attract
U.S. investors, who are banking on the long term growth prospects
of the region.
</P>
<P>
Global players like Coca-Cola, Ford, Texas Instruments, Lucent
Technologies, and Hewlett-Packard all agree that short-term
difficulties will not alter their investment strategies, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing U.S. investors' performance in 1996, the report said
Asia-Pacific was the only region that attracted more U.S.
manufacturing investment in 1996 compared to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Emerging markets in Asia were important production and
distribution centers for leading manufacturers in the high-tech
and automotive industries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Singapore and China together received over 2 billion
U.S. dollars in U.S. manufacturing direct investment, accounting for
one third of investment to that region.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows from the U.S., the world's leading investor, stood at
85.6 billion dollars in 1996, a mere one-half percent increase
from 85.1 billion dollars in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The share of manufacturing in total U.S. FDI plunged from
one-half in 1995 to one-third in 1996, a dip of 14 billion
dollars, while U.S. FDI into the financial services sector went
up by almost 140 percent or 17.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The services sector, including the banking, finance and
insurance industries, made up 36 percent of total U.S. FDI in 1996
as a result of continued removal of regulatory and investment
barriers in recipient nations.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Adopts Positive Attitude to Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said today that China adopts a positive attitude
toward strengthening financial cooperation in Asia and is ready to
participate in discussions on relevant mechanism for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a speech at the 5th APEC informal
leaders' meeting opened in the Museum of Anthropology of the
University of British Columbia here.
</P>
<P>
"It is beneficial to all countries to enhance regional and
international financial cooperation, maintain normal international
financial order, jointly ward off the impact of excessive
speculation of hot money in the world and create a favorable
financial environment," the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
On the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, Jiang said
useful lessons can be drawn from it and previous financial
instability around the world.
</P>
<P>
"Normal and safe operation of the financial system is crucial
to the overall economic stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain a normal financial order and ward off financial
risks, we should not only formulate correct economic development
strategies and preserve a rational economic structure, but also
improve the financial system through strengthened financial
supervision and regulation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we should maintain an appropriate structure and
size for external debt and gradually open the capital market and
financial services market in light of our specific conditions,"
the Chinese president added.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that Southeast Asia, having suffered
from the recent instability in financial market, will further
demonstrate its vitality for development and hold out a promising
prospect if useful lessons can be drawn and appropriate adjustment
made.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asia has
suffered temporary economic difficulties due to the recent
instability in the financial market. Nevertheless, we are
confident that this region will further demonstrate its vitality
for development and hold out a promising prospect if useful
lessons can be drawn and appropriate adjustment made.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has lowered its tariff on a voluntary basis
for several times, a drop of about 60% in five years. Beginning
from 1 October this year, China's average tariff level is reduced
to 17%. The Chinese Government has decided to lower its average
tariff on industrial products to 10% by 2005. In addition, China
has decided to accede to the Information Technology Agreement and
started negotiations on relevant issues. We believe that such
practical moves on our part will promote the development of
economic and technological cooperation as well as trade and
investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, I would like to warmly welcome the convocation
of the 9th informal APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai,
China, in 2001. We will make full preparations for this meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the
U.S. economy surged in November despite turmoil in the world's
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its index of
consumer confidence surged to 128.3 from 123.4 in October. That
was well above the expectations of Wall Street and not far off the
28-year high of 130.2 reached in September.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Dow Jones average plunged about 900 points over
four days in October, culminating in a 554-point fall on Oct. 27
-- its biggest point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
The market has since recovered two-thirds of its 900-point drop.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said consumer sentiment is important because consumer
spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's overall economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index, calculated from a 1985 base
of 100, is based on a representative sample of 5,000 households
nationwide.

WASHINGTON, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors today filed
first-degree murder charges against two suspects in the
hate-slaying of a black man at a bus stop in Denver, Colorado,
last week.
</P>
<P>
District Attorney Bill Ritter said he had not decided whether
to seek the death penalty for the pair, who also face first-degree
attempted murder charges for shooting and paralyzing a woman who
tried to help their target, United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Thill, who confessed in television interviews that he
killed African immigrant Oumar Dia because he was black, has been
in jail since he was picked up less than 24 hours later on the
basis of a tip to police.
</P>
<P>
The second suspect, 24-year-old Jeremiah Barnum, was arrested
the next day and faces the same charges as Thill.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Following is the
full text of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech at the 5th
informal leaders' meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
opened here today:
</P>
<P>
The Rt. Hon. Prime Minister Chretien,
</P>
<P>
Fellow Colleagues,
</P>
<P>
It is a great pleasure for me to come to this picturesque land
of maples. First of all, please allow me to extend my heartfelt
thanks to yon, Mr. Prime Minister, and the Canadian Government for
your considerate arrangements.
</P>
<P>
As mankind is approaching the 21st century, it is necessary for
us to develop a concept as well as a modality for cooperation that
are in conformity with the trend of the times by summarizing the
past experience and looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
APEC is the most influential economic forum in our region and
one of the most dynamic organizations for economic cooperation in
the world. It has its own basic features in its approach, that
is, giving full consideration to the diversity of its members and
acknowledging their divergence in the level and stage of
development as well as the consequent differing interests and
needs; laying emphasis on flexibility, step-by-step progress and
openness; adhering to such principles as equality and mutual
benefit, consensus, seeking common ground while puffing aside
differences as well as voluntarism; and, combining individual with
collective actions.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street managed
to move higher today despite a sharp selloff in Tokyo following
the collapse of a major Japanese brokerage.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.03 points to 7,808.95.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled 571.13
million shares as against 513.99 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Although the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled 5 percent today,
broad-market indicators here also turned higher.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 4.15 to 950.82, the
NYSE composite index rose 1.84 to 496.98, and the Nasdaq composite

Exchange composite index fell 1.71 to 661.80.
</P>
<P>
Stock markets in Europe also edged higher today.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo share prices were dragged lower by worries that Yamaichi
Securities, which decided to close Monday with roughly 24 billion
U.S. dollars in liabilities, may sell off its stock holdings to
cover part of its debts.
</P>
<P>
There were some encouraging economic news in the U.S. today.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Practice has proved
all the more clearly that the APEC Approach, which responds to the
reality in the region, is conducive to achieving a balance of
rights, interests and needs of various members. It will also help
its member economies to give full play to their capability for
common development. Adherence to this approach affords an
important guarantee for strengthened cooperation among APEC
members.
</P>
<P>
The sole mission of APEC is to promote economic cooperation. It
should refrain from extending the scope of its discussions to
social, political, security and other non-economic fields. It is
necessary to concentrate our efforts on advancing economic
cooperation in a spirit of doing certain things and refraining
from doing other things.
</P>
<P>
Trade and investment liberalization is a relative and
conditional concept for any APEC member economy. Diversity among
APEC members and their actual circumstances should be fully taken
into consideration and the principles of voluntarism, mutual
benefit, and consensus be observed. In identifying sectors for
early voluntary liberalization (EVSL), members should be allowed
to maintain the freedom of choice in terms of participation.
Meanwhile, the differentiation between the two timetables should
be acknowledged, and both the interests of a member itself as well
as those of other members should be considered so as to facilitate
common development. Developed members should be encouraged to use
their economic and technological advantages to help developing
members on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and
complementarity. By no means should the interests of the
developing economies be compromised. Only in this way will more
opportunities for cooperation be created for both developed and
developing members.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The recent financial
instability in Southeast Asia has affected many regions in the
world and aroused widespread concern from the international
community. From the recent and previous financial instability
around the world, we may draw some useful lessons.
</P>
<P>
Normal and safe operation of the financial system is crucial to
the overall economic stability and development. To maintain a
normal financial order and ward off financial risks, we should not
only formulate correct economic development strategies and
preserve a rational economic structure, but also improve the
financial system through strengthened financial supervision and
regulation. Meanwhile, we should maintain an appropriate structure
and size for external debt and gradually open the capital market
and financial services market in light of our specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
It is beneficial to all countries to enhance regional and
international financial cooperation, maintain normal international
financial order, jointly ward off the impact of excessive
speculation of hot money in the world and create a favorable
financial environment. We adopt a positive attitude toward
strengthening financial cooperation in Asia and is ready to
participate in discussions on relevant mechanism for cooperation.

VANCOUVER, Canada, November 25 (Xinhua)-- Economic and
technological cooperation and trade and investment liberalization
are closely linked and should support each other. The rapid and
dynamic advance of science and technology today has become the
decisive factor behind the development of productive forces and
exerted profound impacts on world economy and social life.
Strengthened scientific and technological exchanges as well as
technological cooperation and transfer will not only help augment
the economic and technological strength of developing members, but
also enhance the sustainability of economic development of the
developed members. This will not only narrow the gap of
development among its members but also greatly facilitate the
process of trade and investment liberalization. To this end, I
would like to put forward the following four points.
</P>
<P>
I. Fully open the market for technology trade so as to facilitate
the technological cooperation and transfer among APEC members, remove
man-made barriers and abolish discriminative policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
II. Adopt necessary measures to encourage and speed up the transfer
of hi-technologies and other latest technologies to all members and
developing members in particular with a view to promoting economic and
technological progress of developing members.
</P>
<P>
III. All members should pay due attention to the protection of
intellectual property rights and work to rationalize the IPR regime.
Protective period of technical patents should be appropriate and terms
of their transfer fair.
</P>
<P>
IV.  I would like to propose that APEC adopts an Agenda for Science
and Technology Industry Cooperation into the 21st Century. The Agenda
should include objectives and principles on the one hand and concrete
measures and steps on the other, combining market orientation with
governmental regulation and control, R&AMP;D with the application of the
results, and comprehensiveness with specificity in defining priority
cooperative projects, with a view to activating the process of Ecotech
in real earnest.
