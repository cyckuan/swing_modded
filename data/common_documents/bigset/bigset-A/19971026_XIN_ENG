<HEADLINE> One Man Killed In N. Ireland Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 25 (Xinhua) - A man was killed in a booby trap
car bomb-explosion at noon today on a loyalist housing estate in
Bangor, Northern Ireland, according to a report from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The man was pulled out from his blazing vehicle with serious
leg injuries and died later in hospital, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet known what had caused the explosion but local
people said they thought it was a bomb.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said: "It would appear that he had been
driving the car when the explosion occurred. It is not believed
that anyone else was injured."
</P>
<P>
The anti-British guerrilla group, the Irish Republican Army,
declared a cease-fire in July which paved the way for the
all-party peace talks, but the hard-core "continuity IRA" faction
exploded a carbomb in a small rural town in September.
</P>
<P>
However, Northern Ireland Security Minister Adam Ingram
said there was some indication that the bombing was "not
sectarian".

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong wish to host some
of the events on the competition program for the Ninth Chinese
National Games in 2001, a leading Hong Kong sports official
confirmed here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok, Head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) delegation for the Eighth National Games which closed
in Shanghai on Friday, said that co-hosting the next national
games helps local sports community in their drive to further
sports development.
</P>
<P>
The 2001 games are to be held in Guangzhou, capital city of
South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Fok said that Hong Kong SAR would have to bid officially for
the right to be the co-hosts with Guangzhou. "Anyway, we've
enough time to realize this as there are four years before the
games," he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea got positive response from Guangdong sports officials,
he said. "But we have to wait for the final words from the
central government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fok, who is also President of the Hong Kong Football
Association, made these comments at a press conference at the
airport after the Hong Kong SAR delegation returned from Shanghai
today.
</P>
<P>
Fok praised HKSAR's athletes for their performance at the
national games, where they won one gold medal from the men's 180
kilometers individual road cycling race, plus the Olympic gold
medal won by Hong Kong's ace woman windsurfer Lee Lai Shan at last
year's Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
He said HKSAR's participation of the games, which took place
only three months after the establishmen of the SAR, was unique.
"This is a move of historical significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fok also wished that HKSAR delegation's performacne at Shanghai
would help to win more governmental support and financial
investment into local sports.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Hong Kong Sports Development Board (SDB)
echoed the comments, saying that the establishment backs such
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"The SDB supports local sports assciations in their drive to
promote individual sports and would try to win more financial
support for them from the governmene, according to actual needs
and our financial capability," said Andrew Ma, SDB's Chief
Executive.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russian Backs Land-for-Peace Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov arrived here before noon today from the Lebanese
capital Beirut in an effort to help solve the Mideast peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival at Damascus International Airport, Primakov
told reporters that Russia insists on the continuation of the
Middle East peace process on the basis of the Madrid Conference
and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a co-sponsor of the peace process, together with the
U.S., at the 1991 Madrid Conference. But it has mainly absent from
this arena over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Primakov pointed out that peace negotiations should not be
affected by the change of governments. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu came to power last year and retreated from commitments
of the previous governments, including a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights it seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said he will exchange views with
Syrian President Hafez Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa
on the stalled Middle East peace process as well as bilateral ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Syria plays a key role in the Middle East
peace process and praised the ties of friendship and cooperation
between Russia and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's ongoing Mideast trip includes Lebanon, Syria, Israel
the Palestinian self-rule territories, Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here after a one-day visit to Lebanon where he met
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Stops Issuing Entry Visas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has stopped issuing
entry visas to foreigners as a security measure to the
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference, the Qatari
news agency said today.
</P>
<P>
"The measure has been taken as a precautionary step to
boost security ahead of the conference, " the news agency
quoted an official in the Qatari Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has taken effect from October 20 and will be in
force till November 20. It applies to all nationalities," the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which has been downgraded from a summit to a
ministerial level under the pressure by some Arab countries'
boycott due to the Israeli participation, is scheduled to take
place in Doha on November 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
Qatar expected some 2,900 foreign participants from more than
90 countries and international organizations will take part in the
conference which is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the other part of the world.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Ministry said that all major hotels in Doha
have been booked by the ministry and three floating hotels
have been ordered to accommodate the delegates during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
talks, Syria, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
have announced to boycott the annual conference, the fourth since
it was launch in 1994. And some other Arab states such as Egypt
have made it clear that they would participate in the conference
on condition of concrete progress in the Middle East peace

BONN -- Visiting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat today
called on the European Union (EU) to exert "constructive pressure"
on Israel so as to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting here with German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel, Arafat said the failure of the Israeli government to
fulfill its commitments under peace agreements was the only reason
for the current deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is a strategic option not only for the Palestinian
people, but also for the Israeli people. It is a necessity for
the Arab world and the Middle East region. We must protect the
peace with all the possibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 70 percent of Israel's economy was linked to
Europe, Arafat called on the EU to use its economic clout to bring
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for constructive pressure on Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu," Arafat said.

He described the U.S. as the world's most developed capitalist
country and China a major developing power. "The three joint
communiques between the two countries are the basis for
Sino-U.S. relations." said Jiang, adding that "we should properly
and earnestly implement the communiques. We still have a great
deal of work to do in this regard."

<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
announced a series of initiatives on promoting cooperation between
Britain, Europe and the Caribbean countries at the on-going
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).
</P>
<P>
During wide-ranging talks with delegates of the Carribean
Community (CARICOM) countries, British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook proposed convening a Region Forum "where all those with an
interest in the Caribbean can discuss practical measures to
address issues such as economic development and diversification,"
according to a British Foreign Office statement.
</P>
<P>
The Britain-Chaired Region Forum, which will meet early next
year, will also discuss issues on trade, tourism, investment,
drugs and money laundering.

<P>
Cook also proposed that CARICOM create a Caribbean Investment
Bureau to promote investment between Britain and Caribbean
countries with the assistance of the Invest in Britain Bureau.

<P>
In addition, the British government appoints an informal
Advisory Group of prominent British figures, mainly of Carribean
origin, to advise British government ministers on promoting
broader relations with the Caribbean.

<HEADLINE> Horror Bus Crash in S. Africa Shocks Govt, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government and political parties were shocked by a horror
collision between a bus and a petrol tanker in the Kwazulu-Natal
province that killed 33 women early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The women were burned to death when their bus collided with a
stationary fuel tanker near Mandini, a city more than 100
kilometers north of Durban, at about 4 a.m. (0200 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The bus burst into flames in impact of the collision and the
women were burned beyond recognition, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Ten other people were injured, one of them critically, in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The women, members of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) Women's
Brigade, were traveling from Port Shepstone in the south coast of
Kwazulu-Natal to the northern city of Ulundi for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
South African Acting President Thabo Mbeki learned with "shock
and disbelief" about the tragic accident, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government, the people of South Africa and
on my own behalf, I would like to convey our condolences to the
IFP, its president Inkosi (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi and the
next-of-kin," spokesman Thami Ntenteni said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the acting president had called on all road users to
take extra pre-cautionary measures and to drive safely
particularly as the festive was approaching.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents usually peak around the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
"It is tragedy that we are losing more and more of our beloved
ones through road accidents," he quoted Mbeki as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IFP reacted with shock at the accident.
</P>
<P>
IFP spokesman Hennie Bekker said: "We, in the IFP, pray that
the families and those injured will receive strength and courage
and that the sorrow and wounds may eventually heal."
</P>
<P>
IFP leader Buthelezi said he was "deeply shocked" at the news
of the accident, and expressed sincere sympathies to the injured
and the families of those killed.
</P>
<P>
He announced that a relief fund had been established for the
families of the 33 women killed in the accident and called for
donations.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the people of Kwazulu-Natal to give generously to
help pay for the funeral costs and to support the families who
have lost their mothers," Buthelezi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the fund would be made available on Monday
once the necessary formalities had been attended to.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) Ronnie
Mamoepa said his party has learned with "shock and horror" of the
untimely death of 33 IFP Women's Brigade members.
</P>
<P>
"We share the pain and grief and suffering with those who lost
their loved ones in this accident," said Mamoepa.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC policy-making National Executive Committee
expressed its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families, and
wished those wounded a speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mamoepa said the ANC extended its sympathies to IFP Women's
Brigade president, Faith Gaza, and IFP leader Buthelezi "on these
trying moments."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party also extended its condolences to the
families and friends of those who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
After the tragic crash, Transport Minister Mac Maharaj
announced a week of mourning for a total of 53 people killed in
road accidents in Kwazulu-Natal in the last six days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 11 people were killed in a crash between an
articulated truck and an open truck carrying laborers at Bulwer,
some 100 kilometers west of Durban.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, five people were killed in a collision between a
bus and a truck on the N2 highway between Port Shepstone and
Harding, a town about 60 kilometers west of the sea port.
</P>
<P>
Three other people were killed earlier today when two cars ran
into the back of a lorry on the N3 highway at Van Reenen, 250
kilometers northwest of Durban.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Transport Ministry spokesman Ranjeni Munusamy said
motorists were asked to switch on their head lights from Monday
until Friday as a sign of remembrance for those who died, and as
a commitment from the people of Kwazulu-Natal to road safety.
</P>
<P>
Munusamy said the Transport Department will appoint a
commission to investigate into the recent spate of collisions
involving heavy motor and passenger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal's top transport official is seeking an urgent
meeting with freight industry officials in the province to
discuss the matter, Munusamy said.
</P>
<P>
An "Arrive Alive" campaign is underway in the country to
enhance road safety. Police set up numerous road blocks in major
cities to curb drunk driving and other forms of reckless road
behavior.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, road accidents are frequent owing to high
speed of vehicles, among other factors. In the country, few
drivers observe speed limits.

<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A new Commonwealth regional
fund for South Asia was launched at the Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) here this afternoon, which is designed
to help regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
The South Asia Regional Fund (SARF) is the third in a planned
series of regional investment funds established following the
Africa and Pacific funds under the umbrella of the Commonwealth
Private Investment Initiative (CPII).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony at the Edinburgh
International Convention Center, Commonwealth Secretary-General
Emeka Ayaoku said: "This fund constitutes yet another example of
the Commonwealth's unique capacity to promote cooperation and
foster economic development among its member states."
</P>
<P>
"The South Asia region is generating strong demand for
investment capital, driven by rapid economic growth and continuing
economic reforms. I am confident that SARF can make a significant
contribution to the development in South Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SARF Fund, which covers the Commonwealth countries of
Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, as well as
non-Commonwealth members of Bhutan and Nepal, could finally reach
the volume of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the SARF member countries, President
Maumoon Gayoom of Maldives said that regional fund can be very
effective in implementing the CPII program and it is a timely
contribution to the development process in the South Asian
Association for Regional Corperation (SAAR) countries.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the (SARF) fund can open up new
opportunities for the flow of foreign investment capital," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which has
wide-ranging networks in the region, will be empowered to manage
the SARF Fund.

JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Palestinian youths were
wounded during clashes with Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas
and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
They were among hundreds of Palestinians demonstrating in West
Bank and East Jerusalem to demand the release of Palestinian
political prisoners jailed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The three were suffering from the effects of tear gas fired by
Israeli soldiers guarding the Jewish holy site Rachel Tomb in the
West Bank city Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were marching toward the tomb and threw stones
at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were also held in East Jerusalem and other West
Bank cities of Nablus, Hebron and Tulkam, but no clashes occurred
during the protests.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently holding about 5,000 Palestinian prisoners,
whose future will be settled through negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) on implementing their
1995 interim accords.
</P>
<P>
The peace have just been resumed after a seven-month deadlock
resulting from Israel's intransigence in building a Jewish
settlement in traditionally Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of black women
from various parts of the United States gathered in the city of
Philadelphia today to join a Million Woman March to show their
solidarity and strength.
</P>
<P>
The women stood shoulder to shoulder for more than a
kilometer in the street in a rainy weather, local TV shows. The
morning march and a daylong rally was organized by two housing
activists who relied on a grass-roots approach to reach out to
black women.
</P>
<P>
The march started with a procession beginning at 7 a.m. near
the Liberty Bell, traveling three kilometers to a stage at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the former wife of South Africa
President Nelson Mandela, was one of the speakers scheduled to
address the crowd during the daylong rally.
</P>
<P>
The rally echoes the Washington Million Man March in 1995, a
gathering of black men, and the Promise Keepers, a Christian men's
organization, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Phile Chionesu, a co-founder of the march said, "The march is a
declaration of independence against ignorance, injustice, poverty
and abuse, and all the negative things that tend to separate us as
black women and deteriorate us as a people."
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated the gathering would attract 700,000
women.

<HEADLINE> China Grants Six Locomotives to Tanzania-Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China granted today six
brand-new locomotives to the Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority
(TAZARA) in a drive to reinvigorate the major traffic line
between the two African countries.
</P>
<P>
The six sets of 3,000 horse power diesel electric locomotives
have been provided in accordance with an agreement reached by the
governments of China, Tanzania and Zambia in August of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to hand over the locomotives,
Tanzania's Minister of Communications and Transport, William
Kusila, said that the locomotives will inject vitality into the
railway whose performance has deteriorated over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
He urged railway workers to work with the new management of
TAZARA so that "the use of the six new locomotives can go towards
stopping this continued deterioration in performance."
</P>
<P>
A delegate from Zambia expressed her wish to turn the railway
into an investment corridor. "We will endeavor to ensure
investment in this corridor becomes a reality so that more
traffic will be generated," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Zhang Hongxi said the railway crystallizes
the friendship between the three peoples of Tanzania, Zambia and
China.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between China and Tanzania had exceeded 60
million US dollars by the end of September, 15 percent over the
same period of last year, said a Chinese business official.
</P>
<P>
Yang Chanxing, deputy chief engineer of the manufacturer
Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, said that the
locomotives have experimented for one month before the handover.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA officials have expressed satisfaction over the
performance of the locomotives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1860-km-long railway, streching from Tanzanian capital of
Dar es Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi of Zambia, traverses mountains,
valleys and marshland. It was built from October of 1970 to July
of 1976 under the aid of the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Axum Obelisk Will Return Home From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's national
committee for the return of the axum obelisk today announced that
the obelisk now standing in Rome will return home in April next
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, members of the
committee told Ethiopian newsmen that "the effort for the return
of the obelisk since 60 years now is nearing success thanks to
the friendly gesture of the incumbent Italian government".
</P>
<P>
They said the Italian International Technical Institute has
taken the contract to transport the obelisk homewards and
reinstate it at its original site.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian scientists and experts with the institute will work
together for the proper reinstatement of the obelisk that weighs
160 tonnes, they said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the work will be carried out in such a way
that it would not harm other heritages found at the original
site.
</P>
<P>
The axum obelisk was looted in 1937 by Italain aggressors
under the personal order of Benito Mussolini.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Lashes US Military Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today indirectly attacked the United States, saying "the
era of securing interests through force and aggression is over."
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Kuwait Minister of Social Affairs and
Labor Ahmad Khaled Al-Kulaib, the president reiterated foreign
presence is a threat to security of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The countries and forces which consider using force to achieve
their interests in the region are making a grave mistake," Khatami
said, quoted by the official news agency of IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a mistake is a source of great harm to
humanity, adding "world stability cannot be founded on aggression."
</P>
<P>
"Not only the nations won't submit to aggression, but also the
world public opinion would never condones it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has about 20,000 soldiers with its Fifth Fleet in the
Gulf and it recently sent aircraft carrier Nimitz, which has about
80 tactical aircraft on board, and its combat group of seven
destroyers, four frigates, an attack submarine and two
minesweepers to reinforce its military presence.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the region belongs to regional countries and they
should cooperate in achieving security. "The situation is ripe to
bind an accord amongst regional countries based on mutual respect,
an accord which addresses the interests of all the states in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Citing Palestinian struggle as a clear evidence of a nation's
steadfast resistance to aggression, Khatami said "we must endeavor
to build a future based on understanding and dialog and always
confront the hegemonic powers."
</P>
<P>
He said that addressing world and regional problems through
negotiations is the cornerstone of Iran's foreign policy and Iran
is ready to cooperate with regional countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait minister, who arrived in Tehran Friday to deliver a
message from the Kuwait Emir to Khatami, described relations
between the two countries as satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"The many meetings and negotiations between high ranking
officials of the two countries are evidences of progressive
relations between the two neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Iran's opposition to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait
seven years ago, saying "Kuwait will never forget Iran's
humanitarian assistance during those tough and critical years."

<HEADLINE> Trade Unions Urged to Help African Workers Live </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pan-African Workers
Conference has appealed to trade unions and workers to join hands
in improving the poor living conditions of workers.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, ended over the weekend, has
criticized that trade unions across the continent have become
less representative of workers and agreed to take measures to
reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, with the theme of "Africa for Democratic
Participation," was attended by trade union and worker
representatives as well as academicians, government officials and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conference has brought to the surface the poor living and
working conditions of African workers, their unfavroable
employment and income situation, and precarious trade union
situation in the generally unfavorable labor-management
relationship.
</P>
<P>
The participants in their resolutions also called on national
policy workshops on democratic participation to support
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
On gender equality, they called for increased participation of
women in trade union structures and other decision making bodies
underscoring that the present percentage of women's involvement
was too small.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 25 countries said it is necessary to create
conditions for the Organization of African Trade Union Unity
(OATUU) to forge closer relationship with other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
They also urge trade unions to strengthen cooperation with
universities and other civil organizations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes UN Latest Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today welcomed a
new resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council which
threatens to impose new sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's State Minister for Cabinet Affairs and official
political spokesman Abdel Aziz Al-Dakheel told reporters that
resolution 1134 which was adopted Thursday night is a "proof
of the international legitimacy consensus and determination on
forcing Baghdad to implement international commitments."
</P>
<P>
The resolution sponsored jointly by the United States and
Britain warned of adopting new punitive measures against Iraq
and threatened to impose travel ban on all Iraqi officials
and military personnel responsible for hampering the task of
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Three of the five permanent Security Council members China,
France and Russia abstained in the vote pushed through by
the U.S. and British delegations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been criticizing Iraq of continuing to hamper
the mission of U.N. weapon inspectors but Iraq said it did
not block their mission.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dhakheel said Kuwait was thankful to the countries which
voted in favor of the resolution against Iraq which occupied
Kuwait for seven months before its troops were driven out by
a U.S.-led allied armed forces during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "Kuwait sympathizes with the suffering
of the Iraqi people."

<HEADLINE> Jordan: No Deal with Israel on Palestinian Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today said that it would
not discuss with Israel any issue or project in the Jordan Rift Valley
that concerned the occupied Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin made these
remarks while meeting with visiting Palestinian Minister of Civil
Affairs Jamil Tarifi, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel are currently considering to establish a
Red-Dead Canal which runs through the desert along the Red Sea to
the Dead Sea, semi-official paper Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Part of the occupied Palestinian territories lies on the
western side of the Jordanian-Israeli border which runs from the
southern tip of the Dead Sea to the northern tip of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, both sides discussed water project
cooperation and the means to develop Jordan Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin affirmed Jordan's support for the Palestinians in the
field of water.
</P>
<P>
Neither of them disclosed details of their cooperation during
a press conference after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jordan views the Red-Dead Canal project as the backbone for the
development of the whole Jordan Rift Valley region and the only
sustainable way to resolve its worsening water shortage, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The 190-kilometer canal, which is to cost at least 5 billion
U.S. dollars, is being designed to carry water from the Red Sea to
the Dead Sea, to generate hydro-electric power, to desalinate
water, to help overcome the problem of water shortage and to save the
Dead Sea from gradual evaporation.
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Rift Valley is the southern most part of the Jordan
River Valley which runs through the whole kingdom and is one of
the main water resources for the 4 million population of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad
met with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov here this
afternoon, with the presence of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
Al-Shara, Damascus radio said.
</P>
<P>
The radio gave no further details of of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here earlier today after wrapping up a one-day
visit to Lebanon as part of his Mideast tour to resume Russian
involvement in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Greeting Primakov at the airport, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq Al-Shara lashed out at Turkey's building of a security belt
in northern Iraq, saying it would cause tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's plan (to set up the security belt) has no legitimacy
according to International Laws. Anything contrary to the
principles of International Laws and in violation of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of states would of course
give rise to tension in the region," Shara said.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish newspaper had quoted an unidentified Turkish minister
as saying that Ankara has set up a fait accompli security zone in
northern Iraq by deploying 8,000 troops and will use it as a
starting point for military operations against the its outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party militants inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An Arab League official source had also denounced the Turkish
move, calling it an open violation of the sovereignty of an Arab
state which would but increase tension and violence in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister told reporters that his country
agrees to Russia's joining in a panel monitoring the execution of
the "April Understanding" on the situation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., France, Israel, Syria, Lebanon had come to an
understanding in April 1996 and set up a commission to monitor
ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, a Russian entry should get the approval of all the
five member states of the commission.

<HEADLINE> Moscow, Grozny Call for International Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Chechen negotiators
have agreed to call an international conference on resolving the
relations between Moscow and Grozny, the Itar-Tass news agency
said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The conference could take place in Moscow, Russian Security
Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin and First Vice-Prime Minister
Movldai Udugov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin believed that a conference involving leading Russian and
foreign experts could make the negotiating process between Russia
and Chechnya more transparent and guarantee its continuity.
</P>
<P>
Udugov said the talks have been difficult so far, because the
parties stand their ground on all issues, primarily the status of
Chechnya, and "it would be problematic to bring them to a common
denominator."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the negotiators of both countries mainly
discussed the implementation of previous economic and other
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Chechen officials complained the customs agreement signed by
Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chechen president Aslan
Maskhadov has not been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin stressed the need to improve the work of the Russian and
Chechen governments to accelerate the implementation of bilateral
agreements.
</P>
<P>
On problem of hostages, Udugov said that the Chechen list
includes 1,438 people.
</P>
<P>
Rybkin noted that hundreds of people have been freed, but
hundreds more still remain in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The joint commission on a Moscow-Grozny treaty began its fifth
meeting on Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines Flex Muscles in Bright Star Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Armored amphibious assault
vehicles speeded towards the beach, helicopter gunships boomed
overhead and transport helicopters churned up columns of dust and
disgorged scores of Marines.
</P>
<P>
This is the scenario on the first day of a week-long joint
combined maneuver involving air, navy and army forces from seven
countries in this year's "Bright Star 97" military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The coalition amphibious landing, carried out this morning on
the Egyptian Mediterranean beach, about 300 kilometers northwest
of Cairo, is the culmination of months of detailed planning
between the elite U.S. Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) and its
allies.
</P>
<P>
Poised off the coast on ships of the U.S. navy's sixth fleet,
forces of Egyptian, American and British, French and Italian units
combined to form a larger task force to carry out their
synchronized, rapid and unopposed build-up of forces ashore.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. 24th MEU spokesman 1st Lt Nat Fahy, this
coalition amphibious assault is the most sophisticated,
technologically advanced version of the amphibious assault as we
know today.
</P>
<P>
Although today's operation was technically an "unopposed
landing," which means "no live fire," it is a highly complex
operation that requires extensive coordination between the allies,
according to Col Richard F. Natonski, Commanding Officer of the
24th MEU.
</P>
<P>
"Once we herded men and machine onto slow-moving landing craft,
now we have replaced them with state-of-the-art equipment,"
Natonski said as he stepped down from a LVTP-7A1 armored
amphibious vehicle that has just reached seashore.
</P>
<P>
Despite wild speculations that the concept of the maneuvers
was based on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, U.S. commander denied
that there is any "political implication" in it nor any third
parties were targeted.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is anything to do with the Gulf War,"
though the MEU carried out such brilliant operations like "Desert
Shield" and "Desert Storm" in the 1991 Gulf War, said Lt. General
Tommy R. Franks, commanding general of the Third U.S. Army.
</P>
<P>
No few than 58,000 troops from the combined forces of Britain,
Egypt, France, Italy, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and the
U.S. will be taking part in the "Bright Star 97" maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian forces will account for roughly one third of the joint
troops while the U.S. brings with it the George Washington
aircraft carrier, the US Guam helicopter carrier, Apache
helicopters, Abrams tanks and 17,200 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The exercises started as early as 1981 and are being held once
every two years except in the 1991 Gulf War. They initially
involved merely Egypt and the U.S. until forces from other
countries began to join in 1993.

<HEADLINE> German Economy to See 2.4 Percent Growth This Year: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's six leading economic
research institutes are expecting the country's economy to grow by
2.4 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, the German news
magazine Der Spiegel reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest projections, which will be formally published in the
joint Autumn economic report of the six independent institutes
next Tuesday, represent an upward revision of their Spring
projections of 2.25 percent growth for 1997 and 2.75 percent
growth for 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, they are still considerable lower than the forecast
made by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week that the economy
would expand by 2.7 to 2.8 percent in 1997 and would accelerate to
about three percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic growth, the institutes still see no
improvement on the job market. Instead, they are expecting a 1.3
percent drop in the number of jobs in Germany this year and a
stagnation next year, Der Spiegel reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, vice-chairman of the German Trade Union Federation
DGB, Ursula Engelen-Kefer, said today that Germany's unemployment
could climb further from the current level of about 4.5 million to
five million by February next year.
</P>
<P>
She threatened that if employers did not stop further job cuts,
trade unions would drop their current restraint at labour
negotiations and would demand more wage hikes.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Paper Calls for Monitoring UNSCOM Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's official newspaper
Al-Jomhouriya today called for the creation of a mechanism to
monitor the work of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1134
implies evil intentions to tighten, rather than lift sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, proposed by the U.S. and Britain, was passed on
Thursday threatening Iraq with new sanctions if it continued to
interfere with arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions imposed on Iraq were supposed to have been
eased, but what happened was that these restrictions are getting
harder despite Iraq's cooperation with the UNSCOM, AL-Jomhouria
complained.
</P>
<P>
It asked U.N. Security Council members to come to a conclusion
on what Iraq has accomplished, through studying the reports of the
UNSCOM and their embassies in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The paper said it is necessary to do so in order to avoid
passing "new, unfair resolutions" to aggravate the suffering of
the Iraqi people and open the door to serious crises.

<HEADLINE> Angola-Portugal Relations Enter New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Angola and Portugal have
decided to strengthen their economic cooperation and promote it
to a new stage of development.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres' just ended visit.
</P>
<P>
He made his first visit as the prime minister to Angola at the
invitation of Angola's Prime Minister Franca Van-Dunem from
October 20 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The five-day visit of historical significance has brought the
friendly cooperation between the two countries to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Angola and Portugal could be traced
back into ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Since the two ruling parties of Portugal, the Social party and
the Social Democratic Party, who assume power alternatively,
adopt changeable attitudes towards Angola's opposition party --
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
bilateral relations between the two countries are not steady and
have not developed in accordance with the wishes of both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, things have changed in recent years. Since 1995, for
the first time in Portugal's political life, the Portuguese
government has adopted a clear attitude towards Angola's warring
factions and showed a very strong desire to develop cooperation
with Angola. It is under such circumstances that the exchanges of
visits by the two countries' leaders at high level have been
increased, with Portuguese leaders coming to visit Angola
frequently. They expressed their willingness to assist Angola and
at the same time to develop bilateral cooperation ties. Those
visits have paved the way for the development of the bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1996, the outgoing President of Portugal
Mario Soares first visited Angola, followed by incumbent
President Jorge Sampaio who headed a delegation to the country
soon after he was at the helm of the state.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, last April, Sampaio headed a government delegation
including the House Speaker Almeida Santos, Foreign Minister
Jaime Gama as well as many other government ministers to attend
the inauguration of Angola National Reconciliation Government. He
also delivered a warm speech on the occasion and reiterated his
strong desire to strengthen the bilateral relations and the
support to Angola's peace process.
</P>
<P>
This time the Portuguese government delegation led by Prime
Minister Guterres includes 64 entrepreneurs. The main objective
of the visit is to strengthen bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Guterres reiterated that it is not an
expedient measure to develop the bilateral relations but to make
it of long-term and strategic significance so that the two sides
could benefit from it.
</P>
<P>
Some 23 agreements were sealed to this effect and they cover
investment,industry, education, environment protection and other
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Just like what the prime minister commented at the signing
ceremonies that there is no longer any obstacles which could
hinder the development of the bilateral cooperation because it is
now built upon a solid base.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has a limited territory and lacks development
potentials. A large number of technical workers are jobless and
there is an urgent need to open up foreign market.
</P>
<P>
Angola has a vast territory, and is rich in mineral resources.
It has become Portugal's foremost target of foreign policy in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Portugal can get raw materials such as petroleum from Angola
and can also make a breakthrough for the development in the south
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Now with peace in Angola, the country needs to reconstruct
itself. It needs great technical assistance which could be
provided by Portugal. It will provide opportunities for
Portugal's extra technicians and is also good for Angola to
revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two countries will surely boost
each other's economy and further develop their bilateral
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad
today told visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov that
Syria welcomes Russian role in salvaging the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Damascus radio this evening reported that Assad also urged
Russia to help seek a just and comprehensive solution to the
Middle East problem during his meeting with the Russian minister
with the presence of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Primakov arrived here earlier today after wrapping up a one-day

</P>
<P>
Assad assured the Russian official that Syria is willing to
continue the peace process, but it will only be ready to resume
peace talks with Israel from where they broke off.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister said that Russia, as one of the

Peace talks between Syria and Israel broke off earler last
year. Syria insists that the resumption of negotiations depends
upon Israel's complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights on the
basis of 1967 borders as well as balanced and equal security
arrangements. Former Israeli Labor government informally agreed to
return the Golan Heights to Syria, but the current Likud-led
government does not recognize the promise.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Xiaolangdi Project Eases Fears of Flooding (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- With the beginning of
damming today of the Yellow River by a multi-purpose dam project,
hundreds of millions of residents in the river's lower reaches
will no longer have to live with the constant fear of flooding.
</P>
<P>
The principal aim of the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project,
second in size only to the Three Gorges Project in China, is to
control the devastating flooding which has plagued the Chinese
nation for centuries.
</P>
<P>
Of the drainage basin of the Yellow River, the second longest
waterway in China, 694,000 sq. km. or 93 percent is located
upstream of the Xiaolangdi site, a strategic position for flood
and sediment control.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, Xiaolangdi dam and reservoir, 40 km northwest
of the ancient city of Luoyang, will raise the flood prevention
capacity along the river from the current 60 years to 1,000 years
for the occurrence of major catastrophic flood.
</P>
<P>
Many hydraulic experts hold that construction of Xiaolangdi
Water Control Project has changed the long-held belief that the
Yellow River could not be tamed.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has for years loomed perilously over cities at
elevations below the river bed, including Zhengzhou, capital of
Henan Province. Flooding in these areas would pose a serious
threat to all of northeast China and the Huanghe-Huaihe Plains.
</P>
<P>
Recorded history dating back 2,500 years shows that the river
has breached its banks on 1,500 separate occasions and the course
of the river has changed 26 times, resulting in high death tolls.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huaibao, a 90-year-old flood survivor, recalled a tragic
scene in 1938: "One day, when we were threshing wheat at a
grainyard, I heard someone shouting, 'the river bank has breached,
run!' People immediately climbed up to the top of houses and
trees. The water surged up and swallowed the whole village in
hours."
</P>
<P>
No large-scale flooding has occurred in the five decades since,
but Wang still climbs up to the top of the dam whenever it rains.

<P>
MADRID, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Jacques Villeneuve was
third in the last leg of the European Grand Prix in Jerez, Spain,
on Sunday but claimed this year's Formular One world championships
for Williams team.
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen of Finland completed the 4,428 kilometers circuit
running first with a time of one hour, 38 minutes and 57.772
seconds. His McLaren teammate David Coulthard of Britain finished
second with 1.654 seconds late while Villeneuve 1.802 seconds late.
</P>
<P>
German Michael Schumacher failed to make his third world
championships title for Ferrari after withdrawing in the 48th lap
as he clashed upon Villeneuve's Williams.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher made a flying start and led all the way before the
collasion.
</P>
<P>
The German led this season in the points before the final
showdown with Villeneuve, who was one point behind after he was
cut out two points in Japan leg when he didn't slow down before
yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
This was the 11th victory for the Williams driver this year.

<P>
Nevertheless, silting remains a serious problem, with
sedimentation raising the river bed in the lower reaches by some
10 cm per year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Yellow River, the world's muddiest
river, carries over 1.6 billion tons of sand annually, with each
cubic meter of water containing 35 kg of sand -- 69 times the
level in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
After years of study, Chinese hydraulics experts have found a
solution: building a large reservoir between Sanmenxia and
Huayuankou. Xiaolangdi Village, located at the middle reach of
Yellow River and 130 km downstream of Sanmenxia, was chosen as the
site, where there could be the largest possible storage capacity
for a reservoir.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the flood control capacity of Xiaolangdi will be more
than all the existing 160 reservoirs along the Yellow River put
together.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
the State Council have high hopes for and attach great importance
to the project. General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central
Committee, and Premier Li Peng, have both inspected the
construction site several times.
</P>
<P>
The 40-billion yuan project will be of great benefit to the
people, said Zhang Jiyao, vice minister of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiurong, a 60-year-old villager, said she has been waiting
for the reservoir to be built since she got married in Xiaolangdi
at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The dam project has won support from the World Bank and other
international organizations. More than 10,000 workers, including
700 engineers from 50 countries and regions, are working day and
night at the dam area.
</P>
<P>
Olivier Collin, a German engineer, said, "The Yellow River is
of special significance to the Chinese people. I saw the revival
of an ancient nation at Xiaolangdi."
</P>
<P>
However, some hydraulic experts said that Yellow River
continues to be the toughest river to tame, and they expect their
descendants to harness it in a more scientific way.

XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Four hours after the damming
operation was launched, the flow width of the Yellow River,
China's second longest, was narrowed from 106 meters to 83.64
meters.
</P>
<P>
The operation for the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project started
at 4:15 p.m. today. The damming will take a total of 42 hours to
complete.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Xi, who is in charge of the damming, the
operation is well underway, with 33 large trucks dumping about
3,000 cubic meters of stone into the river each hour.
</P>
<P>
"The river flow is not strong, and it is good for the damming
operation, which is expected to be completed a little bit ahead of
schedule," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The work will continue round-the-clock, until the two sides of

BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official today
stressed the importance of comprehensive development in
agriculture while visiting an agriculture exhibition here.
</P>
<P>
The full-scale development, which has been successful in the
past ten years, should be continued and promoted, said Tian Jiyun,
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a visit to the Exhibition on Ten
Years' Achievements of the National Comprehensive Development in
Agriculture, which attracted 31 units with about 60,000 kinds of
products on display.
</P>
<P>
Tian said more than 13 million hectares of high-yield land has
been cultivated, since the comprehensive development program was
launched in the 1980s, which means an increase of 40 percent in
the national grain output capacity.
</P>
<P>
The program was a major strategic measure to stablize and raise
the fluctuating grain output volume through issuing preferential
policies for agriculture and launching state agricultural
projects.

NANJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Sunan Canal, the southern
stretch of Beijing-Hangzhou Canal, was opened to navigation today
upon completion of a harnessing project in east China's Jiangsu
province.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70,000 workers spent five years and two months to
complete the project, which involved a total investment topping
2.7 billion yuan (about 325 million U.S. dollars). About 8,945-mu
(about 596 hectares) of land was taken over for use and houses of
693,000 sq meters of housing were torn down. Forty-two bridges and
286 bank revetments have been built, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Beijing-Hangzhou Canal, the longest man-made canal in the world
and a symbol of China, boasts a bustling water transport operation.
</P>
<P>
The southern stretch of Beijing-Hangzhou Canal, about 208 km
long, flows southwards through Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi and
Suzhou cities in Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The navigation will help develop the economy of Jiangsu
Province and the Yangtze Delta.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Not to Block Spain's Bid for NATO's Integrated Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain is reportedly expected
to give up its objection against Spain's request for entry into
NATO's integrated military command system.
</P>
<P>
The policy change, the press here reported today quoting
Spanish officials as saying, would help pave the way for NATO's
reform of its commanding mechanism in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The officials, whose names were withheld, said Britain had
already agreed to delink Spain's bid for the integrated military
command system with the bilateral dispute over Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar, a town and port on the south coast of Spain,
formerly belonged to Spain but now is a British colony.
</P>
<P>
As the two countries both claim sovereignty over Gibraltar,
Spain has been imposing restrictions over activities on the waters
and in the air space around the disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
What provides Britain as a leverage against these restrictions
is Spain's bid to fully incorporate into NATO and join the Western
military alliance's commanding mechanism in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Spain became NATO's 16th, and the newest, member in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed NATO reform program, a new military command
will open in Madrid once Spain enters into the integrated system,
and a current commanding post in Gibraltar will be closed.
</P>
<P>
However, in July, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told a
NATO summit in Madrid that his country would veto the closure in
Gibraltar if Spain does not lift its restrictions there.
</P>
<P>
The British stance was rejected by the Spanish government, and
objected by other NATO members, who termed it as "unacceptable,"
as it brought a bilateral dispute into the NATO reform process.
</P>
<P>
And as a latest development, Spanish officials said, the
British government agreed to close the command post in Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, it agreed with its Spanish counterpart
to re-start negotiations about Gibraltar's status after Spain
successfully joins NATO's integrated military command system.

navigating the development path of the country's socialist
cultural undertakings and meeting the public's increasing demand
for cultural pursuits, State Councillor Li Tieying said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on cultural work in the capital city of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, Li said that the Party
congress has clearly defined the status, nature, objectives, and
major content and tasks of socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the guiding principle of the congress concerning
cultural undertakings is of practical use, and priority should be
placed on studying and carrying out the guidelines of the congress
in daily life, said Li, who is also member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theory on cultural undertakings is an important
component of Deng Xiaoping Theory as a whole and has become the
guide for cultural development, Li said, adding that thriving
cultural and arts projects must serve the people and socialism. He
noted that China has many flourishing and competitive schools for
the arts.
</P>
<P>
The socialist culture should be inspiring, reflect people's
real life and emphasize social benefits rather than economic
returns, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To advance cultural undertakings with Chinese characteristics
throughout China's primary stage of socialism is necessary to
achieve coordinated economic, political and cultural development
of the country and meet the people's increasing demand for a
better cultural life, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the country's reform and opening-up, cultural
undertakings have entered a booming period. However, they still
cannot satisfy the wants of the people who are beginning to enjoy
a fairly comfortable life, Li said.
</P>
<P>
More attention should be paid to updating the theory on
cultural undertakings, enlist more people to join cultural
circles, promote the cultural productions, and better manage
cultural undertakings, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in a socialist market economy, reform is the
way to ensure the success of cultural undertakings, including the
reform of state-owned performance organizations and a wider
opening of cultural facilities to the public.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Speakers on Poverty, Illiteracy, Overpopulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Speakers of South Asian
countries today called for overcoming poverty, illiteracy and
overpopulation in the region.
</P>
<P>
They noted that these problems had defied vast natural and
human resources, and deprived one fifth of humanity of fruits of
progress, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The speakers made their call at the second conference of
speakers and parliamentarians of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which opened here this morning and
is attended by delegates from India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Sri
Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal and the host, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Speaker of National Assembly Illahi Bukhush Soomro
said that South Asia is the poorest part of the world.
</P>
<P>
In this region's countries, overpopulation, poverty, low
literacy and shortage of basic amenities are a big threat to the
social and economic order, he said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the SAARC are peace, prosperity and people's
development, said Soomro. "We should work together to achieve
them."
</P>
<P>
P. A. Sangma, Speaker of India's Lok Sabha, said that South
Asia accounts for only 3.3 percent of the world's land surface but
its population of 1.2 billion is 20 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
"Our contribution to the world income is only 1.3 percent,"
said Sangma, "But we are the abode for nearly half of the world's
illiterate, and we have about 160 million malnourished children."
</P>
<P>
He identified alarming rate of population growth as a main
weakness of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"International trade is a proven strategy for economic growth,"
Sangma said. "We should concentrate in this area, keeping aside
our political differences for the moment."
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Bangladesh Parliament Humayun Rasheed Chaudhry in
his address also highlighted overpopulation as the main hurdle in
the way of progress.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parliamentarians to focus on tackling the issues
of overpopulation and poverty by addressing them at both
governmental and people's levels.
</P>
<P>
Dasho Kinzang Dorji, Speaker of Bhutan's National Assembly,
called for promoting economic cooperation among the SAARC member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Nepalese Parliament Ram Chandra Pudel called for
active role from all the member countries in combating the
problems in a concerted manner.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the conference, which will run
until October 28, will discuss ways to promote people's contact
among the member countries, and cooperation among the
parliamentary institutions of the member countries.

<P>
XIAMEN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen Airlines has opened two
new flights, between Macao and Fuzhou, the capital of east China's
Fujian province, and between Macao and Xiamen, the provincial
special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Both flights will operate round-trip once a day. For the first
time, the company has used its own flight identification -- MF --
since it gained the right to run international flights in January

</P>
<P>
In August 1996, Xiamen Aviation Company launched the Fuzhou to
Macao route by chartered planes in cooperation with an aviation
company from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Airlines is China's first regional civil aviation
enterprise. It is jointly-run by the Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC) and the aviation office of Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the company operates 16 Boeing airplanes and has
opened more than 80 domestic flights since it was established in
1984. The company transports over three million passengers every
year.
</P>
<P>
So far, it registers a total capital of four billion yuan (500
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the company would continue to cooperate with
aviation companies from Taiwan and Macao, which would in turn
contribute to their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, tourists from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia could
travel back and forth from Fuzhou and Xiamen via Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The study of the essence of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
should be linked with practical conditions and aimed at solving
practical problems for the people, senior Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
Li, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made the
remarks during an inspection tour from October 21-25 in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
He called on local officials to study earnestly the experiences
in the course of their work so as to fully carry out the Deng
Xiaoping Theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Also, Li urged local officials to work out a good strategy for
local development, further improve their development programs, and
strive to make breakthroughs in solving the major problems in the
localities.
</P>
<P>
Also, officials should establish close relations with the
masses, carefully consider the interests and aspirations of the
public, and work hard to resolve the problems facing the people,
for all the reform measures put forth at the party congress have a
direct bearing on the interests of the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Good resolution of the people's problems represent a reliable
guarantee for the success of our course," Li said.
</P>
<P>
While visiting a number of urban and rural areas, Li noted that
the province has scored rapid economic growth over the past
several years. However, it faces the arduous task of helping the
impoverished people in the rural areas, and some state-owned
enterprises are still in difficulties, he observed.
</P>
<P>
With solid industrial and agricultural foundations, abundant
natural resources, and a large number of talented personnel,
Sichuan has good potentials for future development, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The pandemic of tuberculosis
(TB) and Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) is posing a serious
threat to TB control across South Asia as 40 percent of global TB
cases are recorded in this region with one million deaths per
year, experts said at a regional meeting which began here today.
</P>
<P>
They said there is clear evidence that HIV infection activates
TB in people with dormant TB by weakening their immune system and
that TB may speed up the progression to AIDS in HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Health Minister Shanti Shamsher Rana stressed the need
to strengthen the training, supervision and education to produce
trained manpower at all levels and involve the community to
control TB while inaugurating the seventh Governing Board Meeting
of SAARC TB Center and the workshop relating to research on TB and
HIV in the SAARC member countries, Nepal's official RSS news
agency reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao to Open Up Mobile Phone Service Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Macao plans to open up its mobile
 phone service market early next year, and two to three mobile
phone service companies are expected to gain operation rights.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lopes, director of the Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department, told the Tai Chung Pou newspaper
that a set of new telecommunications regulations are being
formulated to open up the mobile phone service market.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Telecommunications Company (CTM), which currently
monopolizes the local market under agreement with the government,
will only run the domestic telephone and long distance telephone
services in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations, upon approval by the Sino-Portuguese Joint
 Liaison Group (JLG), is expected to be promulgated and come into
effect early next year, he said, adding that the government will
add two to three more operators of the mobile phone service
through public bidding.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cost of using mobile phone service will drop
markedly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the director said that his department is
negotiating with the CTM on the further reduction of the price of
long distance calls, which has drawn lots of complaints. He said
the price cut may start next January.
</P>
<P>
The losses CTM will suffer due to the opening of mobile phone
service will be compensated through extending its monopoly terms,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Governments Urged to Act Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Governments in the Asian-Pacific
region should make political commitment and take visible action
against the spread of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), a
senior U.N. health official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), was speaking to reporters on the
second day of the 4th International Meeting on AIDS in Asia and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Piot said it is encouraging that the Association of Southeast
Asia Nations, particularly the Philippines, has promised to bring
the campaign against HIV/AIDS to its political agenda.
</P>
<P>
AIDS is the acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome caused by HIV,
which can be infected through sexual contact, injecting drug use
and blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the deadly disease will cause serious
socio-economic impact in the region, including rising medical cost
and decreasing markets as a result of losing human resources, Piot
warned.
</P>
<P>
Taking Cambodia as an instance, Piot said that as one of the
poor countries in the world Cambodia will have to allot as much as
2.8 billion U.S. dollars in the anti-HIV/AIDS campaign by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Piot said governments should give priority to prevention in the
fight against HIV/AIDS, such as promotion of condom use.
</P>
<P>
Prevention is the most important way in checking the spread of
the epidemic and it is easy for governments to take prevention
measures against AIDS, which are "not highly expensive," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the five-day AIDS meeting earlier today, Piot
warned that the Asia-Pacific region, the world's most populous
region, is fast becoming a region with most HIV infections in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The number of estimated HIV infections doubled in the region
during the last three years to between 5 and 7 million, he said,
adding that it could easily double again by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian countries, India was thought to have the
largest population of between 3 and 5 million living with HIV,
according to Piot.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which discussed the current status of HIV/AIDS in
the Asia-Pacific region today, will focus on socio-economic issues
related to HIV/AIDS in the region and ways to curb the spread of
the disease in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS, established in January 1996, is the leading
advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS. It brings together six
U.N. agencies in a common effort to fight the epidemic: the U.N.
Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Population
Fund, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister has
said that 400 to 600 companies are expected to attend the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference scheduled for
next month in its capital Doha, the Qatari news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabri al Thani
made the remarks Saturday at the opening session of a meeting for
business executives on the Qatari private sector's role in the
MENA conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign participation in the November 16-18
conference would be larger than expected, adding that a large
number of countries, especially those from Europe, America and
Asia, would attend the conference at the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention any Arab countries, most of which have not
announced whether they would attend the conference, which would be
boycotted by some Arab countries due to an Israeli participation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has sent invitations to more than 90 countries and
international organizations. The Qatari foreign minister said
that so far, more than 50 countries have signed up their
participation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has downgraded the conference from a summit to the
ministerial level under the pressure by some Arab countries'
boycott.
</P>
<P>
In protest against the deadlock in the Arab-Israeli peace
talks, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
have threatened to boycotted the conference.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have not attended all the previous three
conference held in Casablanca, Amman and Cairo, in which Israel
took part.
</P>
<P>
The conference is traditionally attended by Arab states, Israel
and their major partners in the other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Be Tough With Military Coups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, Ooctober 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said coups
agaist democratically elected governments could not be accepted, and
the organization would be tough with military coups in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Mail in Harare yesterday,
Salim said it had to be accepted that mistakes were made by the
OAU during the 1960s because the organization then appeared to
accept coups as a way of life and regarded them as internal
problems.
</P>
<P>
''But now in Harare a decision was taken that coups against
democratically elected governments could not be accepted and that
the role of military in society was to guarantee territorial
national integrity and leave politics to popularly elected
governments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He regarded the OAU summit in Harare in June this
year as having been a turning point with regards to the
phenomenon of military coups against democratically elected
governments.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the message was getting home forcing
would-be coup-makers to understand that they would not be
welcome.
</P>
<P>
The military regimes, which declared that the civilian
governments had been corrupt, nepotistic and so forth, had
worsened the situation and never abandoned the corrupt practices
they accused the ousted governments of having been guilty of, the
OAU chief said.
</P>
<P>
On the just ended the OAU defence chiefs meeting, Salim said
the objective of the meeting is not to usurp the functions of the
U.N. because peacekeeping was enshrined in the U.N. Charter as
one of the international body's main functions. But, he said,
there are cases whereby the reaction of the U.N. is rather slow
and Africa is saying its people know their conditions better and
probably can react faster.
</P>
<P>
On democracy in Africa, Salim said the democratization process
in Africa is irreversible and that nobody, even those that are
inclined to dictatorship, could openly argue against democracy
because it is the people themselves who are demanding it and
will benefit during the process.
</P>
<P>
He noted democracy should be the logical outcome of ''our
people's struggle".

<HEADLINE> Egypt Maps Out Privatization Program for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt plans to sell 15 public
sector trade firms and 35 hotel companies for public subscription
within the privatization program for next year, today's Egyptian
Gazette reported.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program for 1998 was approved Saturday at a
Ministerial Privatization Committee meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it decided to add seven state-owned maritime
companies to the list of companies Egypt plans to privatize in
1997, thus raising the number of companies to be privatized in
1997 to 106.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters following
the meeting that the meeting reviewed an implementation program
for the 76 public sector companies whose shares were offered for
total or partial sale in the stock exchange in 1997, adding that
the government planned to sell the shares of 22 companies before
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed that workers of a privatized company are
allowed to own up to 10 percent of the company's shares in
accordance with the employee stock ownership program, Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
The early approval of the 1998 plan for privatization means
that the holding companies should begin rectifying the financial
structures of their affiliated companies to be sold and settling
their debts so that they would attract potential investors, said
Ganzouri following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The share of the private sector in Egypt's economic activities
has increased from 39 percent in early 1980s to 55 percent
in 1996-97, the government said in July. Meanwhile, the private
sector's contribution to the gross domestic product increased from
51 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
Egypt kicked off the privatization program to reduce government
involvement in the economy in 1991, but it has only got seriously
involved in privatization since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has promised to privatize more than 300 state-owned
companies.

<HEADLINE> Unicef Program Promises Poor Chinese Women a Well-off Future(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Six months ago, Peng Muying's
desire to start her own tailoring business was but a castle in the
air costing an unaffordable 1,000 yuan (120 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"I always dreamed of living a better life by running my own
tailoring shop, but 1,000 yuan is really a large sum for me and my
family," said the 18-year-old girl, who lives with her parents.
The four-member family earns about 2,600 annually.
</P>
<P>
To get her business off the ground, Peng got a loan from the
Social Development Program for Poor Areas (SPPA), an aid-the-poor
project initiated by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef)
in China. She now makes 300 yuan a month.
</P>
<P>
The micro-credit program grants each woman no more than 1,000
yuan to start small-scale business, like pig-raising or opening a
grocery, said Lin Fei, national program officer for SPPA.
</P>
<P>
The loan and the interest must be repaid within 14 months, she
said.
</P>
<P>
SPPA assistance has also been given to many of Peng's fellow
villagers in Luzhen, located over 100 kilometers from Hefei,
capital of Anhui Province in central China, since the spot was
chosen as a trial site for the SPPA program last year.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the residents of Luzhen earn less than 650 yuan
(about 80 US dollars) each year, most of them women.
</P>
<P>
Peng and 248 other women there received loans after completing
a six-month special skills training course.
</P>
<P>
"Unicef cares about the situation and is willing to help these
poor women and their children," Lin said. "But they should learn
some skills to help themselves, instead of simply getting some
relief fund and then spending it."

<P>
From the outset, the women discussed each others business plans
to ensure the ventures were practical and low-risk.
</P>
<P>
"I chose to open the tailoring shop because I like tailoring,
and more importantly, there is no such shop in our village," Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of business, Peng, along with 248 other
women in Luzhen, who were put on the program, earned a total
profit of 181,000 yuan, or 700 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most effective poverty-relief method ever
implemented here. We should learn something from it, such as
strict management on loan providing and payment," said village
head Du Shizhong.
</P>
<P>
"The SPPA project can also help improve the education, health
care and hygiene conditions of those poor women and their
children," said Lin Fei. "Only when the quality of rural women is
improved can the root of poverty be removed. That's our ultimate
aim."
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and local governments, Unicef is carrying out SPPA
program in 24 counties of 15 provinces and autonomous regions. It
plans to pledge a total of over seven million US dollars for the
work in China by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> Historic Visit to Push Forward Sino-US Relations: Macao Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The historic visit by China's
President Jiang Zemin to the United States will help push forward
the cooperative relations between the two countries, a commentary
in today's Macao Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The first visit to the U.S. by a Chinese state leader in 12
years marks the entry of a new relationship built on a strategic
basis, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The strategic basis, it said, means that the two sides share
many bilateral common interests and a "wide range of common
strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
Those interests involve such hot topics as world peace and
development, the establishment of a new world order, disarmament,
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass
destruction, environmental protection, anti-terrorism, and the
settlement of regional disputes, among others.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that close cooperation between the two
countries is needed if those issues are to be addressed
effectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a huge potential in cooperation in the economic
and trade field has laid down a strong economic foundation for the
"common strategic interests," it said.
</P>
<P>
While giving prominent coverage to Jiang's visit, the paper
said the upcoming summit meeting between China and the U.S. would
pave the way for a framework of new relations that will last to
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tai Chung Pou newspaper said that President
Jiang's visit to the U.S. will have significant and far-reaching
influence on the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-language newspaper said because the two sides
share many common interests, they should seek cooperation and
develop relationship by seeking common ground while putting aside
differences in ideology and political system.
</P>
<P>
"A new type of strategic partnership relations between China
and the U.S. will be a decisive factor for the peace and
development of the Asia-Pacific region and the entire world in the
21st century," it said. "That will also be happy news for mankind."
</P>
<P>
The Correio Sino-Macaense newspaper predicts that the Sino-U.S.
summit will help resolve the Taiwan issue, which it said is the
most important and most sensitive part of the Sino-U.S.
relationship.
</P>
<P>
"The summit meeting will make the U.S. side reiterate its
political promise of upholding the 'one China' policy, and keep to
the spirit and principles laid down in the three joint
communiques," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, the cross-straits relations will
continue to ease up for quite a long time," the newspaper added.
"That will help create an environment for the political dialog
across the Taiwan Straits and the final reunification of China."

</P>
<P>

contacts and consultations between leaders of the two countries on
issues of common concern are conducive to mutual understanding and
trust and to the development and consolidation of the friendly
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on entrepreneurs of the two countries to have more
exchanges and asked more Chinese companies to contract for
projects in Laos.
</P>

issues left over from history nor disputes at present; there is
every reason for them to carry out effective and fruitful
cooperation in all fields.

<HEADLINE> Pak President Calls for Eradicating Poverty in S. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari today called upon parliamentarians of South Asian
countries to play an effective role in addressing the issues of
poverty and illiteracy from the region which is home to one fifth
of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Leghari was speaking here this morning at the inaugural
ceremony of the second conference of speakers and parliamentarians
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),
which is attended by delegates from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the host, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the problems of poverty and illiteracy in the
region, Leghari said, "Without addressing ourselves to these
humbling facts, the pursuit of glory and prestige in any field can
only be a meaningless exercise."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot shut our eyes to the reality that despite the
incomparable richness of our cultural and civilizational
inheritance, our region has just about the world's poorest
economic, social and human development indices," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that political parties, legislatures and
parliamentarians of the region had an especially critical role to
play to address these problems.
</P>
<P>
"They shall have the task of formulating, debating and enacting
essential enabling legislation as well as developing the necessary
political perspectives which can enable us to resolve difficulties
that lie in our way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leghari stressed the need for strengthening the
structures of peace and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"In its drive to maturity it is also expected that SAARC shall
evolve formal and informal forums and procedures for mutual
consultations that will strengthen the structures of peace and
development in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the delegates to consider a range of specific measures
for the strengthening of parliamentary consultations and exchanges
in a number of technical, economical, social and ecological
fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Leghari said, "We need to collectively deliberate
upon broader trends in the world and in our region so as to ensure
that our policies towards each other and towards the world in
general are in conformity with the imperatives of the global
economy and the parameters of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the conference, which will run
until October 28, will discuss ways and means to promote people's
contact among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
It will also discuss cooperation among the parliamentary
institutions of the member countries.

KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is expected to
replace the foreigners now employed in its administrative agencies
with Kuwaitis from next July in a bid to reduce unemployment, a
Kuwaiti official was quoted today as saying.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Trapped in Manila's Traffic Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- It is believed that everyone
living in Metro Manila has the experience of being trapped in the
unthinkable thickness of traffic either under the burning sun or
in heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic jams have been part of the Filipinos' daily
life. To commute between home and office, some of them have to
spend three to four hours waiting in agonizing anxiety in the
paralyzed traffic.
</P>
<P>
Manila is rivaling Bangkok in terms of traffic mess and there
have been stories told about it: a traveler departing from Manila
airport arrives in Hong Kong before the people seeing him or her
off get back home; a businessman started driving home at 7 p.m. in
a heavy rain and reached his destination at 8 a.m. the next day;
and a commuter ran amuck and shot dead several people after being
caught in the traffic for a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
Believe them or not, traveling in Manila is becoming a both
mental and physical suffering. With an averaged car speed of 12
kilometers per hour, passengers are advised to restrain their
anger, try every means to be patient or take a quick nap before
the traffic flow moves again.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, the traffic problem is now one of
the "bottlenecks" impeding the country's economic development,
causing an annual financial loss of 15 billion pesos (450 million
U.S. dollars). The amount represents the drain in money caused by
inefficient fuel consumption, unproductive man-hours, damaged car
parts and government investments to cope with the nasty problem.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the traffic mess is the result of a number of
problems, including inadequate infrastructure, inefficient
management, the poor traffic light system and lack of discipline
on the part of both drivers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
Manila now accommodates 1.6 million registered vehicles, about
65 percent of the country's total. In addition, nearly 3,000 new
cars are added to the already very crowded streets every month
while a huge number of dilapidated vehicles called "flying
coffins" are hanging on.
</P>
<P>
However, the capital city shares only 20 percent of the
country's road network. To aggravate the situation, the Philippine
government has spent only an average of three percent of its gross
national product on infrastructure in the past few years, much
lower than Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and other countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The traffic light system also does not help the flow of
traffic. At most intersections, the drivers can see either an
outdated or defunct traffic light system or no lights at all. As a
result, they don't know whether to proceed or stop if no traffic
enforcers guide them.
</P>
<P>
The lack of discipline by the drivers and the commuters is also
making the traffic worse. In Metro Manila, a kind of passenger
vehicle called jeepney is sighted everywhere. To make more money,
most jeepney drivers like to race on the road, or stop wherever
they want, showing no courtesy at all to other road users.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most passengers do not like to go to regular
stations, they just stand in the middle of the road or other
improper places to wait for a jeepney.
</P>
<P>
First things first. Traffic authorities' inefficient management
is the most contributing factor to the traffic mess, experts said,
adding that it is too easy to get a driving license in the country
and that police are not very strict in implementing traffic rules
and some of them even take pretty bribes from traffic violators.
</P>
<P>
To ease the traffic chaos, the Metro Manila Development
Authority (MMDA) has tried many ways, but failed to improve the
situation. Its latest programs include the Unified Vehicle
Reduction Program (UVRP) and the Vehicular Occupancy Optimization
Scheme (VOOS).
</P>
<P>
Under the UVRP, vehicles are banned one day a week from all
roads between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., depending on the last digit of
their plate number. The VOOS program stipulates that vehicles with
less than three occupants shall be restricted from using major
roads.
</P>
<P>
Facing protest from the masses, the MMDA has buried several
other drastic measures such as the express lane scheme and the
odd-even way which bans a vehicle three days a week.
</P>
<P>
These programs have reportedly reduced the traffic volume by 35
to 40 percent. But local people still don't feel the difference
and experts said the only way out is to curb the growth of private
cars and develop the public transport system.
</P>
<P>
Since September, people have found that Manila's traffic is
even worse than ever. The MMDA said this is due to several light
railway projects being constructed in the city. These projects
have occupied the inner lanes of some thoroughfares, thus
obstructing the flow of the traffic.
</P>
<P>
The MMDA said the traffic in Manila would remain the status quo
before these projects are completed in 2001. But will the
situation be largely improved after 2001? Experts said the only
answer is "wait and see."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Arrests 955 Illegal Expatriate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has arrested
a total of 955 illegal foreign laborers residing in the Kingdom
during the first five days of a campaign to clamp down on illegal
residents, a senior Saudi official said today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi director general of the Interior Ministry's passports
Assad Abdel Karim was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying
that the arrests were made following a three-month amnesty
allowing the illegal residents to leave the country without any
punishment, which expired on October 17.
</P>
<P>
Saudi police and immigration officials have been raiding
businesses and housing blocks across the country in a crackdown
on illegal foreign workers in a bid to catch unlawful expatriate
laborers after the expiration of the grace period, Karim said.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, mostly from India, southeast Asia and other poor
Arab countries, make up one third of Saudi population of 18
million population. No official figures of illegal foreign
residents in the kingdom are available, but independent sources
put the number at More than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
So far about 400,000 illegal residents have left the kingdom
for their home countries.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities announced in July a three-month period
allowing the illegal residents leave the country without
penalties and warned that those who did not leave the country
volunntarily in the period would face punishment of up to
100,000 Saudi Riyals (26,000 U.S. dollars) and a two-year
imprisonment to be followed by deportation.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Ministry warned people sheltering illegal
workers that they could also face jail terms of up to six months
and a 13,000 U.S. dollars fine.

<HEADLINE> Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for Chinese (3) II. Protection of Workers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Labour Law promulgated in 1994 states that workers have
equal right to employment, the freedom to choose their jobs, and
the right to training, holidays and vacations, pay, labor safety,
health, social security, and welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages people to find jobs through labor
departments or on their own by getting organized or forming
companies. To create more job opportunities, the government has
established many employment agencies and vocational training
centers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, there were 31,000 job agencies, 2,716
employment centers, and 200,000 service establishments which
provide nine million people with jobs. Labor departments' job
placement agencies helped 70 million people, 30 million of whom
were unemployed, in the 1983-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that, by September 1997, there were
about eight million unemployed, of whom six million had just been
laid off, putting the unemployment rate at around four percent.
</P>
<P>
To solve the unemployment problem, especially for people who
have been out of work for more than six months or who have
financial difficulties, China has developed a re-employment plan,
which has helped more than six million jobless people find work
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen thousand vocational schools provide training for more
than eight million students, and 4,467 technical schools enroll
700,000 people every year. More than a million people received
training in different types of programs in 1996.

Laws and regulations in 1995 reduced the 48-hour week to a
40-hour week, so that all workers get two days off each week. They
also enjoy national holidays with full pay. Women have a minimum
90-day maternity leave with pay, and people who live apart from
their parents or spouses are given vacations for family reunion
once a year.
</P>
<P>
China guarantees by law full pay for labor and equal pay for
equal work, regardless of sex, age, or race. State regulations
have set standards for the minimum of wages, and all provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central
Government have their own standards, with the exception of a few.
</P>
<P>
Workers' wages increase with economic development. Per capita
income for urban workers averaged 2,140 yuan in 1990 and 6,210
yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Laws and regulations also protect safety and hygiene in
factories, and deal with occupational hazards and safety in mines,
safety inspections and a supervisory system for the measures.
</P>
<P>
The laws and regulations have prompted enterprises to improve
working conditions and to create a safe and clean environment, and
China has increased spending on improved working condition. Twenty
million yuan is spent annually on labor protection technology, and
the number of injuries and deaths in Chinese factories have
continued to fall in recent few years.

A social security system provides workers with insurance for
retirement, illness, injuries in industrial accidents,
occupational hazards, unemployment or maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, pension insurance had been introduced in
state and collective enterprises in urban areas, and 87.58 million
employees and 23.58 million retirees had joined the plan, and
103.2 billion yuan was paid out to pensioners in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the pensioners' livelihood, pension funds have been
established and their pensions have been revised upward to the
extent of 40-60 percent of the increases of their average wages in
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Medical expenses for serious illness are covered by a special
type of fund and the retirees' medical expenditures have
increased, and 7.91 million workers and 640,000 pensioners have
participated in the medical fund.
</P>
<P>
More than thirty million employees have taken out industrial
injury insurance policies in 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities. The country now has 2,000 unemployment insurers
and 89 million employees are now covered by this type of
insurance, and 20.16 million people are covered by birth insurance.

population and TV coverage of 86.2 percent. Seventeen provincial
and municipal TV stations broadcast via satellite, and the number
of subscribers to cable TV had come to 50 million by 1996.
</P>
<P>
That year, 22 film studios produced 110 feature films and
distributed 174 new full-length films, 11 of which won awards at
international film festivals.
</P>
<P>
China's 2,689 art troupes put on 400,000 performances,
attracting 400 million people.
</P>
<P>
China has 2,641 public libraries, a 47-fold increase from 1949,
with a total collection of over 300 million volumes. The country

<TEXT>
<P>
China's cultural development is in response to increasing
demands for cultural life. Now both urban and rural people spend
more on education, culture, and entertainment. These accounted for
9.6 percent of per capita expenditures in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There are 102 color TV sets per 100 urban households on
average, and 87.97 per 100 rural households, 76.23 sets more than
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there were 640 million Chinese travelling in China,
spending 163.8 billion yuan on tourism.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, as a developing country limited by natural
conditions, China cannot avoid certain problems in promoting the
people's economic, social, and cultural rights. There are still
over 50 million Chinese without enough food and clothing. Many are
illiterate, and economic and cultural standards simply are not
high enough. There are still violations of human rights in social
life.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the task of the Chinese government and the people to
continue improving economic, social, and cultural rights still
lies in developing the economy, improving the system of democracy
and legality, and promoting socialist culture and ethics.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Determined to Promote Cruise Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority
(KPA) has launched a marketing strategy to promote cruise tourism
and about 17 luxury cruise liners are expected to call at the
Mombasa Port before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
KPA Managing Director Lenny Mwangola said in a press statement
issued this week that KPA was determined to promote the Mombasa
Port as a major and attractive cruise destination in the east
African region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the first of the 17 vessels arrived at
Kilindini Harbor of the port this week where the cruise liner TSS
Albatros disembarked 172 tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the KPA would keep regular contacts with the
cruise liner owners and invite charterers to participate in
various international cruise conventions.
</P>
<P>
The port boss stated that the KPA had already invited cruise
line operators to undertake facility visits at the port and
spearheaded a campaign to sensitize the customs and immigration
departments on how to improve services to boost cruise tourism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the KPA had formed a Cruise Ship Facilitation
Committee which was aimed at removing the obstacles hindering the
growth of cruise tourism.
</P>
<P>
The port chief executive pointed out that plans were under way
to form an Indian Ocean cruise association with membership from
13 member port states.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Mombasa Port handled 55 cruise ship calls with
18,000 tourists either embarking or disembarking at the port.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Xiaolangdi Water Control Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River, China's
second longest, is being blocked today for the multi-purpose dam
project at Xiaolangdi, in Henan province.
</P>
<P>
The project is the largest on the Yellow River and consists of
three parts: the dam, a water diversion and sediment system, and a
power plant.
</P>
<P>
The rockfill dam is 154 meters high and is 1,317 m. long.
</P>
<P>
The total storage capacity of the reservoir is 12.65 billion
cu.m., and is second only to the Three Gorges
reservoir. Ninety-three percent of the Yellow River's
694,000-sq.km. drainage area is located upstream from the
Xiaolangdi Dam site.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the project is control of flood, ice and
silt, water supply, and power generation. It will prevent the
sorts of floods that occur every thousand years while existing
facilities can only cope the lesser ones that occur every 60 years
like those that occurred recently.
</P>
<P>
Xiaolangdi has been considered one of the most challenging jobs
in the history of engineering because of the 16 tunnels and the
generating plant that are to be built under a sandy hill on the
northern bank.
</P>
<P>
Construction work started in September, 1994 and will be
completed by 2001. It will cost 40 billion yuan, 1.1 billion US
dollars worth of funds coming from World Bank loans. Bids for the
work came in from all over the world.

XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Damming operations have
started for the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project in Luoyang in
Henan Province on the Yellow River, China's second longest.
</P>
<P>
At 16:15, six trucks, side by side on the river's southern
bank, simultaneously dumped the first load of stones into the
river.
</P>
<P>
The damming will take 42 hours to complete. Chinese and foreign
engineers and laborers will work round-the-clock at the end of the
dam.
</P>
<P>
The flow of the river at present is suitable for damming,
according to the chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Project will be the largest water control
project on the Yellow River and the second largest reservoir in
China. China already has 160 reservoirs on the Yellow River for
flood prevention.

<HEADLINE> Economic, Social and Cultural Rights for Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China has tried for years to
give its people fuller economic, social and cultural rights, which
are an important part of human rights, according to Ren Yanshi in
an article released by Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has improved people's right to existence
and development in keeping with the realities in China, and
conditions in China have continued to turn for the better on the
whole.

I. People's Right to Existence and Development
</P>
<P>
This large country grew out of a semi-colonial, semi-feudal
society and, because of its large population, shortage of
resources, and relatively backward economic and cultural
conditions, the government made its primary task to safeguard
people's right to a decent life and well-being.
</P>
<P>
Since the People's Republic was founded, the government has
emphasized its obligation of feeding and clothing the
people. Relying on its own strength, China has generally solved
the problems of providing for its people, now 1.2 billion, an
historic achievement in safeguarding people's right to existence
and development.
</P>
<P>
With reforms and opening to the outside world, China has
stressed expanding the economy and building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and augmented its productive forces. It rapidly
developed its economy from 8.8 percent annually in the 1979-1990
period to 12.2 percent in the 1991-1994 period.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, China had reached its 1980 goal of quadrupling the
GNP, five years ahead of schedule. In 1996, China's economy
continued to develop rapidly, with a GDP of 6.7 trillion yuan (816
billion US dollars), an increase of 9.7 percent over 1995 in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
Along with economic development, the Chinese people's standard
of living has risen. In 1996, per capita income of urban residents
was 4,377 yuan, three times that of 1978, when adjusted for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of rural people was 1,926 yuan in 1996, more
than four times that of 1978.
</P>
<P>
Bank deposits of both urban and rural residents amounted to 3.8
trillion yuan in 1996, a 182-fold increase over the 1978 figure,
and urban residents' savings deposits have now reached 45 trillion
yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer goods have increased steadily. From 1952 to 1990, per
capita consumer spending rose 2.7-fold, reaching 3,919 yuan last
year, even though the population grew 98.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quality of life has improved rapidly. Spending on food
decreased steadily, from 57.5 percent of total expenditures in
1978 to 48.6 percent last year in urban areas, and from 67.7
percent to 56.3 percent in rural villages.
</P>
<P>
Improvements can also be seen in living conditions, with per
capita floor space of housing in urban areas going from 3.6 sq.m
in 1978 to 8.5 sq.m. last year, and from 8.1 sq.m. in rural areas
to 21.7 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights, said in an interview this month that China has scored
remarkable achievements in education and in feeding and sheltering
its people in the past several decades and should be praised.
</P>
<P>
China has put a great deal of manpower, materiel, and funds
into getting rid of poverty. The number of the poor in rural areas
fell from 250 million in 1978 to 58 million last year.
</P>
<P>
It has also helped village people improve their well-being
faster. In the late 1970s, China had a fourth of the world's poor,
but now less than a fifth, and a target has been set of getting
all poor people out of poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
With improvements in the people's standard of living and in
medical care, life expectancy has improved from 35 before the 1949
Liberation to 70-80 last year, and the mortality rate fell from 33
per thousand to 6.49 per thousand in 1994.

HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The second OAU chiefs of
defense meeting has provided an information sharing forum in the
search for pragmatic strategies for managing and resolving
conflicts in Africa, a Zimbabwean defense official said.
</P>
<P>
Vitalis Zvinavashe, Commander of Zimbabwean Defense Forces
made the remarks at a press conference marking the end of the
two-day meeting of the chiefs of defense of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) central organ last night.
</P>

He said Africa has the largest number of intra-state
conflicts. The Organization of African Unity maintained that it
is beneficial to invest in preventing conflicts than spend
considerable resources in putting out fires among us, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some of our countries spent huge amounts of
resources waging war, and yet were reluctant or unwilling to
contribute towards maintaining peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said Africa has a problem of funding peacekeeping efforts
and will soon undertake activities to raise funds and establish a
peace fund if resolutions adopted at the meeting are endorsed by
the political leaders at their November meeting in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
OAU Assistant Political Director Sam Ibok said once endorsed,
the organization will organize a peace week, launch a
commemorative stamp in each country, football matches among
popular football teams in Africa as way of raising funds
throughout the continent for the peace fund.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed issues relating to command and control,
logistics, finance, communications, training, doctrine, structure
and operation planning for the OAU peace support operations.

<HEADLINE> Group to Co-ordinate Rare-earth Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A co-ordination group for
exports of rare-earth metal products has been set up to halt the
faltering momentum of international prices, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Made up of more than 50 major Chinese producers and exporters
of rare-earth metal products, the non-governmental organization
plans to prevent exports below a reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
The international rare-earth market depends heavily on Chinese
exports and the demand for Chinese rare-earth exports will grow
with the rapid development of high technology, said Yu Dahai,
director of the commodity department of the Chinese Chamber of
Commerce of Metal, Mineral and Chemical Importers and Exporters,
one of the initiators of the group.
</P>
<P>
Export prices should have gone up steadily, but, due to lack of
information, some Chinese rare-earth exporters sell their products
at comparatively low prices. This undermines the reasonable profit
margins of other producers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
Exporting rare-earth products at unreasonably low prices is not
only a waster of precious resources, but is also a burden on
generations to come, said Meng Guirong, president of the Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest rare-earth metal producer, with
its 1996 production of 45,300 tons accounting for 64.7 percent of
the world total.
</P>
<P>
Rare-earth is the name given to 17 chemically similar metals
with properties that are highly valued in industry.

<HEADLINE> OAU to Be Tough With Military Coups, Says OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, Ooctober 26 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organisatio of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim said coups
agaist democratically elected governments could be accepted and
the organization will be tough with military coups in Africa.
</P>
<P>
have been a significant feature of African politics and he
regarded the OAU summit in Harare in June this year as having
been a turning point with regards to the phenomenon of military
coups against democratically elected governments.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Mail in Harare yesterday,
Salim said it had to be accepted that mistakes were made by the
OAU during the 1960s because the organisation then appeared to
accept coups as a way of life and regarded them as internal
problems.
</P>
<P>
''But now in Harare a decision was taken that coups against
democratically elected governments could not be accepted and that
the role of military in society was to guarantee territorial
national integrity and leave politics to popularly elected
governments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He regarded the OAU summit in Harare in June this
year as having been a turning point with regards to the
phenomenon of military coups against democratically elected
governments.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the message was getting home forcing
would-be coup-makers to understand that they would not be
welcome.
</P>
<P>
The military regimes, who declared that the civilian
governments had been corrupt, nepotistic and so forth, had
worsened the situation and never abandoned the corrupt practices
they accused the ousted governments to have been guilty of, the
OAU chief said.
</P>
<P>
On the just ended the OAU defence chiefs meeting, Salim said
the objective of the meeting is not to usurp the functions of the
U.N. because peacekeeping was enshrined in the U.N. Charter as
one of the international body's main functions. But, he said,
there are cases whereby the reaction of the U.N. is rather slow
and Africa is saying its people know their conditions better and
probably can react faster.
</P>
<P>
On democracy in Africa, Salim said the democratisation process
in Africa is irreversible and that nobody, even those that are
inclined to dictatorship, could openly argue against democracy
because it is the people themselves who are demanding it and
would benefit during the process.
</P>
<P>
He noted democracy should be the logical outcome of ''our
people's struggle".

<HEADLINE> OAU Military Meeting Ends in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of defense staff from
the members states of the Oganization of African Unity (OAU )
Central Organ ended a two-day meeting here yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed issues relating to command and control,
logistics, finance, communications, training, doctrine, structure
and operation planning for the OAU peace support operations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also provided a forum for the sharing of military
expertise, information and ideas in the search of strategies for
managing and resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session, Zimbabwe's Deputy Minister of
Foreign Affairs Nicholas Goche described the meeting as " a
milestone in the continued search for best ways and means to
prevent, manage and resolve conflicts that have ravaged the
African continent".
</P>
<P>
He noted that a collective approach is critical for the
realization and promotion of stability on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is " a clear and ample demonstration of our
common resolve and desire to assume greater responsibility for
tackling problems affecting Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, it constitutes a positive step in the
enhancement of our capacity building program as we aim to put in
place the necessary peace-support infrastructure," Goche said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to conflits in Africa, he said that Africa has been
plagued with serious problems whose root causes are poverty,
underdevelopment, ignorance and diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said that conflicts in the Great Lakes region, Sierra
Leone, Somalia, Burundi and Angola had shattered the economic and
social fabric of most of their societies and made the majority of
their populations the wretched of the earth.
</P>
<P>
The growing complexity of these conflicts and problems behoves
the OAU to strengthen its own mechanism for resolving these
problems, the Zimbabwean official said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore critical for the continent to sharpen its
skills in conflict prevention, management and resolution," said
Goche, adding that it is high time that OAU moves away from ad
hoc responses to crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
He called for African governments and people to harness all
available resources and experiences in order to seek solutions to
the challenges the continent is facing.

<HEADLINE> Xiaolangdi Project Will Provide Flood Relief For North China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAOLANGDI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Damming of the Yellow River
for a huge water-control project begins today, and the project
will keep millions of Chinese living along the lower reaches of
the river from having to be threatened by floods again.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project, which is second in size
next only to the Three Gorges Project on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, is intended to stop flooding on China's second
longest river, which has been known for a long time for the
disasters it caused.
</P>
<P>
The project will control 93 percent of the river's drainage
area and be able to handle large floods that may occur every
thousand years.
</P>
<P>
The river bed along the river's lower reaches is often more
than twenty meters higher than nearby cities, meaninng that, if
the river overflows its banks it could threaten Beijing and
Tianjin and would adversely affect the national economy.
</P>
<P>
For two millenia, the river has overflowed more than 1,500
times and changed its course in a major way 26 times. These have
affected several dynasties over the centuries, hence the saying
"While the Yellow River is calm, the society is stable".

<HEADLINE> India's Gold, Silver Prices Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua)-- India's gold price crashed by
115 rupees (3.19 US dollar) per 10 gm and silver declined by 230
rupees (6.39 dollar) per kg at the local bullion market Saturday
following reports that the Bank of Switzerland would be selling
about 1,400 metric tonnes of gold in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Gold, standard and ornaments, nosedived by 115 rupees at 4,350
and 4,200 rupees (120.83-116.67 dollars) per 10 gm respectively as
prices in overseas markets went down to 308.10 from 322.75 dollars
an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, gold was traded lowest at
4,370 rupees (121.39 dollars) per 10 gm on July 8. The gold prices
almost kept on losing in the domestic market after the government
relaxed the import control of gold.
</P>
<P>
Silver today lost 230 rupees at 6,730 rupees (186.94 dollars)
per kg as prices in the overseas market declined to the level of
4.88 from the 5.06 dollars an ounce. As a result, silver coins
also declined by 100 rupees (2.78 dollars) per 100 pieces.

Wang Huanbao, 90, is a survivor of the 1938 flood, when 800,000
people were killed. Standing on nearby high ground he saw with his
own eyes the entire process, where an entire village went under
water.
</P>
<P>
And, even though the river has not flooded seriously for the
past half century, Wang still has the habit of walking along it
when the high-water season comes.
</P>
<P>
The river bed in the lower reaches has been rising at an annual
rate of 10 cm and experts say that dykes can not prevent big
floods for good, but that the Xiaolangdi project, being built
where there is the largest concentration of floods, has a better
chance of stopping floods that the 160 existing reservoirs along
the river combined.
</P>
<P>
The project shows the wisdom and power of the Chinese and
belongs to both history and the present age, says Lin Xiushan, the
project's chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of Communist Party leaders has shown great
concern for the project, and President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng have visited the project site several times.
</P>
<P>
Its cost is estimated at 40 billion yuan, and is helped by the
World Bank. Nearly 10,000 technicians and engineers from more than
50 countries and regions are taking part in the construction work.
</P>
<P>
One German engineer told Xinhua that the Yellow River is
important to the Chinese and that through the project one can see
an ancient nation reviving.

<HEADLINE> Children With HIV/AIDS to Reach One Million Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- More children are contracting
HIV than ever before, and there is no sign that the infection rate
is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million children worldwide will be living with
HIV by the end of 1997, according to the Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 400,000 children under 15 years became infected with
HIV worldwide, bringing the total number of children living with
the virus to 830,000.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 1.5 million people who died of AIDS last year,
350,000 were children, an UNAIDS report distributed during the
ongoing 4th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and Pacific
here said today.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, if the trend continues uncontained, AIDS may increase
infant mortality by as much as 75 percent, and result in an
increase in the under-five child mortality by more than 100
percent in regions most affected by the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is the most recognized disease in the world today; but
the disastrous impact it is having on children has not been given
enough attention," said Dr Peter Piot, executive director of
UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
Dr Piot warned that if the spread of HIV that causes AIDS is
not rapidly contained, progress already made by the public health
system in reducing infant and child death rates will be reversed.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Warns of Surging HIV Cases in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific is fast
becoming a region with most HIV infections in the world, with the
number of estimated infections having doubled in the last three
years to between 5 and 7 million, a senior U.N. health official
warned today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of the Joint United
Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), issued the warning in a
keynote speech to about 2,500 delegates attending the 4th
International Meeting on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The HIV epidemic in the Asia-Pacific is accelerating faster
than anywhere in the world, Piot said, adding that one of the most
worrying aspect of the epidemic in the region was its trend.
</P>
<P>
The HIV is human immuno-deficiency virus that causes AIDS,
acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures provided by the Western Pacific Regional Office
of the World Health Organization, Piot said the total number of
infections could easily double again by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Piot said India is the country
worst hit by HIV in both the region and the world, with its
estimated HIV-infected people reaching between 3 and 5 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
But in terms of percentage of a country's entire population,
Piot said, Cambodia and Thailand are the worst-stricken countries
in the region, with their infected people accounting for more than
two percent of their respective populations.
</P>
<P>
Piot said the most effective way of checking the spread of the
HIV epidemic is prevention so as to keep low-level infection
rates, citing the efforts of Singapore, the Philippines, and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Piot also praised the just-ended satellite symposium on AIDS,
children and youth in the Asia-Pacific, for its role in mobilizing
children and youth to take part in the campaign against the deadly
disease.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was held between October 23 and 25 in Manila as
part of the program of the current four-day AIDS international
meeting, which opened here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss, among other things, the current
status of HIV/AIDS in the Asia-Pacific, socio-economic issues
related to HIV/AIDS in the region, and ways to curb the spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
In parallel to the meeting, a grand exhibition will be held to
display publications about AIDS, medicines against AIDS and
efforts made by all countries against the lethal disease.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS, established in January 1996, is the leading
advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS. It brings together six
U.N. agencies in a common effort to fight the epidemic: the U.N.
Children's Fund, the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Population
Fund, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
the World Health Organization and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Waste Management Proposal Awaits Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A proposal for an integrated
waste management program in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka has been
submitted to the government recently by a London-based private
firm, Pan Asia Services Ltd. (PAS), the national news agency BSS
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The program, to be implemented in phases and on the
Build-Operate- Transfer (BOT) basis, will require a direct foreign
investment of 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project will comply with the international human health and
environment standard, BSS quoted PAS Chairman Ghulam Murshed as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The PAS was optimistic about getting government approval, and
hoped to start a techno-economic feasibility study by the
beginning of next year. The study is expected to be completed in
three months, BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The major components of the project are collection and disposal
of wastes, four street cleaning units, transfer, sorting and
treatment centers, two landfill centers, one waste to energy
plant, one plastic recycling plant and a transport unit, the PAS
chief said.
</P>
<P>
The PAS chief said plastic bags will be supplied to households,
containers, hoppers and dustbins will be installed at the
collection points, and special containers will be provided for
toxic and hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 400,000 tons of untreated household and non-sortable
industrial waste will be transferred annually, about 40 percent of
which will be sorted out, packaged and sent to treatment
facilities while some portion will be baled or crushed, according
to the PAS chief.
</P>
<P>
The authorized capacity of each land-fill station will be
120,000 tons per year and each will fill 10 hectares, he said,
adding that to recover the excess heat of the exhaust steam from
power plants, the proposal suggests the setting up of a distilled
water production plant with a capacity of 100,000 liters per day.
</P>
<P>
A proposed composting plant under the project will have an
annual production capacity of 100,000 tons of quality organic
fertilizer, and the transport depot of the project will have 400
trucks, 80 modern waste tippers, street cleaning equipment and
personnel vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Aid Group Meeting to Review Dhaka's Reforms Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Aid Group Meeting for
Bangladesh, to be held here early next month, is likely to review
Dhaka's reform programs in the banking and financial sectors and
progress in privatization, according to a World Bank report on the
meeting agenda.
</P>
<P>
The donors will also evaluate Dhaka's performance in other
agreed fields like the macroeconomic situation and reforms of
various public institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Aid Group's Dhaka meeting is scheduled for November 4-5
against the backdrop of a declining international aid climate and
donors' concern over a deteriorating political climate in
Bangladesh, said the report published here today.
</P>
<P>
But the most striking feature of this year's meeting would be
donors' in-depth review of the country's on-going poverty
alleviation programs.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank referred to inadequacy of the poverty
alleviation programs and said it was currently preparing a rural

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin, Core of China's Leadership of Third Generation (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While he was in office in Shanghai, he won public praise from
the more than 12 million Shanghai residents for his remarkable
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Above all, the relatively backward condition of urban
construction and infrastructure in Shanghai had to be changed so
as to expedite city development. Jiang together with his
colleagues drew up a plan to transform municipal infrastructure
with the help of international capital, using external investments
of over 3 billion US dollars for the construction of key projects
such as the city's subways, Nanpu Bridge, water pollution
treatment, airport expansion and program-controlled telephone
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Now, people are stunned by the miracles performed in Shanghai,
where "there is a change in a year, and a big one in three years."
This has to be attributed to the new thinking of utilizing
external funds and the new mechanism of "borrowing, spending and
repaying money by oneself." These policies were made while Jiang
held office in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
After he came to Beijing, Jiang's ability to manage Party and
state affairs was further put to good use. Under the leadership of
the CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the core, China's reform,
opening up and the modernization drive moved forward
uninterruptedly. Based on Deng Xiaoping Theory, a major policy
decision was made under his direction to establish a socialist
market economy, the Outline of the Ninth Five-year Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-range Objectives Through the Year 2010 were formulated.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of summing up the experience of the reforms and
opening up, he expounded in an all-round way the 12 major
relationships in China's economic and social development and that
a proper balance between them should be maintained. Especially in
his report delivered to the 15th National Congress of CPC, Jiang
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, drew up a
series of important guidelines for an all-round advancement of the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Particularly in economic restructuring, new significant
advances have been made. Not only has it been established that to
keep public ownership in a dominant position and to have diverse
forms of ownership develop side by side is China's basic economic
system for the primary stage of socialism, but also it is clearly
pointed out in the report that public ownership can and should
take multiple forms and that all government methods and
organizational forms that reflect the laws relating to socialized
production, including the joint stock system and the joint stock
cooperative system, may be utilized boldly.
</P>
<P>
It is further clarified that the non-public sector is an
important component part of the socialist market economy and we
should continue to encourage it and guide it to a healthy
development. In the reform of the political structure, new
progress has also been made.

<P>
It is clearly pointed out in the report that the scope of
democracy should be further extended, ensuring to the people the
rights to holding democratic elections, making policy decisions in
a democratic manner, and instituting democratic management and
supervision. Ruling the country by law should be upheld and great
efforts be made to promote socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
His report of more than 30,000 words has been regarded as "a
political declaration and program of action of the third
generation of collective leadership of China leading the people
toward the new century."
</P>
<P>
In leading China's reform, opening up and modernization drive,
Jiang has paid close attention to the correct handling of the
relationship between material progress and cultural and ethical
progress. He has said that economic backwardness is not socialism
and spiritual deficiency is not socialism either.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee under his direction
made a series of major policy decisions to develop socialist
culture and ethics, and to strengthen and improve the leadership
of the Party.
</P>
<P>
These measures have helped China improve its social
atmosphere. Paying attention to ethics and courtesy has become
common practice.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption campaign has also won phased results. Such
major cases as that of Chen Xitong, former member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and former Secretary of the
Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, have been investigated and
dealt with according to law. All these moves have won immense
popular support.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is fully aware that in order to carry out the
modernization drive in a big country with a population of 1.2
billion, social stability is a basic prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he lays particular stress on the need to balance reform,
development and stability, and formulates the basic principle of
"seizing the current opportunity to deepen the reforms and open
China even wider to the outside world, promoting development and
maintaining stability."

<P>
Even though China's political situation has become more stable,
its economy prospered and people's living standards improved day
by day, Jiang as China's top leader has never been intoxicated
with the successes, and has constantly exhorted leading carders at
all levels: "We should have the awareness of hardships and think
of danger in times of safety."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the contradictions and difficulties existing in
economic and social life, he always keeps a clear head and exerts
himself to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years or more, he has traveled to all of
China's provinces (except Taiwan), autonomous regions and
municipalities directly under the Central Government, and gone
deep into grassroots units for investigation and study as well as
for the understanding of social conditions and popular will.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he goes, he will invariably visit those workers whose
enterprises have not extricated themselves from difficult
positions, and express his sincere solicitude.
</P>
<P>
He pays special attention to the life of those people who live
in poor areas of remote provinces. The Chinese Government under
his direction worked out a very ambitious "plan to alleviate
poverty" and was determined to accomplish in the main the task of
providing adequate food and clothing for the impoverished people
in rural areas within this century. During the past five years,
the rural poor population of the country has decreased by 32
million.
</P>
<P>
In the diplomatic field, the third generation of collective
leadership with Jiang at the core has demonstrated its outstanding
capability to cope with the international situation and handle all
kinds of complex international affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years under his leadership, China has scored
a series of diplomatic successes. China's international standing
has risen increasingly and its influence on international affairs
has kept growing.
</P>
<P>
China's relations with all countries in the world have further
developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. The good-neighborly relations with the surrounding
countries have been further consolidated, and solidarity and
cooperation with the vast number of developing countries have been
greatly strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government attaches great importance to Sino-US
relations, and in meeting with US personages of political and
various circles, Jiang has reiterated again and again the
standpoint to increase trust, reduce trouble, develop co-operation
and provoke no confrontation. This standpoint has met with
approval from people of insight of various circles in the United
States.

<P>
Jiang as a statesman of the new generation has the distinct
makings and style of a scholar. He has extensive knowledge. He
loves reading, and the most he reads are the latest books on
economics, science and technology, politics and culture.
</P>
<P>
While in office in Shanghai, he wrote papers such as On the New
Features of the Development of World Electronic Information
Industry and the Strategic Problems of the Development of China's
Electronic Information Industry, the Trend of Energy Development
in the World and the Main Energy-Saving Measures, which were
published in the "Shanghai Jiaotong University Journal".
</P>
<P>
He can use English, Russian and Romanian, and knows some German
and Japanese. In meeting with foreign guests, he often expresses
his viewpoints in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
He is highly accomplished in famous works of classic Chinese
literature and often quotes in talks well-known lines from
exponents of various schools of thought as well as Tang, Song and
Yuan poetry.
</P>
<P>
He also reads extensively famous works of Western
literature. He loves to read novels by Mark Twain, and can recite
passages from "Hamlet" by Shakespeare and verses from "Ode to the
West Wind" by Shelley. He also knows very well works by Leo
Tolstoy, Pushkin, Chekhov and Turgenev.
</P>
<P>
He not only loves literature, but has a wide range of other
interest. He likes both erhu tunes by A Bing, a great master of
Chinese folk music, and symphonic music by Mozart and Beethoven,
great masters of Western music.
</P>
<P>
At leisure, he may play erhu and bamboo flute, traditional
Chinese musical instruments, as well as the Western musical
instrument piano. He thinks that art treasures of Chinese and
Western cultures are the common spiritual wealth of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has a warm, harmonious and happy family. He and his wife
have two sons, a grandson and a granddaughter. In his spare time,
Jiang often indulges in sporting with these "pearls in his palm"
in great joy, tells them stories and teaches them to recite
ancient poetry and read English, thus enjoying the traditional
Chinese family life of "Several generations living together."
</P>
<P>
This year is no ordinary year for China under Jiang's
direction. Several major events have taken place: the passing away
of Deng Xiaoping, the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and the convening of the 15th National Congress of
CPC.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of collective leadership with Jiang at the
core has dealt with these three major events very satisfactorily,
winning unanimous acclaim at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
World opinion generally acknowledges that the leaders of the
CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the core are united as one,
firm and energetic, and can unquestionably lead the 1.2 billion
Chinese people to advance victoriously into the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Devaluation of Currencies Hits Indian Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua)-- The recent spate of
devaluation of currencies in Pakistan and some ASEAN nations is
expected to hit Indian exports of rice, soybean products and oil
extractions, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp devaluation in the Thai Baht and the Pakistani Rupee
will make the exports of these countries' goods cheaper than
India's.
</P>
<P>
As India is directly competing with these countries in the
export of rice, soybean products and oil extractions, this is
bound to have an adverse impact on India's exports.
</P>
<P>
The spate of devaluation has come at a time when countries like
the Philippines were reeling under the EL Nino weather phenomenon,
which has caused a sharp decline in food production.
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, India could have taken advantage of
such a situation in pushing up its exports of agricultural goods,
but the devaluation of currencies by its competitors will now pose
a major hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Indian rice exports already registered a 20
percent decline between April and July this year compared to the
previous corresponding period.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin, Core of China's Leadership of Third Generation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- In China, people generally
address Jiang Zemin as "the core of the leadership of the third
generation", because in the people's eyes, Jiang is the top leader
succeeding Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, the cores of China's
leadership of the first and second generations respectively.
</P>
<P>
Just at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) which concluded recently, he was re-elected General
Secretary of the Central Committee of CPC, the ruling party with
58 million members, thus continuing to take on the historical
mission of leading the world's most populous country to advance to
the 21st century. Jiang's re-election is the common aspiration of
the people and enjoys popular confidence.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years since Jiang assumed the office of
China's top leader, China has been stable socially and
politically, its economy has continued to develop, its national
strength has been continuously enhanced, its government has been
extremely active diplomatically and the people's living standards
have risen steadily.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an
average annual rate of about 12 percent. Not only did the economy
undergo a rapid growth, but inflation was brought under effective
control. It is the common desire of the Chinese people of all
ethnic groups to maintain the current momentum of development.
</P>
<P>
What remains fresh in people's memory is that during the
political disturbances occurring successively at home and abroad
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jiang remained unruffled in the
face of turmoil and coped with the situation calmly in the manner
of a statesman who "remains calm before the collapse of Mount
Taishan".
</P>
<P>
With the support of Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of
China's reforms and opening up, Jiang took a series of measures to
keep the political situation stable, and lost no time to carry
forward the reforms and open China even wider to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Not only did he hold his ground, but also there emerged
throughout the country a flourishing trend toward economic and
social development. He himself has thus built up his image and
prestige among the Chinese people.

<HEADLINE> Italy Attaches Importance to Central European Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Central European Initiative
(CEI) has a key role to play in preparing central Europe and the
Balkans for integration into the European institutions, Italian
Foreign Undersecretary Piero Fassino said in Triste today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting of parliamentary speakers from
the CEI's 16 member countries, according to reports from the city.
</P>
<P>
"The CEI can play an important role in holding together those
countries that, although close to entering the European Union and
NATO, sometimes feel these goals are still some way off," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of ways in which the initiative could help
avoid new divisions or feelings of exclusion that the enlargement
of these institutions might otherwise bring, he added.
</P>
<P>
An awareness of the CEI's potential for knitting its members
into Europe ahead of formal membership of the EU and NATO had led
Italy to seek new ways to strengthen the initiative from within,
Fassino said.
</P>
<P>
"Central Europe and the Balkans are of the highest strategic
importance to Italy," Fassino stressed. The region's geopolitical
proximity, its solid political relations with Rome and its growing
economic and cultural ties meant that Italy looked with keen
interest at "this vast area extending from the Baltic to the Black
Sea and the Adriatic."

<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang was born in August 1926 to an intellectual family in
Yangzhou, a historically and culturally famous city at the lower
reaches of China's Yangtze River. The cultural background of his
family with a long tradition of learning enabled him to read
extensively Chinese and foreign literary masterpieces and thus to
have a solid foundation in literature.
</P>
<P>
However, he chose Shanghai Jiaotong University after all, a
prestigious university of engineering in China, with electrical
engineering as his major. It was Jiang Shangqing, his uncle and
foster father, who exerted a great influence on his later taking
the road of a revolutionary as his career. His uncle, a Communist,
who led a regional anti-Japanese armed force in the northeast of
Anhui Province and north of the Huai River in China, sacrificed
his life for the country in a battle in 1939.
</P>
<P>
Jiang graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in
1947. During his college years, he participated in the CPC-led
student movement against Chiang Kai-shek's autocratic rule, and
joined the Communist Party of China in 1946.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, Jiang served as an associate
engineer, head of a workshop and deputy director of a factory in
Shanghai. In 1995, he was sent to the Soviet Union to work in
Moscow's Stalin Automobile Works as a trainee for one year.
</P>
<P>
After his return home in 1956, he served as director of
factories and research institutes in the big industrial cities of
Changchun, Shanghai and Wuhan. Later, he was transferred to
Beijing to take charge of the Foreign Affairs Department of the
First Ministry of Machine-Building Industry under the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, he served successively as Deputy Director of the
State Import and Export Administration and the State Foreign
Investment Administration, Vice-Minister and Minister of
Electronics Industry, Mayor of Shanghai, Secretary of the CPC
Shanghai Municipal Committee, and member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee. After June 1989, he was elected
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the
People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang' family background and unique personal experience have
made him always cherish a lofty ideal to enrich the people,
strengthen the nation and rejuvenate China. When Deng Xiaoping put
forward his initial ideas to build special economic zones (SEZ),
Jiang serving as a leading official at that time in the State
Import and Export Administration, was resolute in its
implementation without the least hesitation.
</P>
<P>
Facing all the wilderness in Shenzhen then, he made a clear
proposal: "All development projects in the SEZ should be started
from a long-term point of view and should not follow the
traditional system." Now, China's first special economic zone,
Shenzhen, which is adjacent to Hong Kong, has developed into a
busting metropolis with a population of over one million.

<HEADLINE> Thai King Wants Fast Passage of Organic Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- King Bhumibol Adulyadej has
urged the Thai government and parliament to speed up the passage
of three organic laws related to general elections, so that the
country could go to the polls under the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The king told some cabinet members on Saturday: "it is your
duty to make sure the completion of the new constitution happens
as soon as possible," according to the Nation Daily today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution, three organic laws -- on the
electoral system, political parties and the election commission,
must be ready within eight months after the promulgation of the
new constitution on October 11.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution has been hailed as a major step toward
political reform and elimination of money politics in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
promised quick passage of the supplementary laws.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the whole process of adopting the three
laws, if put on fast track, would take only one to two months, and
a House dissolution would be announced by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy interior minister Likit Thiravegin said the elections
would take place sometime in January.

<HEADLINE> New Suggestions Made for Cleaner Kathmandu Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Various suggestions including
construction of toilets in public places have come up for
improving the environment of the Kathmandu Valley in preparation
for "Visit Nepal Year '98," Nepali newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
Toilets are not seen in public places in Nepal, and people just
urinate in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions made at a national seminar include
controlling stray dogs, imposing a ban on selling and distribution
of illegally produced alcoholic drinks and implementation of
integrated environment preservation programs through coordination
among the three cities in the Valley -- Kathmandu, Lalitpur and
Bhaktapur.
</P>
<P>
The seminar also underlined the need to make necessary
arrangements for slaughter houses, renovate and conserve ancient
shrines and temples, improve the transport sector for
environmental protection and provide every household with dustbins
for collection of garbage.
</P>
<P>
Kathmandu Mayor Keshav Sthapit said that as part of its efforts
to make "Visit Nepal Year '98" a success, the city has intensified
garbage collection at night and has already killed some 14,000
stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was jointly organized by Nepal's National Zoonosis
and Food Hygiene Research Center and the Canada-based
International Development Research Center.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Suffer Major Setback on BSE Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals on the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) market last week suffered a major setback with the
sensitive index sharply down by over 148 points in the wake of
sustained and heavy bull liquidation and scattered selling by
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index, firm at 4,154.84 on Monday, later
gradually moved downwards to close the week below the 4,000
psychological barrier at 3,957.46 as against last weekend's close
of 4,106.26, showing a fall of 148.80 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index also dropped sharply by 65.05 points to end
the week at 1,703.43 from the previous weekend close of 1768.48.
The BSE-200 and the US dollar index were quoted substantially down
at 382.03 and 175.41 at the weekend compared with last weekend
close of 395.24 and 181.78 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bull operators, who had built up long positions in the past one
week, lightened their commitments fearing a major political
fall-out of the rejection of the Union Cabinet recommendation for
Central Rule in Uttar Pradesh by President K.R.Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
They were not willing to take any risk by getting delivery of
shares due to the political instability in the country. The lack
of interest was also attributed to the long "Diwali" (Light
festival) holidays beginning from October 28.

<HEADLINE> Million Women March Held in Philadelphia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Millions of black women from
various parts of the United States gathered in Philadelphia today
for the Million Woman March to show their solidarity in the black
community and their strength in the society.
</P>
<P>
Local TV shows that the women standing shoulder to shoulder
for more than one kilometer in the street in a rainy weather. They
started with a morning march and gathered for a day long rally,
singing the Black National Anthem and listening to speeches
encouraging them to show their power.
</P>
<P>
They came by train, car, plane and hundreds of buses to the
rally. The organizers estimated two million people filled the avenue
in early afternoon, and local police estimated the
participants at 300,000 to one million.
</P>
<P>
Called by two housing activists who relied on a grass-roots
approach to reach out to black women, the march started with a
procession beginning at 7 a.m. near the Liberty Bell and traveling
three kilometers to a stage at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
The rally echoes the Washington Million Man March in 1995, a
gathering of black men, and the rally of the Promise Keepers, a
Christian men's organization, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The women's march was intended to show unity in the face of
inner-city problems ranging from inadequate health care and poor
education to high unemployment and crime.
</P>
<P>
Phile Chionesu, a co-founder of the march said, "The march is a
declaration of independence against ignorance, injustice, poverty
and abuse, and all the negative things that tend to separate us as
black women and deteriorate us as a people."
</P>
<P>
"Black women have been the epitome of strength in this
country," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to prepare our women, no matter what their status in
life, to look at how we can begin to invest as black women and how
we can begin to vote in blocs as black women."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: President Jiang Zemin on Sino-US Relations (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that though bilateral relations have undergone
vicissitudes in the past three years, the overall trend is toward
improvement, especially in the last six months, during which
increased high-level visits have solved some of the problems which
at a time troubled the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I should say that bilateral relations have seen obvious
improvement," the Chinese president said. "And favorable factors
in the development of bilateral ties are increasing."
</P>
<P>
The two countries "now stand an advantageous chance in
improving the relations between them," Jiang observed.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1997, US Vice-President Al Gore and
other senior officials and statesmen have visited China.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's meetings with these US visitors, he stated the
anticipation of his upcoming state visit to the United States and
the future of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting with Gore, Jiang said that healthy and stable
Sino-US relations toward the 21st century should be based on three
principles: adherence to common interest, farsightedness, and a
proper handling of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
On the adherence to common interest, he said that in the new
situation, the need for the two countries to maintain and expand
cooperation is not dwindling, but growing continuously, and that
in particular, there exist very great, cooperative potentials for
the two countries to jointly safeguard global and regional peace,
develop bilateral economic and trade ties, and promote the growth
and prosperity of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Governments of the two countries and their leaders should have
a full understanding about this. And what's more, people of both
countries should reach such a consensus, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On farsightedness, he said, "We should dispel all interferences
and noises in bilateral relations, stand higher and see farther,
get a firm hold of the fundamental interest of the people of the
two countries, and keep in mind the overall situation of bilateral
relations, the whole world situation as well as the endeavor to
bring into the 21st century a prosperous, stable and peaceful
world."
</P>
<P>
He said that differences on some issues can be resolved on the
basis of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs, and equal consultations. And if some differences can not
be resolved for the time being, the two sides can seek common
ground while reserving differences, but they can not meddle in the
overall situation in developing relations between the two
countries, he said.

<P>
With regard to the proper handling of the Taiwan issue, Jiang
said that the kernel content of the three Sino-US joint
communiques is precisely one that defines the guiding principle
for dealing with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States had made solemn commitment on the Taiwan
question. But in the history of the development of Sino-US
relations, the issue has experienced repeated hindrances, which
even undermined the process of improving and developing Sino-US
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked about the topic time and again, just in a hope
that it would not affect the smooth growth of Sino-US ties any
more," Jiang stated.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, in a meeting with Samuel R. Berger, assistant
to the US President for National Security Affairs, on August 12,
described the general atmosphere of Sino-US relations as good.
</P>
<P>
"Since my meeting with President Clinton in Manila last
November, relations between the two countries have had positive
progress, with common ground in many fields," he said. "This
situation is the result of joint efforts made by the two sides. It
has been painstakingly achieved and should be treasured."
</P>
<P>
He said that he is looking forward to discussing significant
issues about developing Sino-US relations with President Clinton
and joining hands with him to bring a long-term, stable and
healthy relationship of cooperation to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Due to their different social systems, ideologies, cultural
traditions, historical backgrounds, and levels of development and
also because they are both large countries with different
principles in handling things, it is natural that there are
disagreements between the two, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In properly dealing with these disagreements, Jiang said, the
first thing is to deepen mutual understanding. In doing so,
direct, face-to-face dialogues and exchanges between the two
countries' leaders are especially important. These contacts can
not be replaced by any other modern means of communication.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of the two sides sticking to the
principles of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, and equality in consultations. "We should ascend
the heights and be farsighted, and proceed from a strategic level
in mastering the general situation of relations between the two
countries, and strive to expand common ground, enhance trust,
diminish differences, and join hands to create the future."

<HEADLINE> Italy Threatened by Increasing Landslides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Italy, with 70 percent of its
territory being hilly areas, is increasingly threatened by
landslides, the Department of Civil Protection reported today.
</P>
<P>
Landslides have always been a problem for the country since
1945, which cause an average of seven deaths every month, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Umbria in central Italy has been identified as the region most
at risk potentially, followed by Liguria and Abruzzo, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Naples, a city worst affected by landslides, has been subject
to 93 landslides since 1945, followed by Genoa with 73 landslides
and Orvieto with 63 landslides.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the increase in landslides is caused by an
irregular weather, deforestation, a declined vegetation coverage
and soil erosion.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: President Jiang Zemin on Sino-US Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Since Chinese President Jiang
Zemin put forward a four-point principle guiding the development
of relations with the United States in late 1992, he has asked, on
many occasions, including the four meetings with President Bill
Clinton, leaders of both countries to treat Sino-US relations from
a strategic point of view to ensure the growth of such relations.
</P>
<P>
The principle Jiang put forward is: increase mutual trust,
diminish troubles, promote cooperation, and prevent confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is scheduled to leave here for the United States
today. Jiang and Clinton will meet for the fifth time.
</P>
<P>
In November 1993, Jiang held formal talks with President
Clinton at the APEC informal meetings of leaders in Seattle. It
was the first formal meeting between top leaders of the two
countries since February 1989. The meeting was "positive,
constructive and fruitful," and marked a good beginning of such
talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that both China and the United States are
countries of influence in the world and share common interest on
many important issues. To increase mutual trust between China and
the United States they can play a positive part in the world. It
is a reality that there exist differences between China and the
United States. The differences should be resolved through frank
dialogues on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Any action
of imposing one's own view on others should not be taken.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told President Clinton: "there are over a thousand
nationalities, more than 200 countries, many kinds of cultural
tradition and ideology on our earth. The right of people in
different countries to choose their own social system and
development mode should be respected. The diversity of the world
is a good thing, not a bad one. Different countries, cultures can
exchange with and learn from each other and share the fruits of
human civilization."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Sino-US summit itself is
significant. The talks increased mutual understanding and will
help improve and develop Sino-US relations. The talks mark a new
beginning of Sino-US relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
After the Seattle meeting of Jiang and Clinton, Sino-US
relations showed a new momentum of improvement and development. A
year later, Jiang and Clinton met again at the Jakarta meeting of
APEC, exchanging views extensively with each other on the
international and regional issues of common concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the meeting, Jiang proposed five principles guiding the
development of Sino-US relations:
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides develop bilateral relations from a broader and
long-term point of view with the world situation in mind and the
21st century in perspective;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides mutually take into account each other's
national conditions and respect each other's choice, tackle all
problems in bilateral relations in the spirit of friendship;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides push bilateral economic cooperation toward an
all-round development by making full use of the advantages of the
two economies;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides strengthen mutual consultation and cooperation
in international affairs and within international organizations;
</P>
<P>
-- the two sides increase exchanges between them, particularly
of high-level visits and contacts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said at the meeting that a new constructive relationship
should and could be established between china and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Jiang said, leaders of China and the United
States re-opened the door for Sino-US relations. In the 20 years
that followed, bilateral relations grew smoothly in certain
periods while experienced difficulties and setbacks in other
periods. Historic experiences indicate that "we are able to do
things beneficial to the peoples of China and the United States
and the people in the world as a whole" when Sino-US relations are
handled properly, otherwise no party will benefit when such
relations get strained.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the world today is still turbulent and various
forces are being re-grouped. With the numerous complicated and
unstable factors, he said, China and the United States bear more
responsibility in maintaining world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this world of interdependence, economy has
become the first and foremost factor in relations between
countries, adding there are favorable conditions and a broad scope
for increased cooperation between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted that the Chinese government has
always attached importance to the relations with the United States
and hopes to be friendly with the United States. China will not
practice arms race, or join any military bloc, or seek military
expansion, or pose any threat to the security of the United
States. On the contrary, "we hope to increase mutual trust,
diminish troubles, promote cooperation and prevent confrontation"
with the United States, and to constantly promote Sino-US
relations on the basis of the three joint communiques between the
two countries. "We hope that the US government also pursue a
policy of friendship with China."

<P>
BRASILIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will distribute
vaccine doses against hepatitis B across the country starting from
November.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian National Epidemiology Center Director, Jarbas Barbosa,
said today that more than 12 million doses of the vaccine will
be distributed in November alone.
</P>
<P>
The official said hepatitis B is ravaging the northern states
of Mato Grosso, Espiritu Santo, Roraima and Santa Catarina.
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis B is transmitted through sex acts, blood transfusion,
and pregnancy. The country has decided to vaccinate groups of
higher risk first, especially prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that some 12,000 Brazilians have
contracted hepatitis B over the past two years and 10 percent of
them develop liver cancer or hepatic cyrrhosis.

<P>
In October 1995, Jiang and Clinton met for the third time when
they participated in the activities marking the 50th anniversary
of the United Nations in New York, under the background of Sino-US
relations suffering setbacks after the United States allowed
Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui to visit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the issue of Taiwan is the most important
and sensitive one in Sino-US relations and is the core of the
three Sino-US joint communiques which constitute the foundation of
Sino-US relations. He said China does not want to see any incident
that would interfere with the smooth development of the bilateral
relations happen again.
</P>
<P>
"Our basic policy on Sino-US relations is: increase mutual
trust, diminish troubles, promote cooperation and prevent
confrontations. Our position is as follows:
</P>
<P>
"1. The leaders of the two countries should put bilateral
relations into a strategic perspective and strive to remove
various obstacles and interference so as to ensure that Sino-US
relations can constantly move forward in the correct direction;
</P>
<P>
"2. The three Sino-US joint communiques remain to be the
foundation of relations between the two countries. When the
communiques are observed, our bilateral relations will move
forward, and if not, there will be setbacks;
</P>
<P>
"3. It is common interest that has brought China and the
United States together. To promote and expand the common interest,
we should respect each other's national characteristics and
choice, surmount the gaps in social system and ideology, and
handle all issues between us in the spirit of equality,
consultation and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
During the APEC's informal leadership meeting in Manila in
1996, Jiang and Clinton, who was just re-elected US president, had
their fourth meeting, at which the two leaders decided to exchange
state visit in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that both the United States, the largest developed
country in the world, and China, the largest developing one, have
exerted great influence worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-US relations not only affect the fundamental interest of
the two peoples," the Chinese president said, "but inevitably
affect world peace, stability and development." Direct dialogues
between the heads of state of the two countries, Jiang added, will
be conducive to reducing or even wiping out differences.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges LTTE to Support Negotiated Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States has called
upon the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to stop its
indiscriminate attacks and support a negotiated settlement of the
conflict in Sri Lanka, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned Sunday Observer newspaper, in a belated
report of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfuth's
speech in a House subcommittee on Wednesday, also said Washington
supports Colombo's constitutional reform plans in efforts to end
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"In Sri Lanka, where heavy fighting between government and LTTE
forces continues, the U.S. supports a negotiated political
settlement to the conflict," Inderfuth was quoted as saying in the
House International Relations Subcommittee on the Near East and
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The massive bomb attack in Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo on
October 15 only underlined the importance of ending the fighting,
the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the Sri Lankan Government's
wide-ranging proposals for constitutional reform are a solid basis
for a peaceful solution to this tragic conflict, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S. government announced that the LTTE
is on its terrorist organization list and will be banned from
raising fund in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
One week after the announcement, a truck-bomb exploded in the
downtown business center of Colombo, killing 18 people and

<HEADLINE> Brokers See Opportunities in SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese stock brokerage firms,
struggling in the crevice of keen competition, see a glimpse of
hope in the upcoming wave to restructure State-owned enterprises
(SOEs), today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Experts and officials believe that reshuffling property
ownership and management of SOEs offers opportunities for Chinese
stock companies, which are currently constrained by narrow
opportunities for development and deteriorating performance.
</P>
<P>
Stock firms' expertise in asset appraisal and transfer,
selecting acquisition objects, arranging mergers, sorting out
legal relations, distribution of employees and other aspects can
be helpful in SOE restructuring.
</P>
<P>
China has 97 stock brokerage companies, in addition to more
than 200 institutions involved in the business.
</P>
<P>
Underwriting and trading commissions are the major businesses
for most stock firms. But with the expansion of the stock market,
these firms are facing a hard time ahead.
</P>
<P>
Next year, the securities market is expected to see a glut of
supply as the country's quota of 30 billion yuan (3.6 billion
U.S. dollars) for A shares and 4.5 billion yuan (542 million
U.S. dollars) for convertible bonds will be enacted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stock firms have lost profits from the difference of the issue
prices and trading prices by underwriting issues of stocks. They
can no longer survive by relying on their traditional business. So
they are rushing to shift their focus from traditional
underwriting to investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
The complex work and links in the SOEs' restructuring cannot be
done without the participation of stock firms, which have
experiences and skills in dealing with enterprise mergers.
</P>
<P>
In the past practice, enterprise restructuring was always
arranged by government "match-makers" instead of the market. Such
pairings usually lacked rational internal links.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, stock firms would create a broad market in which
all SOEs could find ideal co-operative partners and trade their
property.
</P>
<P>
Wang Liangzhong, an analyst from Guangfa Securities Co Ltd,
suggested that stock firms should establish stable co-operation
relationship with large enterprises, conglomerates and
well-performing firms.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the stock firms should extend underwriting
business in the distribution market to more in-depth services,
such as co-ordinating businesses' financial affairs, designing
asset structure and arranging business operations.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, stock firms should create new financing and
investment instruments to attract clients and promote efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Imports Worsen Indonesia's Economic Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- High demand for imported goods,
especially during the recent currency crisis in Indonesia, has
contributed to a nation-wide economic slump, a cabinet minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"The total value of imports has been surpassing that of exports
for the past few years," Transmigration Minister Siswono
Yudohusodo said Saturday in Mataram, Indonesia's West Nusa
Tenggara province, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's non-oil and non-gas exports in 1996 amounted to
38.09 billion U.S. dollars, a significant increase from 34.95
billion dollars in 1995 and 30.33 billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesia's imports had also increased steadily to
39.33 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, compared with 37.71 billion
dollars in 1995 and 25.61 billion the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Siswono, who was former chairman of the Association of Junior
Indonesian Businessmen (HIPMI), said imports of big motorcycles
have been banned by the government except for sports, but they
still could be easily seen in Jakarta's traffic.
</P>
<P>
Luxury cars have also been imported into Indonesia, Siswono
said.
</P>
<P>
The over-demand for imported goods was expected to seriously
hit the economy, he said. He urged HIPMI members to buy and use
Indonesian-made products.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's current account deficit in 1996 was 8.8 billion
dollars, compared to 7 billion dollars in 1995 and 3.5 billion
dollars in 1994.
A sharp drop in Indonesia's current account would become a serious
problem for the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to the problem was to reduce imports and encourage
exports, although it would depend on the national and
international market situation, he said, adding that another
solution was to attract foreign investors to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, along with other currencies in Southeast
Asian, has been hit seriously by the monetary crisis since July
this year. The value of the rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent
against the U.S. dollar in the past 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts said Indonesia's economy is going
through its toughest time since the oil crisis in the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Top Companies Adopt Merger and Listing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned trading
heavyweights are expected to unveil a massive merger plan and
listing schemes soon in a beefing-up campaign triggered by more
intense competition resulting from the country's trade
liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
China National Technology Import and Export Corp (CNTIC) and
three other leading trade companies have obtained preliminary
approval from the government to form a group company with a
combined annual trade volume of more than seven billion US
dollars, "Business Weekly" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The merger will involve China's seventh and 26th largest
traders -- China National Machinery Import-Export Corp and China
National Instrument Import and Export Corp.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the country's trade circles said Sinochem and the
China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuff Import and Export Corp
are both preparing for domestic listings, while Sinochem also
plans a red chip offer in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The merger of the four companies aimed at the creation of a
supergroup to match international counterparts. The listed arms
will serve as effective instruments for the parent company's
fund-raising activities and promote financial engineering such as
mergers and acquisitions, the paper quoted China Securities
Co. analyst Tong Xuejun as saying.
</P>
<P>
Merger and business diversification, especially into
manufacturing, top the suggestions floated for the reorganization
of state-owned trading houses.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said many other state-trading firms are also
considering listing and the merger of these four may herald
similar moves.

<HEADLINE> Worldwatch Calls for Dismarmament of Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 million
military-style, hand-held weapons exist in the world now and the
uncontrolled spread of these weapons led to violence and
instabilities in regions and societies, said the Worldwatch in a
report released today.
</P>
<P>
Part of the weapons that individuals can carry provide massive
firepower for criminals, drug smugglers and part falls into the
hands of private armies and other civilians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"These small arms are the tools for as much as 90 percent of
the killings in today's wars, and are the fuel of criminal
violence," noted researcher Michael Renner, author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The United States has by far the most small arms, the report
said, by one estimate enough to arm every adult and child in the
country. Firearm homicides in one day in the United States equal
that in one week in Europe and one year in Japan, it added.
</P>
<P>
Because of the spread of the small weapons, "disputes once
settled with words are now solved with hand grenades in El
Salvador. In Russia, South Africa and Angola, weapons meat for
war are now used by criminals to fuel crime waves and wage turf
battles," Renner said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that in Africa, elephant poachers use military
weapons to slaughter herds and intimidate guards at nature
preserves.
</P>
<P>
The report said that new arms production is one source of this
proliferation. Excess equipment from U.S., Russian and European
armies is routinely given away or sold cheaply to other countries.
Weapons left over after civil wars often enter the black market
and resurface at other hotspots, or find their way to drug cartels
and other organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
"It may not be much of an exaggeration to say that we are
witnessing an era in which, in a sense, armies are disarming while
civilians are rearming," Renner said in the report.
</P>
<P>
In the United States alone, Renner said, the number of small
arms in circulation among the general population were officially
estimated at 192 million to 250 million.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended quick disarmament of combatants when
wars end, adoption of an international code on arms sales, a
clamp down on the illegal arms trade and destruction of collected
weapons.

Declaration here this evening, calling on all Commonwealth

and Investment Facility, launch a Commonwealth action program to
remove administrative obstacles, promote Commonwealth Export
Training Centers, set up a Business Council made of major private
sector leaders from all regions of the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage investment flows, the declaration called
for the rapid finalization of Commonwealth Code for Good Practice
and establishment of a Commonwealth investment promotion program.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth leaders also expressed their concern at the
persistence of extreme poverty in many countries and the lack of
capacity to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the declaration pledged to work to halve the
proportion of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015
and work towards a comprehensive solution of the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
On the worsening situation of world environment, the
Commonwealth decided to work with the international community "to
protect our planet for future generations".
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called for urgent action in the
international community to strengthen disaster relief response and
mechanism.
