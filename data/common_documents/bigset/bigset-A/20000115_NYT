EIGHT STATES TO BE SPARED MEDICARE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: NY, Del., Mass., Hawaii, Mo., Ore., Tenn, Vt.)  
(js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hospitals in New York and seven other states will
be spared cuts in Medicare payments under a decision announced
Friday by the secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E.
Shalala.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials had been considering a policy change that
would have cut $2.1 billion from Medicare spending in the eight
states over the next five years. New York hospitals would have lost
$170 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oregon,
Tennessee and Vermont were also spared from cuts, federal health
officials said. The purpose of the payments in question is to help
hospitals that serve large numbers of indigent patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shalala's decision followed months of intense lobbying by
the senators from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles E.
Schumer, and Rep. Charles B. Rangel, dean of the state's
congressional delegation. All are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New
York, also opposed the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer hailed the decision. ``We have been working on this a
long time,'' he said, ``and we got a lot of relief today.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled, including 2.7 million in New York state. The
program routinely covers hospital care for Medicare beneficiaries,
and the federal Medicare law guarantees extra payments to hospitals
that serve ``a disproportionate number of low-income patients with
special needs.'' The law refers to these institutions as
``disproportionate-share hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals serving more low-income patients get more federal
money. Medicare officials said initially that hospitals in New York
and the other states had exaggerated the number of poor people they
served.
</P>
<P>
   The question at the heart of the dispute is whether people in
welfare programs financed entirely by the states _ home relief and
general assistance programs _ should be counted as indigent when
the federal government computes Medicare payments to
``disproportionate-share hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these patients are single adults with mental illnesses
and drug or alcohol problems. Dr. Shalala ruled Friday that they
could be counted as indigent in computing the state's extra
Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee,
said: ``The purpose of the added Medicare payment to hospitals is
to account for the high costs of serving poor communities. Not
accounting for the care of home relief patients clearly
contradicted the intent of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Estimates by the Healthcare Association of New York State
suggest the size of the cuts that might have occurred: $13.5
million a year at Beth Israel Medical Center, $24.7 million at the
New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, $6.3 million at
Montefiore Medical Center, $11.7 million at New York and
Presbyterian Hospitals, $7.5 million at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and
$4.5 million at nine hospitals on Long Island. The cuts would also
have affected many other hospitals in New York City and across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, said Friday night, ``We were absolutely delighted with
the administration's decision, and the hard work of our
congressional delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New York hospitals had threatened to sue the federal
government if it made the cuts it had been considering.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involved not only Medicare, but also Medicaid, a
separate health program for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers and children who receive cash assistance under the main
federal-state welfare program normally qualify for Medicaid, and
they are also counted as indigent when federal officials compute
the extra Medicare payments allowed to hospitals serving large
numbers of poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had said that the childless adults in New
York's home relief program qualified for Medicaid only because New
York had received a special dispensation, or waiver, from the
federal government, allowing the state to expand Medicaid
eligibility as part of an experimental project.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that it
would continue to recognize the extra costs that hospitals incurred
in caring for both types of Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the department, said,
``We concluded that people receiving Medicaid because of a federal
waiver should not be treated any different from people in the
regular Medicaid program.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, federal officials abandoned an effort to force New
York hospitals to repay $1 billion of Medicare money they had
received in recognition of the extra costs of treating low-income
patients. But at that time, the federal officials said they would
insist on a stricter interpretation of the law after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Skolfield said the money to pay for Friday's decision, $2.1
billion over the next five years, would be included in the budget
that President Clinton will send to Congress next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals across the country are still planning to ask Congress
to restore billions of dollars cut from Medicare in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.

COMMENTARY: TWO 21ST CENTURY FOXES ELOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to reposition quote marks in 5th graf.)  
(DW)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ CEO of the United States may be a big job, but the
White House, like everything else, looks smaller this week next to
the new AOL Time Warner. The most mega mega-merger in history
reduced the imminent presidential primaries to quaint sideshows,
relics of a distant age flickering along the fringes of the evening
news. Press and public alike instinctively recognized that the
first (though hardly the last) consummated marriage between new
media and old is going to shape our lives long after we've
forgotten which politician had which health or tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement and trepidation generated by this deal is in part
about money and Wall Street valuations, sure. But its lasting
effect lies in the sheer velocity and impact of seismic cultural
change. The unofficial precursor of AOL Time Warner synergy, the
movie ``You've Got Mail,'' came out just a year ago and has already
been outrun by Internet time. In that picture, the big chain
bookstores were driving the little independents out of business.
But now _ according to a new Andersen Consulting survey buried
under Monday's avalanche of merger news _ those big bookstores are
themselves being routed by the Net. This Christmas Americans
purchased more (far more) books online than at stores _ even though
less than half of the country is online and most of us who are have
slow connections.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Time Warner deal accelerates the arrival of an
inevitable future by ratifying it with big clout and bucks. When
the world's largest purveyor of movies, music, journalism, books
and cable puts all its chips on the Internet, that's a virtual Mall
of America. (Conspicuous non-players in this mother of 21st-century
media combinations: a newspaper or major broadcast network.) In
increments within the next decade _ the loose time frame estimated
by AOL's Steve Case and Time Warner's Gerald Levin, with whom I had
separate conversations on Thursday _ everything we watch, read and
listen to will be as speedily accessible on the Internet as e-mail
is now. Which is not to say it will be free.
</P>
<P>
   A Wall Street Journal headline announces ``the death of old
media''; Wired.com has spotted ``a music industry death knell'' and
``the end of TV as we know it''; in a December speech at the
Columbia Journalism School, Dan Okrent of Time Inc. declared ``the
death of print.'' I don't disagree, in the sense that the old media
will all be put in new electronic bottles. I can't say I'm upset.
For all the unknowns _ indeed, because of them _ this is a gripping
transitional moment in history. Besides, some of the antique forms
will continue to survive alongside the digital _ and, as Okrent
observed, even books printed on paper will still be sold to an
aging nostalgic elite. But most information and culture we consume
will be available both in greater variety and in handier, more
portable and cheaper packages than we have now.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say it can't be so. Don Imus spoke for many this week
when he said that a citizenry that still can't program a VCR will
never figure out how to download movies or navigate the Web's
infinity of offerings. That's where AOL comes in. It has long been
derided in Silicon Valley as ``the Internet on training wheels,''
but that was and is Case's big marketing idea. A country that can't
be bothered to program a VCR wants an Internet on training wheels.
That means a pre-selected, Reader's Digest distillation of the
Internet that's ultimately not in a PC and doesn't require you to
know what a disk drive, a browser or an operating system is, let
alone how to use one. It's an Internet that will be reached through
a ubiquitous device (``AOL Anywhere'') that looks like (and is as
simple to work as) a phone or TV. AOL TV will be introduced later
this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The other things we like in an appliance besides ease of use are
convenience and speed. We bridle at rewinding videocassettes or
returning our rentals to Blockbuster. It's a pain to search for TV
Guide, or fish out the newspaper's sports section or stock tables,
or the L.L. Bean catalogue, once we're settled into the couch with
clicker in hand and all that unruly paper is in the next room.
Media giants will pander to our laziness by giving us the whole
menu on demand, instantly, no geek expertise required, through
broadband connections such as those Time Warner's cable now adds to
AOL. They'll try to keep us glued, lest we wander into the wider
Internet in search of competing goods, services and information.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will need or want to shop at the virtual mall, but
few corporations have gone broke so far overestimating the appeal
of instant gratification to the American consumer. We are already
adopting DVD players faster than we initially did VCRs _ even
though home DVD players don't yet record _ not just because the
picture is better but because you can fast-forward or rewind in a
click. Once people discover instant digital time, they're suddenly
too impatient to tolerate even a few extra seconds required by
analog.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't guarantee that AOL Time Warner will succeed. Vision
is one thing, execution another. AOL has a history of access and
privacy meltdowns, Time Warner of money-hemorrhaging Web sites and
lumbering cable TV service. The corporate cultures could clash,
too: Case has never watched the most dazzling gem in the mountain
of content he just bought, ``The Sopranos.'' Fierce, perhaps more
nimble competitors will arrive soon, maybe siphoning off AOL Time
Warner brains when they do. Predicting winners in show business is
a fool's errand.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL Time Warner does have a head start and some corporate
DNA on its side. Levin stubbornly championed cable while Wall
Street predicted its (and his) doom. Two other executives on stage
at Monday's baptism were among the first to figure out, some 20
years ago, that the broadcast market could be fragmented into
lucrative, narrow niches: Ted Turner, who saw a global audience for
nonstop TV news, and Bob Pittman, who was present at the creation
of the first 24-hour movie channel as well as MTV. Theirs was a
digital sensibility before digital was cool _ home computers were
just coming on the market _ and you could argue that MTV in
particular, with its quick cuts and demolition of linear narrative,
was a harbinger of the aesthetic of Web surfing. Certainly the Web
is in part a zillion channels as specialized and idiosyncratic as
those of Turner's and Pittman's early wild dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the troubling part of the story. If you
believe that the Internet is the greatest explosion of free
expression and cultural resources of the past century, what happens
when it is merchandised as a mass-market product by the biggest
corporations in history?
</P>
<P>
   In theory and so far practice, the Web is limitless, too
powerful and diverse to be tamed or homogenized by any company, no
matter how huge. Some kid out there may already have a new idea
that will upend AOL Time Warner as Case did Bill Gates on the Net.
But should the new AOL or its coming rivals squelch that kid, who
will blow the whistle?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, almost every journalist in America works for at
least one media octopus. (Me? I'm an author at Random House, owned
by Bertelsmann, AOLs partner in Europe and Australia.) Even the
theoretically pure PBS now has a journalistic conflict of interest:
its broad new ``strategic alliance'' with AOL just happened to be
announced the day of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the specter of Big Brother. ``No country in the
history of the world has had this much information about people
before,'' in the words of the media critic Jon Katz.
Public-interest groups also worry that AOL Time Warner and its kin
will run their fast Internet wires like private toll roads, banning
other Internet providers or diverting them to slow and bumpy
traffic lanes. Case says trust him: if he and his peers fail to
guarantee an open Internet or to protect us from ``the nightmare of
an Orwellian world,'' then ``the backup is government
intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   He also allows that ``the devil is in the details,'' and ``it's
fair for people to say `Prove it' _ and that's what we will do over
the coming months.'' Levin echoes him, as well as vowing
independence for his journalists and artists.
</P>
<P>
   We may be on our own as we seek verification. Even as the
country was debating the vast implications of AOL Time Warner, the
otherwise loquacious current president and his would-be successors
have been all but mum on the subject. That's why it's in the
self-interest of those who haven't yet ventured into cyberspace to
stop procrastinating. You'll have no choice but to go there soon
enough, and on this frontier as on our last, more is up for grabs
now than after the barons lay down the rails.

   Operations job Casserly's &QL; 
to lose, sources say &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ After another day of meetings with owner Bob McNair,
Charley Casserly has emerged as the clear favorite to become the
first vice president of football operations for Houston's NFL
expansion that begins play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources close to McNair told the Houston Chronicle on Friday
that Casserly is the leading candidate, and one went so far as to
say the job is Casserly's to lose, ``and don't expect Charley to
lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair made it clear Friday that he continues to be impressed
with Casserly, but he declined to call him the favorite or the
leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley's just farther along than anyone else,'' McNair said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   When Casserly returned to Houston on Thursday for a second
series of interviews with McNair and executive vice president Steve
Patterson, he brought his wife, Beverley, and daughter, Shannon,
another indication of how serious McNair is about hiring Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to McNair said the Casserly family is checking
out neighborhoods and schools before they leave Sunday. McNair
wants to have the position filled before he leaves for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still hoping to have this wrapped up in the next two
weeks, but it's an important and complicated process,'' McNair
said. ``This job has a lot of requirements. There's a lot involved
in putting a team together. You've got to remember that we're
building from the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the league meeting in New York next week
(Tuesday), and I'm going to visit with some people (owners) up
there about some other possible candidates we may interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, the former Washington general manager who spent his
entire 23-year NFL career with the Redskins, and Joe Mack, who
helped get the Carolina and Cleveland expansion franchises off the
ground, are the only candidates to be interviewed so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I are on the same page about so many things,''
Casserly said. ``Everyone knows Houston's going to be a premier
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the many things that impress me about Bob is his
commitment to do things the right way and how much he wants to win.
He wants to do whatever it takes to have the best football program
around. And he's never wavered from that commitment. How could you
not be interested in a job like that?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of NFL executives are interested in the job, including Tom
Donahoe, who resigned as Pittsburgh's director of football
operations Friday after losing a power struggle with coach Bill
Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   McNair called Steelers owner Dan Rooney on Thursday to ask for
permission to interview Donahoe. McNair had no idea Donahoe was
going to resign.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday afternoon, McNair still had not heard from
Rooney, but getting permission is no longer necessary. Donahoe, who
had eight years left on a 10-year contract, is free to negotiate
with any team.
</P>
<P>
   Like Casserly, Donahoe is one of the most respected personnel
men in the league. Although Donahoe wasn't available for comment
Friday, he has told friends he would be interested in the Houston
job.
</P>
<P>
   Before Casserly returned to Houston this week, others on
McNair's list were Donahoe, Seattle senior vice president Mike
Reinfeldt, Seattle vice president of football operations Randy
Mueller and Tampa Bay director of player personnel Jerry Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   But Casserly has continued to impress McNair with his enthusiasm
for the job. They will have more meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to know Charley better and better,'' said
McNair, who stopped short of saying he would interview more
candidates. ``I like him a lot. I really do. Our philosophies are
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley's done it at every level of an organization. And he's
been successful at every level. He's asking a lot of questions, and
so am I. We're talking about things like budget, personnel,
scouting and ranges in salary for the various positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said, we may have a small window of opportunity to
make a decision, and I'd hate to lose someone good, someone I
really like, because that window closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams are interested in Casserly. It is no secret New
Orleans owner Tom Benson wants to talk with Casserly about running
the Saints. Casserly admits that two other teams have shown
interest in him but refuses to disclose them.
</P>
<P>
   League sources say one is the New York Jets. Casserly has a
close relationship with Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It was Parcells and former Redskins coach Joe Gibbs who really
got McNair's attention regarding Casserly. They gave him glowing
recommendations, as have others in the NFL, including owners,
general managers and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly admits that he is excited about the possibility of
working for McNair. But, like McNair, Casserly insisted that no
agreement has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that Bob and I've had a chance to continue the
discussions we began last week,'' Casserly said. ``There are so
many things you have to talk about when you're starting an
organization from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things is that we'd want to have our
scouting department up and running by June.''

IT DOESN'T TAKE A SHRINK TO SEE THE COWBOYS ARE CRUMBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was in-your-face trash-talking at its most distasteful. The
fact that it was coming from the mouth of the 57-year-old owner of
the Dallas Cowboys made it that much more repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``John in Plano'' was getting a glimpse _ and an earful _ of a
Jerry Jones, the same one that normally sugarcoats every move by
claiming it's in the best interests of ``owah fans,'' rarely seen
or heard and it wasn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you like those three Super Bowls?'' Jones taunted, his
voice and temper rising as he outshouted the phone-in caller to
KTCK/The Ticket on the morning of Chan Gailey's firing. ``How did
you like those three Super Bowls?''
</P>
<P>
   John had had the temerity to suggest that it was Jones himself
who might be the problem with the Cowboys and that he should resign
as general manager and hire a real football man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   That, Jones said then and reiterated later that evening at the
news conference called to announce Gailey's firing, isn't going to
happen in this lifetime. He will never be just another owner,
writing checks.
</P>
<P>
   And that in a nutshell, dear fans, is why the Cowboys will
never, as long as Jones is running the show, be much better than
what they were this year. This, unfortunately, is about as good as
it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Those three Super Bowls Jones keeps crowing about? Won when not
only the Cowboys' system was different, but when the entire league
was different, before salary cap and free agency turned it into the
NML _ National Mediocrity League.
</P>
<P>
   The Team of the '90s that Jones is so proud of has won but a
single playoff game since its Super Bowl run in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   There's another key ingredient missing now from those Super Bowl
teams: Jimmy Johnson (and yes, he had a heck of a lot more to do
with the third one than the guy who carried the title of head coach
at the time).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson ruined the Cowboys' job for any future coach that might
occupy that same desk because there's no way they can ever match
the reality or the myth that he left.
</P>
<P>
   His ghost may prowl the halls of Valley Ranch forever. It would
serve Jones right.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jerry would ever hire another Jimmy Johnson anyway.
Johnson provided the counter-balance to Jones' bombastic ownership
style. It was Jimmy who made the football decisions then, not
Jerry. It was Jimmy's personality that dominated the team, not the
owner's. Jones will never let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament that the Cowboys find themselves in today was
forecast in a letter sports psychologist Dr. Don Beck of the
National Values Center in Denton sent to Jones two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an excerpt from that letter:
</P>
<P>
   ``You claim to be installing \R your\S managerial philosophy
within the Dallas Cowboys in the belief that the basic historic
functions of the traditional `head coach' have shifted into the
system itself where they are now shared rather than being deposited
in a single person. That's well and good, but this new kind of
framework can ONLY work when the CEO is not ego-driven, prefers to
stay in the background, and only acts to keep the total system
operating in a clear, efficient, effective and natural manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``...it sometimes seems you create a dysfunctional conflict
between the progressive operating philosophy you advocate and your
own `overly excitable' personality, a high-rolling entrepreneur's
need for credit, demands for personal status and visibility, and
virtual insistence that you are the Dallas Cowboys _ X's and O's,
socks and jocks, dollars and cents, hearts and minds...
</P>
<P>
   ``You have virtually transformed the Dallas Cowboys Football
Club into the Jones Family Enterprise. That is incompatible with
the very management models you claim to respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beck's prediction has come all too true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be a forecaster of doom and gloom at all, but
the pattern is so clear,'' Dr. Beck said this week. ``He's locked
into a closed loop. As long as he runs the one-man-band syndrome,
he'll have trouble. The fault lines are designed into his system
and will continue to plague the organization in spite of his best
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, whatever you may have thought of him, never had a
chance. He became the unwitting (no jokes, please) victim of Jones'
own system, the classic scapegoat for the sins of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was fired, it would have been difficult to find a
handful of fans who weren't ready to buy the coach a bus ticket out
of town. Only Jones could make an entire nation feel sorry for
Gailey, but he managed to do so without even half trying.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Beck is right; football Camelot in Dallas is dead and gone.
As long as Jones is running the show, the Cowboys are doomed to
repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   To be perfectly honest, we probably didn't need a sports
psychologist to tell us that.
</P>
<P>
   ``John in Plano'' already had it figured out.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sat., Jan 15:
</P>
<P>
   The British government has bowed to a ruling of the European
Court of Human Rights and ceased its ban on gays in the military.
Nearly every NATO member has now ended discrimination against gay
men and women in the armed forces. Britain's defense department,
like that of the United States, long maintained that the presence
of openly gay troops would hurt morale and discipline. But there is
ample evidence from other European nations, like France, that this
is not true.
</P>
<P>
   The British military will replace the ban on gays with a code of
conduct that applies to all service members, whether homosexual or
heterosexual. The guidelines would still allow commanders to
respond to inappropriate conduct like sexual relations between
commanders and subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's military did not make the change voluntarily. If
experience is any guide, however, lifting the ban will have little
impact on military life. Canada, which also had a ban on gay
troops, was compelled by a federal court to reverse its policy in
1992. There is no evidence that the change in policy has led to
harassment, resignations or unit breakdowns. Australia has had much
the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   The continued resistance of U.S. military leaders to ending the
compromise ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy is based on the
judgment that openly gay individuals are a risk to unit cohesion
and discipline. Yet several academic studies in recent years
examining foreign militaries and paramilitary organizations such as
fire and police departments have found no evidence that the
presence of openly gay individuals compromised performance.
Researchers have also found that even where there is a long history
of bigotry, a change in policy can be smoothly carried out when
strong emphasis is placed on conduct and compliance with clear
rules that apply to all.
</P>
<P>
   The change in British practice leaves the U.S. military nearly
alone among Western nations in its official policy of
discrimination. It is another clear indication that Washington's
attitude is behind the times.

EDITORIAL: THE COZY WORLD OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Jan. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Political patronage is so deeply entrenched in some corners of
New York state's court system that well-connected lawyers consider
it a personal entitlement to receive lucrative legal assignments
from the judges they help elect. The public got a revealing glimpse
of this sleazy culture earlier this month through disclosure of a
candid letter written by two officials of the Brooklyn Democratic
Party to protest being excluded from patronage spoils. The two
officials complained about being frozen out of legal work by
another well-connected lawyer who funneled the work to his own firm
instead, notwithstanding their ``unquestioned loyalty'' to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   The letter tacitly confirmed a longstanding arrangement under
which judges channel legal business to party leaders, undermining
the impartiality of local courts in Brooklyn. The question now is
how many judges and lawyers participate in the scheme, and whether
it involves kickbacks or other abuses. The FBI has reportedly
opened an investigation. That shows more curiosity than did
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, whose response to the
letter was to issue a statement handing the matter to the state
Grievance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This week New York's chief judge, Judith Kaye, announced several
steps to identify and, she hoped, destroy pockets of favoritism and
patronage. These steps include the appointment of a special
inspector general to monitor and enforce existing court rules
against favoritism and the creation of a new panel to propose
long-range improvements in the fiduciary appointment process.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of courthouse patronage extends, of course, beyond
Brooklyn. It is practically hard-wired into the state's system of
electing judges, which fosters an unhealthy reliance on party
leaders by judges who are supposed to remain above partisan
politics. The state Legislature shows no interest in switching to a
system of merit selection. But even without that reform, there is
much Judge Kaye can do to depoliticize the courts by creating a
central system for awarding court business that is open to all
qualified lawyers, not just the well connected.

INSTEAD OF PLAYING, HORNETS AND KNICKS GRIEVE FOR PHILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ When the National Basketball Association
decided to postpone Friday night's game between the New York Knicks
and the Charlotte Hornets, it gave the Knicks a reprieve of one
game from being placed in the awkward position of playing a team in
mourning. On Saturday night, they will face Charlotte at Madison
Square Garden, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday night that included executives
from the league and the National Basketball Players Association, as
well as the Hornets representative Elden Campbell, the sides
discussed postponing Saturday's game but quickly dropped the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would probably be pushing our luck,'' said
Patrick Ewing, who, as the president of the players union, was on
the conference call with commissioner David Stern; deputy
commissioner Russ Granik; the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter, and Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we got this one, and we're going to go to the memorial
today and pay our respects to the family. Postponing it was
discussed, but they said that one would be tough. I'm glad we got
at least one.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a change of plans at the last moment, the
Hornets will play Saturday, board a flight around midnight and
travel to the funeral for their teammate Bobby Phills, which is
planned for 1 p.m. Sunday in Baton Rouge, La. The next day, the
Hornets are scheduled to play Toronto in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   For a day, the Hornets were given time to grieve without having
to think about basketball. Friday, the Phills family, friends and
Hornet teammates were joined by the Knicks, who remained in town to
practice, at a memorial service at Central Church of God.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult service for a number of those who spoke.
Coach Paul Silas of Charlotte was weary with emotion after
describing the smile of Phills, his team captain, and expressing
how much of a team player Phills was when he recently asked the
coach to play him off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Hornets' vice president, Bob Bass, broke down and was
consoled at the podium as he sobbed and said, `'The bad thing is, I
never told Bobby that I loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   The expressions of respect for Phills came from every direction:
from his wife, Kendall, to the Hornets' owner, George Shinn, in the
hymn sung by the recording star Regina Bell (who is the wife of
Phills' former teammate, John Battle), and in the message delivered
by the pastors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most painful moments came when David Wesley, the
teammate who the police say was racing with Phills before his fatal
collision on Wednesday, fought off his emotions and described a
light moment he had with his close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to talk about one time,'' Wesley said. ``We were
in a golf cart coming around a hill, and we saw about three shots
of sand go up. And Bobby's still in the sand trap. All of a sudden,
the ball comes out, and it's landing next to the hole. And he's
talking about he won the hole. That's Bobby. We had some great
talks and some great times, and that's the Bobby I know.''
</P>
<P>
   There were humorous recollections, and several uplifting moments
during an inspirational sermon by the Rev. Kenneth Paramore.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he discussed God's enigma by saying, ``God, why is
there a drug dealer on my street, but Bobby is gone?'' And he ended
his sermon by saying: ``Bobby, he won. It may look like he lost,
but he won because he knows the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two hours after the service began, the players,
friends and family members were dismissed. It was close to 4:30
p.m. when everyone left the church. If the game Friday night had
been played, the players would have had less than an hour to get
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been rough,'' Larry Johnson of the Knicks said.
``I know I wouldn't have been able to focus on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the league was slow to postpone the game, it was clear
from the conversations that Stern and Granik had with the union and
Campbell that it was unfathomable for the teams to play a game a
couple of hours after an emotionally draining service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the league we should do whatever the Hornets wanted to
do,'' Ewing said. ``Those guys felt that they needed time to grieve
and get ready for the ceremony today.''

RESURGENT NETS' NEXT GOAL IS THE PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When the Nets' shots were clanging off
the rim and their opponents were making unrestrained dashes to the
basket, the most encouraging aspect about New Jersey was its
seemingly secure spot in the National Basketball Association's
draft lottery. Defeating a team with a winning record appeared to
be improbable. Qualifying for the Eastern Conference playoffs
seemed impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Nets take their home floor Saturday night against
the Boston Celtics, they will be just one victory from ninth place
in the conference standing. While the top eight teams reach the
playoffs, the Nets' proximity to the final berth signifies the
tremendous turnaround that has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   After starting the season 2-15, a run of 13 victories in 18
games has reinserted the Nets into the playoff race. At 15-20, the
Nets are bunched around 9th and 10th place with Orlando, Boston and
Cleveland. In the mediocre Eastern Conference, where a sub-.500
record may get a team into the playoffs, the Nets are a mere three
and a half games out of eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good knowing that we faced a lot of adversity as a
team,'' said Stephon Marbury, who has keyed the Nets' surge with
superb play at point guard. ``We came out when it was really tough
and played hard. We've always played hard, but it was like we were
playing hard in spurts. Now we're playing 48 minutes. We're the
attackers and we're not being attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' ascension is not deceptive. While they benefited from
playing 11 of 15 games at home in December, four of their 10
victories that month came against teams that would make the
playoffs if the regular season ended today. And within the past
week, the Nets handed first-place Miami only its fifth loss in 17
home games and beat a scrappy Orlando club, proving that on the
road, the Nets could not only win but also prevail in close
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Nets have righted themselves, Kendall Gill warns
that they must keep their edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn how to handle success, and you do that by not
being too overconfident,'' he said. ``I think we didn't know how to
handle it earlier in the year when we went 5-3 in the preseason. We
thought we were going to come out here and beat everybody like we
had been doing. Now we just have to stay humble, know that we're a
good team, but come out and play hard and know that if we don't
come to play, we'll get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Thursday's 110-105 victory over the struggling Los
Angeles Clippers, that point has sunk in with the Nets. Even during
their recent resurgence, they displayed a disturbing habit of
losing to lesser opponents. They twice gave away fourth-quarter
leads in losing to the Washington Wizards, dropped a game to a
woeful Chicago Bulls team that was playing without Toni Kukoc, and
lost at home to the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nets had won those games, their record would already be
above .500, and they would be tied for sixth in the conference.
Even so, there was a time not too long ago when 15-20 seemed out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 2-15, it was like quasi-survival,'' coach Don Casey said.
``We just had to get out of the dysfunctional state that we were
in. We've always had little goals, and one was to get to .500 by
the All-Star break, which is possible, maybe probable. But we've
got some road trips ahead of us. We could slip.''
</P>
<P>
   After his team was humbled by its poor start, Casey said he did
not worry about his club getting too comfortable with success.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are pretty resilient kids,'' he said. ``The fact is that
they stayed together when we were 2-15. There was frustration, but
there wasn't a whole lot of finger-pointing. The coaches didn't
point and say give me better players. The players didn't say give
me better coaches. We kind of stayed together, so I think they
understand the path.''

ALFRED NZO, 74, ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER, SOUTH AFRICAN DIPLOMAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBUR South Africa _ Alfred Nzo, who helped lead some of
the earliest battles against South Africa's apartheid regime and
decades later became the country's first black foreign minister,
died on Thursday in a clinic here. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   A leading figure in the African National Congress for more than
30 years, many of them spent in exile, Nzo was a key figure in the
negotiations that led to the country's first all-race vote in 1994
and became one of the country's most important ambassadors to the
world after the election of Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Nzo, who suffered a stroke last month, had been hospitalized
since then at the Olivedale Clinic, the African National Congress'
spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki, part of a younger generation of
liberation fighters, praised Nzo, who retired from government last
year after the election of Mbeki. ``To his last day, he was an
unwavering champion of nonracialism and nonsexism,'' Mbeki said in
a statement. ``He stood for a united country and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other leaders of the struggle against apartheid, Nzo
found his calling at the University of Fort Hare, where he joined
the ANC's Youth League. It was the beginning of an allegiance that
would last his lifetime, eventually making him the party's
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   He left Fort Hare in 1946, after his second year. Back in
Johannesburg, he studied part time at a technical college, and in
1951 he was licensed as a health inspector and assigned to work in
Alexandra, one of the area's impoverished townships.
</P>
<P>
   The poverty and deprivation he observed heightened his political
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to play a part in the incipient struggle, he helped
organize the defiance campaigns of the 1950s. In 1956, his activism
cost him his job as health inspector, and he then thrust himself
headlong into the activities of the ANC. Without his job, he lost
his right to reside in Alexandra, but he did not leave, and that
made him a frequent target of the security forces. He was arrested
repeatedly, ordered banned, and on more than one occasion
imprisoned. In 1963 and 1964, he was detained for a total of 238
days.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his release, he went into exile, becoming a
diplomat for the African National Congress, first in Cairo, Egypt,
later in New Delhi, India.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he was elected the movement's secretary-general and
moved to its headquarters in Tanzania. He remained
secretary-general, overseeing much of the African National
Congress' day-to-day operations, until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He remained part of the inner circle that negotiated with the
government and laid the groundwork for the country's change in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Nzo is survived by his wife, Regina, and their son.

CARBONNEAU PLAYING YOUNG AT HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Maybe it's an indictment on the
Stars that their best forward this season has been a 39-year-old
center who occasionally loses feeling in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it's just that Guy Carbonneau isn't your
average 39-year-old center.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fountain of youth,'' Stars forward Mike Keane likes to call
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm doing what he's doing as well as he's doing it at age
39, I'll either (a) commit suicide or (b) be one hurting unit,''
Stars winger Blake Sloan said. ``That's a real testament to the
type of player he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The type of player he is defies every current athlete stereotype
there is.
</P>
<P>
   He's unselfish, willing to spend maybe his last season helping a
player like Sloan develop. He's a yeoman, playing a defensive role
as he goes against other teams' top lines night after night. He has
become Dallas' best player by doing what he does best. Working
hard, being consistent and never giving less than everything he
has.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing it in pain, playing with cervical stenosis, a lot
like Michael Irvin's condition. An unusually narrow spinal cord
causes him to sporadically lose feeling in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies, of course, wear down with time. Carbonneau turns 40 in
March, spending almost three-fourths of those years playing a game
that grinds on a body like a grater on cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed, they told me the same thing again that I
wouldn't play as much, maybe 50 games, and I started laughing
because I knew that wasn't going to happen,'' Carbonneau said.
``The reason it doesn't happen is I don't let it happen. I want to
play because of who I am, and I know I can do my job and help the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have never needed him more. Of the five centers who
were on the roster when the season began, two will be in the lineup
at 9 tonight against Vancouver at General Motors Place.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano is out with a''real mild'' concussion. Brian
Skrudland is out indefinitely with a chest contusion. Derek Plante
was relegated to minor-league affiliate Kalamazoo long ago. That
leaves only Joe Nieuwendyk and Carbonneau, who has played more than
any of the rest of them, seeing action in 42 of the Stars' 44 games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't just filling time either. The oldest player in the NHL
is averaging 15-plus minutes a game and ranking among the team
leaders in plus/minus (second at plus-9), hits (fifth with 90) and
blocked shots (third with 40).
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said that he thinks Carbonneau has
played so well that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman should use one of
his commissioner's picks to put him in the All-Star team. There
were no commissioner's picks last season, but Bettman selected Mark
Messier, Al MacInnis, Jari Kurri and Igor Larionov in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two guys that have had terrific years this year are
Carbonneau and Keane,'' Hitchcock said. ``Carbo's a perfect example
of how long attitude can carry you. Because to me, Carbo is a
player when he steps on the ice, whoever he's playing against, his
attitude is `I'm better.' I think that cockiness and that
aggressive attitude has given him a career longer than anybody
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody thought he was done after the 1993-94
season in Montreal. The few that weren't thought he was after the
1994-95 season in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody that is except Carbonneau and Stars general manager
Bob Gainey.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey traded for him on Oct. 2, 1995. Carbonneau is now in his
fifth season with the Stars. Oh yeah, he's also going to be the guy
tonight asked to shut down the Canucks' top line of Mark Messier,
Todd Bertuzzi and Markus Naslund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and I love it,'' Carbonneau said, a gigantic smile
creasing his face. ``I love a challenge. That's how I built my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he plays, though, wears on a body. The effects of the
cervical stenosis is felt when his neck is in certain positions,
usually after checks. The spinal cord plucks the nerve and sends
electrical stimulations down to his hands, causing them to lose
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only one of the injuries he has battled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably say he's had most everything,'' Stars trainer
Dave Surprenant said. ``Yet, he's in as good of shape as anybody on
the team. That's his longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he needs a little more rest. As Hitchcock said, ``I think
for us to be successful we have to find periods of time, regardless
of who is in our lineup, to rest him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau had the day off yesterday, watching practice from
atop the rink. He was talking about wine (he collects it) and
France (he has never been there).
</P>
<P>
   ``I may go in September on a wine-buying trip,'' Carbonneau
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's training camp isn't it, Carbo?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I said maybe,'' he said with a sly smile. ``I don't
know if I'm going to retire. I'm pretty sure \RI am\S. But I
thought last year was my last year. Really, definitely, I thought
after winning a Stanley Cup that was going to be my last year. Then
one morning in July I got up, and I felt like running again. That's
how it happens. This summer, I'll get up in July sometime, and if I
don't feel like running then I'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   So no, it isn't an indictment of the Stars that their best
forward this season has been a 39-year-old center who occasionally
loses feeling in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Not when that player is Guy Carbonneau.

DR. PAUL B. SIGLER, 65, SCIENTIST WHO STUDIED ORGANIC STRUCTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Benjamin Sigler, a molecular biologist at Yale and a
pioneer in the study of the organic structure of organisms,
collapsed and died on Tuesday on a walk from his home to his
laboratory on the campus in New Haven. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, the university reported.
</P>
<P>
   Sigler, who also conducted research at Yale with support from
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, contributed to the
understanding of cell development, hormone regulation and cancerous
growths. His basic research in structural biology concerned changes
and aberrations in the number or arrangement of chromosomes in
animals or plants.
</P>
<P>
   Sigler came to the field in a roundabout way. A native of
Richmond, Va., he graduated summa cum laude from Princeton with a
degree in chemistry in 1955 and prepared for a medical career.
</P>
<P>
   He trained at Columbia University, where he received an M.D. in
1959. After his internship and residency at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center, he turned to basic research and received a
doctorate in biochemistry at Cambridge, in England, in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   By then he had joined the handful of biophysicists who employed
crystallography to plumb the secrets of enzyme function by charting
the structure of proteins. After a brief stint at the National
Institutes of Health, he worked at the Medical Research Council
Laboratory in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he moved to the University of Chicago, where he rose to
the rank of professor of biochemistry and molecular biology. There,
he determined the structure of the RNA molecule, which initiates
protein synthesis. He also began his original studies of proteins
that regulate the flow of information encoded in genes. He
continued that work at Yale, where he arrived in 1989. In 1992, he
was selected for the National Academy of Sciences, which advises
the federal government on various issues.

   Sigler is survived by his wife of 41 years, Althea Jo Martin
Sigler; four daughters, Jennifer L. Sigler of Port Jefferson, N.Y.,
Michelle A. Sigler of London, Deborah R. Sigler of Berkeley,
Calif., and Rebecca L. Africano of Normal, Ill.; a son, Jonathan

2 GIS FINALLY LAID TO REST AFTER 29 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jon Eric Reid died nearly 29 years ago, but people
don't fade away easily.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on a frigid morning at Arlington National Cemetery, it
mattered little whether the Phoenix soldier perished in 1971, 1991
or even 2000.
</P>
<P>
   If only for a few moments, Army Warrant Officer ``Jake'' Reid
was back. He was summoned during a funeral service and burial
Friday by the memories of his family and his fellow helicopter
pilots who had returned home from the Vietnam War without knowing
whether he was dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   Now they know.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots looked skyward when four UH-1C ``Huey'' copters flew
in a diamond formation over the tree-covered crest where Reid, long
listed as missing in action, will be memorialized. A few of them
smiled when they heard the ``whoop, whoop'' of the rotor blades
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell some of you were going back 30 years in your
hearts and in your minds,'' Senior Army Chaplain Gilley Richardson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and David M. May were piloting a Huey gunship for the 48th
Assault Helicopter Company on Feb. 20, 1971, when they were hit by
enemy ground fire in Laos. The helicopter landed upright on its
skids, the tail boom broken off and the right rear burning.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the fates of Reid, May and the other two members of
their crew remained uncertain, and their families held out hope
they might have fled the wreck. In 1998, the Army excavated the
site and, last October, identified Reid and May from dental records
and DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of relief as about 65 of Reid and May's
relatives and friends gathered at the 612-acre cemetery, which
looks down on the nation's capital from a hill across the Potomac
River. More than 265,000 people from all military service branches
are buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the coldest, clearest day of the new year, which was
somehow fitting for two families finally getting the clarity they
needed about the fates of two sons long missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks the end of a very long journey,'' May's family
said in a statement. He was from Hyattsville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also sadness at the finality of it all, at letting
go of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the 3rd U.S. Infantry (``The Old Guard'')
carried the flag-draped casket containing Reid's and May's
co-mingled remains to the grave site.
</P>
<P>
   Seven soldiers fired three volleys into the air.
</P>
<P>
   A lone bugler played ``taps.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Reid's brother, Mike, and his sister, Roxena
Wotring, sat near the casket accepting the greetings of
well-wishers and the thanks of a government. They said they were
gratified that a handful of the 48th Assault Company had traveled
here to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that they were very close,'' Wotring said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were close indeed, said Richard Lester, a fellow
pilot from the 48th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found pleasure in simple things like music, mail from home,
hot chow, cold beer, a periodic cold shower,'' Lester said in
remarks prepared for an earlier chapel service closed to the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Lester referred to the ``fog of controversy'' surrounding the
U.S. involvement in a war that millions of Americans only know
today through movies and history books. The strife and the war
protests didn't diminish the soldiers' honor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did all they were asked and, with their lives, showed
their commitment,'' Lester said. ``What more could their country
ask?''
</P>
<P>
   After the chapel service and burial were over, Mike Reid was
asked whether the formal ceremonies had contributed to a sense of
closure.
</P>
<P>
   He paused a long time, then replied, ``It helps.'' &QL;

JAMES P. O'NEIL, 55, PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL PRINTING CO.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ James P. O'Neil, the president and chief operating
officer of Browne &AMP; Co., believed to be the country's second-oldest
publicly traded company and one of the world's leading financial
printers, died on Thursday in New York City. He was 55 and lived in
Wayne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He died of cardiac arrest at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical
Center, said Denise K. Fletcher, a senior vice president and chief
financial officer of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Browne &AMP; Co. specializes in printing documents for initial
public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and other forms required
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Its revenues rose to
$850 million from $110 million during O'Neil's tenure, Ms. Fletcher
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil joined the company in 1984 as chief financial officer. In
1996, he became president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1775 in New York, Browne &AMP; Co. has offices in 51
cities in 12 countries. It has about 7,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Browne, O'Neil was a partner at J.H. Cohn &AMP; Co.,
an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   James Peter O'Neil was born in Glen Ridge, N.J., on Dec. 8,
1944. He received a bachelor of science degree in business
administration from Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J., in
1966. For the next two years, he served in the U.S. Army; he was
awarded a Silver Star during his tour of duty in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil is survived by his wife, JoAnne; a son, James J. O'Neil
of Queens; two daughters, Pamela Fauerbach of Little Falls, N.J.,
and Kathleen O'Neil of Wayne; two brothers, Robert, of Neshanic
Station, N.J., and Jack, of Norfolk, Va.; and a sister, Peggy.

HERB GRAFF, 74, A CINEPHILE AND PRESERVATIONIST, IS DEAD

 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herb Graff, who devoted most of his life to
collecting, preserving and showing movies, especially early talkies
of the 1930s, and a cinephile whose calling card read simply but
accurately ``Film Resource,'' died on Sunday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said John Cocchi, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Graff _ always Herb, never Herbert _ was not a critic or an
author and he never expressed a desire to be a director, but he
made a significant contribution to the art of movies. He knew more
about them than most historians or archivists. For him, film was a
passion and a valuable cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   When he lectured, which he often did at universities, for arts
organizations and at the Players club, he did it the old-fashioned
way. In a time of VCRs and DVD, he showed his movies on a
16-millimeter projector, often with a scratchy soundtrack,
accompanied by his knowing and witty commentary. An evening with
Graff had an improvisatory air, but was actually artful in the way
he would trace the genesis of a genre, exploring the difficult path
of black artists in early cinema or the growth of the American
movie musical.
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas Watt's 1989 profile of Graff in The New Yorker, Graff
said: ``Everybody loves old films _ everybody. But we're the only
country that never gave film the respect it deserves.'' He said
that 70 percent of all silent films had been lost. His mission _ a
word he would never use _ was to rescue celluloid before it
disintegrated into cinematic dust. As Watt wrote, Graff saw his
first Chaplin movie at the age of 10, and it changed his life. He
began collecting movies as a teen-ager, buying one-reelers and even
scraps of film discarded by film companies. His collection grew and
eventually he had his own private cinematheque of several hundred
features and more than 1,000 shorts.
</P>
<P>
   While working as a salesman in the garment industry (for Charles
Greenberg &AMP; Sons, which made Lucky Girl and Boy shirts), he began
offering a series of public screenings and was soon showing films
on PBS and at Town Hall in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although his principal interest was in early talkies, especially
musicals, his collection included silent films and also works from
the 1940s. When asked to name his favorite films, he began his list
with Chaplin's ``City Lights,'' Keaton's ``Our Hospitality'' and
``any Paramount Marx Brothers film (before they had love
stories).''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, hearing that Walter Kerr, then the drama critic of The
New York Herald Tribune, collected old movies, he got in touch with
him and offered to lend him some of his own. When Kerr was working
on his book ``The Silent Clowns,'' Graff became his guide and film
sleuth. After the book was published, the author thanked him as a
man ``who searched and searched and found and found and never
blinked an eye at the most impossible request.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendship led to Graff's alternative pastime as
theatergoer. Whenever Kerr's wife, Jean, was unable or unwilling to
attend a play, Graff would go in her stead. The frequency of these
appearances next to the critic on the aisle led to the theatrical
joke that Graff was actually Jean Kerr because the two of them had
never been seen together.
</P>
<P>
   Graff was born in Boston and grew up in Brooklyn. He served in
the Navy during World War II. He is survived by two sons, Michael,
of Bedford, N.Y., and Bennett, of New Haven; a daughter, Emily
Gersten of Yonkers, and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although Graff was active for many years as a lecturer and
consultant, it was not until 1983 that he finally gave up his day
job in the garment industry. As he told Watt, he had been in London
and passed a building with a plaque commemorating Ivor Novello as
``Actor, Manager and Composer _ 1893-1951.'' He recalled saying to
himself, ``Were I to die my tombstone would read, `Here Lies Herb
Graff, Sold Shirts in White, Pink, Beige and Blue, and Every Five
Years Lilac.''' When he returned to New York he went to work for
the Castle Hill film company and remained a movie professional the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Even after suffering a stroke in 1991, he continued to compile
his film collages and to screen them, giving his talks from a
wheelchair while never losing his enthusiasm. His epitaph might
read, ``Preserved Early Movies for Future Generations.''

LETTERMAN HAS BYPASS SURGERY AFTER DOCTORS FIND A BLOCKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Letterman, host of CBS' ``Late Show With David
Letterman,'' had successful quintuple bypass heart surgery Friday
at New York Presbyterian Hospital, according to his publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman, 52, had the emergency surgery after a test Friday
morning revealed that an artery leading to his heart was severely
constricted.
</P>
<P>
   On his show, Letterman often jokes about his cholesterol levels
and the oat bran he eats to help lower them. On Thursday, while
taping the show that was broadcast Friday night, he chatted with
Regis Philbin about the fact that he was going into the hospital
for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Letterman had an angiogram, which provides
pictures of the interior of the heart, because he has high
cholesterol levels and a family history of heart trouble (his
father died of heart disease while still in his 50s). The surgery
took place in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Late Show'' will broadcast reruns until Letterman's
return. It will be the first time that he is absent from the show
for reasons other than vacations, his spokesman, Howard J.
Rubenstein, said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never missed a show since 1982. He's the Cal Ripken of
TV,'' said Rubenstein, referring to the Baltimore Orioles shortstop
with the stellar attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's surgeon was Dr. O. Wayne Isom, chairman of
cardiothoracic surgery at the New York Weill Cornell Center. He
predicted a rapid recovery, according to the statement. Isom
performed similar surgery on Walter Cronkite in 1997, and on Larry
King in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave has the heart muscle of a 20-year-old,'' Isom said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Post, Letterman's cardiologist, said in the statement
that it was too early to tell how long Letterman's recovery would
take, but that his prognosis for a full and speedy recovery was
excellent because he was in good health and exercised regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman's show won Emmy Awards in 1994, 1998 and 1999 while he
was affiliated with CBS, and the show won five while he was
affiliated with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   CBS released a statement Friday that said: ``We're thrilled that
Dave's surgery went well. He is a valued member of the CBS family
and we love him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned first and foremost about his health, but we
can't wait until he's back behind his desk where he belongs.''

LABOR DISPUTE COULD CANCEL SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The inaugural season of the Los Angeles Avengers
could be canceled because of a labor dispute between a group of
players and the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The league informed its owners it will shut down unless a group
of players withdraws its threat to file an anti-trust lawsuit
against the league.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's expansion draft, which the Avengers were scheduled to
participate in, has been postponed, along with all mini-camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ownership will not do anything with the threat of a lawsuit
hanging over their heads,'' said deputy commissioner Rod Kurpiers.
``The league cannot go forward with the threat of a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 14 players has recently banded together in hopes of
forming an association. Players currently average between
$1,000-$1,500 per game in the league's 14-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the league is trying to bully the players into
forming a union and giving up their legal rights,'' said Jeffrey
Kessler, an attorney representing the association. ``The players
won't be bullied.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Avengers signed former Cal quarterback Justin
Vedder.

PARITY? NOT IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're about at the halfway point of the 1999-2000 season. Funny,
if someone hadn't said anything, this season looks a lot like last
season. For that matter, it looks like 1997-98 or the season before
that.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the parity that was promised before the season?
</P>
<P>
   As much as I hate to crash the parity party, women's college
basketball appears to be the only thing that hoax Y2K bug actually
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is No. 1, Tennessee No. 2 and Louisiana Tech is No.
4.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's see here. UConn was ranked first for seven weeks last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee ranked second is newsworthy only because the Lady Vols
aren't No. 1. Regardless, does anyone think Tennessee won't make
the Elite Eight? It would be the first time in six seasons if the
Lady Vols didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When the final Associated Press poll was released last season,
the aforementioned three teams were in the top four. In fact, that
threesome has been among the top four at the end of every season
since 1996. Since the NCAA started women's basketball as a Division
I sport in 1981-82, at least two of those teams have finished in
the top four of the rankings eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Are we seeing a pattern yet?
</P>
<P>
   Of the teams currently ranked in the AP top 10, eight started
the season there. Among the AP Top 25, there are only two new teams
since the poll came out before the season began. The Supreme Court
has more turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Top 25 really an indication of parity? Well, it would be
a nice start.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, women's basketball is on its way to another
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, UConn-type Final Four. Just what you
wanted, right? Another sequel to a sequel you've already seen. The
``Major League/ trilogy had more suspense.
</P>
<P>
   All the optimistic talk about parity was fueled by Purdue's
national championship last season that ended Tennessee's three-year
reign. That talk has been deposited in the ``Mavs-Win-NBA-Title''
folder.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of it is that there are still but a handful of
programs that have committed the resources for a sustained period
to build powers. Those that did _ Tennessee, Connecticut, Louisiana
Tech, Georgia and a few others _ are on a throne that doesn't seem
to be touchable.
</P>
<P>
   For all the progress women's basketball has made _ television,
professional leagues, increased participation and spending _ this
is one area that really needs help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most appealing aspects of men's college basketball is
the ever-present threat that No. 49 could beat No. 1. It's what
makes the NCAA Tournament arguably the greatest sporting event on
the calendar. Who remembers who won the men's NCAA Tournament last
season? Maybe you don't recall, but I bet you remember that Gonzaga
was one victory away from the Final Four or the season before that
Valparaiso reached the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Now ask yourself, what really memorable victories have there
been over the past two seasons in women's college basketball?
Sixteenth-seeded Harvard winning at top-seeded Stanford in the 1998
NCAA Tournament? Duke ending Tennessee's 1999 season last March?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, but those types of upsets are rare.
</P>
<P>
   As good as women's college basketball is, until teams like Tulsa
or TCU or Eastern Michigan have at least a shot at running with the
Louisiana Techs and Connecticuts, the game is going to be missing
one key element.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. MUSTANGS' RUCKER FINDS YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   After two years of college, SMU guard D-dra Rucker finally found
that getting away wasn't what she really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Carrollton Newman Smith's all-time leading scorer played for two
seasons at San Diego State. The Left Coast, however, never worked
out. Finally, after waiting for three seasons to show off the
potential that made her a 1997 All-State selection, she is thriving
in a place where she never envisioned three years ago: home at
nearby SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy I made the move back,'' said SMU's junior guard.
``Had I stayed in California, I don't think I would have developed
into a complete player. It's better for me basketball- and
education-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucker is tied for the team lead in scoring at 15.9 points per
game, leads in assists (3.7) and averages 4.9 rebounds for the 8-5
Mustangs. She was named the WAC's top player for last week and
leads the conference in steals, averaging 3.2 per game.
</P>
<P>
   After coach Beth Burns left SDSU for Ohio State in 1997, Rucker
and five other players transferred. Initially, Rucker told TCU that
she would come to Fort Worth. But, she had a last-minute change of
heart and made the switch to SMU.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that one of the reasons she chose Fort
Worth-Dallas is because the only family member who lives in Texas,
her mother, Barbara, lives near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and I are really close,'' Rucker said. ``It's a big
deal that she's the only one in Texas. When I played at San Diego
State she would come to a lot of the games and now she doesn't have
to go so far.'' \Nsubheds:FAST BREAKS \Nsubheds:No kidding
\Nagatea:With her team trailing at halftime at Arkansas on Monday
night by 13 points, Tennessee coach Pat Summitt used a little truth
to inspire her team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that we can't feel sorry for ourselves \Rfor
losing to Connecticut last Sunday\S,'' she said. ``Nobody else in
America does.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols rallied for a 79-69 victory, the program's 800th
victory. \Nsubheds:It still counts \Nagatea:Victory No. 500 could
have come at the expense of No. 1 Connecticut on Jan. 2. One
humbling defeat later and Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore got his
milestone victory ... against South Alabama on Monday night, 90-33.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really makes this special is I have accomplished it in my
hometown and at the school that I've always loved,'' said Barmore.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year head coach became the 15th women's college
basketball coach to win 500 games. ``I've been wanting the
attention focused more on the team than myself,'' he said.
\Nsubheds:Virginia loses player \Nagatea:Virginia junior guard Erin
Stovall, who left the team indefinitely last month for undisclosed
personal reasons, will not return to the Cavaliers this season,
coach Debbie Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for both of us at this time is to leave things
as they are and revisit it in the spring,'' Ryan said in a prepared
statement. ``We reached a decision this week that she will not
return for the remainder of the 1999-2000 season. We will miss
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall, a two-year starter and a preseason first-team
all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection this season, was second on
the team in scoring with a 13.8 average when she left the team
prior to a Dec. 20 game against Virginia Tech.  &LR; subheds:Bad break
 &LR; agatea:Wisconsin freshman center Nina Smith suffered a fractured
right foot in practice on Jan. 1 and will miss six to eight weeks.
Smith, the ``USA Today'' and ``Parade'' 1999 high school player of
the year, was averaging 11 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.
\Nsubheds:Who's better \Nagateb:When No. 9 Rutgers plays No. 1
Connecticut at 2 p.m. Monday on ESPN, it signifies the Huskies'
toughest conference game this year. If Rutgers has any chance to
pull off an upset, All-Big East guard Shawnetta Stewart must match
up with UConn's Shea Ralph. Ralph Stewart Pos. G Yr: Jr. Sr. Ht:
6-0 5-10 Ppg: 16.3 15.1 Rpg: 3.6 6.8 Apg: 5.2 3.3 Team's Record:
13-0 11-2 Team's Rank: 1 9
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Neither is going to score 30 points, but both are
capable of pulling off a triple-double any night. Stewart should be
up for the game, but even after two knee surgeries, Ralph is the
better player.

   MALIBU, Calif. _ St. Mary's center Brad Millard is so big, the
Lakers needed two scouts to evaluate him Friday against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Millard, the Gaels' 7-foot-3 wide body with surprising athletic
ability, brought Lakers vice president Jerry West and general
manager Mitch Kupchak out to Malibu for an evening at Firestone
Fieldhouse. Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor was there too, as
were eight other NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a guy that's hardly played the last two years
because of a broken left foot. But when you're 7-3, as long as
you're breathing, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, West and Kupchak should have bypassed
Pepperdine and taken in a nice dinner at one of those fancy
restaurants along Pacific Coast Highway. The game was a rout _
frisky Pepperdine breezed to an easy 77-49 victory in both teams'
West Coast Conference opener _ and Millard never left the bench
while nursing an injured right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Prince and Brandon Armstrong scored 15 points each for
the Waves. Pepperdine (11-5, 1-0) held St. Mary's (5-9, 0-1) to
24.5 percent shooting on 13 of 53 shots. The Waves also forced 28
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With numbers like that, and no Millard to look over, is it any
wonder West, Kupchak and Baylor slipped out of the arena at
halftime?
</P>
<P>
   Millard hasn't played the last three games, missing the first
because of the flu and the second while serving a suspension for
disciplinary reasons. The official word on Millard's absence Friday
was that the right ankle he tweaked in practice earlier this week
never improved. But some suggest his sour mood over a dismal season
is holding him back more than the tender ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Millard had X-rays taken on the foot Friday, which came up
negative. But he still didn't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his injuries and pain still in the foot, albeit the
opposite foot, we're not taking any chances,'' St. Mary's coach
Dave Bollwinkle said. ``We want to hold him back until we have a
better evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Millard, who is expected to be a first-round pick in the NBA
draft in June, is putting up decent numbers, averaging 13.5 points
and 8.0 rebounds. Not bad considering he missed all of 1997-98 and
all but three games last year with the broken left foot. But the
strain of carrying a mediocre team is beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   Something was bothering him Friday. He mostly just sat at the
end of St. Mary's bench, his chin in his hand and an indifferent
look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Pepperdine cared much _ about Millard's health, mental
state or NBA future.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves were never in danger after opening a 25-10 lead midway
through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine pushed into blowout mode early in the second half,
taking a 46-25 lead five minutes in, then survived another 15
minutes of garbage time to notch its third straight win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our defensive schemes, when they're executed well, can
create some turnover situations and steals and I thought we did
some of those things,'' Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff said.
``Sometimes a team will do a good job for a while because we're not
as crisp with our execution. I thought in the second half we
stepped it up and got some steals and we were able to break the
game open.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Greer scored 16 points to lead St. Mary's, which came away
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're one of the top three teams in the conference,
no doubt about it,'' Bollwinkle said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine plays host to San Diego today at 4 p.m.

LAKERS STREAK ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When the mightiest winning machine in the NBA at
last sputtered and crashed, it was the smallest, most
benign-looking cogs that fouled the system and stopped the forward
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers entered Conseco Fieldhouse on Friday
carrying 16 consecutive wins. They left with a decidedly unfamiliar
feeling _ a 111-102 loss to the East-leading Indiana Pacers before
a euphoric sellout crowd of 18,345.
</P>
<P>
   And it all ended because of a pair of afterthoughts named Austin
Croshere and Travis Best. The two reserves scored 22 of the Pacers'
36 points in the decisive fourth quarter and put an end to the
longest NBA winning streak in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things,'' coach Phil Jackson noted, ``come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   This one finally did, 37 days after it started.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the Lakers won and won and won, cranking
out victories like Aaron Spelling cranks out TV shows and inspiring
musings of matching the league-record 33-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Even Spelling misses now and then. The Streak was similarly
fated to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to happen at some point,'' Glen Rice said, ``and
I think the best thing we can gather from this game is we've got to
learn from it. It's definitely going to make us a stronger team. It
seems like when you have a streak like we had and you lose, you
hope that it makes the chemistry and the character on the team
stronger, and you'll be able to go out and get that streak going
again.''
</P>
<P>
   This one ended when the Lakers' vaunted defense at last failed
them in a fourth quarter, and when their trio of stars at last
failed to deliver consistent offense.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-point surge in the fourth got Rice to 20 points, but he
finished 9 for 20 from the field. Shaquille O'Neal missed his usual
close-range flip-ins for the second straight game and made just 10
of 25 shots for 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never usually miss 15 shots,'' O'Neal said. ``A lot of those
were in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be the Sports Illustrated jinx or something,'' O'Neal
said, referencing this week's cover that featured him.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, trying to match the output of Reggie Miller,
slipped into some old bad habits, playing wildly at times and
finishing 7 for 19 for 18 points. Miller led the Pacers with 22
points, and Jalen Rose hit 8 of 12 shots for 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Kobe played a real heady game tonight,''
Jackson said. ``There's a lot he has to learn, experience-wise, in
this kind of an offense, as to how to use it. We didn't get the
ball back into Shaq as much as we could have in the course of the
game. But Shaq wasn't hitting his shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a 15-point game from Ron Harper and some steady
bench play, the Lakers were, as usual, in position to win.
</P>
<P>
   They led by five early in the fourth quarter before the Pacers
aided by three turnovers mounted a 15-2 run that gave them a 94-86
advantage with 5:26 to go. But Rice rattled off eight quick points,
including a pair of 3-pointers, as the Lakers cut the lead to
100-96 with 2:33 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then Croshere knocked the wind out of them with a 3-pointer, and
Bryant fouled out trying to stop Best _ a 5-foot-11 speedster who
dealt Bryant his last three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Rice hit his final 3-pointer with 37.4 seconds left to make it a
five-point game, but the Lakers chose not to foul immediately, and
their defense failed them, as Miller put it away with a 14-footer
with 18.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew The Streak would end sometime, and the Pacers were
as good an opponent to lose to as any. But that didn't stop the
sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it bothers me. Of course it bothers me,'' Bryant said.
``I didn't want to lose for the remainder of the season. It always
bothers you when you lose. But that's fine. We'll start another
streak.''

COACH: FULL (OF HIMSELF) ARENA?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ From afar, critics say Bruce Arena
personifies cockiness in action, emitting an aura of
self-absorbance rarely seen in his profession outside the likes of
a Pat Riley, Jimmy Johnson or Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   (But based on that trio's resumes, it's not such bad company.)
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with employers, colleagues and the media isn't
always exemplary, with occasional comments leaving some red-faced
and others seething.
</P>
<P>
   And it only gets worse for rivals, since he creates the means
for victory everywhere he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as his detractors quickly point out, you can't spell the
word ``arrogance'' without using the letters a-r-e-n-a.
</P>
<P>
   But on the American sporting landscape, no coach is more misread
than 48-year-old Arena, U.S. Soccer's latest men's national team
coach. His team takes on Iran in a friendly at the Rose Bowl on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Men's soccer, you say? That sport in which the U.S takes not a
back seat but the trunk when it comes to global respect?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's about to change. And you can thank Bruce Arena for
that. Just check the facts: He gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   After building a dynasty of sorts by orchestrating five NCAA
Division I championships at Virginia, Arena pursued new challenges,
toting his magic wand with him as head coach of DC United in the
newly formed Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a less than memorable start _ an initial 1-6 record,
which had some critics wondering aloud if college soccer's premiere
coach could handle the professional ranks _ Arena's sides won
back-to-back MLS crowns before losing to Chicago in the title game
in the third season.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, United came to symbolize a degree of
professionalisn and attention to detail which many credit to
Arena's presence. Others envied it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had proved himself domestically, United States
Soccer Federation officials searched elsewhere for a national team
coach to replace exiled Steve Sampson following the World Cup
debacle in France '98.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, then president of USSF, seemed intent on
looking abroad, saying Arena lacked the ``international experience
to handle the side.'' Others within the USSF hierarchy seemed split
on the issue. Eventually, a lack of available quality candidates,
and mounting support for an American to coach the U.S., gave the
native New Yorker his chance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. The U.S. has posted a string of quality
triumphs, including a pair of victories over Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But 2000 brings bigger challenges, with the upcoming Gold Cup
among the obstacles precluding qualifying for World Cup 2002. The
U.S appears ready for not just the periodic big win but performing
with the consistency required to gain credibility on the global
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It a great atmosphere, everybody feels like they're a part of
the team... nothing is going on behind closed doors,'' said forward
Brian McBride, a deadly aerial threat from close range on the U.S.
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce has made a tremendous difference in our mindset. He
always talks about winning games, playing to our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Sampson's methods in doling out playing time were
unpopular in France, coupled with a defensive-minded strategy which
arguably hindered their chances of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to a T, players talk of the fairness and respect
permeating training-camp sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows they have a chance, so long as they perform and
work hard,'' said midfielder John Harkes, one of Sampson's notable
and second-guessed omissions from the '98 roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the past, but everyone knows Bruce
brings out the best in players ... a plus when there's a coach
wanting to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great feeling, because we're all on the same page,'' said
Cobi Jones, the Galaxy playmaker returning to familiar confines
this week. ``You can feel the best of U.S. Soccer is coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the U.S. team is gaining the confidence found in past
Arena squads. Eventually, look for it to become an aura of
invincibility _ a fine line just short of pomposity. Setting high
standards and refusing to compromise upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all that's said about Bruce, he has great rapport with his
players,'' said Dallas' David Dir, recognized by many as MLS' most
outspoken coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I've never heard a player who's been with
him who hasn't respected him. There's a lot of pressure on these
guys, and his presence does a great job taking some of that
pressure of the team. And his teams are always ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't care what others might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that are around me know me and that's the only thing I
feel that's important,'' said Arena in addressing his image. ``It's
important that the coaches and players I work with are treated
fairly and that we have respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Followers say Arena's philosophy has tempered somewhat over the
years. Part of it comes from enduring life's challenges. Eleven
years ago, Arena lost his twin sister Barbara to breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helped me in terms of keeping perspective,'' he said.
``It told me that your time is numbered and that you always need to
do the right thing. I just try to make sure I am always doing the
right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, inflammatory incidents occur, such as the indelible
locker- room image last year when the former United coach was
heavily toking on a victory cigar after a victory over the Galaxy
in MLS Cup '99.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid, for one, expressed views to a reporter
that Arena's actions were ``inappropriate'' considering he was now
the national team coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If L.A. would have won, I'd be smoking a cigar in their locker
room,'' said Arena without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't diminish the fact (United's) a team I was part of for
a number of years and was very friendly with, but I would have
celebrated and congratulated L.A. had they won.''
</P>
<P>
   If the current trend and past successes are any indication,
Arena might very well be lighting a few more victory cigars in the
future, possibly in the nations of Japan and South Korea sites for
the 2002 World Cup.

JACKSON LIKES JORDAN'S POSSIBLE RETURN AS EXEC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Even in a suit and tie, Michael Jordan's return
to the NBA will be good for the game, and for Jordan. So says his
former coach.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson spoke with Jordan on Monday in Los
Angeles just days before it became public that the former Bulls
star was negotiating to join the Washington Wizards. Jordan is
expected to become the top executive for basketball operations and
a part-owner. The deal follows his failed attempt to purchase an
interest in the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really encouraged him last year in the Charlotte
situation,'' Jackson said. ``I think Michael's competitiveness,
what he likes to do, his love of basketball, the association
between the NBA and Michael Jordan _ all those things, I think,
would be great for him....
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to enjoy it, and it's going to be tough,
and it's going to be intriguing, and it's going to be something
that grabs a hold of him because he's so competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also provide a much-needed boost to a sorry franchise.
The Wizards have a bloated payroll, underachieving talent and no
track record to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been associated with so many things that have been
successful, that it's hard not to feel like he's going to be part
of something that's successful there,'' Jackson said. ``I'm sure
for the players it's a good feeling....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take him time. He'll make some mistakes, like
any other business, and learn from it and he'll do well. He's got
an eye for the kind of thing he wants to have done. He's had good
coaching from... Dean Smith (at North Carolina) and a good
organization with the Bulls. I think he'll have a good
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Masked man: Robert Horry wore a transparent mask to protect his
broken nose and admitted he's not yet used to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be odd (wearing it), but I think after a while,
I'll start playing and I'll forget about it hopefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horry isn't sure how long he'll have to wear the awkward-looking
mask, but he's not worried about his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I'm married. I don't need to look good,'' he said. ``I'm
just mad that I can't paint it and do like the Road Warriors used
to do on WWF.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep thinker: Jackson is known for educating his players by
giving them books, and his first gift to O'Neal is something by
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Which book?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling,'' O'Neal said. And when did he get it?
``Can't tell you. Can't tell you how me and Phil operate.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal promised to share his impressions once he's done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to read it first, so I can get the quotes ready,'' he
said. ``I want to read the book, memorize it, analyze it,
dissecticize it and then come back.''

VETERAN MARINO LACKS CRAFTINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dan Marino is at the stage of his career where you
wish football pants came with pleats, or at least a skosh more room
in the hip and thigh. Age and stretch fabrics are not kind to
Marino's 38-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of middle-age spread, and the braces and bandages
that bind his tortured knees and ankles, disfigure what was a
classic quarterback's silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, his right arm seems to have gone to flab, apparently an
effect of the neck injury that cost him five games last fall. The
man who has thrown for nearly 10,000 yards more than anybody else
in NFL history is only the 31st-rated passer in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   These days, as the game's most awesome tools rust away, he must
rely on savvy to help the Miami Dolphins win games. The trouble is,
that's not Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen Marino referred to as the ``sentimental favorite'' in
these NFL playoffs, because he's the greatest player of his era
never to win a Super Bowl and because he has hinted at an imminent
retirement. Today's AFC divisional playoff against the Jaguars in
Jacksonville could be his last game if the Dolphins lose.
</P>
<P>
   We are supposed to see him in the image of creaky, crafty
quarterbacks from Norm Van Brocklin to John Elway, pitching their
teams to victory without their best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Marino, though, has never played that role or inspired that kind
of sentiment. It's the price he pays for being a little too
talented to love, too loudly demanding of his fumble-fingered
receivers, too stubborn in the application of his enormous ability.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, a Dolphins fan as well as a Boston Red Sox
fan, calls Marino the Ted Williams of football. Williams refused to
hit to the opposite field, preferring to try to blast baseballs
over or through shifted infields. Marino, too, doesn't set out to
do the little things that separate the gifted athlete from the
masterful, believing he should always be able to connect with even
a double-teamed receiver.
</P>
<P>
   That refusal to acknowledge his limitations might be a reason
for Marino's enormous numbers. His regular-season pass completions
have totaled 11 miles.
</P>
<P>
   That self-confidence might also explain the seemingly
inexplicable _ 17 seasons, 10 playoff appearances, eight Pro Bowls,
but only one Super Bowl and no Super Bowl rings. Ted Williams never
won a World Series either.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs, crime and attitude aren't the only ways to squander great
athletic talent. Another is to rely on it so much that you're
imprisoned by it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Marino doesn't care about winning, or cares more
about personal statistics than about the scoreboard. It's just when
it comes to figuring out ways to win, he can't see beyond the tips
of his passing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, he had the arm to pull it off, to approach his
own perfectionist standards and to make the Dolphins contenders all
by himself. Now he has trouble hitting the broad side of Dan
Marino, and without craft to fall back on, his plunge has been
precipitous.
</P>
<P>
   The years since run-oriented coach Jimmy Johnson joined the
Dolphins in 1996 have brought a clash of giant personalities. Last
week, before they faced the Seattle Seahawks in the wild-card
playoff round, the two men put their heads together and simplified
the offense, conserving Marino's arm for the pivotal final drive.

   It worked and the Dolphins scored an upset 20-17 victory.

   It makes you wonder if Marino would have a ring by now if
Johnson had come along before the quarterback was set in his ways.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-SECURITY (Moscow) _ Underscoring its darkening view of
the West, the Kremlin issued a new national security strategy that
inveighs against an expansionist Europe and United States and
contemplates the use of nuclear weapons in war ``if all other means
of resolving the crisis have been exhausted.'' The revised language
governing nuclear weapons is a subtle but unmistakable change from
the previous strategy that allowed the use of nuclear arms only
``in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation.''
By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-SPACE (Seoul, South Korea) _ Having succeeded in making
computer memory chips, consumer electronics and automobiles, South
Korea has set its sights on a far loftier goal: conquering outer
space. The government plans to develop a rocket capable of ferrying
satellites into orbit within the next five years. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   CHILD-SOLDIERS (Geneva) _ The United States, which wants to keep
the option of sending soldiers into combat at 17, found itself with
few allies in negotiations this week on an international agreement
to set a new minimum age for recruitment and active military
service. By Elizabeth Olson.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-SPAIN (Madrid) _ A Spanish magistrate will ask Britain
to conduct a new medical exam on Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator, with Spanish doctors taking part, according to a
lawyer for victims of the Pinochet regime. By Al Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Nozhai-Yurt, Russia) _ To be sure, many
officers and soldiers in the Russian army are still atheists, and
the attitude of many of them toward chaplains appears to be neutral
at best. But the ties between the military and church have
strengthened in recent years. More than 100 churches and chapels
have been established on Russian military bases, according to The
Moscow Times. And Russian draftees can request service in a unit
that has a priest, though it is not always honored. By Michael R.
Gordon. (With map and photo.)
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-BORDER (Kursumlija, Yugoslavia) _ The Serbian chief
of police here looks weary. For him the war in Kosovo is not only
not over, but it has come closer. He says Albanians from Kosovo are
crossing the border into his district in the adjacent part of
Serbia and attacking villagers and the police. By Carlotta Gall.

   NYC-DEATHRATE (New York) _ For some reason, people in New York
City died at a remarkably higher rate during the first week of this
year compared to the same period in 1999: Perhaps the suspense of
seeing of computers malfunction proved just too alluring given the
alternative of a funeral. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINA-PRIMARIES (Atlanta) _ Alerted to the closing of polling
places in black neighborhoods during South Carolina's last
Republican presidential primary, the Justice Department has begun
asking pointed questions about both parties' coming primaries,
political officials around the state said Friday. The inquiry
raises the possibility that the primaries could be challenged by
the government under the Voting Rights Act. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   RAPE-PSYCHOLOGY (Undated) _ Rape is primarily a crime of
violence and power, not sex. Or so a generation of social
scientists and feminist scholars have argued. But in a forthcoming
book, two evolutionary scientists say this view is born of
ideology, not science, and is ``based on empirically erroneous,
even mythological, ideas about human development, behavior and
psychology.'' By Erica Goode.

<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-IMAGE (DES MOINES, Iowa) _ In the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley has
tried to cast himself as his party's gruff truth-teller. But he can
be curt and uncommunicative, and former colleagues have said he is
aloof. To his supporters, traits like these are part and parcel of
what make Bradley a different kind of politician. But to the
undecided voters who are vital to his success, Bradley runs the
risk of being viewed as simply surly. By James Dao. (With photos)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-IMAGE (Washington) _ Despite three debates this month and
dozens of campaign speeches, Gov. George W. Bush remains something
of a muddle: authoritative and insightful one day, hazy or scripted
or platitudinous the next. He has performed well enough not to
diminish the strong likelihood that he will cinch the Republican
presidential nomination. But he has left unanswered the question of
just how potent an adversary he would be for the Democratic
nominee. By Frank Bruni.

   REPUBS-HISPANICS (San Jose, Calif.) _ The Republican party is
making a big push for Hispanic votes. By Don Van Natta.

   SCOTUS-ABORTION (Washington) _ Adding an abortion case to its
docket for the first time in eight years, the Supreme Court agreed
Friday to decide whether a Nebraska law banning a procedure the
state calls ``partial birth abortion'' is constitutional. By Linda
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-FUNDS (Washington) _ Hospitals in New York and seven
other states will be spared cuts in Medicare payments under a
decision announced Friday by the secretary of Health and Human
Services, Donna E. Shalala. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   AIR-SAFETY (Washington) _ President Clinton announced a program
on Friday to encourage airline pilots to report their own rule
violations, in exchange for immunity from punishment, to make it
easier for the government, the airlines and the pilot unions to
detect trends that could hurt safety. By Matthew L. Wald. (With

</P>
<P>
   DP-CAMPS (Washington) _ The story of the DPs, as they were
called, is one that is little remembered today, but it is a
remarkable chapter of the Holocaust era and is the subject of a
three-day conference that began here on Friday night: ``Life
Reborn: Jewish Displaced Persons 1945-1951.'' By Joseph Berger.

   &UR; BUSINESS DAY _ (Moved in ``f'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS-FAST-TRADES (New York) _ Investing in the stock market
for the long term, the strategy that has made the most sense and
the most money for people over the years, is all but dead. And new
numbers show the betting has become faster and more furious there
than at any time since the 1920s. The rapid-fire trading mentality
of a very small group of hyperactive investors has altered the
behavior of large numbers of investors. The consequences are large,
since studies show that investors who trade frequently get lower
returns, and heavy trading contributes to wide swings in the
market. By Gretchen Morgenson. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   GLAXO-SMITHKLINE (London) _ Two British pharmaceutical giants,
SmithKline Beechham PLC and Glaxo Wellcome PLC, are near agreement
on a $80.7 billion merger that would create the world's largest
drug maker, executives close to the talks said here Friday night.
By Andrew Ross Sorkin.

   WALMART-APPOINT (Undated) _ David Glass, who aggressively
expanded Wal-Mart Stores Inc. from a rural discounter into a
worldwide powerhouse during his 12-year tenure as chief executive
and president, announced Friday that he would step down
immediately. As expected, he will be succeeded by his long-trusted
lieutenant and chief operating officer, H. Lee Scott. By Leslie
Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-TOURISM (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ Determined to
dispel the myths that surround it, South Africa has turned to
Madison Avenue. This month, the country makes its first major foray
into the world of international marketing with an $18 million
promotional campaign. Its emphasis is on enjoying South Africa's
exotic outdoor attractions and urbanity rather than experiencing
the opening of a door to a new multiracial democracy. By Henri E.
Cauvin. (With graphic.)

Marathon forecast: Warm, humid, slow
<TEXT>
<P>
   Runners bracing for balmy conditions
</P>
<P>
   By ALAN TRUEX
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Sunday promises to be a pleasant day for viewing the Methodist
Health Care Houston Marathon. But not a pleasant day to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Marathoners do not like balmy weather. They want it cold _ low
40s would be ideal.
</P>
<P>
   And without those chilly conditions, there is little chance of a
record being set in the race that begins at 8 a.m. Sunday in front
of the George R. Brown Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have to be good conditions to have a
record,'' said Nicole Carroll, the No. 2 women's seed for the
26.2-mile event. ``It would have to get a bit cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kaitany set the course record in 1989 with a run that
took 2 hours, 10 minutes, 4 seconds. The women's record, 2:27:51,
was established by Ingrid Kristiansen in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   For a record to be broken, four factors seem essential: a
top-quality field, a fast pace, incentive and chilly weather.
</P>
<P>
   This race seems to have three of the four.
</P>
<P>
   The field looks stronger than last year's. Sammy Maritim, who
finished second to Stephen Ngundu the past two years, is seeded
only seventh this time.
</P>
<P>
   Maritim expects the pace to be faster than it was last year,
when his fellow Kenyan, Ngundu, won with a time of 2:14:56.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of rabbits in the race now,'' Maritim said,
``and that will make it faster. Believe me, this will be a very
fast race. We have the best pace-makers we've ever had. Godfrey
Kiprotich will lead the fast group.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiprotich, who also is from Kenya, never has raced here. He is
unlikely to win, but if he sets a brisk pace, everyone else will
have to run faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will see after the first five kilometers how the race is
going,'' said Ngundu, 32. ``If other runners are aggressive, I will
be aggressive, too. If the pace is hot, you adjust yourself and
push to the front. I want to be at the front. You can't let
yourself get too far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of incentive for a record pace. A bonus of
$50,000 will go to any man or woman who breaks the record in his or
her division. That money will be awarded in addition to the
first-place prize of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact this is an Olympic year brings additional
incentive. Many runners need a fast time to win an invitation to
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   But still, there is the problem with the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather is cold and we can make a fast pace,'' Ngundu
said at a news conference Friday, ``there could be a record.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he could run a 2:10 on a warm day, he
grinned and said, ``It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't say it's likely.
</P>
<P>
   Said Carroll, who is from Brisbane, Australia: ``From where I
come from, this is a bit of a cold snap. Brisbane is very humid.''
</P>
<P>
   She never has run in Houston and wasn't planning to be here to
challenge Ukraine's Tatiana Pozdnyakova, winner of last year's
women's open and No. 1 seed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll intended to run in Osaka on Jan. 31, but a red-tape
snafu kept her from entering that race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is the biggest marathon around right now,'' she said,
``so that's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritim is fond of this course and sees a trend in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year (1998) I was behind by one minute,'' he said.
``The second time I was behind four seconds. This time I don't
know. I changed my schedule of training, and I think it will
help.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks he has overtrained in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I'll try to be smart, and I will be well-rested,''
he said. ``I feel better now than I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But how about the weather?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the weather is a bit warmer than last year,'' he
said. ``I'd rather it be cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Could he set a record?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the weather.''

Casserly emerges as favorite
<TEXT>
<P>
   Operations job his to lose, sources say
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   After another day of meetings with owner Bob McNair, Charley
Casserly has emerged as the clear favorite to become the first vice
president of football operations for Houston's NFL expansion that
begins play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources close to McNair called Casserly the leading
candidate Friday, and one went so far as to say the job is
Casserly's to lose, ``and don't expect Charley to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair made it clear Friday that he continues to be impressed
with Casserly, but he declined to call him the favorite or the
leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley's just farther along than anyone else,'' McNair said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   When Casserly returned to Houston on Thursday for a second
series of interviews with McNair and executive vice president Steve
Patterson, he brought his wife, Beverley, and daughter, Shannon,
another indication of how serious McNair is about hiring Casserly.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to McNair said the Casserly family is checking
out neighborhoods and schools before they leave Sunday. McNair
wants to have the position filled before he leaves for the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still hoping to have this wrapped up in the next two
weeks, but it's an important and complicated process,'' McNair
said. ``This job has a lot of requirements. There's a lot involved
in putting a team together. You've got to remember that we're
building from the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the league meeting in New York next week
(Tuesday), and I'm going to visit with some people (owners) up
there about some other possible candidates we may interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Casserly, the former Washington general manager who spent his
entire 23-year NFL career with the Redskins, and Joe Mack, who
helped get the Carolina and Cleveland expansion franchises off the
ground, are the only candidates to be interviewed so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and I are on the same page about so many things,''
Casserly said. ``Everyone knows Houston's going to be a premier
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of the many things that impress me about Bob is his
commitment to do things the right way and how much he wants to win.
He wants to do whatever it takes to have the best football program
around. And he's never wavered from that commitment. How could you
not be interested in a job like that?''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of NFL executives are interested in the job, including Tom
Donahoe, who resigned as Pittsburgh's director of football
operations Friday after losing a power struggle with coach Bill
Cowher.
</P>
<P>
   McNair called Steelers owner Dan Rooney on Thursday to ask for
permission to interview Donahoe. McNair had no idea Donahoe was
going to resign.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday afternoon, McNair still had not heard from
Rooney, but getting permission is no longer necessary. Donahoe, who
had eight years left on a 10-year contract, is free to negotiate
with any team.
</P>
<P>
   Like Casserly, Donahoe is one of the most respected personnel
men in the league. Although Donahoe wasn't available for comment
Friday, he has told friends he would be interested in the Houston
job.
</P>
<P>
   Before Casserly returned to Houston this week, others on
McNair's list were Donahoe, Seattle senior vice president Mike
Reinfeldt, Seattle vice president of football operations Randy
Mueller and Tampa Bay director of player personnel Jerry Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   But Casserly has continued to impress McNair with his enthusiasm
for the job. They will have more meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to know Charley better and better,'' said
McNair, who stopped short of saying he would interview more
candidates. ``I like him a lot. I really do. Our philosophies are
similar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley's done it at every level of an organization. And he's
been successful at every level. He's asking a lot of questions, and
so am I. We're talking about things like budget, personnel,
scouting and ranges in salary for the various positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said, we may have a small window of opportunity to
make a decision, and I'd hate to lose someone good, someone I
really like, because that window closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams are interested in Casserly. It is no secret New
Orleans owner Tom Benson wants to talk with Casserly about running
the Saints. Casserly admits that two other teams have shown
interest in him but refuses to disclose them.
</P>
<P>
   League sources say one is the New York Jets. Casserly has a
close relationship with Bill Parcells.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parkas, earmuffs, gloves and itchy wool scarves
finally came out of the back of the closet Friday, as New Yorkers
accustomed to this winter's balmy weather were served up an
Arctic-inspired reminder that a) the city is not in a tropic zone
and b) it is the middle of January.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions Friday _ with the temperature dropping to 13
degrees in Central Park and the wind gusting to 37 miles per hour _
were far from records for New York. But after three months of
temperatures that were warmer than any recorded along the
Northeast, the sudden and intense cold was more than enough to
cause a collective shiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is brutal,'' said Antonio Pedoto of the Bronx, who had the
unfortunate assignment of serving a nine-hour shift Friday as a
flag man at a construction site in Midtown Manhattan. ``I can't
stand still.''
</P>
<P>
   Commuters offered similar assessments, as they scurried from
buses, subways and cabs to building lobbies, coffee shops or other
places of refuge. ``My face aches,'' said Camille Parson, a ballet
dancer, as she walked along 23rd Street Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the sudden plunge in temperatures was a mass of
Arctic air that moved through central and eastern Canada in recent
days, pulled by the modest snow storm that passed through the city
on Thursday, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania
State University. The wind and cold together meant a wind chill
factor of about 15 degrees below zero during the morning rush
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures should begin to rise again by early Saturday,
Gadomski said, reaching perhaps as high as 40 degrees by Sunday.
But by early next week, the colder air will return, and another
storm system already streaking east from the northern Mississippi
Valley toward New York threatens to leave the region with the
season's first measurable snowfall, Gadomski said. The outlook for
the coming weeks, he said, is likely to involve more drastic ups
and downs in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's freeze _ the temperature never rose above 22
degrees _ the Rockefeller Center outdoor ice-skating rink was
nearly empty early Friday, and the normal crush of tourists lining
up outside the Times Square television studios, like MTV's, all but
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The cold front produced a small surge in homeless people's
turning to city shelters, said Olga Beck, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Homeless Services. A total of 6,860 single adults
stayed in the city's 44 single-adult shelters on Thursday night, up
about 100 from the normal count, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Peter's Place, a drop-in center for homeless men and women in
the basement of a church on West 23rd Street, about 70 people
gathered late Friday afternoon, playing dominos, dozing in their
chairs, leafing through newspapers or watching ``The People's
Court'' on a large-screen television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative to this would be either I go to jail or I die
out there,'' said Augustus Griffin, 65, who, like many of the other
guests, kept his hat and coat on even while inside the daytime
shelter. ``I can't survive in that cold.''  &QL;

U.S. IRAN SOCCER MATCH MATTER OF PRIDE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- The United States vs. Iran soccer match
Sunday at the Rose Bowl represents a thaw in the two nation's icy
relations, but to local Iranians it's a hot ticket, a chance to
express ethnic pride and focus attention on repression in their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, many of whom fled
their country after the 1979 Islamic revolution, said they plan to
root for the Iranian national team -- but may sit while the anthem
of the current regime is played.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those rare times that Iranians here can speak
out about human rights in Iran,'' said Bijan Khalili, director of
Van Nuys-based Ketab Corp., which publishes a weekly Iranian
newspaper and the Iranian Yellow Pages. ``They're going to sing the
real Iranian national anthem. They're going to bring the real
Iranian flag, which Iranians used for 3,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County is home to one of the largest populations of
Iranians outside Iran, with estimates up to 500,000, including an
estimated 100,000 to 150,000 in the San Fernando Valley, according
to Iranian organizations and community members. The highest
concentrations are in Tarzana, Encino and Reseda, as well as Los
Angeles' affluent Westside communities, particularly Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 people are expected at Sunday's game, including a
large Iranian-American contingent. A substantial Armenian presence
is also expected to watch the under-23 American team play the full
Armenian national team following the main event.
</P>
<P>
   Most Iranians here have never had a chance to see their national
team in person, so the game represents a once-, or at least first-,
in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch their heroes in action.
</P>
<P>
   It also presents larger opportunities, such as the chance to
dispel stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 20 years, we've been called and branded all kinds of
names, including terrorist,'' said Behrooz Afrakhan, a journalist
in Tarzana who will cover the game for Iranian-language television.
</P>
<P>
   ``With soccer, which is an international means of communication,
we are trying to not only express our passion for it and support
our players, but say to the world, Look at us, we are civilized, we
have a great history and we are law abiding.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen Naderi-Nejad, who produces an Iranian talk show out of a
house in Northridge, plans to distribute about 55,000 paper flags
with the pre-revolution Iranian banner on one side and the Stars
and Stripes on the other. He plans to hand them out in the Iranian
community before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The flags, he said, represent a symbol of friendship between the
two peoples, if not their governments. The money to print them,
about $5,000 to $6,000, came from donations by the local Iranian
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell the American people we appreciate your
hospitality,'' Naderi-Nejad said. ``We came to this country and you
gave us a lot of opportunity, especially to our kids. We are
friends, we are not enemies. We are separate from the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition match occurs as the icy relations between the two
nations have begun to very slowly thaw. The United States severed
diplomatic ties with Iran after militants took hostages at the U.S.
Embassy in Teheran in 1979. But Reformist President Mohammad
Khatami, elected in 1997, has called for a ``crack in the wall of
mistrust'' between the two nations and encouraged cultural
exchanges at a nongovernmental level.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the U.S. played Iran in the World Cup in France, a
match universally praised for its good sportsmanship. Later that
year, the two countries hosted each other's wrestling teams. Some
observers, and team members, hope such athletic events will achieve
the same results as did the ``pingpong diplomacy'' between the
United States and China in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope by coming here ... it will help in some way to bring
the two governments to one table, face to face, to talk to each
other and solve their differences,'' said Jalal Talebi, the
director of Iran's national soccer teams and its former World Cup
coach. ``It would give each other a chance to respect each other's
rights, religion and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's exhibition match grew out of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of focus on the politics and the perceived
tensions (before the game), but it turned out to be one of the
great events of France '98,'' said Jim Moorhouse, communications
director for the Chicago- based U.S. Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA, the ruling body of international soccer, even presented
both teams with its Fair Play Award. The U.S. Soccer Federation
then decided to propose a friendly game in this country to continue
the spirit and rivalry -- and to try for some sporting revenge for
being knocked out of the World Cup by the 2-1 loss to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soccer Federation officials said security will be tight at
the game, just as it is for any other large soccer game at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And those who wish to make political statements or
demonstrations can do so in a large grassy area set aside near the
main entrance of the stadium, a standard practice for soccer games,
said Emilio Pozzi, managing director of U.S. events for the
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards will not censor any signs or displays brought
into the stadium, as long as they conform to size and safety
requirements. Generally, flags must be no larger than 2 feet by 3
feet, and sticks, poles and umbrellas are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they don't impede traffic flow or disturb another
patron that has bought a ticket, they can display anything they
want,'' Pozzi said.

LA SCHOOL BOND PANEL WANTS $40 MILLION REFUND
</HEADLINE>
 -LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Greg Gittrich  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- Los Angeles Unified administrators sunk
as much as $40 million of local Proposition BB bond money into a
failed school construction project on contaminated land in South
Gate, bond oversight officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And the bond oversight committee wants the money back.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, chairman of the citizens oversight committee,
said the panel signed off on the use of the local bond money after
assurances from district administrators that 40 acres of industrial
property in South Gate could be cleaned up. Those assertions were
obviously incorrect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us all kinds of documentation to us to show that the
school supposedly could be built,'' said Soboroff, a mayoral
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not going to use the money, if the school cannot
be built, we want the money back,'' he said. ``The taxpayers want
their money back.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, most of the money -- at least $25 million -- has
already been spent.
</P>
<P>
   The district could recoup some of the money by selling the land
contaminated by industrial pollution, but school officials said
it's unclear if it can get back the entire investment.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD Chief Operating Officer Howard Miller said he is anxious
to see documentation of the exact promises the district made to the
bond oversight committee when use of the money was approved two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was well before the current management was in place,''
Miller said. ``This site never was environmentally clean and could
not have been made to be so.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's former administration used the bond money to
purchase dozens of tainted parcels adjacent to the Los Angeles
River. State bond money also may have been used to buy some of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barry Groveman, co-chairman of the district's
special safety team, the district began condemning property in the
area in the early 1990s. Other acquisitions are still pending and
the district would likely face litigation if they backed out of the
deals.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Groveman, who is running for district attorney,
revealed that the vast majority of the property was purchased
without adequate environmental assessments, despite claims to the
contrary by district administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he reported that LAUSD real estate and construction
officials never obtained reliable estimates on how much it would
cost to clean up the land.
</P>
<P>
   The findings came on the heels of the Belmont Learning Center
scandal and contributed to the school board's decision to oust
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted on Tuesday to abandon the construction of the
South Gate campus, which was to include a high school and
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the land will likely be sold, but noted the district
is required by state law to clean up the property.
</P>
<P>
   The Proposition BB oversight committee is scheduled to discuss
the use of the bond money for South Gate at its meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight committee was established in early 1997 as part of
the $2.4 billion bond's guidelines to win support for the measure.
Concern over how the money would be spent had prompted voters to
reject a similar bond measure in 1996.

CITY MOING TOWARD UNIONS FOR LAX WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Beth Barrett  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- With billions of dollars in Los
Angeles International Airport work on the horizon, city officials
are in the process of changing the rules to force virtually all
construction workers to be hired through union halls and work under
union rules.
</P>
<P>
   The first-ever ``project labor agreement'' for LAX has
tentatively been approved for the upcoming $120 million remodel of
the Tom Bradley International Terminal after it was negotiated by
local unions and a private firm, said Carl Uehlein, the Washington,
D.C., lawyer brokering the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles World Airports, for legal reasons, would become the
``beneficiary'' of the arrangement if airport commissioners and the
City Council concur and city officials claim it will ensure a more
skilled work force and labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   But others claim that insisting on union contractors when an
estimated 70percent to 80percent of the local construction work
force is nonunion is unjustified and that the agreement will
increase the cost of the LAX project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grab by the unions,'' said Joe Battaglia, executive
director of the Associated Builders and Contractors Los
Angeles/Ventura Chapter, which represents nonunion contractors.
``They're forcing individuals who choose not to be in the union to
be in a union just to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scare tactics. They put a gun to your head, `Do this or
we'll strike.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Interim airports Executive Director Lydia Kennard said the
agreement that is expected to go to the airport commission next
month is a tested method and would guarantee LAX gets well-trained,
quality workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes good business sense for us as an airport, and we're
enthusiastic about it moving forward,'' Kennard said. ``This is a
concept that's been duplicated across the nation at other major
airports.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission member Miguel Contreras, executive
secretary/treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,
said through a spokesman that he is withholding comment pending
formal consideration of the matter. Other commissioners did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   The airport commission and a labor-friendly council have worked
to give labor more control over LAX contractors and even
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Assistant City Attorney Bret Lobner said the commission
started to explore umbrella pre-hiring rules more than a year ago
for the more than $10billion expansion, one of California's largest
public works projects ever. The Bradley terminal is not part of
that expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lobner said the terminal labor agreement would prevent labor
strife and provide top-notch employees in a nondiscriminatory
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot strike or stop work or they'd face penalties of
$10,000 per day,'' Lobner said.
</P>
<P>
   The courts generally have upheld similar agreements as legal,
with the California Supreme Court last summer ruling they do not
violate state competitive bidding laws.
</P>
<P>
   But critics question why public officials would enter into an
agreement that could increase costs.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association, said his organization has studied project labor
agreements and found they are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is a substantial increase in cost for public
projects,'' Coupal said. ``We'd hoped the trend toward project
labor agreements would terminate. I suppose if you give in to
terrorism and extortion you save yourself some grief, but we don't
think that's in the public's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin P. Kropke, business manager/financial secretary for IBEW
Local Union 11, said the agreement will benefit unions and the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will provide an incentive for people to be part of the
industry,'' Kropke said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that since union and nonunion shops alike must pay
prevailing wages, there should be no difference in cost to public
entities unless nonunion shops fail to pay those wages. Nonunion
contractors contend they can do jobs for less because they don't
have to comply with layers of union rules.
</P>
<P>
   The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and other
trade organizations, Kropke said, commit themselves to successful
apprenticeships and long-term training of their members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (nonunion contractors) want to come into town, do a job
and leave,'' he said. ``People who stay in the business have no
problem working in this environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would allow nonunion contractors to compete, but
all nonsupervisory nonunion workers would have to go through union
halls.
</P>
<P>
   They would have to pay what amounts to union dues and meet other
union requirements. They would get prevailing wages and union
representation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was negotiated between the unions and Parsons
Constructors Inc. of Pasadena to shield the airport from possible
challenges under the National Labor Relations Act, which has been
used to argue that public agencies cannot enter into the pre-hiring
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons officials did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the unions and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg were
poised to ask the council to consider reversing airport commission
approval of an LAX general contractor's use of a nonunion
subcontractor, Helix Electric of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   They were backed by the Democratic National Convention
Committee, which sent a protest letter to Mayor Richard Riordan.
But the group backed down after learning a larger Helix Electric
contract already had been approved by the commission and had not
been challenged by the council.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, there had been a flurry of meetings, including one
attended by Riordan and union representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cerrell, whose consulting firm represented the IBEW and the
National Electrical Contractors Association, characterized the
meeting with the mayor and his staff as productive and his clients
as ``very satisfied'' with the overall result. Deputy Mayor Noelia
Rodriguez declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said she had the votes to reconsider the Helix bid even
though it represented a $500,000 saving over the next bidder. She
said she was worried the Helix contract would have inflated on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have concerns, but when the contractor, mayor and
unions all asked me to withdraw it, I did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Geller, Helix Electric's spokesman, said the firm met
with IBEW officials, and was urged to support project labor
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our policy,'' Geller said. ``We don't support the
concept. We're committed to an open shop.''
</P>
<P>
   General contractor Swinerton &AMP; Walberg Co. Vice President
Forrest Redman said the company was playing by the ``rule book''
when it hired Helix.
</P>
<P>
   Geller said the firm is committed to finishing its two contracts
totaling about $9 million as part of LAX's face lift in
anticipation of the Democratic Convention but won't work under a
project labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a taxpayer, I'd be outraged by this,'' he said.

By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They were streaks that had to end sooner or
later. But the way the Mighty Ducks and St. Louis Blues were
playing it seemed like it would be later, rather than sooner, that
Anahein would snap its seven-game winless streak against the league
and its six-game winless streak versus St. Louis at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues came into Friday night's game with the best record in
the league, while the Ducks were quickly sinking in the Western
Conference standings. But Anaheim, inspired by the spirited play of
its role players, especially Mike Leclerc, defeated St. Louis 3-1
before 14,906.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, 1-7-1 in their previous nine games, moved back into a
tie with Calgary and Edmonton for eighth in the conference with the
victory that ended the Blues' undefeated run at seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya scored what would turn out to be the game-winning
goal at 10:15 of the second period on the power play, but it was
the Leclercs, Aaltos, Cullens and Kohns of the Ducks who proved to
be the difference -- along with the goaltending of Guy Hebert, who
stopped 36 of 37 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Leclerc was a force from the opening faceoff, until he fought
Marc Bergevin late in the third period. The Ducks gladly hopped on
the big winger's back and won their first game in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I can't go down and hit anybody, but I like to see it.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked all-star defenseman Al MacInnis out of the game in
the third period with what looked to be a legal check, even though
he was called for boarding on the play. Leclerc's fiesty
forechecking was a big reason why the Blues' other all-star
defenseman, Chris Pronger, spent 10 minutes in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   He was crucial to the Ducks' offensive. His perfect goal-mouth
pass to Marty McInnis, made possible by Aalto's strong forecheck,
gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead at 4:41 of the second period. Leclerc
then assisted on Kariya's goal at 10:15 of the second to give
Anaheim a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Turgeon pulled St. Louis within 2-1 at 14:52 of the
second period, but then the combination of Cullen and Ladislav Kohn
made like Kariya and Teemu Selanne to restore Anaheim's two-goal
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   After Pascal Trepanier held the puck in at the St. Louis blue
line, Cullen made a nifty between-the-legs drop pass to Kohn who
ripped a shot into the top, right corner of the Blues net at 2:08.
</P>
<P>
   .. Minnesota high school, He's a good shooter, most people don't
realize that. It looked good. The Ducks moved the puck well and had
several scoring chances, the best of which were Paul Kariya's blast
off a feed from Selanne and Leclerc's deflection of a shot by
Fredrik Olausson. But once again Anaheim was unable to get any
tangible results. St. Louis backup goalie Jamie McLennan somehow
got in front of Kariya's shot through traffic and he just swatted
away Leclerc's with his stick after the puck had trickled behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues' third-ranked power play also had two opportunities,
but Ducks' suspect penalty killing unit, ranked 24th in the NHL,
never really let St. Louis get set up.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't nearly so easy in the second period when Stu Grimson
was called for cross-checking shortly after the Ducks had taken the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert had to brilliant and was in a two-minute stretch that saw
him turn aside bids by Scott Young, Pavol Demitra, Chris Pronger
and Bob Bassen.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's power play continued to pressure when it was given a
chance, but took a hooking call on by Pronger to give it the
opening it needed. With a two-man advantage for 53 seconds, the
Ducks converted at 10:15 when Leclerc held the puck in and got it
to Selanne. Anaheim's slumping winger drove hard to the net and
picked up his first assist in 10 games when he setup a tap-in for
Kariya.

MOB BURIAL SPOT YIELDS BODIES OF TWO MEN, WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Digging through the night shielded from biting cold,
authorities early Friday unearthed the remains of two men and a
woman after being tipped off to the burial spot by a top lieutenant
to fugitive South Boston crime boss James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities have yet to identify the victims believed to
have been killed by Bulger and his longtime cohort, Stephen Flemmi,
sources said Bulger confidant Kevin Weeks claims Arthur ``Bucky''
Barrett, John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey, Flemmi's stepdaughter,
were buried in the eight-foot deep grave in the city's Dorchester
section.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi have long been suspects in the murders of
Barrett, one of six men charged with the $1.5 million Depositors
Trust bank heist in suburban Medford in 1980, and McIntyre, who was
suspected of cooperating against Bulger in an ill-fated plot to run
guns to the Irish Republican Army. Barrett disappeared in 1983 and
McIntyre vanished the following year.
</P>
<P>
   And Boston police have for years considered Flemmi a suspect in
the 1984 disappearance of Hussey, 26, who was allegedly about to
expose her sexual affair with Flemmi, her mother's longtime
common-law husband.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks, who has been described as Bulger's ``surrogate son,'' has
turned on Bulger in the wake of his own indictment on federal
racketeering charges in November.
</P>
<P>
   His revelations are expected to bring an avalanche of new
charges against Bulger and Flemmi, both longtime FBI informants,
and possibly against their former handler, retired FBI Agent John
J. Connolly Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger and Flemmi were indicted on federal racketeering charges
in January 1995 that ultimately led to the disclosure that they
were informants. That prompted a number of former cohorts to
cooperate against them.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger remains a fugitive, while Flemmi is in jail awaiting
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Connolly was charged in a new federal racketeering
indictment along with Bulger and Flemmi that alleges he protected
them from crimes and warned them about the 1995 indictment so they
could run.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference, US Attorney Donald K. Stern and
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin 2d confirmed that bones
retrieved during a painstaking search were those of two men and a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   But they refused to identify the victims, noting that it will
likely take a couple of months for DNA tests to determine who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have preliminary views of who they might be,'' said Stern,
adding that forensic experts will compare DNA found at the
gravesite with other DNA evidence in an effort to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators quietly notified the families of
McIntyre, Barrett and Hussey about the possibility that their
bodies had been located and began seeking DNA evidence from them to
match with remains found in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's widow, Elaine, declined to comment Friday but said
investigators told her there was a ``possibility'' one of the
recovered bodies was that of her husband. They also told her
forensic tests must be conducted to confirm identities.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre's son and Hussey's mother, Marion, both declined to
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a court ruling last September, US District Judge Mark L. Wolf
concluded there was ``reason to be concerned'' that Connolly had
warned Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was cooperating against them
-- a breach that probably would have marked him for death.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before Barrett disappeared, there were rumors
circulating in the underworld that he was cooperating with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett was among a number of men arrested on April 6, 1983 when
FBI and DEA agents raided a South Boston warehouse loaded with
marijuana. The FBI had apparently received a tip about the
warehouse from Bulger, who was miffed that Charlestown gangster
Joseph Murray was storing drugs in his hometown without his
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Hussey and Flemmi were not married, but they raised her
children from an earlier marriage together in Flemmi's house, a
typical suburban home in Milton, just outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi often referred to Deborah Hussey and her siblings as his
children and was introduced to their friends as their father,
according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Hussey reportedly had problems with drug abuse and had a
criminal record, including an arrest for auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Dennis J. Kelly, who represents Weeks, declined to
comment Friday on whether Weeks has negotiated a deal with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi's lawyer, Kenneth Fishman, said only, ``Obviously, if and
when there are additional charges that result from this
investigation we will comment on them at that time and deal with
them at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found underneath about seven to eight feet of
soil along a former freight train railroad spur being converted by
the Metropolitan District Commission into bike path connecting
Castle Island in South Boston to Pope John Paul II park on the
Neponset River.
</P>
<P>
   Although the site is at the edge of a well-lighted parking lot
along a busy street, it was heavily wooded during the early 1980s,
according to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts State Police, the US Drug Enforcement
Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Boston Police and
the Suffolk County Medical Examiner's Office focused with
laser-like precision on the area where the first human bones were
discovered early Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The search was conducted like an archeological dig. Enclosed in
yellow and white striped party tents and warmed by portable
heaters, police and medical examiner staffers used spoons, small
tools and sifting screens to carefully extricate even the smallest
pieces of remains from the mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the investigation that led them to the bodies was
likely to bring investigators any closer to catching Bulger, Stern
replied, ``Well, we don't believe he was one of the two (male)
bodies.''

   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa _ When America Online and Time Warner
announced the biggest merger in history last week, it set off a
furious, if predictable, debate that swept through the airwaves,
chat rooms and hyperactive financial markets, which couldn't decide
if it was a brilliant idea or a marriage made in cyberhell.
</P>
<P>
   Is it good for the country, many asked, for a single media
conglomerate that already bestrides the print and cable world to
also control America's most popular entrance ramp to the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Will it further widen the technological gap between rich and
poor?
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean for America's relations with its allies, who
are increasingly uneasy with the nation's dominance of the Net?
</P>
<P>
   And are these matters that Washington should wade into, as it
did in the Microsoft case, or should they be left to the invisible
electronic hand?
</P>
<P>
   All interesting questions _ except out here on the campaign
trail. America may be plunging into a new global economy at warp
speed, but the major presidential candidates would rather talk
about ethanol subsidies than the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans and Democrats alike it's Old Economy 101,
perhaps because times are so good, perhaps because the politics of
the New Economy are far too complex for a slogan, perhaps because
even Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, admits that events are
moving so fast that nobody can truly understand what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't ask about it much because we've filled up all
that empty office space downtown,'' said Midge Leiter, a
47-year-old Democrat who came to a Rotary meeting in Portsmouth,
N.H., on Thursday to hear Gov. George W. Bush. ``Health care is the
big issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the candidates get a bigger earful on managed
care and access to medical insurance than on any other subject. But
it's also remarkable how little is said about the huge range of
potential political issues raised by the explosion of the digital
economy since the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Log on, and you are barraged with arguments about the privacy of
electronic records, the wisdom of keeping the Internet tax free,
the national security implications of super-encrypted messaging
that can protect your credit card data or be exploited by
international terrorists. And then there is the thorny issue of
whether the government should play a role in making sure technology
does not further widen the divide between the wealthy Net-savvy of
the world and the digitally deprived.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the dizzying changes in the electronic economy
that leave the candidates mute. Many of the biggest foreign policy
crises that Washington has faced in the past decade have been
rooted in the turmoil that can roil the global markets, from
Russia's economic implosion to the financial meltdowns that struck
Mexico and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests six weeks ago at the World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle had the chief effect of underscoring to
politicians how potent the issues raised by economic globalization
have become, both in America and abroad. And the politicians'
response has largely been to drive around the whole thing like it
was a bad neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Among the candidates, for example, only Gary Bauer has raised
questions about China's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foreign policy speeches have dealt at length with the
traditional issues of the 1980s and early '90s _ national missile
defense, Iran and Iraq, peacekeeping _ but when he got a question
from a voter in New Hampshire last week about how he would have
handled the near-collapse of a huge hedge fund 16 months ago, he
stumbled, then erroneously said that the Treasury had bailed out
the wealthy investors. (He quickly corrected himself after
questions from two reporters, acknowledging that private investors,
not the taxpayers, had bailed out the fund.)
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore may be more comfortable dealing with
questions about the global economy: after all, he participated in
all the administration's midnight meetings about how much to aid
Russia, whether to rescue the Mexican peso and how to keep the
Asian upheaval from spreading to American shores. But as one top
economic aide says, he is ``scared to death to open his mouth'' on
these issues.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   The administration's all-out push to get China into the WTO has
angered labor unions at the very moment Gore most needs their
support. Trade agreements that fail to require other countries to
enact environmental protections have driven a wedge between Gore
and his favorite constituency. His foray into government regulation
of the export of encryption software put him at odds with Silicon
Valley _ at least until last week, when the administration backed
down and dropped virtually all controls on such exports.
</P>
<P>
   And just the mention of Russia, Gore knows, invites the
Republicans to ask uncomfortable questions about what happened to
America's multibillion-dollar ``investment'' in converting Russia
to capitalism with taxpayer-financed ``enterprise funds,'' which
Gore once proudly hailed. Actually, it's no wonder he'd rather talk
about managed care and saving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's changed in eight years is that globalization is a
reality, and it's a very controversial reality,'' said Mickey
Kantor, President Clinton's former trade representative and
commerce secretary. ``Economic change has run way, way ahead of the
politicians, and they don't know how to get a handle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly the first time.
</P>
<P>
   During the presidential campaign of 1908, when steel and
railroad trusts were a national preoccupation and J.P. Morgan
played the role of Bill Gates, everyone ran on a
don't-mess-with-a-good-economy platform. Then one day William
Jennings Bryan, the Democratic nominee, argued that ``public
ownership is necessary where competition is impossible.'' He
quickly backpedaled, but Wall Street and the business community
decided he was unfit to run the U.S. economy.

<P>
   So it's not too surprising that no one in this year's race dares
to wander far from the siren song of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   They are all free traders, promising to destroy trade barriers
overseas, but mindful of Greenspan's message that surging imports
keep inflation in check. (In congressional races, however, where
workers at a local factory can form a large and angry voting bloc,
trade is often still hotly debated.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, everyone is foursquare in favor of letting
entrepreneurship flourish. But does the AOL-Time Warner deal
encourage innovation and easy access to the Internet for all, or
squash it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too early to judge,'' Bush said carefully when
asked _ for this article _ on Friday. ``It's important for people
in public positions to be mindful of what could happen in access to
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bush nor Gore _ nor the other candidates, for that
matter _ have ventured far into the murky waters of the Microsoft
case, and have taken particular care not to address the question of
whether the company should be broken up, much as Standard Oil was a
century ago, or AT&AMP;T in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is changing too rapidly,'' said Bush, who added,
``I haven't paid that much attention about the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates are probably wise to be cautious. While the
tycoons owned the trusts, lots of steelworkers and secretaries have
Microsoft in their 401(k) plans. Worse, the terrain keeps changing.
A week ago Microsoft was the biggest gorilla on the block. Now,
assuming the AOL-Time deal comes together, there will be two
gorillas battling for content and distribution, meaning the market
may set up a better competitive fight than the courts ever could.
The fact is, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   But it might be refreshing to determine if Democrats and
Republicans had a different approach to ensuring the privacy of
computerized records, an issue the Supreme Court touched on last
week when it barred states from selling data on drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   And it would be interesting to hear competing plans for bridging
the digital divide. Years ago, when utilities stayed neatly within
state and national boundaries, the government made sure that basic
telephone service reached even the more remote and impoverished
outposts. Does a similar plan make sense for the Internet? And who
should pay to wire up villages in India and ghettos in Brazil _
their own governments? American foreign aid? The World Bank?
AOL-Time Warner?
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the candidates wooing Silicon Valley for cash are
steering clear of such discussions. Instead, they talk about
keeping the Internet tax free, at least for a while, even though it
is not entirely clear why a sale that takes place over the Net
should be treated differently than one that takes place over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley's attitude is that they just want government as far
away from the Internet as possible,'' an adviser to Gore said the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next few months at least, it's back to the Farm
Bureau.

 COUNCIL BLUFFS: U.S. economy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it's not too surprising that no one in this year's race dares
to wander far from the siren song of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   They are all free traders, promising to destroy trade barriers
overseas, but mindful of Greenspan's message that surging imports
keep inflation in check. (In congressional races, however, where
workers at a local factory can form a large and angry voting bloc,
trade is often still hotly debated.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, everyone is foursquare in favor of letting
entrepreneurship flourish. But does the AOL-Time Warner deal
encourage innovation and easy access to the Internet for all, or
squash it?

</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CROATIA-REFUGEES (Knin, Croatia) _ Almost five years after
Croatia promised to allow refugees from the Yugoslav wars to return
to their homes here, the authorities still put endless obstacles in
the way of many of those who want to come back. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-POLITICS (Santiago, Chile) _ On paper, the choice that
nearly eight million Chilean voters face on Sunday could not be
starker. Ricardo Lagos, an austere Socialist and the man President
Salvador Allende Gossens had picked as his ambassador to Moscow
before he was overthrown and killed in 1973, is the candidate of
the center-left coalition that has governed for the last decade.
His challenger is Joaquin Lavin, an ebullient conservative who
started his political career in Gen. Augusto Pinochet's planning
ministry. But one of the many surprises of this tightly fought race
has been how Lagos has run to the right and Lavin has run to the
left. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-DRUG-COSTS (United Nations) _ As more international
attention focuses on an AIDS epidemic spreading out of control in a
number of sub-Saharan African countries and India, France is
prodding the United Nations to find ways to make cheaper drugs
available to poor countries, where treatment is beyond the means of
most people who need it. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ECUADOR-DOLLAR (Quito, Ecuador) _ Just a week ago, President
Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador appeared to be finished, the only
uncertainty about his fate being whether he would resign or be
forced from office by a coup. But by announcing that he intends to
replace the local currency with the American dollar, he has
seemingly gained assurance that he will survive to face at least
the next crisis. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-HEALTHCARE (Montreal) _ When Canada's state-run health
system was in its first bloom, in the 1970s, Americans regularly
trooped up here on inspection tours, attracted by Canada's promise
of universal ``free'' health care. Today, however, few Canadians
would recommend their system as a model for export. By James
Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-GOLAN (Katzrin, Golan Heights) _ With the revival of the
Israeli-Syrian peace effort after a nearly four-year stalemate, the
Golan Heights has entered a state of flux. On the surface, the
apparatus of opposition to any Israeli concession of the Golan can
be seen revving its engine, as with a mass rally that the settlers
sponsored in Tel Aviv last Monday. But beneath the surface, a quiet
psychological and practical preparation has begun. By Deborah
Sontag and William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CHECYNYA-GEORGIA (Mozdok, Russia) _ The war in Chechnya has
exacerbated the strains in Russia's relationship with Georgia, a
former Soviet republic. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-U.S. (Washington) _ Despite nuclear tensions and
diplomatic false starts that have dogged U.S. relations with India
in recent years, the Clinton administration plans to court India as
an ally in trying to restart global trade talks that collapsed in
Seattle last month. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TALKING-CARS (Detroit) _ Later this year, hundreds of thousands
of drivers will be able to have conversations with their cars. Tell
the car to get on the Information Superhighway, and it will
download e-mail using relatively slow cellular phone connections. A
computerized ``voice'' will be able to read the e-mail through the
car's stereo speakers, automakers say. It will call out sports
scores on command, not just when a radio station programs them. It
will quote the latest stock prices. By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WARNER (New York) _ The journey to last week's
announcement that America Online would buy Time Warner in history's
largest merger began last fall and included secret meetings in New
York and Boston and a key dinner on Jan. 6 at the home of Steve
Case, the chairman of America Online. But the turning point for the
deal came over the New Year's holiday in solitude of the small
library of the Vermont vacation home of Gerald Levin, the chairman
of Time Warner. By Steve Lohr and Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   HEROIN-STRATEGIES (Seattle) _ Larry W. Campbell, chief coroner
of British Columbia, where deaths from drug overdoses have risen
tenfold in the last decade, to 407 last year, said he came to a
conference in Seattle this week for one reason. ``There are ways to
prevent these people from dying,'' Campbell said, ``and I'd like to
learn more about them.'' By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA-COMMISH (Philadelphia) _ Up from Dublin by way of a
street beat in the South Bronx and a prodigious rise to the No. 2
spot in the police hierarchy of New York City, John Timoney is
obviously in control as he completes his second year as
Philadelphia commissioner. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-CUBAN-EMIGRES (Miami) _ Tune out the racket, and what
emerges from the feud over the political custody fight over the
6-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez is a split among Miami's
700,000 Cuban-Americans over U.S. trade and immigration policies,
as well as fatigue with both the old guard's myths of the
pre-revolutionary Cuba and its plots to rout Castro and go back to
take the island. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-BLACK-VOTERS (Atlanta) _ When the Democratic presidential
candidates finally withdraw from Iowa and New Hampshire, where the
electorate is predominantly white, they will move quickly into
Southern states where black voters often play a decisive role. And
at the moment, at least, Vice President Al Gore seems to enjoy a
commanding advantage with African-American voters. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-NOTEBOOK (Des Moines, Iowa) _ Should Iowa and New
Hampshire be allowed to dominate the early going in the nominating
process?; A Kennedy stirs the political waters; A call for action
on matters of faith; A Virginia Democrat thinks independent; Are
term limits the final answer? By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-DEBATE (Des Moines, Iowa) _ The debate of the Republican
presidential candidates. By Rick Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN-APPEAL (Washington) _ Across his 17 years in Congress,
John McCain has had a rock-solid conservative voting record except
for his defiance of his party leaders on campaign finance overhaul
and anti-tobacco legislation. Yet on the campaign trail, McCain's
passions are more populist than traditionally conservative as he
bashes ``lobbyists in $1,000 suits'' or criticizes Gov. George W.
Bush's tax cut as too skewed toward the rich, saying that he does
not think Bill Gates needs a tax cut. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   FAA-NEWSTYLE-JET (Washington) _ Under a decades-old rule,
charter operators follow one set of guidelines, and corporate jets
follow another. But a new class of owners has suddenly blossomed
that does not fit either category, and that is causing an uproar in
aviation safety circles. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backstage before the recent Republican presidential
debate in South Carolina, John McCain was yukking it up with his
new friend Gary Bauer when George W. Bush finally showed up _ late,
as usual, and with a Texas-sized security detail. In walked a crowd
of Texas Rangers _ the kind with badges, not baseball bats _
talking into their sleeves about the imminent arrival of the
governor while the other candidates rolled their eyes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to his laid-back image, Bush seemed nervous, wound a
little tight, as he has before several of these events. In a snub
that might have been inadvertent, he stepped in front of Bauer to
have a word with McCain _ the only opponent he sees as a peer,
according to one Bush adviser. Orrin Hatch, whose antipathy for his
Senate colleague McCain is well known, was nonetheless greeting
each of the candidates perfectly correctly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, whom Bush in particular ``doesn't have much use
for, and sees as an interloper,'' according to a Bush adviser, was
staring at the ceiling. And finally, with just minutes until air,
Alan Keyes _ whom the others view mostly ``as an entertainment
dimension,'' according to another Republican adviser _ arrived with
his own security detail, and stood alone for the brief moment
before local party officials lined them all up to wait for the show
to begin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The usual, and usually forced, civility between the candidates
breaks down occasionally even in public. But behind the scenes, the
surprise is not that their exchanges are so nasty _ they aren't _
but that their relationships are so complicated and, even in this
heavily scripted, goal-oriented environment, so personal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Hatch, who has fought a number of Senate turf wars with
McCain, jokes about having been on the wrong side of the McCain
temper, it is with unmistakable feeling. After Forbes sat next to
McCain while they were getting their TV makeup put on before a
joint appearance, he complained that he never, ever wanted to be
put in that position again, and apparently hurt McCain's feelings a
little. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a social conservative who has been tough on Bush during
debates, seems almost poignantly open to a real, and not just a
political, friendship with the governor. ``When there were reports
last week that Bush was annoyed that I had asked him a question
four times in a row in the debates,'' he said in an interview,
``his staff made a point to let me know that not only was that not
true, but that Bush really likes me.'' After he needled Bush to
clarify his position on abortion at a recent debate, he then turned
to him off camera and whispered, ``Good answer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, issues and ideology seem as irrelevant to the
candidates in choosing their friends as voters say they are in
choosing a candidate. And in the Democratic race, Bill Bradley and
Al Gore, two Ivy Leaguers who share a passion for policy and agree
on a host of issues, probably won't be brunching in this lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in the Senate, Bradley told at least a couple of
friends that he thought Gore was hypocritical, a phony of the first
order, and in recent debates has done nothing to hide his disdain.
The vice president has gone on referring to Bradley as his friend _
at least until their chat on ``Meet the Press,'' when Gore put out
his hand, offering to shake on a pledge to stop running ads _ and
Bradley stared at it with a look that said, ``Ewww, cooties.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who those around him say rarely mentions Bradley at all,
one way or the other, has again and again called his opponent a
``good, decent man,'' though Bradley does not seem to have been
able to bring himself to return the compliment. ``I agree; I am a
good person,'' he said at one point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Bradley's put it this way: ``They never clicked
politically, stylistically or personally and have nothing in
common. And saying he's a good, decent man is like saying, `Oh,
Bill Bradley has all of his limbs.' I wouldn't return the
compliment, either.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vice president does not seem to be taking it to heart. ``He
really does not get bent out of shape about exchanges like that,''
said his daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff. But for Bradley, it does
seem personal _ in part, friends say, because of his experience as
a tough athletic competitor, and in part because he categorically
refuses to mask his real feelings in any setting. ``He won't hide
his feelings beholding something he thinks is absurd or silly,''
said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, who has been
advising Bradley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, as the campaign has gone on, McCain's attitude toward
Bush seems to have cooled. ``McCain has real doubts that Bush is up
to the job, and you see that in the body language sometimes,'' said
William Kristol, a friend of both Bauer and McCain who was Keyes'
roommate at Harvard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the candidates who really are friendly, but
have no political reason to advertise the fact, usually don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bauer, for instance, have hit it off this year. And
McCain, who despite his moderate following has quite a conservative
record, spent last Fourth of July weekend with Annette Bening and
Warren Beatty, who considered running himself, apparently because
he didn't see a true liberal in the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the ideological opposites Bauer and Bradley are friendly
acquaintances, having met several times back in Bradley's Senate
days. ``We did establish a little bit of a relationship and we wish
each other well,'' Bauer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush was once quoted as calling him a ``twerp,'' Bauer
says he has since grown genuinely fond of the Texas governor. When
Bauer was in the middle of a mini-scandal last fall over having had
private meetings with a young female aide, both Bush and McCain
went out of their way to be supportive. At a joint appearance,
according to a Bush aide, Bush pulled Bauer close and whispered,
``You hang in there; I know it's garbage and never believed it for
a moment.'' Of course, as the aide added, ``he knows he's going to
need those people when this is all over.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bauer seems to feel hopeful that even in the craziness and
intense pressure of a presidential race there is room for the
unexpected, uncalculated wild card of human feeling. ``There's just
a human dynamic,'' he said, ``that arguing long distance is
different from standing next to someone and taking their measure.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the context of a campaign, relationships ultimately do
not hinge on who likes whom _ or who doesn't. ``George Bush doesn't
like or dislike people; he respects them or doesn't,'' said an
adviser. ``He may not like a guy, but if he respects his
accomplishments, it's OK.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser also says it is not McCain whom Bush sees as the
true threat, but Forbes, who is willing to spend vast amounts of
money to go negative, as he did against Bob Dole in 1996. ``A lot
more of our strategic decisions, like doing the Iowa straw poll and
waiving the matching funds,'' the aide said, ``were about not
letting Forbes do to us what he'd done to Dole.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in politics, that's still the ultimate compliment.

joint appearance, he complained that he never, ever wanted to be
put in that position again, and apparently hurt McCain's feelings a
little. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a social conservative who has been tough on Bush during
debates, seems almost poignantly open to a real, and not just a
political, friendship with the governor. ``When there were reports
last week that Bush was annoyed that I had asked him a question
four times in a row in the debates,'' he said in an interview,
``his staff made a point to let me know that not only was that not
true, but that Bush really likes me.'' After he needled Bush to
clarify his position on abortion at a recent debate, he then turned
to him off camera and whispered, ``Good answer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, issues and ideology seem as irrelevant to the
candidates in choosing their friends as voters say they are in
choosing a candidate. And in the Democratic race, Bill Bradley and
Al Gore, two Ivy Leaguers who share a passion for policy and agree
on a host of issues, probably won't be brunching in this lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in the Senate, Bradley told at least a couple of
friends that he thought Gore was hypocritical, a phony of the first
order, and in recent debates has done nothing to hide his disdain.
The vice president has gone on referring to Bradley as his friend _
at least until their chat on ``Meet the Press,'' when Gore put out
his hand, offering to shake on a pledge to stop running ads _ and
Bradley stared at it with a look that said, ``Ewww, cooties.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who those around him say rarely mentions Bradley at all,
one way or the other, has again and again called his opponent a
``good, decent man,'' though Bradley does not seem to have been
able to bring himself to return the compliment. ``I agree; I am a
good person,'' he said at one point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Bradley's put it this way: ``They never clicked
politically, stylistically or personally and have nothing in
common. And saying he's a good, decent man is like saying, `Oh,
Bill Bradley has all of his limbs.' I wouldn't return the
compliment, either.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vice president does not seem to be taking it to heart. ``He
really does not get bent out of shape about exchanges like that,''
said his daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff. But for Bradley, it does
seem personal _ in part, friends say, because of his experience as
a tough athletic competitor, and in part because he categorically
refuses to mask his real feelings in any setting. ``He won't hide
his feelings beholding something he thinks is absurd or silly,''
said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, who has been
advising Bradley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, as the campaign has gone on, McCain's attitude toward
Bush seems to have cooled. ``McCain has real doubts that Bush is up
to the job, and you see that in the body language sometimes,'' said
William Kristol, a friend of both Bauer and McCain who was Keyes'
roommate at Harvard. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the candidates who really are friendly, but
have no political reason to advertise the fact, usually don't. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Bauer, for instance, have hit it off this year. And
McCain, who despite his moderate following has quite a conservative
record, spent last Fourth of July weekend with Annette Bening and
Warren Beatty, who considered running himself, apparently because
he didn't see a true liberal in the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even the ideological opposites Bauer and Bradley are friendly
acquaintances, having met several times back in Bradley's Senate
days. ``We did establish a little bit of a relationship and we wish
each other well,'' Bauer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush was once quoted as calling him a ``twerp,'' Bauer
says he has since grown genuinely fond of the Texas governor. When
Bauer was in the middle of a mini-scandal last fall over having had
private meetings with a young female aide, both Bush and McCain
went out of their way to be supportive. At a joint appearance,
according to a Bush aide, Bush pulled Bauer close and whispered,
``You hang in there; I know it's garbage and never believed it for
a moment.'' Of course, as the aide added, ``he knows he's going to
need those people when this is all over.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bauer seems to feel hopeful that even in the craziness and
intense pressure of a presidential race there is room for the
unexpected, uncalculated wild card of human feeling. ``There's just
a human dynamic,'' he said, ``that arguing long distance is
different from standing next to someone and taking their measure.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the context of a campaign, relationships ultimately do
not hinge on who likes whom _ or who doesn't. ``George Bush doesn't
like or dislike people; he respects them or doesn't,'' said an
adviser. ``He may not like a guy, but if he respects his
accomplishments, it's OK.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the adviser also says it is not McCain whom Bush sees as the
true threat, but Forbes, who is willing to spend vast amounts of
money to go negative, as he did against Bob Dole in 1996. ``A lot
more of our strategic decisions, like doing the Iowa straw poll and
waiving the matching funds,'' the aide said, ``were about not
letting Forbes do to us what he'd done to Dole.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in politics, that's still the ultimate compliment.

<P>
   Professional football coaches often make more than $1 million a
year. They work long hours, sometimes sleeping in their offices,
looking for a small edge that will give their teams a victory and a
chance to advance to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But when faced with a crucial decision during close games, many
coaches make a mistake that a middle-school math student might
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The problem comes when a football play known as the two-point
conversion collides with a mathematical principle known as expected
value. Expected value is the average result, over the long term,
that somebody can expect to see from a given decision. On the roll
of a die, for example, it is 3{ _ the average of the numbers 1
through 6.
</P>
<P>
   Adults use the concept, knowingly or not, when they make
decisions about which insurance policy or mutual fund to buy. And
as statistics has become a much larger part of math teaching in the
last decade, expected value problems are popping up in state
curriculums and on standardized tests. Many football coaches, it
seems, could use a few review sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, after scoring a touchdown, teams try to add two
points by running or passing the ball into the end zone from the
two-yard line, rather than take the safer route of kicking it
through the goalposts for one point. Bill Parcells, the New York
Jets' coach this season, did it against the New England Patriots,
and the Jets ended up losing a game that most likely kept them out
of the postseason. Two college coaches did it over New Year's
weekend; at least one game hinged on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The two-point conversion has been part of the college game for
decades, but the National Football League, looking to add
excitement, adopted it only in 1994. Coaches usually try for the
conversion when they think that one point is of little import but
two would make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Behind by five points to the Patriots in the third quarter,
Parcells went for two, hoping to pull within three points, the
value of a field goal. The difference between trailing by four
points and five points, on the other hand, seemed trivial. Coaches
even carry laminated cards on the sideline, telling them what leads
and deficits should cause them to go for two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the card and blow it up!'' said Phil Simms, the former
New York Giants quarterback who is now a commentator for CBS
Sports, offering a bit of advice to coaches. ``Too often, teams use
it too quickly, and it ends up costing them at the end.'' Because
it fails so frequently, Simms said, the two-point conversion play
should usually be reserved for the very end of games, when the lost
point cannot come back to haunt a coach.
</P>
<P>
   An expected-value calculation, in which one multiplies the
chance of success by the value that success would bring, echoes the
point. In the NFL this season, two-point attempts worked 37 percent
of the time. So the expected value of a two-point try was 0.74, or
74 one-hundredths of a point: 0.37 (the success rate) times 2 (the
value of a successful attempt). The expected value of an extra
point, by contrast, was about 0.94, since the kicks are good about
94 percent of the time and a successful kick is worth one point.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical difference is significant, and it really does
cause teams to lose games. The Jets, for instance, missed their
two-point try, forcing them to make another one later on, which
they also missed. Had they scored the extra point both times, the
Patriots would not have been in position to kick a last-second
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently, coaches will do something that is in direct
violation of the laws of probability,'' said Harold Sackrowitz, a
statistics professor at Rutgers University. He has designed an
alternative card that has columns for both the score and how much
time is left in a game.
</P>
<P>
   A good contrast to the two-point conversion is basketball's
three-point shot, which turns out to be a worthy risk, all else
being equal. Most pro teams make the long-distance shot about
one-third of the time, giving it an expected value of about 1 (.33
x 3). Regular, two-point shots go in the basket about 45 percent of
the time, for an expected value of .9 (.45 x 2).
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of expected value go far beyond sports. In state
lotteries, the expected value of a $1 ticket is often less than 75
cents, because the government keeps so much of the initial pot. In
other words, people who play the lottery every day can expect about
a negative 25 percent return on the investment over their
lifetimes. Casino games often have similarly grim expected values.
And investors use expected values when studying the historical
returns of mutual funds to decide which make sense, depending on
when the money is needed.
</P>
<P>
   So if anybody is looking for an excuse to plop down in front of
the playoff games, think of it as a chance to make a case study of
basic statistics. As strange as it may sound, watching the Vikings
and Rams and the Titans and Colts smash helmets could help a
teen-ager get into college or an adult make a wise financial
decision.

   ``Take the card and blow it up!'' said Phil Simms, the former
New York Giants quarterback who is now a commentator for CBS
Sports, offering a bit of advice to coaches. ``Too often, teams use
it too quickly, and it ends up costing them at the end.'' Because
it fails so frequently, Simms said, the two-point conversion play
should usually be reserved for the very end of games, when the lost
point cannot come back to haunt a coach.
</P>
<P>
   An expected-value calculation, in which one multiplies the
chance of success by the value that success would bring, echoes the
point. In the NFL this season, two-point attempts worked 37 percent
of the time. So the expected value of a two-point try was 0.74, or
74 one-hundredths of a point: 0.37 (the success rate) times 2 (the
value of a successful attempt). The expected value of an extra
point, by contrast, was about 0.94, since the kicks are good about
94 percent of the time and a successful kick is worth one point.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical difference is significant, and it really does
cause teams to lose games. The Jets, for instance, missed their
two-point try, forcing them to make another one later on, which
they also missed. Had they scored the extra point both times, the
Patriots would not have been in position to kick a last-second
game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently, coaches will do something that is in direct
violation of the laws of probability,'' said Harold Sackrowitz, a
statistics professor at Rutgers University. He has designed an
alternative card that has columns for both the score and how much
time is left in a game.
</P>
<P>
   A good contrast to the two-point conversion is basketball's
three-point shot, which turns out to be a worthy risk, all else
being equal. Most pro teams make the long-distance shot about
one-third of the time, giving it an expected value of about 1 (.33
x 3). Regular, two-point shots go in the basket about 45 percent of
the time, for an expected value of .9 (.45 x 2).
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of expected value go far beyond sports. In state
lotteries, the expected value of a $1 ticket is often less than 75
cents, because the government keeps so much of the initial pot. In
other words, people who play the lottery every day can expect about
a negative 25 percent return on the investment over their
lifetimes. Casino games often have similarly grim expected values.
And investors use expected values when studying the historical
returns of mutual funds to decide which make sense, depending on
when the money is needed.
</P>
<P>
   So if anybody is looking for an excuse to plop down in front of
the playoff games, think of it as a chance to make a case study of
basic statistics. As strange as it may sound, watching the Vikings
and Rams and the Titans and Colts smash helmets could help a
teen-ager get into college or an adult make a wise financial
decision.

   NEW DELHI, India _ Just after New Year's, when most of the
world's leaders were welcoming the millennium like a flower about
to bloom, the government in New Delhi was denouncing its neighbor,
Pakistan, accusing it of masterminding the hijacking of an Indian
airliner. Charges and countercharges of assorted evils have since
followed as officials of the fledgling nuclear powers busy
themselves with what often seems their preoccupation: hating each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between predominantly Hindu India and overwhelmingly
Muslim Pakistan are now near the low point of 1971, when they
fought their third all-out war. Things weren't supposed to be this
way _ or at least that was India's calculation when it unbottled
the nuclear genie in May 1998 by conducting underground nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistan responded quickly with matching nuclear tests. And
rather than making the subcontinent more secure, many experts on
the region now agree, India and Pakistan's open possession of the
bomb appears to have raised the risk of limited wars that could
spiral out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Their poisoned relationship has taken on a perverse dynamic.
Smaller, weaker Pakistan has been emboldened to view its nuclear
arsenal as a magic shield that will protect it from harm even if it
endlessly gores India, the dominant power in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced a war of ``a thousand cuts'' that is enraging
India, wearing its patience thin and prompting some Indian
officials to threaten stronger retaliation. Pakistan has
consistently miscalculated India's determination not to let
possession of nuclear weapons deter it from responding militarily.
India's defense minister, George Fernandes, recently boasted that
``India can beat Pakistan anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The stark deterioration in relations between India and Pakistan
has been evident in a series of recent events _ most immediately in
India's response to the hijacking. But the decline began last
summer, when Pakistani forces occupied remote peaks in the Indian
state of Kashmir, the Himalayan territory that both countries
claim, and India fought to root them out with troops, artillery and
fighter planes. Pakistan eventually withdrew, but tensions have
only grown.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was
toppled in a military coup in October. The rise to power of Gen.
Pervaiz Musharraf, the army chief whom India holds responsible for
Pakistan's ill-advised summer adventure, has driven the two
countries further apart. Pakistani-backed guerrilla attacks on
Indian security forces in Kashmir are now at their worst level in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. V.P. Malik, India's army chief, said recently that the
restraint that India showed last summer _ specifically its decision
not to cross the so-called Line of Control that separates the
Indian- and Pakistani-held portions of Kashmir _ ``may not be
applicable to the next war.''
</P>
<P>
   He voiced the belief that the escalation of limited wars could
be tightly controlled in part because the nuclear deterrent itself
would help prevent them from getting out of hand and in part
because cool-headed leaders would exercise discipline. In future
wars, he said, ``the escalation ladder would be carefully climbed
in a carefully controlled ascent by both protagonists.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely such words that chill nuclear thinkers. Theories
of deterrence work only if those who possess the bomb believe that
it is dangerous to wage wars because violence may escalate
frighteningly and unpredictably. What if India decides to strike
militant training camps inside Pakistan next time? How will
Pakistan react?
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that at some point, the Pakistanis will be tempted
to up the ante,'' said George Perkovich, author of ``India's
Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California Press, 1999). ``There will
be another provocation. Somebody blows up something big and India
says, `That's it,' and takes out targets. Then you're on your way.
Who's going to back down?''
</P>
<P>
   India's assumption that unwrapping its nuclear capability would
make the subcontinent safer was perhaps best expressed by Jaswant
Singh, the nation's chief of foreign affairs, in 1998: ``If
deterrence works in the West _ it so obviously appears to, since
Western nations insist on continuing to possess nuclear weapons _
by what reasoning will it not work in India?''
</P>
<P>
   But that line of logic ignores a critical difference between how
the Cold War was fought and how India and Pakistan confront each
other: With a notable exception, the Americans and Soviets took
care not to place their own armies in direct military
confrontation. The exception was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
which experts say was the moment when the two sides came closest to
stumbling into an all-out nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani armies confront each other constantly
along the Line of Control in Kashmir. More than 500 Indian soldiers
were killed in last summer's fighting, and with them died the trust
of India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, for Sharif, then
prime minister. Peace talks stopped. Just months earlier, Vajpayee,
the Hindu nationalist leader, had gone by bus to Pakistan, where he
and Sharif shook hands and agreed that their nations would sort out
their differences over a bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton planning to visit India this spring, U.S.
diplomats are trying to get India and Pakistan back to the
negotiating table. ``The United States has repeatedly said, `You
have to be talking to each other, not shouting at each other,
especially when things seem to be at their worst,''' said Richard
Celeste, the U.S. ambassador in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   But India has other ideas. In order to end the hijacking on New
Year's Eve, India traded three imprisoned militants for the
hijacked plane's passengers and crew _ a choice that many in India,
even some of Vajpayee's allies, have depicted as a humiliating
setback for his government. Since then, India has aggressively
pushed for the United States and other nations to declare Pakistan
a terrorist nation, isolating it as a pariah.

official asserted in an interview last week that the conclusive

   Some U.S. officials worry that they would lose influence over

numbers of alienated young people flocking to the banners of
Islamic fundamentalism and a holy war against India.

he believes India is more secure for having openly embraced the
bomb. Years before the tests, Pakistan was already suggesting that
it might use nuclear weapons, Mishra said. The new element added by
India's tests was the certainty that India, too, had the weapons,
he said, adding that nuclear deterrence had kept the recent
conflict in Kashmir from widening.
</P>
<P>
   But the tests do seem to have introduced a new element for both
countries: Certainty has replaced doubt about the effectiveness of
their bombs. Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's ambassador to the United
States, said in an interview that the years of deterrence through
``nuclear ambiguity'' had worked well enough, but that when India
tested, Pakistan had no choice but to follow suit. ``You're never
sure of designs until you test them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan certainly seems emboldened. ``When that capacity had
been proved and the Pakistani military down through the ranks saw
the mountain shake, the Pakistanis said, `We can equal these
guys,''' said Perkovich, the expert on India's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, it is difficult to see a way out of the
bitter cycle of violence over Kashmir that seems to endlessly
repeat itself. ``Much of India-Pakistan relations has a strong
sense of deja vu,'' said Ms. Lodhi. ``We've all been there before.
We've had half a century of confrontation. Are we going to spend
the next century in conflict, too, or break out of it?''

<P>
   Since Russian troops launched a new offensive against Chechen
rebels four months ago, U.S. military officials have watched
closely to see if the Russian commanders would avoid the mistakes
they made during their disastrous 1994-1996 campaign. Could they,
as promised, match the U.S. successes last year against Serbia and
against Iraq in 1991, using technological and tactical superiority
to crush a weaker enemy, while minimizing losses and maintaining
popular support?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is no.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. commanders and military analysts, this second Chechen
war has revealed more about Russian strengths and weaknesses than
any spy satellite ever could. And for officials in Washington and
across Europe, the insights are in a way reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Red Army that many once feared could roll across the
plains of northern Europe today cannot even contain an insurgency
within its own borders. Moreover, even as Russian tactics evolve,
the military and political leadership appear locked strategically
in the Soviet age, said U.S. officials. Even though Russia no
longer has a so-called command society, in which a Stalin can order
many thousands of Chechens to forcibly move to another province, as
he did in 1944, Russian leaders still act as if they can rule with
an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, that means fighting a war at great internal and
external cost, instead of pursuing a political resolution that
effectively manages an old ethnic division.
</P>
<P>
   In the haphazard transition to democracy under Boris Yeltsin,
conventional forces bore the brunt of downsizing and shrinking
budgets. Priority was given to the strategic nuclear force, which
today is Russia's only real claim to status as a military power.
Russia still has a standing force of 1.5 million troops, slightly
larger than the one maintained by the United States, but the budget
will be only $4 billion this year, compared with the Pentagon's
$284 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Russians have had to rely on Soviet-era weapons
and equipment, and the troops are chronically untrained, underpaid
and underfed. Draft dodging is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning is that a lot of the recent commentary
about the state of the Russian military is pretty accurate, and
that is that it is in pretty lousy shape,'' said Mark N. Kramer, a
senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Russians seemed to have learned some lessons
from the last Chechen war, said U.S. military officials. When that
conflict began in 1994, some 30,000 Russian troops raced in to
smash the revolt, only to suffer enormous losses, including some
3,000 dead, when they tried to quickly seize Grozny, the rebels'
stronghold and the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a real black eye the first time around by charging to
the train station and stopping to eat supper and getting ambushed
and losing a regiment early on,'' a U.S. general said. ``Although
the war dragged on for nearly two more years, they never recovered
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   After their defeat, Russian commanders shifted the bulk of their
resources to ``first to fight'' divisions, according to a U.S.
defense official who closely monitors the Russian military. Those
units, including the Russian special forces, have led the ground
assaults in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have also improved their tactics, attacking
far more deliberately and with greater force, American officials
said. An estimated 100,000 Russian troops marched systematically
through northern Chechnya, seizing the countryside and gradually
encircling Grozny, cutting off 6,000 rebels there and another 6,000
in the southern mountains. The American general said that in this
campaign the Russians were exhibiting better command and control,
effectively coordinating complex operations.
</P>
<P>
   They have also made extensive use of air and missile strikes and
artillery bombardments, minimizing the exposure of ground troops to
deadly firefights with dug-in rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Robert Scales, the commandant of the U.S. Army War
College, said this concern over casualties, which badly eroded
public support during the first war, has been one of the most
striking changes in Russian military doctrine in decades, showing a
new sensitivity to the military's need for civilian backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Soviet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian command has also adopted another tactic from NATO's
Kosovo war, mounting a public-relations blitz to rally popular
opinion. They have strictly controlled battlefield reports and
grossly downplayed losses. (The U.S. defense official said the
Russians had underreported losses threefold, which means there are
probably more than 1,000 dead already.)
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive began to go awry, as before, when
commanders finally ordered an assault on Grozny on Christmas Day.
Despite three months of bombardments, Russian troops encountered
fierce resistance from rebels dug into a network of fortified
trenches and bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russian troops counterattacked, their offensive now
appears in disarray, raising doubts in the minds of American
analysts about whether the Russians can defeat the Chechens. ``The
Chechens are an enemy that's incredibly tough, prepared to fight
and die for their cause,'' said Scales. ``The Chechens are not
Iraqis.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense official who specializes in the Russian military
predicted that the offensive would fail. He cited the Russians'
military shortcomings, but also their failure to realize the
underlying cause of the conflict: the Chechens' historic
unwillingness to accept political domination by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've learned tactical lessons,'' the official said.
``But I don't think the political leadership or the military
leadership in Russia has learned the strategic lesson. Chechnya is
not a military problem, and it is not subject to a military
solution.''

<P>
   Since Russian troops launched a new offensive against Chechen
rebels four months ago, U.S. military officials have watched
closely to see if the Russian commanders would avoid the mistakes
they made during their disastrous 1994-1996 campaign. Could they,
as promised, match the U.S. successes last year against Serbia and
against Iraq in 1991, using technological and tactical superiority
to crush a weaker enemy, while minimizing losses and maintaining
popular support?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is no.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. commanders and military analysts, this second Chechen
war has revealed more about Russian strengths and weaknesses than
any spy satellite ever could. And for officials in Washington and
across Europe, the insights are in a way reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   The mighty Red Army that many once feared could roll across the
plains of northern Europe today cannot even contain an insurgency
within its own borders. Moreover, even as Russian tactics evolve,
the military and political leadership appear locked strategically
in the Soviet age, said U.S. officials. Even though Russia no
longer has a so-called command society, in which a Stalin can order
many thousands of Chechens to forcibly move to another province, as
he did in 1944, Russian leaders still act as if they can rule with
an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   In Chechnya, that means fighting a war at great internal and
external cost, instead of pursuing a political resolution that
effectively manages an old ethnic division.
</P>
<P>
   In the haphazard transition to democracy under Boris Yeltsin,
conventional forces bore the brunt of downsizing and shrinking
budgets. Priority was given to the strategic nuclear force, which
today is Russia's only real claim to status as a military power.
Russia still has a standing force of 1.5 million troops, slightly
larger than the one maintained by the United States, but the budget
will be only $4 billion this year, compared with the Pentagon's
$284 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Russians have had to rely on Soviet-era weapons
and equipment, and the troops are chronically untrained, underpaid
and underfed. Draft dodging is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning is that a lot of the recent commentary
about the state of the Russian military is pretty accurate, and
that is that it is in pretty lousy shape,'' said Mark N. Kramer, a
senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Russians seemed to have learned some lessons
from the last Chechen war, said U.S. military officials. When that
conflict began in 1994, some 30,000 Russian troops raced in to
smash the revolt, only to suffer enormous losses, including some
3,000 dead, when they tried to quickly seize Grozny, the rebels'
stronghold and the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a real black eye the first time around by charging to
the train station and stopping to eat supper and getting ambushed
and losing a regiment early on,'' a U.S. general said. ``Although
the war dragged on for nearly two more years, they never recovered
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   After their defeat, Russian commanders shifted the bulk of their
resources to ``first to fight'' divisions, according to a U.S.
defense official who closely monitors the Russian military. Those
units, including the Russian special forces, have led the ground
assaults in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have also improved their tactics, attacking
far more deliberately and with greater force, American officials
said. An estimated 100,000 Russian troops marched systematically
through northern Chechnya, seizing the countryside and gradually
encircling Grozny, cutting off 6,000 rebels there and another 6,000
in the southern mountains. The American general said that in this
campaign the Russians were exhibiting better command and control,
effectively coordinating complex operations.
</P>
<P>
   They have also made extensive use of air and missile strikes and
artillery bombardments, minimizing the exposure of ground troops to
deadly firefights with dug-in rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Robert Scales, the commandant of the U.S. Army War
College, said this concern over casualties, which badly eroded
public support during the first war, has been one of the most
striking changes in Russian military doctrine in decades, showing a
new sensitivity to the military's need for civilian backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Soviet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian command has also adopted another tactic from NATO's
Kosovo war, mounting a public-relations blitz to rally popular
opinion. They have strictly controlled battlefield reports and
grossly downplayed losses. (The U.S. defense official said the
Russians had underreported losses threefold, which means there are
probably more than 1,000 dead already.)

<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Mixing race and politics, everyone
knows, often produces a volatile brew. But in South Africa, racial
politics are the only politics. Despite all the talk of
reconciliation and transformation during the first five years of
democracy here, that reality remains virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Whites vote for whites. Blacks vote for blacks. The apartheid
laws that separated the races for decades have been swept from the
books, but the divisions they engendered still define the ballot
box.
</P>
<P>
   Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a white man jolted the nation when he announced that
he might leap across the racial and political divide and urged
other whites to think like him. The high-jumper was none other than
Pik Botha, the long-serving foreign minister for the apartheid
regime, the oppressor and opponent of black liberation _ and maybe
soon, he says, a card-carrying member of the African National
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afrikaners, whites should support the ANC,'' Botha, 68, told
the country in a series of newspaper, television and radio
interviews about his plans to join the party that had led the
resistance to apartheid. ``We cannot just continue with blacks
voting ANC and whites voting for the opposition. I want to break
with the racist attitudes of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   And as black party leaders gasped with delight and white party
leaders howled with dismay, the thick political walls between the
races suddenly seemed less sturdy and it suddenly seemed reasonable
to wonder: Which way will white voters go in the new South Africa?
Is this country finally ready to move beyond the politics of race?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer, clearly, is no. Most whites voted decisively
against the ANC in last year's presidential election. But Botha's
willingness to even consider joining the ANC hints at a shift in
mind-set _ if only a modest one _ among some whites as they ponder
their political futures here.
</P>
<P>
   Botha says they have no choice. He warns that if whites, who
make up only about 10 percent of the population, continue to vote
along the color line, they will find themselves relegated to tiny,
powerless parties.
</P>
<P>
   Such parties, while vigorous guardians of minority rights, lack
the power to make policy on issues, like crime and affirmative
action, that preoccupy whites.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Botha argues, joining the ANC would offer
whites a real voice in policy-making and in the selection of
policy-makers. (And some political analysts say that if blacks were
to join the traditionally white political parties, it might give
those parties greater legitimacy to challenge the ANC, offering the
country more of a true multiparty flavor instead of what exists
now, a largely one-party state.)
</P>
<P>
   The ANC government's increasingly centrist philosophy has at
least made such conversations possible. Whites no longer fear that
ANC leaders are all closet Communists, ready to nationalize
industry and seize white land. In fact, the government's fiscally
conservative policies have left behind its partners among the
unions and the Communists as government officials take a tough
stance on wage negotiations and push ahead with privatization
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Botha commended the country's current economic policies and
reminded his fellow whites that it was the ANC that supported a
liberal constitution that protects minority rights, property
rights, civil liberties and Afrikaans as an official language. But
Botha is not your average white man. He has always been a bit of a
maverick, even during the decades when he served the white
government. In the 1980s, he stirred a furor by predicting that
South Africa would someday have a black president. And when that
day arrived, he served under President Nelson Mandela until his own
National Party withdrew from the government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For most whites, however, joining the ANC is simply unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pik Botha is right when he says this is the key to
normalizing politics,'' said Bob Mattes of the Institute for
Democracy, a nongovernmental organization that surveys public
opinion on politics. ``But leaders moving over is just the tip of
the iceberg. It's not like Pik Botha takes all those people with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just watching the new government redress some past inequities
makes some whites jittery. More government money and attention is
directed toward blacks now than in the old days when whites
absorbed the lion's share of the government's attention and had the
best jobs, land, schooling and neighborhoods. Now, as the
democratic government spreads the wealth more equitably, those
white privileges are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Thabo Mbeki, the new president, seems less preoccupied
with racial reconciliation than was his predecessor, Mandela. Mbeki
stresses foreign investment, delivery of services to the poor and a
commitment to help other predominantly black countries in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And some political analysts warn that even if whites were to
join the ANC in significant numbers, there are no guarantees that
they would have much clout, particularly in a government that
stresses affirmative action and black empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   The party that some believed offered the best hope for
multiracial membership, the United Democratic Movement, has fallen
victim to organizational and financial difficulties and, some say,
racial bickering. Where else to call home? Only the ANC, insist its
loyalists, pointing to its long history of racial inclusion and
prominent white members, who include the current ministers of trade
and industry, and water and forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being converted,'' the ANC spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama,
said of whites. ``Even our slavemasters, like Pik Botha, they are
getting converted by the wisdom of the former slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-boiled conservatives roll their eyes at such talk and
deride Botha as a political opportunist long out of touch with his
own people. But even the conservative press seemed reluctant to
slam the door on the possibility that white hearts might be warming
toward South Africa's most famous liberation party.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last week one newspaper, The Citizen, recalled
Botha's knack for sensing the shifting political winds. ``When Mr.
Botha predicted in 1986 that South Africa would one day have a
black president, how many whites believed him?'' the editorial
read. ``Never say never in politics.''

TALKING, ONLINE CARS GIVE NEW MEANING TO `INFORMATION
SUPERHIGHWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A new era is dawning for automobiles. Later this year,
hundreds of thousands of drivers will be able to have conversations
with their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the car to get on the information superhighway, and it will
download e-mail using relatively slow cellular phone connections. A
computerized ``voice'' will be able to read the e-mail through the
car's stereo speakers, automakers say. It will call out sports
scores on command, not just when a radio station programs them. It
will quote the latest stock prices. It will even be able to check
the traffic and give directions.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million cars and trucks in the United States are
expected to have this conversational capability by the end of the
year, using voice-recognition software to translate drivers' words
into a limited list of computer commands. That is not quite enough
to surf the Internet, but enough to splash in it.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketing experts are skeptical about the need for this
innovation, even if it can be made to work properly. ``Most people
don't want to talk to their car,'' said Jack F. Trout, president of
Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy firm based in Greenwich,
Conn. ``They want their car to shut up and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, auto executives are forging ahead. Some Americans
have always used their cars as living rooms, dining rooms and
offices, and they expect this to be no different. Just as
cupholders allowed drivers to sip coffee during their commutes,
executives say, these devices will allow them to work on their way
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years it will be in all of the new vehicles that
we're doing,'' Jac Nasser, Ford Motor's chief executive, said here
last week at the North American International Auto Show, where many
of the talking cars were shown. ``We will do nothing short of
transforming our cars and our trucks into a portal for the
Internet.'' Ford's first talking cars will be the 2001 model year
Lincolns, on sale by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first General Motors Internet-connected talking vehicles
will roll out of factory doors in a few months, and by year's end,
more than 400,000 cars, sport utility vehicles, pickups and
minivans will be ready to talk back to their owners, said Todd R.
Carstensen, a company spokesman. Many other automakers are rushing
to get their versions ready by next year, if not sooner. One
supplier, Delphi Automotive, already has $2.5 billion in orders
from seven automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Providing Internet access is one of a series of moves by
automakers to add safety and entertainment features _ and the added
charges they bring. Many minivans now come with video screens that
allow passengers in the back seat to watch movies. Some Ford and GM
cars are already equipped with wireless connections to operators
who can give directions, make dinner reservations or call a tow
truck, tracking the car with a global positioning satellite system.
If an air bag deploys, operators can send an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-recognition technology is intended to give motorists
access to computers without requiring drivers to type and steer at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicles have to be safe,'' said Lawrence D. Burns, vice
president for research, development and planning at General Motors.
``Driving requires your eyes on the road and your hands on the
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will not be able to do many of the things they can do on
their home or office computer, and they will not get results as
quickly because of limits on the vocabulary of the
voice-recognition systems and the relatively slow speed of the
cellular Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the GM and Ford versions will not be able to send
e-mail. Ford's voice recognition software would understand just 200
words. While the systems are intended to be simple to use, Ford
drivers would need to know they should say ``get e-mail'' or ``read
e-mail'' and not just ``e-mail'' to cue the system, which listens
for verbs, or ``tell me the NPR news'' to hear National Public
Radio's latest Internet report.
</P>
<P>
   The system is by no means foolproof. If a backseat driver
interrupts, a Ford's ``voice'' is likely to pause, then utter a
patient-sounding ``say that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice recognition in cars ``is really just in its toddler stage
now,'' said Richard F. Doherty, director of research for
Envisioneering, a technology assessment and market research firm in
Seaford, N.Y. ``It is somewhere between being a great show-me
gimmick and a convenience, and it is getting closer to being a
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most people keep the same car for years, automakers are
trying to design communications systems that can be updated as
better technology becomes available. So instead of equipping each
car with a computer that would be outdated almost as soon as it
made it out of the factory, Ford and GM plan to install cellular
communications equipment that links cars to land-based computers
that can be updated as new technology becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet cars would then use cellular phone connections to
link up to an Internet home page preprogrammed with the driver's
preferences for traffic, weather, news and stock reports, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, on the other hand, plans a ``bring your own
laptop'' approach. ``How many phones do you want to deal with? How
many Internet accesses?'' asked Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's
vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to install a small screen, microphone and
cellular phone modem in its vehicles sometime within the next two
years. Drivers would then plug in their own equipment, said Stephen
J. Buckley, a DaimlerChrysler electronics specialist.
</P>
<P>
   While no manufacturer has yet set prices on the devices, the
bulk of revenue is likely to come from monthly wireless connection
and Internet access fees, with expected charges of $7 to $75 a
month. With that, drivers could turn on the ignition, tune in to
the Internet, and drop out of the boredom of commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Talking cars have been produced before. In the mid-1980s,
Chrysler New Yorkers would tell drivers ``your fuel is low'' or
``your door is ajar'' or ``fasten your seat belts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the car was a nag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear it all the time, and if you didn't address the
issue right away, it would go on and on and on and drive you
crazy,'' said Steve Aretakis, the president of Hasco Spring
Industries in Oak Park, Mich., who suffered through a couple of
years of driving a 1984 New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Aretakis isn't holding his breath for the latest Internet
version of the talking car. ``I haven't had a car since like
that,'' he said. ``I don't really know if I'd want one, either.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ In late 1998, during the darkest hours of the Clinton
presidency, while friends and foes in Washington obsessed about
whether a sexual affair would force a sudden change in tenants at
the White House, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt began sending
notes to President Clinton about the final years of another
president.
</P>
<P>
   Look West, Babbitt advised, just as President Theodore Roosevelt
had done at the turn of the century. With the stroke of a pen, TR
used a 1906 law called the Antiquities Act to set aside pieces of
the American back yard for the ages _ protected as a national
monument. Clinton could do the same, using the same legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And he has. Chasing Roosevelt's ghost, Clinton arrived at the
wind-chapped lip of the Grand Canyon last Tuesday, exactly 92 years
after Roosevelt went to the same spot. Roosevelt hiked; Clinton
arrived by helicopter. But their intent was the same: using the
power of the presidency to establish a personal legacy that would
outlast that transitory power.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Clinton designated three new national monuments
and expanded a fourth. He has now set aside more federal land _
outside of Alaska _as monuments than any other president. More than
2.7 million acres of federal land, or an area about twice the size
of Delaware, has been given new monument status, which restricts
development while aiming to keep the area in a wild state for
perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even lame ducks have wings,'' said Babbitt after leading
Clinton on a tour of rust-colored high ground in Arizona, newly
enshrined as the Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little that any president facing a hostile
Congress can do to change the course of domestic events in his last
months in office. One major exception is the environment. The
Antiquities Act gives a president power to confer eternal
protection on a piece of the public domain as ``an object of
historic and scientific interest.'' Land that has been given
monument status may no longer be used for any purpose or in any way
that would change its character. That is, if the land has
traditionally served as grazing territory, or been hunted or
fished, such use might be continued. On the other hand, logging,
mining or off-road driving would be forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Clinton has signaled his intent to use the Antiquities
Act like a golfer who has just discovered the power of a titanium
driver. He is likely to designate another half-dozen national
monuments, protecting desert land in Oregon, coastal cliffs in
California, the river banks that Lewis and Clark explored in
Montana and ancient Indian sites in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a one-year-old executive order that brought to a
halt all new road building on 40 million acres of National Forest
land _ a move that could nearly double the size of land protected
as wilderness _ Clinton's conservation legacy would place him among
the giants of American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The big stick actions of the president over the last two years
have come as somewhat of a surprise to people who once thought
Clinton's idea of green extended no further than the Astroturf he
had long ago in the back of his pickup truck. Then, too, this was
the man who just a few years ago had to be nudged, on the basis of
polling done by adviser Dick Morris, to spend his summer holiday in
the Rockies, trying to look presidential while swatting at horse
flies and wincing at sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the president was far less decisive when he took
office in 1993. Just months after moving into the White House, he
made a daring move to abolish nearly a century of federal land
management policies that had catered to mining, timber and oil
interests. But when Western Republicans raised a stink, Clinton
backed off, to the howl of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What started as a love affair is now looking like it may turn
out to be date rape,'' said Jay Hair, then the executive director
of the National Wildlife Foundation, in a memorable jab at the
president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildlife Federation looks more kindly on Clinton today, as
well they might. Before the executive actions of last week, Clinton
also initiated a federal land purchase that protects Yellowstone
National Park from mining, put 70,000 acres of riverbank on the
last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River into the National
Wildlife system and began his string of monument designations with
one of the biggest ever _ the 1.7 million acres of Grand
Staircase-Escalante in southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he has had a very strong second half from the
environmental point of view,'' said Jim Lyon, legislative director
for the Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, mainly in the rural West, accuse Clinton of making
big land grabs at the expense of small communities. They also say
that Clinton cares less about the land than he does about linking
himself to spectacular scenery for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has an agenda that is not necessarily good for society _ he
just wants to leave a legacy,'' said Rep. Barbara Cubin, R- Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the public is overwhelmingly in favor of more
wilderness and national parks _ which many monuments ultimately
become. Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce and Olympic _ now among the most
popular national parks _ all started as monuments.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good politics, Democrats say, to have Republicans
carping about presidential orders to protect stunning pieces of
federal land. The Democrats say one of their best issues in 1996
were efforts by a handful of Western Republicans to close down some
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a huge upsurge in public sentiment on behalf of
protecting open space,'' said Babbitt. In Arizona, while leading
Republicans opposed Clinton's designation of the new monuments, a
poll by the Arizona Republic showed 80 percent support for the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Other presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have looked to
public land for a legacy. All but three of the 15 who came between
Teddy Roosevelt and Bill Clinton established national monuments, of
which there are more than 100 today. Although a subsequent
president _ or a veto-proof majority of Congress _ could overturn a
declaration, no monument has ever been revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt recalled that his grandfather, a rancher and merchant in
northern Arizona, strongly opposed Roosevelt's 1908 declaration
that set aside Grand Canyon as monument. He had a water claim in
the canyon and a ranch on the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not many years went by before my grandfather, in his mellow
years, said he always was in favor of protecting the Grand
Canyon,'' said Babbitt. ``As I told the president: History is on
our side.''

   When Jeffrey Harris was head of the National Reconnaissance
Office in the mid-1990s, his agency's satellites routinely peered
down on the world's hot spots from outer space and photographed
them for federal intelligence agencies. It was all supersecret and
all dedicated to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harris has a new job and a new agenda. As president of Space
Imaging Inc., a private company in Thornton, Colo., he wants to get
rich by selling photographs taken by his company's satellite camera
_ the first in the world to rival military reconnaissance in
accuracy and sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   The spy-satellite business, for decades a secretive monopoly of
advanced nations, is trying to go commercial. But the photographs
pose questions of practicality, security and privacy: In theory,
nosy neighbors can now peer over tall fences.
</P>
<P>
   Space Imaging's satellite, launched in September, is the first
of a dozen or so commercial surveillance craft expected to be sent
into orbit in the next decade, a wave begun by the Clinton
administration's green light in 1994. The new field of close-up
space photography is seen as a boon for mining companies,
mapmakers, geologists, city planners, ecologists, farmers,
hydrologists, road makers, journalists, land managers,
disaster-relief officials and others seeking to monitor the
planet's changing face. The global market in such imagery is
expected to reach as high as $5 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Space Imaging's photos have already laid bare the devastation of
last November's earthquake in Turkey, showing demolished warehouses
and shattered residences. The pictures have also revealed the grim
aftermath of Venezuela's recent floods and mudslides, as well as
smoke curling over the Chechen city of Grozny, which was under
Russian attack.
</P>
<P>
   From an orbit 400 miles up, the camera can see objects as small
as 3 feet wide. The photos aren't cheap. A minimum order for a
North American scene is $1,000, and a foreign image is $2,000. But
the company, via its Web site, www.spaceimage.com, also sells $10
snapshots of world landmarks, including the Taj Mahal, Vatican
City, Big Ben, the Forbidden City in Beijing and Central Park in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Wheelon, a former CIA official who helped shape the
nation's early spy-satellite program, said world governments and
their militaries would probably be the top customers for years to
come. Civilian inroads, he added, ``will take a long time, like
computers did.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Space Imaging's main customer now is the Pentagon. And
the company is co-owned by the Lockheed Martin Corp., a military
contractor that makes spy satellites, and E-Systems, a division of
Raytheon that provides many of their communication links.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is making a technological leap of faith,
inspired by the success of the Internet and personal computers. It
just got a $1.3 million order from the Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh, which is regularly battered by cyclones and is eager to
improve its assessment of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton Carey, associate administrator for innovation, research
and education at the Department of Transportation, said his office
was investigating the imagery for tracking four million miles of
federal highways and for planning future construction.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far Space Imaging has had some of its greatest
successes providing military-type surveillance for civilian
organizations. Last week, the Federation of American Scientists, a
private group in Washington that promotes arms control, released an
analysis of Space Imaging photographs that disclosed a secret North
Korean missile base, setting off a battle among experts over
whether the launching site for long-range missiles is a serious
threat or too primitive to be of concern.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, director of the federation's space program, said such
images promise to ``increase the amount of fact and decrease the
speculation and hype in public debate.'' Careful study, he said,
could provide an independent check on government claims and a
competitive analysis for federal intelligence analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce D. Berkowitz, a former CIA analyst and the author of
``Best Truth: Intelligence in the Information Age'' (Yale, 1999),
said commercial spy satellites were destined to reshape military
espionage. ``As the commercial sector gets better and better,'' he
said, intelligence agencies are ``going to have to push harder at
the edge to find their own special niche.''

espionage. ``As the commercial sector gets better and better,'' he
said, intelligence agencies are ``going to have to push harder at
the edge to find their own special niche.''

   WASHINGTON _ I was disappointed to learn that David Letterman's
producers slipped the first lady the contents of her New York pop
quiz in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever other problems she has, Hillary Rodham Clinton never
struck me as the sort of girl who would crib on a quiz.
</P>
<P>
   I have been badgering Rudolph Giuliani to see me, so I could
give him a pop quiz on Washington. But now, to be fair, I'll have
to provide an advance peek. So, Mr. Mayor, call me when you're
ready to ace this.

</P>
<P>
   Myth has it that Pierre L'Enfant, the capital's designer,
refused to name a street J because he was feuding with John Jay,
the first chief justice. But it was more likely a worry that J and
I looked too similar.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) What does it mean when the light on top of

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was, frankly, unprepared for jail in this country.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Asia, I often encountered people _ particularly
Chinese _ who had endured Kafkaesque months or years in prison
without ever committing a crime. Their futures were decided not by
legal principle but by luck, and American presidential candidates
this election season have denounced the arbitrary and often brutal
nature of the Chinese system.
</P>
<P>
   After my years abroad, I returned to the United States and spent
the last few months of 1999 writing a book in my hometown in
Yamhill County, Ore., a place as bedrock America as can be, a place
that I revere as God's Country and that is the antipodes of China.
Except, it turns out, for the jails that house immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   I was pressed into service by county officials as an interpreter
for a half-dozen Chinese immigrants who were languishing in jail,
awaiting the outcome of their asylum applications. They are among
the 17,000 foreigners held by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in prisons and jails around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later I walked through a series of clanging
steel doors into the women's section of the Yamhill County jail.
Among the mostly American prisoners, five Chinese women stood out
as they walked in a circle around the room, trying to get some
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   For months _ in some cases nearly a year _ they had been stuck
in jail, not knowing the status of their cases or what would happen
to them, not able to ask questions or seek help. According to
inmates and jail officials, when two of the Chinese women were
ordered to switch bunks and did not understand, guards knocked them
to the ground and handcuffed them, bloodying one. Those two women's
fear, humiliation and wretchedness increased when they were placed
on a punishment regimen for the next four weeks, effectively
penalizing them for not understanding English.
</P>
<P>
   When the women heard me speak their language, when they were
finally able to explain their nightmare, they began to cry. They
told how they had come from various villages in Fujian province,
the area on the coast that is home to many of the Chinese who come
to America. Two were teenage sisters, and the rest were in their
20s. They were smart, enterprising and brave, as one would expect
of young people who had mortgaged their possessions and taken
considerable risks to forge a new life in a land whose language and
customs they could not understand.
</P>
<P>
   All had arrived at Portland International Airport and requested
asylum. Instead of finding freedom, they were hustled into
different jails. Although they had broken no law, they were often
treated worse than criminals, who were at least allowed the use of
the exercise yard each day. The Chinese were never allowed outside.
Supporters in groups like Amnesty International initially were not
permitted to give them materials in Chinese, although that was
reversed after a county commissioner intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The only stroke of luck these women had was that Jim Bunn, a
Republican, lost his re-election bid for Congress and ended up
working as a humble jail guard. He took an interest in them, bought
Chinese-English dictionaries so that they could communicate and
became their guardian angel. ``I just kept thinking, `What if I
were in China and in jail?''' he said. ``So I wanted to see if I
could make things a bit easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS is often criticized for the way it treats foreigners,
sometimes denying them the dignity and safeguards Americans demand
when they are jailed overseas. But while the Chinese women had
terrible things to say about the INS, they said they were also
mistreated by the guards, who looked down on them because they were
foreigners and could not communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the women's fundamental concern was not so much their
daily treatment as the way they had been locked up without the
right to make their case effectively or without any knowledge of
what was happening to them.
</P>
<P>
   The well-meaning jail officials for whom I was interpreting
asked specific questions about what the Chinese wanted, such as
their preferred meal for Christmas. The women shrugged, conferred
and decided. ``We'd like rice,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   What these women cared about most was not better food, outside
exercise or even English lessons, they said, but some insight into
how their fate would be resolved. ``We can get by whatever you feed
us,'' one woman said fervently. ``Just tell us, does anybody know
about us? Or have we been forgotten?''
</P>
<P>
   Because the women had met only briefly with interpreters, poor
ones at that, they said they felt they had been unable to recount
their histories thoroughly. Most of them believed they had been
lost in a bureaucratic INS limbo rather like the Chinese criminal
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe they are right.
</P>
<P>
   Under INS rules, some of them will be granted asylum and end up
U.S. citizens, and the others will spend a year or more in jail and
be deported. The children of the former may end up American Ph.D.s,
and the children of the latter will probably end up as Chinese
factory workers. The difference between the two groups is largely
whim and luck.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to anyone who talks to Chinese peasants in places
like Fujian why they come to America: for the same reason my
ancestors did, to live a better life. Most Chinese, however, are
smart enough to insist that they are fleeing China's restrictive
birth policy. A federal law provides that as many as 1,000 people
yearly can gain asylum to avoid persecution on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees may be telling the truth when they say they
have violated the policy and face forced sterilization or fines,
but there is no way of verifying their stories. The upshot is that
immigration judges tend to reward the best-coached, smoothest liars
rather than the most deserving applicants.
</P>
<P>
   I put the women in touch with people at Linfield College in
nearby McMinnville, and the few Chinese living in the area. Life
began to look up for them as they got English lessons, Chinese
Bibles and magazines, as well as arrangements to call relatives in
China. Then in December, the INS abruptly took the women away in
the middle of the night to other jails, scattering them and telling
no one where they had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women wrote her English teacher, saying her new
jailers in The Dalles, Ore., had taken away her Chinese-English
Bible, which also helped in her study of English. She also said she
is given two envelopes each week, each with 33 cents postage, but
could not combine them to get a single envelope with the 60-cents
postage needed to write her family in China. ``This is not good
place to been,'' she wrote in her newly acquired English. ``I'm sad
and scared and broken heart. Why they did it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Some who made friends with these women thought immigration
officials deliberately moved them so they would no longer have any
local supporters to monitor their treatment. If that were true,
then it mimicked the times in China when I tried to help people and
ended up getting them in trouble with their government.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Bill Strassberger, an amiable INS spokesman, about all
this, and he said the agency would not have moved them to isolate
them. The agency tried to remind local jails that these immigrants
are not criminals and should be treated with dignity. ``I'll be
honest with you,'' he said. ``We haven't been totally successful in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I have moved on, to New York, and I doubt I will see any of
these women again. Those who are released and become Americans will
eventually see a warmer side of America, but I wonder about those
who are sent back to China. What will they say about human rights
in this country?
</P>
<P>
   I realize that these women and others like them are
fundamentally economic immigrants who in most cases have lied about
the reasons they came. Perhaps they should be sent back. Yet I have
hectored so many Chinese officials about the importance of a
justice system that treats people with compassion that I still feel
deeply let down by the fate of these women, especially in a place
in the heartland whose essential goodness I cannot question.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice if Americans could have adhered to the
standards to which they hold China.

COMMENTARY: MASTER OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Bill Gates is stepping down _ or up, or sideways, or
something _ from his position as CEO of Microsoft. Nobody seems to
think that this will make much difference either to the way
Microsoft is run or to the desire of the Justice Department to
break up the world's most valuable company and humble its founder.
But maybe the announcement provides a good occasion to reflect on
the achievements of this elder statesman (44 years old!) of the New
Economy.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that Gates is to business strategy what Heinz
Guderian, the father of the blitzkrieg, was to military strategy.
Germany didn't invent the tank or the bomber; but the German
command understood, in a way that the British or the French did
not, how these inventions changed the nature of war, and very
nearly ended up conquering the world. Microsoft didn't invent
either the personal computer or the point-and-click interface; but
Gates understood, in a way that other contenders for empire did
not, how these inventions changed the nature of business
competition, and some think that he has come equally close to
global conquest.
</P>
<P>
   You could say that each of the two other companies one might
have expected to dominate the New Economy was the victim of a
flawed philosophical premise. IBM's fallacy was that of crude
materialism: accustomed to providing software free with its
mainframes, the computer giant believed that market power rested in
the hands of manufacturers, and did not realize its mistake until
far too late. Apple, by contrast, suffered from naive idealism: its
managers believed that having the better idea, the better product,
was in itself enough to ensure victory in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Only Gates seems to have realized the importance, in this new
competitive realm, of ``network externalities,'' which is economese
for the incentive most of us have to use the same software _ or
video format, or typewriter keyboard _ that everyone else uses.
It's not a new concept, and around the time Gates was starting to
build his empire economists were working out a theory of how
companies should conduct themselves when network externalities are
crucial. (Perhaps the leader among these theorists was Berkeley's
Carl Shapiro; not coincidentally, Shapiro took a leave in the
mid-'90s to become a top official at the Justice Department's
antitrust division.) The essence of that theory is that you have to
lose money to make money: your product must initially be sold
cheaply, even given away, until enough people are using it that the
rest feel that they have no alternative.
</P>
<P>
   This seems obvious now, but in the 1980s Apple thought that
simply because the Macintosh was insanely great it could be sold at
a premium price from day one. It was Gates who understood the power
of ubiquity, and used that knowledge to build an unassailable
market position. ``Windows 95 is Macintosh 89,'' declared the
losers bitterly when the struggle was all over. They were right,
but that in itself tells you how much better Gates played the game.
</P>
<P>
   Did Microsoft overplay its hand? Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
thinks so, and though many independent economists think that his
``findings of fact'' were rather one-sided _ Nicholas Economides of
New York University, whose Web site on network externalities is
much admired among aficionados, describes the judge's report as
``unusually harsh'' _ there is a reasonable chance that in the end
Microsoft will be broken up into an applications company and one or
two operating systems companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that will not be the end of the story, because Microsoft is
unique only in the scale of its success. Monopoly is inherent in
the logic of network externalities: the normal life cycle of new
industries will be one in which an initial field of competitors is
brutally winnowed until only one major player remains.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, investors are counting on this process: since everyone
now knows that you have to lose money to make money, and acts on
that knowledge, only the eventual prospect of big monopoly profits
can justify the prices now being paid for money-losing tech stocks.
When does the legitimate attempt to capitalize on victory in a
competitive race become an illegal abuse of market power? So far,
nobody has laid down the ground rules.
</P>
<P>
   So don't cry for Bill Gates, America. The truth is, he isn't
leaving us _ and even when he does, there will still be plenty of
other Bills to pay.

 UNDATED: that basis.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the refugees may be telling the truth when they say they
have violated the policy and face forced sterilization or fines,
but there is no way of verifying their stories. The upshot is that
immigration judges tend to reward the best-coached, smoothest liars
rather than the most deserving applicants.
</P>
<P>
   I put the women in touch with people at Linfield College in
nearby McMinnville, and the few Chinese living in the area. Life
began to look up for them as they got English lessons, Chinese
Bibles and magazines, as well as arrangements to call relatives in
China. Then in December, the INS abruptly took the women away in
the middle of the night to other jails, scattering them and telling
no one where they had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women wrote her English teacher, saying her new
jailers in The Dalles, Ore., had taken away her Chinese-English
Bible, which also helped in her study of English. She also said she
is given two envelopes each week, each with 33 cents postage, but
could not combine them to get a single envelope with the 60-cents
postage needed to write her family in China. ``This is not good
place to been,'' she wrote in her newly acquired English. ``I'm sad
and scared and broken heart. Why they did it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Some who made friends with these women thought immigration
officials deliberately moved them so they would no longer have any
local supporters to monitor their treatment. If that were true,
then it mimicked the times in China when I tried to help people and
ended up getting them in trouble with their government.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Bill Strassberger, an amiable INS spokesman, about all
this, and he said the agency would not have moved them to isolate
them. The agency tried to remind local jails that these immigrants
are not criminals and should be treated with dignity. ``I'll be
honest with you,'' he said. ``We haven't been totally successful in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I have moved on, to New York, and I doubt I will see any of
these women again. Those who are released and become Americans will
eventually see a warmer side of America, but I wonder about those
who are sent back to China. What will they say about human rights
in this country?
</P>
<P>
   I realize that these women and others like them are
fundamentally economic immigrants who in most cases have lied about
the reasons they came. Perhaps they should be sent back. Yet I have
hectored so many Chinese officials about the importance of a
justice system that treats people with compassion that I still feel
deeply let down by the fate of these women, especially in a place
in the heartland whose essential goodness I cannot question.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice if Americans could have adhered to the
standards to which they hold China.

   MINORITY-ANGELS (Los Angeles) -- The success or failure of the
new CBS drama ``City of Angels,'' will help guide the future of
similar minority themed programming, a prospect that its writer and
producer do not relish. The show, with Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center in its opening shots, is about a struggling
inner-city hospital, and is an effort by CBS to include more
minority actors and themes in its programming. The NAACP and other
minority groups say if it fails, it might sour network executives
on the idea, and a similar chance for such a high-profile minority
show might not come for years. By Steve Carney (Will move on the

   SETTLE-COSTS (Los Angeles) -- It started out as a routine Los
Angeles police drug raid on a house in South Central on a warm
spring night in April 1997. It became a horrible case of one
mistake after another when it turned out officers raided the wrong
home. And while none of the nine people in and around the house
suffered severe injuries after police stormed in, it ended up
costing the city $851,000. The case involving Climon Hawkins has
come to take on a deeper meaning for city officials who report
judgments and settlements already are headed for a record this
financial year, which began July 1. Officials call it the Rampart
syndrome higher payouts by the city because of the mushrooming
scandal centered at the LAPD Rampart Division's anti-gang unit. By

`RAMPART SYNDROME' FUELS HIGH-PRICED LIABILITY CASES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Rick Orlov  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- Barely halfway through the financial
year, the city of Los Angeles faces a record for payouts of
liability claims. And it's likely to get worse -- a lot worse -- in
the next 18 months thanks to ``Rampart syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the name officials have attached to the coming blizzard
of claims growing directly out of the mushrooming scandal centered
on the LAPD Rampart Division's anti-gang unit and the fallout from
the scandal that already has juries skewering the city in unrelated
police misconduct cases.
</P>
<P>
   With a $19 million settlement last week of a traffic collision
claim against a city employee, Los Angeles has paid out about $48
million since July 1 in liability cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's just $4 million short of last year's total and $11
million short of the record in 1995-96 -- and it leaves just $5
million in the budget for judgments and settlements for the next 5
months.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, a city attorney candidate and chairman of
the City Council's Budget and Finance Committee, which reviews all
legal settlements, said the LAPD's tainted reputation is making it
easy for plaintiffs' attorneys to cast the city in the worst
possible light before juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already seeing the impact in criminal cases where
juries don't trust the testimony of police officers, and ... civil
cases which should be settled for a nominal amount are going to
trial,'' Feuer said. ``We will suffer the lingering impacts of this
for months to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual impact of the Rampart scandal, in which officers
allegedly framed suspects, offered perjured testimony and committed
other crimes, will keep the city's liability costs high well into
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even begun to see the direct Rampart cases,'' said
City Attorney James Hahn, a candidate for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably won't be until next year, and I will be
recommending we handle them aggressively and quickly -- not only
from a fiscally responsible point of view, but from one of being
just. We had people who suffered permanent injuries and were
jailed, and they deserve compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials cite the case of Climon Hawkins as clearly traceable
to Rampart syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   It started out as a routine Los Angeles police drug raid on a
house in South Central on a warm spring night in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it became a horrible case of one mistake after another when
it turned out officers raided the wrong home. And while none of the
nine people in and around the house suffered severe injuries after
police stormed in, it ended up costing the city $851,000.
</P>
<P>
   It could have cost a lot less but the City Council, ignoring the
potential for juries to punish the city over the Rampart scandal,
rejected an offer to settle the case for $375,000. The council
offered $150,000, which was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we made a mistake, but the jury award is way out of
line,'' Deputy City Attorney Ted Smith said. ``The total of the
medical bills was $26,000. It all happened quickly, a matter of
seconds, before officers realized they were in the wrong house.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no dispute over some of the basic facts.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 p.m., a team of narcotics officers from South Bureau,
armed with a search warrant, went to Hawkins' home in the 4400
block of S. Orchard Street, several weeks after an officer made a
drug buy in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But with mistaken photos taken from a helicopter, police had the
wrong house and should have been at one down the street.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the stories diverge.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said officers used standard procedures in securing the
home, ordering those in it to get on the ground and handcuffing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been more than a couple of seconds before
they realized there was a mistake and they let everyone go,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul De Montesquiou, the attorney for Hawkins and the eight
others involved in the incident, called it a case of brutality and
a violation of civil rights in which Hawkins and others were beaten
by police.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Hawkins had medical bills of $5,313. The jury awarded
him that and $200,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, they wanted to punish the LAPD for being the LAPD,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith takes it a step further, saying, ``There's no question
this is a Rampart syndrome.'' During the trial nine major news
stories were published about Rampart. There were three on the
weekend before the jury began deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has asked for a new trial, based partly on one of the
jurors coming forward and talking about how the jury was influenced
by the Rampart situation. De Montesquiou disputes Smith's
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a strong case and a conservative jury,'' De Montesquiou
said. ``This was more than a mistake. It was assault and battery. I
don't think Rampart influenced them at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkins case was particularly disturbing to Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very disappointed with that,'' Hahn said. ``We've
asked for a new trial in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Hahn and his top aides worry the impact of the Rampart case will
last for at least a year, based on the department's experience
following the Rodney King case -- or longer depending on how much
public attention focuses on Rampart and whether any new disclosures
come out.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan is closely monitoring the payouts and
recognizes the impact of the Rampart scandal, Deputy Mayor Kelly
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those things that you have to take into
consideration in preparing the budget,'' Martin said. ``But we
think the city is doing all it can in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The city this year has budgeted some $53 million to cover its
liability claims. Liability claims cost $52 million in 1998-99 and
$42 million in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Claims vary sharply from year to year, peaking at $59 million in
1995-96 and falling to $35 million the following year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of this fiscal year, claims are already
in excess of $29 million.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, the council approved a record $19 million
settlement with a Florida woman who suffered crippling injuries
when a city truck careened across the Hollywood Freeway and smashed
into her car.
</P>
<P>
   The city worker involved, who said he fell asleep at the wheel,
pleaded guilty last year to overloading the vehicle and was fined
$200 and placed on three years' probation. He still works for the
city but is no longer driving any vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term escalation in claims against the city finally
prompted Hahn last year to create a special team of lawyers working
solely with the LAPD, the city's largest department and the one
that draws the most lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But many feel -- even in the face of Rampart syndrome -- that
the city settled far too many cases in the past and must fight in
court to convince juries of the city's position whenever the facts
warrant it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends an important message to police officers that we will
defend them and another message to the public that we are just not
settling cases,'' Feuer said.
</P>

HOPE RIDING ON BACK OF `ANGELS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Steve Carney  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES, Calif., -- When ``City of Angels'' premieres
SUNDAY, the hospital drama with the mainly African-American cast
will carry with it the future of other multicultural programs,
minority groups say.
</P>
<P>
   But its creators insist they're just trying to make good
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make it out like it's some kind of trailblazing Jackie
Robinson of television,'' said Paris Barclay, an African-American
and one of the show's creators.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its genesis predates the controversy, ``City of
Angels'' has landed on the TV landscape amid charges from minority
groups that this season's television offerings feature an
unprecedented lack of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some see the show as not just another Steven
Bochco drama, whose cast happens to be African-American. To them
``City of Angels'' is a saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a high-stakes kind of thing,'' said Alicia
Maldonado, spokeswoman for MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's successful, it can mean other things for other
groups,'' Maldonado said. But if it fails, it might sour network
executives on the idea, and a similar chance for such a
high-profile minority show might not come for years.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco, creator of ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``NYPD Blue''
and ``L.A. Law,'' asked Barclay two years ago about doing a medical
drama with a mostly minority cast. Barclay has won two Emmy awards
for directing ``NYPD Blue'' episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to do a black drama for a long time,'' Bochco
said. ``There's such an extraordinary talent pool to draw from, and
it's been under-utilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope we don't get buried under the burden of our
own historical significance,'' he said. ``I hope we get the same
chance as any promising new show, and find its audience and
succeed. You hope you succeed or fail on your merits.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``City of Angels'' cast includes Bochco veterans Blair
Underwood (``L.A. Law'') and Michael Warren (``Hill Street Blues'')
as well as Vivica A. Fox (``Independence Day'' and the Fox series
``Getting Personal''.) In addition, more than half of the writing
staff and crew are minorities or women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this to be politically correct. I'm not doing
this to be Crusader Rabbit. I'm doing this,'' Bochco said,
``because I want to. I'm passionate about it. I have a creative
commitment, not a political commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   And the show should make good business sense, as well, Barclay
said.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have other minority shows in the pipeline, he said,
and even if ``Angels'' doesn't survive, the networks should be
interested in catering to viewers of color. After all, census
officials say that by 2050 no racial group will make up more than
50 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly why minority groups want to know why TV
doesn't reflect the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When the four major television networks announced their new Fall
shows last May, not a single one had a minority in a leading role.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
threatened boycotts, but starting earlier this month the networks
began agreeing to add minority actors, writers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   For the NAACP, ``Angels'' carries much weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things should be a long way behind us,'' said
Frank L. Berry, director of the NAACP's nine-state Western Region.
``In any case it's an important step, and we certainly want to be
in a position to work with those who want to produce the best
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco said dramas with predominantly African-American casts
have failed in the past because they were too tightly focused on
the experience of being African-American. He said he wanted to make
a show with a broader melodramatic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``An inner-city hospital is a very legitimate environment to
populate with a significantly African-American cast,'' Bochco said.
And the setting allows for universal tales dealing with issues of
death and life.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the show won't deal with race, he said. For
example, two medical students -- one white and the other
African-American -- are continually squabbling over perceived
favoritism for one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   One viewer said the show's realism alone should draw fans. Dr.
Clarence Sutton Jr., a trauma surgeon at Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center in Mission Hills, trained and is now on the faculty
at L.A. County/King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, between
Watts and Compton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying there aren't enough black shows on.
I think this is going to be a shining star,'' said Sutton, who
operated on the most seriously wounded child from the Jewish
Community Center shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very true-to-life. For sure, people in the medical
profession are going to appreciate it,'' he said. ``I'd be
interested in watching this myself. I can relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay, invoking Martin Luther King Jr., said he hopes viewers
judge the show by its content and characters, not the color of
their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people like Bochco dramas,'' with their complex characters,
and quirky, compelling story lines, Barclay said, ``they'll
probably like this show.''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong drama with the predominantly black cast will debut
at 8 p.m. SUNDAY, JAN. 16, and will begin appearing in its regular
time slot Wednesday at 8 p.m.

<P>
   ``An inner-city hospital is a very legitimate environment to
populate with a significantly African-American cast,'' Bochco said.
And the setting allows for universal tales dealing with issues of
death and life.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the show won't deal with race, he said. For
example, two medical students -- one white and the other
African-American -- are continually squabbling over perceived
favoritism for one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   One viewer said the show's realism alone should draw fans. Dr.
Clarence Sutton Jr., a trauma surgeon at Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center in Mission Hills, trained and is now on the faculty
at L.A. County/King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, between
Watts and Compton.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying there aren't enough black shows on.
I think this is going to be a shining star,'' said Sutton, who
operated on the most seriously wounded child from the Jewish
Community Center shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very true-to-life. For sure, people in the medical
profession are going to appreciate it,'' he said. ``I'd be
interested in watching this myself. I can relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay, invoking Martin Luther King Jr., said he hopes viewers
judge the show by its content and characters, not the color of
their skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people like Bochco dramas,'' with their complex characters,
and quirky, compelling story lines, Barclay said, ``they'll
probably like this show.''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong drama with the predominantly black cast will debut
at 8 p.m. SUNDAY, JAN. 16, and will begin appearing in its regular
time slot Wednesday at 8 p.m.

   Flu Hurts Worse Than the Shot
</P>
<P>
   The flu is battering the nation, filling hospitals and doctors'
offices. Patients, many of them elderly, crowd emergency rooms,
shivering with fever.
</P>
<P>
   Many have only themselves to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rita Charon, an internal medicine specialist at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, said she is
getting so tired of arguing with older people who do not want a flu
shot that she is tempted to forget informed consent and jab them
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is the only way to protect against the misery of
influenza. For some, it can be a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   Flu kills 20,000 Americans a year; most are very old or have
other debilitating illnesses. But even though the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control reports that this year's vaccine is right on
target, most Americans, as usual, are shunning the shots.
</P>
<P>
   People who got the shot and say they got the flu anyway most
likely got another respiratory virus, experts say. Or they were
infected before they built up immunity _ it takes about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that flu season is in full swing, how can people protect
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin Kilbourne, a flu expert at the New York Medical
College in Valhalla, says he has one constant refrain:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a flu shot. It's not too late.''

<P>
   Is the paragraph you are now reading really on the page? Or was
it digitally implanted on your glasses when you weren't looking?
</P>
<P>
   Look out the window. Was that really a Pepsi truck passing by,
or did Pepsi cut a deal with the company that installed the
windows?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's so hard living in the Digital Age, because you just
never know.
</P>
<P>
   These existential musings were prompted by word that CBS News
has been dropping logos into various programs, including a a CBS
billboard looming behind Dan Rather in Times Square on New Year's
Eve _ magically replacing the NBC sign that was actually there.
</P>
<P>
   Is this ethical? It was ``a mistake,'' Rather said. ``There is
no excuse for it.'' But Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News,
defended such fakery, saying its use on ``The Early Show'' was
``whimsical and creative.'' As for the Times Square
sleight-of-mouse, he called it an ``extension of our graphics, a
change in this very festive, in effect, set.''

   States' Rights Upheld at the Supreme Court  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress might be forgiven for assuming that it was protecting
state employees against job discrimination on the basis of age when
it extended the federal age discrimination law to states in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That was two decades before a new Supreme Court majority would
start seeing federal-state relations in a new light and tilting the
balance in favor of the states.
</P>
<P>
   So it should have been no great surprise when the court ruled,
by a vote of 5-4, that states are immune from suit under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. State workers have remedies under
state laws, which are typically weaker.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not all bad news for the federal government. The
court unanimously upheld the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, which
bars states from selling personal information contained in motor
vehicle records. South Carolina and other states, which have made
millions by selling the information to direct marketers and others,
had argued that the prohibition infringed on their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a busy week, the justices were unanimous in ruling
that unprovoked flight at the sight of a police officer can, in
context, be suspicious enough to justify a stop-and-frisk search.

</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years after founding what became the world's most
powerful software company, Bill Gates stepped down as chief

will continue as the company's chairman and chief software
strategist. Nobody is expecting a kinder, gentler Microsoft.

   The White House has been getting an advance peek at some of the
scripts of the major networks' most popular television shows, from
``ER'' to ``Chicago Hope,'' and pushing anti-drug messages in the
plots. Networks participate willingly because approval from the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy permits them to
offer less of their valuable air time for public service
announcements. But the deal raised questions about government
interference in the creative process.

the Seattle incident marks the first known deaths.

   MONUMENTS-LEGACY-REVIEW (Seattle) _ At the Grand Canyon,
President Clinton has used the power of his office to establish a
personal legacy by designating three new national monuments and
expanding a fourth. There is very little that even an unimpeached
president facing a hostile Congress can do to affect domestic
events in his last months in office. One major exception is the
environment. By Timothy Egan.

   FOOTBALL-MATH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Watching a football game could
inflict serious mathematical damage on children. It could even
affect their ability to score well on college boards. The problem
comes from the intersection of a mathematical principle known as
`expected value' and a play known as the two-point conversion. By
David Leonhardt. (also moved in the `s' category as

   SPY-SATELLITES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The spy-satellite business,
for decades a secretive monopoly of advanced nations, is trying to

security and privacy: In theory, nosy neighbors can now peer over
tall fences. By William J. Broad.

   RUSSIA-ARMY-REVIEW (Undated) _ For U.S. and European government
and military officials, the second Chechen war has revealed more
about Russian strengths and weaknesses than any spy satellite ever
could. The insights are reassuring. The mighty army that many once
feared could roll across northern Europe cannot even contain an
insurgency within Russia's own borders. By Steven Lee Myers.

   GERMANY-CORRUPTION-REVIEW (Berlin) _ Germany's 1962 `Spiegel
Affair' and 1983 `Flick Affair' were pivotal moments when the
post-war republic woke up first to its stifling constraints on
freedom and then to corruption at its heart. But perhaps there has

   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Relations between India and
Pakistan are at their worst in decades. Things weren't supposed to
be this way in a subcontinent protected by the threat of
Armageddon. But rather than make the region safer and calmer, many
experts agree that India and Pakistan's open possession of nuclear
weapons appears to have raised the risk of limited wars that could
spiral out of control. By Celia Dugger and Barry Bearak. (Moved in

<P>
   CAMPAIGN-ECON-REVIEW (Council Bluffs, Iowa) _ America may be
racing into a new global economy, but the major presidential
candidates would rather talk about ethanol subsidies than the
Internet. For Republicans and Democrats alike, it's Old Economy
101, perhaps because times are so good, perhaps because the
politics of the New Economy are far too complex for a slogan. By
David E. Sanger. (Moved in `a' category)

   CAMPAIGN-INTERPERSONAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Publicly nice,
privately nasty, or vice versa: The usual, and usually forced,
civility between the presidential candidates breaks down
occasionally even in public. But behind the scenes, the surprise is
not that their interplay is so brutal _ it isn't _ but that their
relationships are so loaded, so complicated and, even in this
heavily scripted, highly goal-oriented environment, so personal. By
Melinda Henneberger.

   ISRAEL-GOLAN (Katzrin, Golan Heights) _ With the revival of the
Israeli-Syrian peace effort after a nearly four-year stalemate, the
Golan Heights has entered a state of flux. On the surface, the
apparatus of opposition to any Israeli concession of the Golan can
be seen revving its engine, as with a mass rally that the settlers
sponsored in Tel Aviv last Monday. But beneath the surface, a quiet
psychological and practical preparation has begun. By Deborah

   NUNS-RECRUIT (Hartsdale, N.Y.) _ It's the ultimate tough sell,
but the message is: Forget Madonna. Become a nun. The Sisters of
Mercy of the Americas are making the pitch with a vengeance, and
they are using all the tools of the modern age: test markets,
target audiences, catchy graphics and, new this month, a Web site.
The sisters have no choice. For more than three decades the number
of Catholic nuns in the United States has fallen like a stone, to
83,000 last year from 180,000 in 1965. Compounding the decline is
the aging of their population; the median age of American nuns is
68. By Lisa W. Foderaro.

SUPPORT OF BLACK VOTERS IS CRUCIAL FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., La., Miss., S.C., Tenn., Texas)  (lb) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Democratic presidential candidates finally
withdraw from Iowa and New Hampshire, where the electorate is
predominantly white, they will move quickly into Southern states
where black voters often play a decisive role.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, at least, Vice President Al Gore seems to
enjoy a commanding advantage with African-American voters, despite
former Sen. Bill Bradley's passionate commitment to the cause of
improving race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls, lists of endorsements and interviews with
dozens of Democratic strategists and black political leaders all
suggest that Gore holds a distinct early lead over Bradley among
black voters in states like Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those states all vote in the first two weeks of March, shortly
after the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 and the New Hampshire primary on
Feb. 1. And in each of those places, political history suggests
that black voters could make up a significant share of the
electorate, particularly in states where competitive Republican
primaries may drain white voters from the Democratic contests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who will deliver remarks at the annual Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday commemoration at the Ebenezer Baptist Church here on
Monday, is counting on black voters in the South to provide a fire
wall of protection against the possibility of an early loss in New
Hampshire, where some recent polls show Bradley with a narrow lead.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters will also be important in the New York primary on
March 7 and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the California voting
the same day. Those two primaries award the most Democratic
delegates, and Bradley may prove more competitive with black voters
in those states, where he is better known and will have an enormous
incentive to spend time and resources, Democratic strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democratic candidates have strong _ and largely similar _
positions on issues that tend to appeal to black voters, whether
generic concerns like education, health care, crime and economic
growth, or narrower topics like affirmative action and racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   And both use deeply personal anecdotes to connect with black
voters: Bradley describes the discrimination he witnessed against
black teammates with the New York Knicks, and Gore recalls how his
father took him to see slave rings in the basement of a mansion in
their Tennessee town.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Bradley has been more direct than Gore in using his
candidacy to call for a war on poverty, which disproportionately
afflicts black Americans, and to appeal for racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm president, I want one thing to be known,'' Bradley said
in a poignant speech about race that he delivered in New York last
April. ``If you want to please the boss, one of the things you'd
better show is how in your department or agency you've furthered
tolerance and racial understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the pursuit of black votes, Gore holds a card that seems
to trump Bradley's oratorical outreach: the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's ties to President Clinton have hurt him with some
voters, they are an enormous asset among blacks. For seven years,
Gore has played loyal lieutenant to a president who remains
immensely popular with black Americans, and he has used his office
to champion causes, bestow access, deliver federal aid and raise
political funds for black officials across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those leaders are now rewarding Gore's efforts, often
emphasizing that they hold nothing against Bradley but have little
reason to look beyond the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In interview after interview last week, black political leaders
explained their support for Gore by citing the Clinton
administration's appointment of black officials, its economic
successes and its support for cities and affirmative action. A CBS
News poll taken last month showed that 88 percent of
African-Americans approved of Clinton, compared with 51 percent of
whites. ``Look, Bill Bradley is a fine fellow and he has a good
record,'' said Bill Campbell, the two-term mayor of Atlanta, who is
black and is a longtime backer of Gore. ``But I don't understand
how anyone would imagine that black voters would desert a vice
president who has been so remarkably supportive of the
African-American community. When a constituency is appreciated and
respected and assisted on critical issues, that ought to count for
something, and it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, a black Democrat who supports Gore,
echoed Campbell's remarks. ``There's a loyalty to Gore that Senator
Bradley cannot shake,'' Lewis said. ``It's just impossible. There's
a hold there and he cannot pull it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Campbell are far from alone. Gore has been endorsed by
29 of the 38 black Democrats in Congress, while Bradley has yet to
be endorsed by any. In addition to Campbell, Gore has the backing
of the black mayors of Cleveland; Houston; Jackson, Miss.; Macon,
Ga.; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Newark, N.J.; New Orleans;
Savannah, Ga.; St. Louis and Washington. He also has the support of
a number of influential black state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Because presidential primaries typically draw a low turnout, and
are usually dominated by party activists, such endorsements can be
critical if elected officials mobilize their political machinery on
behalf of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some Gore organizers in the South, and even some unaligned party
leaders, predict that blacks could make up 35 percent to 40 percent
of the Democratic primary electorate in states like Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. Gore, himself a
Southerner, should win the overwhelming majority of those votes,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say if the election were held today, clearly Gore would
get 80 percent'' of the black vote in Louisiana, said Ben Jeffers,
an African-American who is that state's Democratic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Bill Clinton captured huge majorities of the black vote
in Democratic primaries in key states, winning at least 70 percent
in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, according to
surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was key in terms of Clinton's strategy, and it's one of
the reasons why I really don't think, unless Gore has some kind of
meltdown, that Bill Bradley has any chance of beating Al Gore,''
said David Bositis, an expert on black voting trends with the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies. Three recent national
polls all showed that blacks favored Gore over Bradley by margins
of between two and three to one.

</P>
<P>
   Bradley's list of notable African-American supporters features
only a smattering of local elected officials, including three state
assemblymen from New York City and the minority leader of the Ohio
state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent names belong to Bradley's former colleagues
in the National Basketball Association, like Julius Erving and
Willis Reed; entertainment figures, like the film director Spike
Lee and the actor Lawrence Fishburne; and academics like Cornel
West of Harvard and the historian Roger Wilkins of George Mason
University, who is misidentified in a Bradley campaign release as a
law professor at George Washington University. They are men with
fans, but not with political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign has made it transparent that its insurgent
strategy depends on breakthrough victories in northeastern states
like New Hampshire and New York that aides believe will catapult
him with tornadic velocity into a newly reordered political
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, the campaign reasons, black voters,
like all voters, will be compelled to give Bradley a fresh look.
Bradley aides acknowledge that the task will not be easy, and that
they will have little time to gain traction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black community votes in such a unified fashion that it
has become a tradition that we stick together,'' said Jacques
DeGraff, a black Baptist minister who serves as senior adviser to
the Bradley campaign. ``Traditionally, we deliver 80 percent to the
candidates we get behind. So it takes a great deal of activity to
begin the shift. At first it will be imperceptible. Then it will be
a trickle. And then I believe it will be a flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sheriff Nat Glover of Duval County, Fla., a black
Bradley supporter, said that Bradley would be able to sell himself
to black voters once he had a chance to make contact. Glover, who
only met Bradley four months ago, said he was impressed at how
Bradley's experience as a teammate and roommate of black basketball
players seemed to have shaped his racial sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Glover also said he knew of no other black elected officials
in Florida who were supporting Bradley. ``I've been in the company
of individuals who are certainly considering supporting Bill,''
said Glover, whose county includes Jacksonville. ``I haven't
noticed a ground swell, but I have noticed quite a bit of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   As the race has tightened, Gore has found countless ways to send
messages to black voters. He campaigned in November at the Memphis
church where King spoke the night before he was killed. Last month
he staged an ``African-Americans for Gore'' rally in Atlanta,
declaring, ``Anyone who says affirmative action is no longer
needed, because we've reached the promised land, has confused
wilderness with Canaan.''
</P>
<P>
   He regularly recalls the civil rights legacy of his father, Sen.
Al Gore Sr., while neglecting to mention that the elder Gore voted
against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a year when he faced
re-election in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president hired a black woman, Donna Brazile, as his
campaign manager and took an unusual trip to the United Nations
last week to call for help for African countries ravaged by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Brazile suggested in a recent interview that the
Republican Party used black partisans like Gen. Colin Powell and
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. as window dressing, Gore soothed Powell with a
phone call but was careful to neither criticize his aide nor
dispute her point.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore has repeatedly warned that Bradley's proposal
for expanding access to health care would disproportionately harm
minorities because it would replace Medicaid, the state and federal
health program for the poor, with a system of federal subsidies
that Gore maintains would be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has dismissed those assertions as scare tactics and he
characterized them in a recent debate as the most offensive charges
made by Gore in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Lester, a Democratic pollster who is not working for either
candidate, said polls he had conducted in Chicago, Miami, Atlanta
and North Carolina showed that Bradley had picked up support among
white Democrats but had not gained on Gore with black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for blacks to take a second look at Bradley, not only
would he have to have momentum but he would have to blow Gore out
in the early states,'' Lester said. ``As long as Gore is standing,
I don't see any compelling evidence that black voters will leave
him.''

DON'T REMOVE OLD OPERATING SYSTEMS WHEN UPGRADING UNLESS PC IS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've got a 233-megahertz Pentium II computer, one of the
first ones, which came with Windows 95. I put Windows 98 on it, and
recently upgraded to Windows 98 SE. A friend said I should format
my hard drive and do a fresh install of Windows 98 SE, and that all
those old versions of the operating system are going to cause me
problems. I hate to go through that, but I want my computer to stay
trouble-free. Is he right?
</P>
<P>
   A: John Dvorak, the bellicose computer columnist who seems to
turn up in every Ziff-Davis publication available, has a theory
that operating systems undergo ``OS decay.'' Over time, they
collect digital detritus that wears down reliability and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's had the misfortune of having to reformat a hard
drive, then reinstall the Windows operating system, has found a
silver lining. The fresh installation does feel peppier.
</P>

   However, I'm not sure the problem is related to upgrades to the
operating system. When you install a new version of Windows, the
setup routine overwrites the old versions of key files with the
latest versions.
</P>
<P>
   (The one exception is the backup that Windows makes of the
previous installation. When you install a new version of the OS, it
rolls everything up into a big, compressed data file of about 100
megabytes. If you choose to uninstall the new version of the
operating system, Windows' setup just unpacks everything and
restores your drive to its previous state.)
</P>
<P>
   However, the installation routine will leave behind files that
may relate to the older version but aren't part of the operating
system itself. For example, those who upgrade from Windows 95 to
Windows 98 often have problems with their modems. That's because
the Windows 95 modem drivers are often quite different from the
Windows 98 versions. Downloading the latest drivers from the modem
manufacturer's Web site is the fix.
</P>
<P>
   You can suffer this sort of OS decay if you install and
uninstall different kinds of software, and if you change hardware
components frequently. For example, when you upgrade to a new video
card, chances are there are still some video drivers left on your
system. There may even be lines in the Windows Registry that try to
load them. My approach to doing a fresh installation is the old
saw, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' If your computer is
running well, leave it alone. If not, start backing things up and
get ready for a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I upgraded to Internet Explorer 5 and Outlook Express 5. Now,
I no longer have a spell checker in Outlook Express 5. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A: Microsoft got in trouble with the federal government for
tying one product to another when Internet Explorer became
integrated into Windows 98. Seems like the feds may have missed
another one ...
</P>
<P>
   In Outlook Express 5, you must have Microsoft Word 95, 97 or
2000 on your computer with its spell-checking feature installed
before you can check your spelling in the e-mail program. No Word,
no spell-check. This is spelled out in the help file that comes
with Outlook Express 5. Just do a search in the Help function for
``spelling.''

   HARTSDALE, N.Y. _ For young women in a culture saturated with
alluring images of riches and sensuality, it is an unlikely
advertising come-on. Turn your back on money and men, and spend
your life helping people who are sick, poor and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ultimate tough sell, but the message is: Forget the pop
star Madonna. Become a nun.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, one of the
nation's largest orders of Roman Catholic nuns, is making the pitch
with a vengeance, and it is using all the tools of the modern age:
test markets, target audiences, catchy graphics and, new this
month, a Web site. One recruitment poster that was sent last week
to college campuses shows a close-up of God's hand reaching out to
Adam's from Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam.'' Adam is holding a
cellular phone, and the text reads: ``Do you have a call waiting?''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have no choice. For more than three decades, the
number of Catholic nuns in the United States has fallen like a
stone, to 83,000 last year from 180,000 in 1965. Compounding the
decline is the aging of their population; the median age of
American nuns is 68. The result has been a draining of resources
from the many charities and institutions that the sisters helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a personnel crisis,'' said Professor Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. ``Sisters really did build the
American Catholic Church through their teaching in the parochial
school system and their staffing of Catholic hospitals. They have
been the backbone of the church in this century, and it's
absolutely critical to address the question of the next generation
and who will succeed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recruitment campaign, the New York, New Jersey and
Brooklyn chapters, or communities, of the Sisters of Mercy teamed
up to create the posters and brochures, which are aimed at women 21
to 35. ``If you appear old and nonvibrant, that becomes an obstacle
to anyone wanting to enter religious life,'' said Sister Patricia
Wolf, president of the New York community, adding that the images
showed a ``connection to the world and also to humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and sisters themselves point to a number of factors
responsible for the dwindling population of nuns, a decline far
more precipitous than the corresponding drop in the number of Roman
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   The women's movement and cultural revolution of the 1960s opened
up a world of new opportunities for women, from careers in law to
stints in the Peace Corps. Moreover, where it was not uncommon in
the 1950s and 1960s for Catholic women to join the ranks of nuns if
they were not yet engaged to be married by their college
graduation, in the 1970s and beyond it became more acceptable for
women to marry later in life. And given the booming economy of
recent years and a return to family values, taking vows of poverty
and chastity is, in some sense, a countercultural, even radical,
move.
</P>
<P>
   As laypeople steadily replace nuns on the staffs of Catholic
schools and social service agencies, young women are losing their
exposure to nuns and the more modern ways in which they live today
_ wearing street clothes, often residing in apartments and holding
down demanding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conundrum,'' said Appleby, ``is that as the number of
sisters falls and the ones who remain are drawn into leadership
positions, there is less opportunity for that personal contact that
was so effective earlier in the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious orders now are trying to turn the tide by
injecting some of that face-to-face contact. The Religious of the
Sacred Heart of Mary, an order with 1,100 members worldwide, is
taking advantage of its Hamptons real estate by holding ``Come and
See'' weekends several times a year at its retreat house in Sag
Harbor in eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to come and get to know us in an informal
setting,'' said Sister Mary Alice Young, director of development
for the order on the East Coast, based in Tarrytown. ``The sisters
talk about their own experience, and people can ask questions
without being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sisters of Mercy, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of
Mary last year created a Web site, and for the last two years the
community has run advertisements in Catholic newspapers. ``One of
the things you're constantly hearing is that the baby boomers and
generation X are totally separate entities, and you have to learn
to reach the generations differently,'' Sister Mary Alice said.
``It's speaking to a whole different world than the one I grew up
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, there are similar efforts. In Indiana, the
Sisters of Benedict assembled a lay committee of professionals with
experience in marketing and communications. The sisters now have a
toll-free number, a Web site and advertising. One ad beckons with
the cheeky line: ``You don't have to be perfect to be a nun. God
knows we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   And in California, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles
has made the recruitment of nuns and priests a high priority. Later
this month, the archdiocese will invite 150 to 250 people to its
annual ``7 to 11 Day.'' Starting at 7 a.m., the men and women trail
the priests and nuns as they go about their day. Later they are
treated to dinner with Cardinal Roger Mahony and a talent show.
Past acts have included comedy and line dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope among nuns that they can tap into this millennial
moment, when gift shops sell nothing but angels, and best-selling
books, rock songs and television shows unabashedly deal with issues
relating to religion, the soul and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably more than at any recent time, there is a
real quest today for spirituality,'' said Sister Patricia of the
Sisters of Mercy. ``The media gives evidence of that. You have
something like `Touched by an Angel' on television and other shows.
So an attraction to religious life is perhaps even more possible
than it has been at other times.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A sampling of reactions on two traditionally Catholic campuses
in Westchester County, however, found that for most students, the
idea of becoming a nun was just short of unthinkable. Jessica
Hogan, a senior at Iona College in New Rochelle, said: ``I never
considered it. It seems outdated and old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Delia, a 29-year-old graduate student at Mercy College
in Dobbs Ferry, who is from a ``very strong Catholic family,'' said
she had considered the profession as a girl. Ms. Delia's mother was
a nun for seven years before leaving, and both her aunt and cousin
are nuns. ``I've grown up around nuns, so I have a different
outlook than a lot of people,'' Ms. Delia said. ``You can be part
of a religious order and still be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she decided the religious life was not for her. The
recruitment posters might help, Ms. Delia said, but she believes
that the reason young women have shunned the sisterhood is the
diminishing power of the Catholic Church over their lives. ``The
problem is young people don't stay in the church,'' she said. ``You
have to have that belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a nun is a lengthy affair. At the Sisters of Mercy, an
international order with 5,700 members, first there are periodic
discussions between a prospective sister and a vocation director
for six months to a year. A formal application is then made to the
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted, the candidate lives with other sisters for two
years but retains her outside job and assets. For the next two
years she is a ``novice,'' giving up her job and pursuing spiritual
development. Then, just before taking her first vows, she disposes
of her assets and begins a ministry in keeping with the order's
mission. Three to five years later, she takes her final vows.
</P>
<P>
   The New York, New Jersey and Brooklyn regional communities of
the Sisters of Mercy are determined to increase the minority
representation among their members, who are overwhelmingly white.
One of the posters shows an African-American woman in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't reflect as a community the ethnic background of New
York City,'' Sister Patricia said in her spacious office on a
former estate here. ``Just walk around. We have a significant
amount of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Barbara Ann Catherine Gourdine, 40, is a relatively new _
and young _ member, having made her temporary vows two years ago.
She is also African-American, one of only two in the New York
community, which has 187 members. She actually joined the order at
21 but left in 1988. ``In leaving it gave me a chance to grow and
find out who I was as a person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to adjust to living with three women in a house
after years of living alone in an apartment, and she recently took
a job teaching in a Catholic school after 10 years in a public
school. ``It's not what I expected,'' she said, ``but I am happy.''
</P>
<P>
   With members from Staten Island to the Adirondacks, as well as
the Worcester, Mass., area (the result of a merger), the New York
community of the Sisters of Mercy is spread thin. The order
sponsors two high schools, three health-care centers and three
social-service agencies. There are pastoral duties and community
outreach, as well, but half the members are retired.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nuns resist the idea that they face extinction, and they
look to their history for solace. ``In some ways, you could say,
`Well, it's dying out and the last person should turn out the
lights,''' Sister Mary Alice said. ``But we were founded by only
six sisters 150 years ago. So what you need are committed women.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, there will always be those.

PRICE OF JOINING OLD AND NEW WAS CORE OF AOL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The journey to last week's announcement that America Online
would buy Time Warner in history's largest merger began last fall
and included secret meetings in New York and Boston and a key
dinner on Jan. 6 at the home of Stephen Case, the chairman of
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But the turning point for the deal came not at a dinner or a
power breakfast, but over the New Year's holiday in the solitude of
the small library of the Vermont vacation home of Gerald Levin, the
chairman of Time Warner. It was there, where Levin says he does his
best thinking, that the chairman of the world's largest media
company finally decided he would accept less than half ownership of
the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, to be sure, would contribute about 80 percent of
the revenues of the new company, thanks to the cash-producing might
of a media empire that spans Time and Sports Illustrated, Warner
Bros. and CNN. But it was America Online, with its Internet flash,
that was the hot stock on Wall Street, and thus worth far more than
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   So Levin accepted that the price of leaping into the Internet
era with America Online would be a high one. But there were limits,
too. In Vermont he came up with the make-or-break offer he would
propose at the dinner later that week at Case's home in suburban
northern Virginia: Time Warner shareholders would agree to own only
45 percent of the new company, while America Online shareholders
would get 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided then that if AOL would go along with that, we had a
deal,'' Levin recalled last Friday. ``If not, we were going to have
to go our separate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the America Online-Time Warner deal was put
together is the step-by-step account of two major companies _ a
front-runner in the New Economy and a leader of the Old Economy _
grappling with those issues of business strategy and pricing.
</P>
<P>
   In industry after industry, executives are being forced to
confront the same issue that Levin faced: at what pace and at what
price to enter the Internet economy. And for their part, as the
Internet moves into the mainstream, other Internet executives face
the core issue that Case did in this deal: Does it make sense to
buy into established industries even if it means slower growth and
a lower stock price?
</P>
<P>
   At times, America Online and Time Warner seemed far apart,
almost to the point of parting ways. But ``We kept on dribbling the
ball, even when it seemed that there was no air in it,'' observed
Kenneth Novack, America Online's chief negotiator on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the executive teams of both companies decided that
heading as one into uncharted territory was a gamble worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are right,'' said James Barksdale, an America Online
board member, ``this could be an awesome company, and one that
delivers long-term value for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   If they are right.
</P>
<P>
   Case took the first step in October with a telephone call to
Levin. The two men had spent time together the previous month at
executive gatherings _ first the Global Business Dialogue on
E-Commerce in Paris and then the Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai,
China, sponsored by Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   What made Levin most interesting to Case was the strategic
research that the senior management team had been conducting at
America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   With their company's stock price rising sharply last year, the
America Online management team looked anew at the possibilities for
those increasingly valuable shares _ a currency for forging
alliances and making acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   According to one team member, they focused on three types of
companies: cable television or telephone companies that might give
America Online assured access to their powerful high-speed
networks; Internet companies they might acquire; and media concerns
that they might team up with or buy outright.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner loomed in two of those fields, as a huge media
company and as the United States' second-largest cable network
operator. And Case got along well with Levin in Paris and Shanghai.
So he called Levin to describe a future in which the media and the
Internet seem increasingly likely to converge _ as the personal
computer, the television and the telephone become digital pathways
to new types of information and entertainment services.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motivation is to position this company to capitalize on the
era of convergence,'' Case explained in an interview. ``Time Warner
has powerful media brands, and I think people underestimate the
power of established media brands and the customer relationships
that those brands represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Case called Levin in October not simply to spin visions but also
to float a specific proposal. He said he was thinking of a 50-50
``merger of equals'' in which Levin would be the chief executive
officer, running the company, and Case would be chairman.
Intrigued, Levin suggested that the two meet soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 1 the two dined at the Rihga Royal Hotel in New York in
a private room, ``so no one would see us,'' Levin recalled. As they
sat down, Levin told Case he did not want to discuss the subject of
price yet, but instead wanted to focus on what he called the
``social issues'' _ whether the two of them had similar
perspectives on management and whether Case understood the need to
avoid letting business considerations crimp the independence of
Time Warner's thousands of magazine and broadcast journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Both men came away from that dinner satisfied that they should
take things to the next level. And so a pair of skilled corporate
Sherpas _ one representing each side _ started gearing up for the
climb to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   For America Online, the key negotiator was Novack, the
58-year-old vice chairman. He is a Boston lawyer who for years has
been a trusted elder adviser to Case, who is 41. On major matters,
as one senior manager put it, ``Ken Novack is the last guy Steve
talks to before he pulls the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's chief negotiator was Richard Bressler, 42, who
joined the company in 1988 from Ernst &AMP; Young, where he had become
one of the youngest partners in the history of the accounting and
management consulting firm. He quickly rose through the ranks to
become chief financial officer and, last summer, chairman of Time
Warner Digital Media _ a priority for Levin, 60, who in a recent
company memo described Bressler's mandate as the ``digital makeover
of all Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Nov. 16, Novack and a colleague, Miles Gilburne, met
in Bressler's 28th-floor office at Rockefeller Center. They wanted
to explore what the new services might be if the two companies
merged.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed how people receive information and entertainment,
or ``content,'' today (through magazines, television and
Internet-connected PCs) and how they might receive it in a couple
of years (digital cell phones, wireless hand-held devices).
</P>
<P>
   Gilburne, a senior strategist at America Online, usually
explains his ideas while scribbling on a huge whiteboard at his
office in Virginia. Because Bressler's office had no such amenity,
Gilburne soon asked for an easel with a large pad of paper
attached. Soon sheets of Gilburne's diagrams and notes covered
Bressler's walls.
</P>
<P>
   When the three-hour meeting ended, Bressler recalled, ``We
walked out of there really juiced about what we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the business logic of a merger looked more and more
appealing, the pricing issue was becoming increasingly difficult.
That became apparent the next morning, Nov. 17, when Case and Levin
met for breakfast at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's stock had been rising steeply. For Case, that
made his original notion of a 50-50 ownership deal no longer
practical. The currency of the deal, after all, was America Online
stock. ``I was prepared to pay a premium,'' Case recalled, ``but
there was only so far I could go.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, according to people close to the talks, Case was
pushing for 60 percent to 65 percent ownership of the combined
company. Although the two men decline to disclose what ownership
percentages were discussed over breakfast, Levin recalled: ``It was
clear that we weren't together. I said, `I don't see how we're
going to bridge that gap.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to narrow the gap, the two sides held a pair of meetings
in December _ one in New York, the other in Boston _ accompanied by
senior investment bankers: Eduardo Mestre, a vice chairman of
Salomon Smith Barney, representing America Online, and Paul
Taubman, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
representing Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The parties agreed that the companies would have the same number
of directors on the board. But the ownership ratio remained the big
question.
</P>
<P>
   Over the holidays, Levin and Bressler talked frequently by
phone. Levin had decided that the options were a merger with
America Online or a primarily go-it-alone digital strategy for Time
Warner. ``I had essentially eliminated in my mind any other
merger,'' Levin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from his New Year's holiday in Vermont, Levin
instructed Bressler to call America Online and set up a meeting
with Case. A dinner was arranged for the following evening at
Case's house in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, Levin and Bressler, who had flown from New York on a
Time Warner corporate jet, arrived at Case's house at 6:30 p.m.
Levin noticed that two decorative Christmas reindeer on Case's lawn
had fallen down _ perhaps an omen, Levin recalled thinking, that
``we weren't going to do this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Over red wine in the living room, the four men talked about
their companies, but other things as well, including sports and
Time Warner's HBO hit series ``The Sopranos,'' which Novack
sheepishly confessed he had not seen. The discussion in the living
room lasted ``about a bottle and a half,'' or 90 minutes, before
they began dinner, Novack recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Levin steered the conversation to the one issue not yet
discussed: ownership. He revealed that he was willing to settle for
45 percent ownership of the merged company for Time Warner
shareholders. That would mean 1.5 shares in AOL Time Warner, as the
merged company would be named, for each share of Time Warner stock
_ but not a fraction less.
</P>
<P>
   Case, who had long been pushing for a 60-40 split, called for a
bottle of 1990 Chateau Leoville-Las-Cases from the wine cellar. The
deal, in essence, was done.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was ``no clinking of glasses or high fives,''
Novack recalled. When the chocolate mousse was cleared at midnight,
both sides agreed to go off and sleep on their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York the following morning, Levin said, ``I got up
and felt comfortable that it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Bressler to call America Online. At 9:15 a.m. Bressler
called Novack. ``Is there anything that has changed since we talked
last night?'' Bressler asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Novack replied. ``Nothing at all.''

<P>
   KATZRIN, Golan Heights _ Everybody here knows Moshe Zaidon, the
white-haired manager of a local cafeteria, who walks the pleasant,
orderly streets with a sense of ownership that many of the pioneer
settlers possess. ``There goes Moshe from the cafeteria,'' people
say, and they wave.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't know, however, because it is a hard thing for Zaidon
to admit, that for more than two decades he has possessed a
deep-seated belief that the time would come when they all would
have to pull up stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the beginning that we were living on Syrian
land,'' said Zaidon, 59. He was reclining in his favorite
leatherette chair in his immaculate living room, which is decorated
with Laurel and Hardy figurines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, the Golan became by law an inseparable part of
Israel,'' he continued. ``But deep inside, I knew this day might
arrive. If there was a chance of peace with the Syrians, I always
knew that we were the bargaining chip.''
</P>
<P>
   With the revival of the Israeli-Syrian peace effort after a
nearly four-year stalemate, the Golan Heights, a scenic northern
region replete with gorges, waterfalls and sometimes snow-capped
mountain peaks, has entered a state of flux. On the surface, the
apparatus of opposition to any Israeli concession of the Golan can
be seen revving its engine, as with a mass rally that the settlers
sponsored in Tel Aviv last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface, at the collectives, the kibbutzim, the
military bases and the businesses that have established themselves
in this area about the size of Rhode Island, a quiet psychological
and practical preparation has begun. In the four large Druse Arab
towns in the Golan, where many residents are self-protectively
working to suppress their excitement at a possible return to Syrian
control, planning for a very different future is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Any peace agreement would entail an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, experts agree. But since a peace agreement is by no
means certain, much of Golan life is frozen, with residents
anxiously continuing their daily lives. Some Israeli settlers are
digging in their heels defiantly, like those who collectively own
the Golan Heights Winery, which is considered Israel's finest. They
are planting new vineyards, boosting their bottling capacity and
expanding into new export markets.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Zaidon, who has sponsored several residents'
meetings with lawyers and property assessors, have started to think
about what it would it take to dismantle three decades of Israeli
life in the Golan Heights. Eden Springs, Israel's principal water
bottling company, under pressure from its public shareholders, has
already prepared a detailed plan for relocating its entire plant to
northern Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at least one kibbutz has made a quiet decision to
move as a group to the Galilee, the northern region that most
closely resembles the Golan. The Golan religious council has
written a clause into its standard divorce agreement stating that
no property division would be adversely affected by the outcome of
diplomatic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And one Golan business has used the possibility of a withdrawal
as a marketing tool. An advertising flier for the two-year-old
Howard Johnson hotel at Mount Hermon asked, ``Who knows how long
you have to visit this enchanted spot?''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For decades, the military, which captured the Golan after brutal
battles in 1973, considered the area a strategic necessity to
defend northern Israel against what used to be sporadic shelling by
Syria. Now, though, in the face of what some believe to be a
severely deteriorated Syrian army, it is reassessing its security
plans. Last week, the Israeli army's alpinists, who guard Israel's
only ski resort, conducted their routine training exercises in the
deep snow at the peak of Mount Hermon. But they felt sentimentally
aware that this could be the last winter that their elite unit of
reservists was called into duty to patrol the quiet northern border
on snowshoes and skis.
</P>
<P>
   For the Druse in the Golan Heights, who will stay put, the mood
is very different. Dr. Taiseer Maray, 40, for instance, a
biologist, lives in Majdal Shams, bordering the cease-fire line
between the Golan Heights and Syria. Since childhood, he has been
separated from his older brothers, who made lives in Damascus. Now,
in an exchange of phone calls, the estranged siblings have
discussed reuniting on the family land in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How incredible that would be,'' Maray said, ``all to live
under the same flag.''

<P>
   BUSINESS AS USUAL: Planning for Growth, And for Closing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Victor Schoenfeld is a thoroughly Californian figure: a Palo
Verde-reared winemaker trained at the University of California at
Davis. He exudes the kind of easy informality that masks formidable
technical mastery and an intense competitive drive.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last nine years, Schoenfeld has labored in the
unlikely vineyards of the Golan Heights, where the grapes are grown
amid the rusting wrecks of Syrian tanks. He is chief winemaker for
the Golan Heights Winery, the region's largest employer, whose
tallest blending tank is topped, like an army command post, with an
Israeli flag.
</P>
<P>
   With a thousand acres of local vineyards supplying an
ultramodern winemaking complex, the company produced four million
bottles last year. It also chalked up a record $12 million in
earnings. More important to Schoenfeld, his complex cabernets and
fruity chardonnays are beginning to be recognized internationally
as more than just kosher curiosities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with the prospect of Israeli withdrawal and Syrian
sovereignty, the coming fall harvest could be the winery's last.
``It's a little bit hard on morale,'' Schoenfeld said. ``To think
that a big chunk of your life might be in vain . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But Schoenfeld and his colleagues don't let themselves think
that way. The company is undertaking an $8 million expansion
despite the political uncertainty, and projecting sales to double
to $24 million by 2001. ``The investment program is going forward
as if there were no peace process, because as a business there is
no alternative,'' said Adam Montefiore, the winery's international
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The winery's plans stand in stark contrast to those of Eden
Springs, its next-door neighbor in the Katzrin industrial park. A
publicly traded company seeking foreign investors, it has already
bought rights for what it says is a comparable mineral water source
in the upper Galilee. If Syria takes over, the plant and its work
force would all be moved, managers told employees here this month.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Golan Heights winery, relocation is not an option,
its executives say. This cool highland plateau is the only area
under Israeli domain capable of producing a lot of high-quality
wine grapes, they say. And, for the moment, there is no outside
pressure on the company to seek alternatives. The eight
shareholders are all kibbutzim and collective farms in the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore, an English immigrant, chooses to believe that no
matter what flag flies over it, the winery will survive. But
Schoenfeld is less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have assumptions that have no basis in
reality, that we'd be able to lease the vineyard from the
Syrians,'' he said. ``If this were France and Belgium, I'd have an
easier time imagining some kind of cooperation. But it's the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing, in his New York Giants parka, at the gate to Mount
Hermon, Yitzhak Tsuela worried that international sentiment could
not be aroused to defend the ski resort that his moshav _ a
collective _ had built.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't create a sympathetic image,'' he said, waving at
the skiers. ``Everyone will say, `They're rich.' But they forget,
when we came here there was nothing. We started with a single
Austrian chairlift that the Israeli government gave us to help us
get off the ground.'
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Majdal Shams, which is adjacent to the moshav, are
furious when they hear these Israelis talk about how they created
something from nothing. That nothing was their land. They seethe
when Golan settlers talk about how they, unlike the West Bank
settlers who displaced Palestinians, took over barren territory.
When Syria lost the Golan to Israel during the 1967 Israeli-Arab
war, an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Arabs fled.
</P>
<P>
   In the foothills of Mount Hermon, many of the Druse stayed put,
and grew into a community of 16,600, outnumbering the Jewish
settlers, according to Israeli government statistics. The
government says there are 14,400 Jewish settlers, which the
settlers believe is an undercount.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those in the West Bank, the Golan settlers are primarily
secular and traditionally affiliated with the Labor Party of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike those in the West Bank, few make biblically based
claims to the Golan as part of the greater land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet hillside town, Majdal Shams, within shouting distance of
Syria, is the largest community in the Golan. Its residents belong
to the Druse religion, which considers the Koran sacred but also
has its own religious texts. In Israel, many Druse have sworn
allegiance to the state, and serve in the army. But in the Golan
Heights, most have refused to take Israeli citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people here have never lived in our country,''
Maray said recently, at the clinic he runs. ``But to be so close to
the cease-fire line has kept our dream realistic. At night, we can
see the lamps burning in our brothers' and sisters' homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel has been a mixed experience for many in Majdal
Shams. They say they have always felt like second-class residents,
with textbooks labeled ``Mathematics for Druse'' or ``History for
Druse.'' Maray, who received a doctorate in biology from Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, said he cannot find work in his field in
Israel. Still, he acknowledges that he, like others, benefited some
from the educational and material opportunities of a Westernized
society.
</P>
<P>
   Maray said he expected that Majdal Shams would turn into a
crossroads if peace were made. It is a border town, and its
residents are fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic. After feeling
isolated in Israel, the Druse would be poised to become part of the
Syrian elite, he said. Their savings, which do not amount to much
in Israel, would count for significantly more in Syria's
underdeveloped economy, and their ability to negotiate the two
cultures could be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations proceed, the town's residents try to remain
calm. In the mid-1990s, when peace talks reached a peak before they
were frozen, the atmosphere among the Druse was almost hysterical.
Construction projects halted; businesses stopped placing orders;
some residents even traded in their cars for models that would have
higher resale value in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very optimistic,'' Dr. Maray said. ``But we have
learned not to take too many concrete steps.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL VANTAGE POINT: A Coveted Aerie From Which to Spy  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dressed hood-to-toe in a white Windbreaker with legs, Roni Idri,
29, carried an Uzi on his back as he schussed down a snowy ridge of
Mount Hermon several hundred feet from the Syrian border. One of
the elite army alpinists whose days may be numbered, he was asked
whether the skiing soldiers ever caught anyone trying to slip
across the mountaintop border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' he asked, mystified until it dawned on him. ``You mean,
the enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the geodesic crown jewels of Israel's electronic
espionage network sat on twin promontories of the snowy
7,300-foot-high ridge. After escorting journalists to the
off-limits peak the week before last, the army announced that the
two dense clusters of dish-encrusted antennae and Buckminster
Fuller radar domes were off the record and should not be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But they can be clearly viewed not only from the ski resort
below but from Damascus, just 26 miles to the north. And Damascus
wants Idri's ridge back, military hardware and all _ even if the
spy stations are staffed by American or other Western troops.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, this is the hardest piece of the heights to give
back. The Mount Hermon early warning stations give it unimpeded
surveillance of Syrian skies and military bases. Its top-secret
listening devices can reportedly monitor almost all electronic
communications throughout Syria and southern Lebanon. Though
Israeli military posts dot vantage points throughout the Golan,
none offer the strategic advantage of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts here say the withdrawal of the heavy artillery
and tank battalions Israel maintains across the Golan can be safely
compensated for by an extensive _ and very expensive _ system of
airborne and satellite radar stations, antiballistic missiles and
new wings of F-16 fighter jets. But Israeli negotiators are
demanding some continued Israeli military presence, at least
transitionally, on the mountaintop itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to our advantage to be up on the hill rather than down
in the valley,'' said a senior officer at a Golan Heights military
base. ``Peace would make a difference, but it depends on what kind
of peace you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the commander, who keeps a daily eye on his Syrian
counterparts encamped across the fortified border, a genuine peace
would justify this painful trade-off. ``They act like we act,
according to the rules set up after 1973,'' he said respectfully.
``I would like one day to see Syrian officers as people I could
talk to, as people who share the same mission that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   A CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY: Lives Hang in the Balance As Talks Go On
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resume Wednesday in the
Washington area, are a fact of life in the Golan. Tandem trailer
rigs drive the picturesque, winding roads beside the Sea of Galilee
adorned with banners that say, ``We will not budge from the
Golan.'' Cappuccino-serving waitresses in the cafe here wear
T-shirts with the same slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate market is frozen with uncertainty. ``There is
not a single house on the market in the entire Golan Heights,''
said Gila Yaakobi, the manager of Golan Realty. Construction has
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in an unclear situation now on the Golan,'' said
Moshed Hed, a factory owner who has stalled plans to build on a new
site. ``There is an atmosphere of hesitation, and it has
repercussions in every field.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish Golan Heights, as in Majdal Shams, the 1995
negotiations with Syria served as a kind of fire drill. During that
period, many underwent counseling about how to reorient themselves
psychologically and how to prepare their children for a traumatic
move. In the last few years, many received job retraining in
preparation for leaving agricultural life. Those people, to some
extent, have been bracing for the moment when they might have to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   New immigrants from the former Soviet Union make up a third of
Katzrin's population, and they have been pestering Aryeh Eilat, a
Russian who works as a kind of answer man for the municipality.
They want to know how much compensation money they will receive
from the government and whether they will get green cards from the
United States, too. That kind of gritty pragmatism turns off Eilat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think peace is worth a lot,'' he said. ``Maybe it's worth
the future of my child and my family. But it's such a disgusting
thing to let yourself be sold in the market like an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and his wife are already discussing the relative
merits of other regions. Scuttlebutt claims that the government
would be willing to help them relocate in either the sparsely
populated Negev or the Galilee, which they prefer. They have not
gone as far as some neighbors, though, who are taking weekend
drives to scout out new lives.
</P>
<P>
   Few like to admit any kind of preparation publicly, because it
makes it seem as if they have given up the fight. ``We certainly
don't want to give anyone the impression that we have reconciled
ourselves to the situation,'' Zaidon said. ``On the other hand, we
can't stick our heads in the sand. That's what they did in the
Sinai.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Israeli government handled the forcible evacuation
of the Sinai after the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord of 1979 serves
as the model for what not to do, many Israelis say. But Nurit
Kliot, a geographer at the University of Haifa and an expert on the
Sinai evacuation, said she had already seen the government
repeating past mistakes. She said officials were sending
conflicting signals to the Golan settlers, as they did to the Sinai
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kliot was referring to leaks last week suggesting that Barak
was asking the Syrians to let settlers stay in the Golan after the
Israeli military withdraws. Most experts consider this a condition
that Syria would never accept and see it as a ploy aimed at
convincing the settlers that the government is pushing for their
rights. But many settlers are taking the reports at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The government's evacuation from the Sinai town of Yamit, which
ended with violent clashes between settlers and soldiers, led them
to overcompensate the settlers financially, Ms. Kliot said. Instead
of being paid the value of their property, they were paid ``their
property-plus-plus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This fostered animosity toward the settlers, who were
derogatorily referred to as the ``Yamit millionaires.'' With that
lingering bad impression still fresh, the ski resort operators say
they have never calculated the worth of their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be seen as Shylock, giving up everything for
money,'' Tsuela said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sharon Tsuela, added, in a reference to Syrian
President Hafez Assad, : ``If Assad comes and makes us go, we will
go to Canada. That will be enough of Israel for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking in his living room, Zaidon said he could not imagine
starting over at the age of 59. ``For younger people, it may be
easier,'' he said. ``But I have to make myself face it. Holding on
to the land with our fingernails would be a mistake. After there is
an agreement, and then a referendum, that will be the beginning of
our end here in Katzrin.''

CUSTODY CASE OVERSHADOWS SHIFT AMONG CUBAN IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Wiry and wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap,
Carlos Rodriguez, 18, speaks in the vernacular of American youth.
Just finishing high school, Rodriguez has lived in Miami for the 10
years since he and his parents fled Cuba, where he said his father
was a political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch at the Versailles Restaurant in the heart of Little
Havana last week, Rodriguez was speaking about the one subject that
has held Miami and people around the nation spellbound this month:
the custody fight over the 6-year-old Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.
Rodriguez acknowledged that he shared the contempt for Fidel Castro
that many Cuban-Americans here feel. But he did not share the view
that Elian, whose mother drowned fleeing Cuba with him in November,
should be given to the relatives who are holding him here.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Cuban-Americans, Rodriguez has relatives in Cuba who
want to emigrate. ``I have a sister waiting to come over,'' he
said. If Elian is not returned to his father, who remains in Cuba,
President Castro might retaliate by prohibiting the legal
emigration of the 20,000 Cubans whom the United States agrees to
admit each year. ``I'd rather sacrifice one boy for 1,000 people,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   The strident Miami voices _ the P.T. Barnums of media
manipulation, the high-powered lawyers, the organizers of
demonstrations _ that have been filling the nation's airwaves and
front pages celebrate what they see as the martyrdom of a mother
for her child's freedom from Communist tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week with some of Miami's 700,000
Cuban-Americans, most seem to remain united in opposition to
Castro. A poll by WLTV-Channel 23 here found that 88 percent of
Cuban-Americans also oppose the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's ruling this month that Elian be returned to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   But tune out the racket, and what emerges from the feud over
Elian is a split over American trade and immigration policies and
fatigue with both the old guard's myths of the pre-revolutionary
Cuba and its plots to rout Castro and go back to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups have formed to challenge the Cuban American
National Foundation, which has long been controlled by exiles of a
generation ago. Two groups, Cambio Cubano and the Cuban Committee
for Democracy, would scrap the punitive measures against Cuba, like
the longstanding U.S. embargo, and move toward normal diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
   But for the larger Cuban-American community here, most
differences with the old guard lie more in priorities than in the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a difference of opinion as a difference in
agenda,'' said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuba Research
Institute at Florida International University here.
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a sociologist at the University of Miami, said:
``These are people who do not participate in hard-line political
organizations. They have been able to transcend the hard-line
groups. They have overcome the hyperhatred of Castro; not that they
support Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   These mellowing views do not align neatly along the class and
generational lines that mark the assimilation of many other
immigrant groups. Much of Little Havana, though mixed today with
other Latino immigrant groups, remains emphatically Cuban. Cigar
rolling thrives, third-generation children speak Spanish at home,
quinceaneras _ 15-year-old girls _ still mark their transition to
adulthood in lacy white dresses at big parties.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the contrast between the threats and official
pronouncements and the daily life of Little Havana starker than at
the white stucco matchbox of a house where Elian has settled with
his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, who has petitioned a state court
for his custody.
</P>
<P>
   All day Thursday, as every day, television networks' big white
vans muscled against the house's chain-link fence with satellite
antennas on their roofs and 20-foot microphone booms hovering over
the small yard. Just home from school, Elian rolled out from the
backyard, chewing blue gum, wearing a new wristwatch and driving a
new battery-powered toy stock car.
</P>
<P>
   Four men _ Gonzalez and relatives _ seated themselves on metal
kitchen chairs at one side of the yard. Around and around Elian
drove, indifferent those watching, neither sad nor happy, tracing
the same loop. He did not nod or wave to the relatives keeping an
eye on him or to the reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The little house in Little Havana has become a sanctuary of
anti-Castro sentiment, where a few women stand vigil at the fence
every day to defend the interests of Elian's mother. ``His mother
died in the sea,'' said Marta Santana, who immigrated here 40 years
ago. ``He's living. She sacrificed herself to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the house, however, views are more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all a political thing,'' said Mike Freire, 45,
who came to Miami at age 6 and sells cigars made in the Dominican
Republic throughout the United States. ``They're just using the kid
as a basketball.'' He wants the child returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the psychological effect,'' Freire said. ``It's
horrible, what we are doing to him. The politicians are wrong.''
This is not a view that Freire is comfortable expressing. ``You
have to watch what you say,'' he said. ``You might be accused of
being a Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Rojas, 36, who works for an advertising agency and has
three daughters, ages 11, 10 and 4, clings to her Cuban culture,
requiring Spanish to be spoken at home and preparing Cuban dishes.
When her daughters start dating, she said, they will be chaperoned,
and they will not wear short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ms. Rojas, whose parents fled Cuba in 1958 and
whose husband is a police officer, is a hard-liner. She would keep
Elian here and topple Castro. But she draws the line on the
American embargo against trade with Cuba because, she said, it has
worsened the lives of Cubans. ``A lot of people are starving,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Efrain Quevedo, 37, a sales manager for a food company, and his
wife, Terry, an investigator for the City of Miami, take issue with
the Cuban-American leadership's efforts to steer American policy
toward upending the Castro regime. ``Unless the people there do
something,'' Quevedo said, ``I don't think the United States is
going to be able to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quevedo takes issue with demonstrations that disrupt the
lives of others, like the traffic-stopping protests earlier this
month in Miami against Elian's repatriation. ``It's all right as
long as it's peaceful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing concern for newer immigrants of the 1980s and
1990s _ young and old, employed or unemployed _ is not so much
Castro and Communism as economic opportunity. ``For me, Castro is
nothing,'' said Luis Fernandez, a manager of the restaurant
Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Managing restaurants ``is my profession,'' he said. He left Cuba
for Chile four years ago and moved to Miami only two months ago.
``Here, when you work more hours, you get paid for more hours.''
Someday, he said, he will start a business. ``I've promised myself
that if the government changes, I'd still never go back. This is my
thing.''

   KNIN, Croatia _ Almost five years after Croatia promised to
allow refugees from the Yugoslav wars to return to their homes
here, the authorities still put endless obstacles in the way of
many of those who want to come back.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous Croatian flag, brightly lit through the night, rides
high above the medieval fortress that squats above this ugly town
like a heavy helmet.
</P>
<P>
   When Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, Knin
became the center of resistance by Croatia's Serbs, the capital of
a self-styled republic created with support from Belgrade by rebel
Serbs who controlled almost one-third of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Serbs are gone, and the town is populated almost
entirely by Croats from neighboring Bosnia, who themselves fled the
horrors of the Bosnian war from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like a science fiction movie,'' like ``Invasion of
the Body Snatchers'' or ``The Stepford Wives,'' said Jeannie
Peterson, director of the Knin office of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, who knew the town in the war
years. ``The buildings look almost exactly the same, but the people
are completely different. This is a Bosnian Croat town now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton accords, which settled the Bosnian war, Franjo
Tudjman, Croatia's president, promised to help refugees return.
</P>
<P>
   But Croatia's local housing authorities ignore requests from
Serbs who fled Croatia after Tudjman's army swept away the Serbian
statelet here in the summer of 1995. The authorities use legal or
administrative hurdles to block the Serbs' return, refusing to let
them repair houses so smashed that not even the Croatian refugees
from Bosnia, desperate for a home, can live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy has been clear,'' said a European diplomat.
``Promise that Serb refugees can return, but put every obstacle in
their path.''
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian authorities are understandably reluctant to push
out their ethnic brothers from Bosnia, and have often given the
Bosnian Croats temporary legal authority to remain in houses that
belonged to Serbs _ for centuries a substantial presence in
Croatia. And Zagreb has no real desire to have a majority of Serbs,
no matter how chastened, back in areas like Knin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the new housing _ and there is not nearly enough _ is
assigned to ethnic Croats, not to ethnic Serbs, say officials of
both the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the two international
agencies most active here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few Croatian Serbs stayed on and survived, and those who
wanted to come back can't do it,'' Ms. Peterson said. The Croats,
she said, require the Serbs to have a lot of documents, which are
very hard to get. ``If Serb houses are damaged, it's hard to get
reconstruction assistance, which is supposed to be available to
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 villages in the Knin area that were part of a Croatian
government reconstruction program, only 6 are not purely Croat, and
even in those only Croat houses are being rebuilt, said another
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than 4,000 applications by Serbs to rebuild their houses
in the Knin area, only two are known to have been granted so far,
according to an internal report of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who work for the U.N. refugee agency say they already
have 3,000 Croatian Serbs on their books who have returned to the
area and need resettlement help, so they are reluctant to encourage
any more to return.
</P>
<P>
   And resettlement is complicated, like a three-cushion pool shot.
For a Croatian Serb to be resettled, either a house must be
restored or a new one built, or a Bosnian Croat family must be
repatriated to Bosnia, where a refugee Bosnian Muslim family is
probably living in the Bosnian Croats' house and must also be
resettled.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Bosnian Croats here, whom Tudjman offered
citizenship as ``migrant settlers'' on land formerly settled by
Serbs, express little interest in returning to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the high commissioner's figures, said Guenther
Scheske, the agency's office director in Knin, at least 120,000
Croatian Serbs fled the area when Tudjman's troops retook it in
1995. Some think up to 200,000 or more fled.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,400 Serbs remained, and an estimated 30,000 have returned
since 1995 from Bosnia or Yugoslavia, although the Croatian
government says the number is 60,000. At least 18,000 Bosnian Croat
``migrant settlers'' have come here, along with 4,600 other Bosnian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The next prime minister of Croatia, Ivica Racan, vows to do
better in living up to Zagreb's promises of refugee resettlement.
He is the beneficiary of an opposition coalition's victory in
parliamentary elections on Jan. 3 that overthrew Tudjman's Croatian
Democratic Union, which had run Croatia since 1990. Tudjman died in
December, and a presidential election is scheduled for Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, NATO and the European Union have made better
performance on resettlement, and on Croatia's support for
Muslim-Croat cooperation in Bosnia, their main tests for better
relations with Zagreb. But Racan acknowledges that he must be
careful, as a new Croatian president will also have to be, not to
ignore the fervent nationalism in a Croatia that remembers
atrocities committed by Serbs in the 1991 war and domination from
Belgrade before that, in Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are cases like that of Danilo Stanic. He was one of
the many Serbs who fled in 1995. His restaurant and the apartment
above it in nearby Gracac, a flourishing spot for truckers and
locals, have been taken over by a Croat from Australia who came to
fight with the Croatian army and was apparently rewarded for his
patriotic pains.
</P>
<P>
   Stanic, 38, who lives down the road in his mother's house, which
he has slowly repaired himself, is working through the Dalmatian
Solidarity Committee, a local legal aid and human rights
organization, to get his restaurant back. When he and his wife,
Gordana, opened it in 1989, they called it Alpina, because they had
earned the money to build it from jobs as guest workers in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The new occupant, Ivo Kovac, has renamed it Tvrdi Kamen, meaning
tough or solid stone, a play on Hard Rock Cafe, and it is a popular
and profitable spot. ``He's earning money in my restaurant,''
Stanic said. ``He bought a new Jeep this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanic said he went there several times early on to have a
drink, but that Kovac avoided him. Two years ago, Mrs. Stanic said,
she spoke to Kovac, who offered a low price for the restaurant and
then said he could burn it down as easily, a conversation Kovac
denies.
</P>
<P>
   Stanic admits that like most Serbs here he fled out of fear in
1995, encouraged by Croatian Serb leaders. Like many, he believes
this mass flight was part of a deal between Tudjman and the Serbian
leader, Slobodan Milosevic. But he notes that several hundred Serbs
who stayed behind, many of them elderly, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Stanic went to Belgrade, then ended up in a village near Sombor,
where his aunt and mother thought it would be easier to live. ``In
Serbia the refugees live very hard,'' he said. ``Like me, they left
their property behind and work for very little money and everyone
misuses them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanic traveled here in 1998 to look around and file
applications to return and get his property back. He came back for
good, he said, nine months ago. He began fixing up his mother's
house and salvaging appliances, like his two refrigerators, washing
machine and boiler, from the Knin dump. ``The boiler just had two
bullet holes,'' he said happily. ``Now it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stanic said he isn't even very bitter as he tends his sheep,
bought after he sold his car. He said he has all the right
documents and is sure Croatia will recognize his legal claims
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young Croatian state has not yet gotten on its feet,'' he
said. ``There will be changes here for the good, with a new
government. I don't think they'll behave like the old one. If I
thought differently, I'd go live in Slovenia. It's like this after
every war.''
</P>
<P>
   In the office of the Dalmatian Solidarity Committee, Lazar
Dragicevic, with a big red face and white hair, twisted his hat in
his hands as he described his problem in deciding whether to
return. Now 68, he is trying to get his pension restarted, but
needs more documents. And just to travel here from Serbia, where he
is now living unhappily in Banat, costs half as much as the pension
he isn't getting. ``I'm getting no help from the officials,'' he
said. ``That's why I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants to return to his house by the pretty Otuca River, but
his children are reluctant, his wife has high blood pressure, and
there is little work here except farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to be in your own house,'' he said. ``We're not
worried about the Croats now. We have no other citizenship. And
after four years, it should be possible to live together.'' He
sighed. ``It's a hard decision, though.''
</P>
<P>
   When Croatian troops retook the area in Operation Storm in
August 1995, Dragicevic and his family fled on tractors. ``We were
afraid,'' he said. ``The storm was coming, and they were hitting us
with grenades. There was no time to get anything. We just left.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragicevic's brother, Mico, 66, a shepherd who was out with the
flock, hid with his wife, Ljubica. Croatian soldiers arrested them
on Aug. 8 of that year and took them to Zadar, where they were
detained with other Serbs in a large hall. Five days later, they
were able to contact their daughter in Zagreb, who went to get
them. They returned to Gracac in mid-September, but their house was
looted, though not burned, and their animals stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 64 sheep and one cow and one goat and two pigs, and
everything was gone,'' Ljubica Dragicevic said. ``After that, no
one mistreated us. But they took us away and they stole everything,
and now we're too old to work.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly six months, Lazar and Mico had no contact with one
another and had no idea if the other had survived. Finally, the
International Committee of the Red Cross connected them.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? ``Politics,'' Ljubica Dragicevic said, ``and
those who want to sit in high places.''
</P>
<P>
   They are urging Lazar to return with his family. ``We're both
illiterate,'' Mico said. ``We never went to school. We're not
up-to-date.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljubica moved to the stove, averting her face. ``I'd prefer our
people come back,'' she said softly. ``We have no friends or
relatives here. I do feel threatened. I can't say I'm a Serb, or
people immediately treat you differently.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped for a long moment, then said: ``We're lonely here.
All the people here now are foreign.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTSDALE, N.Y. _ For young women in a culture saturated with
alluring images of riches and sensuality, it is an unlikely
advertising come-on. Turn your back on money and men, and spend
your life helping people who are sick, poor and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ultimate tough sell, but the message is: Forget the pop
star Madonna. Become a nun.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, one of the
nation's largest orders of Roman Catholic nuns, is making the pitch
with a vengeance, and it is using all the tools of the modern age:
test markets, target audiences, catchy graphics and, new this
month, a Web site. One recruitment poster that was sent last week
to college campuses shows a close-up of God's hand reaching out to
Adam's from Michelangelo's ``Creation of Adam.'' Adam is holding a
cellular phone, and the text reads: ``Do you have a call waiting?''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have no choice. For more than three decades, the
number of Catholic nuns in the United States has fallen like a
stone, to 83,000 last year from 180,000 in 1965. Compounding the
decline is the aging of their population; the median age of
American nuns is 68. The result has been a draining of resources
from the many charities and institutions that the sisters helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a personnel crisis,'' said Professor Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. ``Sisters really did build the
American Catholic Church through their teaching in the parochial
school system and their staffing of Catholic hospitals. They have
been the backbone of the church in this century, and it's
absolutely critical to address the question of the next generation
and who will succeed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recruitment campaign, the New York, New Jersey and
Brooklyn chapters, or communities, of the Sisters of Mercy teamed
up to create the posters and brochures, which are aimed at women 21
to 35. ``If you appear old and nonvibrant, that becomes an obstacle
to anyone wanting to enter religious life,'' said Sister Patricia
Wolf, president of the New York community, adding that the images
showed a ``connection to the world and also to humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and sisters themselves point to a number of factors
responsible for the dwindling population of nuns, a decline far
more precipitous than the corresponding drop in the number of Roman
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   The women's movement and cultural revolution of the 1960s opened
up a world of new opportunities for women, from careers in law to
stints in the Peace Corps. Moreover, where it was not uncommon in
the 1950s and 1960s for Catholic women to join the ranks of nuns if
they were not yet engaged to be married by their college
graduation, in the 1970s and beyond it became more acceptable for
women to marry later in life. And given the booming economy of
recent years and a return to family values, taking vows of poverty
and chastity is, in some sense, a countercultural, even radical,
move.
</P>
<P>
   As laypeople steadily replace nuns on the staffs of Catholic
schools and social service agencies, young women are losing their
exposure to nuns and the more modern ways in which they live today
_ wearing street clothes, often residing in apartments and holding
down demanding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conundrum,'' said Appleby, ``is that as the number of
sisters falls and the ones who remain are drawn into leadership
positions, there is less opportunity for that personal contact that
was so effective earlier in the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious orders now are trying to turn the tide by
injecting some of that face-to-face contact. The Religious of the
Sacred Heart of Mary, an order with 1,100 members worldwide, is
taking advantage of its Hamptons real estate by holding ``Come and
See'' weekends several times a year at its retreat house in Sag
Harbor in eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to come and get to know us in an informal
setting,'' said Sister Mary Alice Young, director of development
for the order on the East Coast, based in Tarrytown. ``The sisters
talk about their own experience, and people can ask questions
without being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sisters of Mercy, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of
Mary last year created a Web site, and for the last two years the
community has run advertisements in Catholic newspapers. ``One of
the things you're constantly hearing is that the baby boomers and
generation X are totally separate entities, and you have to learn
to reach the generations differently,'' Sister Mary Alice said.
``It's speaking to a whole different world than the one I grew up
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, there are similar efforts. In Indiana, the
Sisters of Benedict assembled a lay committee of professionals with
experience in marketing and communications. The sisters now have a
toll-free number, a Web site and advertising. One ad beckons with
the cheeky line: ``You don't have to be perfect to be a nun. God
knows we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   And in California, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles
has made the recruitment of nuns and priests a high priority. Later
this month, the archdiocese will invite 150 to 250 people to its
annual ``7 to 11 Day.'' Starting at 7 a.m., the men and women trail
the priests and nuns as they go about their day. Later they are
treated to dinner with Cardinal Roger Mahony and a talent show.
Past acts have included comedy and line dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope among nuns that they can tap into this millennial
moment, when gift shops sell nothing but angels, and best-selling
books, rock songs and television shows unabashedly deal with issues
relating to religion, the soul and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably more than at any recent time, there is a
real quest today for spirituality,'' said Sister Patricia of the
Sisters of Mercy. ``The media gives evidence of that. You have
something like `Touched by an Angel' on television and other shows.
So an attraction to religious life is perhaps even more possible
than it has been at other times.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A sampling of reactions on two traditionally Catholic campuses
in Westchester County, however, found that for most students, the
idea of becoming a nun was just short of unthinkable. Jessica
Hogan, a senior at Iona College in New Rochelle, said: ``I never
considered it. It seems outdated and old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Delia, a 29-year-old graduate student at Mercy College
in Dobbs Ferry, who is from a ``very strong Catholic family,'' said
she had considered the profession as a girl. Ms. Delia's mother was
a nun for seven years before leaving, and both her aunt and cousin
are nuns. ``I've grown up around nuns, so I have a different
outlook than a lot of people,'' Ms. Delia said. ``You can be part
of a religious order and still be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she decided the religious life was not for her. The
recruitment posters might help, Ms. Delia said, but she believes
that the reason young women have shunned the sisterhood is the
diminishing power of the Catholic Church over their lives. ``The
problem is young people don't stay in the church,'' she said. ``You
have to have that belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a nun is a lengthy affair. At the Sisters of Mercy, an
international order with 5,700 members, first there are periodic
discussions between a prospective sister and a vocation director
for six months to a year. A formal application is then made to the
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted, the candidate lives with other sisters for two
years but retains her outside job and assets. For the next two
years she is a ``novice,'' giving up her job and pursuing spiritual
development. Then, just before taking her first vows, she disposes
of her assets and begins a ministry in keeping with the order's
mission. Three to five years later, she takes her final vows.
</P>
<P>
   The New York, New Jersey and Brooklyn regional communities of
the Sisters of Mercy are determined to increase the minority
representation among their members, who are overwhelmingly white.
One of the posters shows an African-American woman in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't reflect as a community the ethnic background of New
York City,'' Sister Patricia said in her spacious office on a
former estate here. ``Just walk around. We have a significant
amount of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Barbara Ann Catherine Gourdine, 40, is a relatively new _
and young _ member, having made her temporary vows two years ago.
She is also African-American, one of only two in the New York
community, which has 187 members. She actually joined the order at
21 but left in 1988. ``In leaving it gave me a chance to grow and
find out who I was as a person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to adjust to living with three women in a house
after years of living alone in an apartment, and she recently took
a job teaching in a Catholic school after 10 years in a public
school. ``It's not what I expected,'' she said, ``but I am happy.''
</P>
<P>
   With members from Staten Island to the Adirondacks, as well as
the Worcester, Mass., area (the result of a merger), the New York
community of the Sisters of Mercy is spread thin. The order
sponsors two high schools, three health-care centers and three
social-service agencies. There are pastoral duties and community
outreach, as well, but half the members are retired.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nuns resist the idea that they face extinction, and they
look to their history for solace. ``In some ways, you could say,
`Well, it's dying out and the last person should turn out the
lights,''' Sister Mary Alice said. ``But we were founded by only
six sisters 150 years ago. So what you need are committed women.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, there will always be those.

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Dressed in her orchid pink bathrobe and blue velour
slippers, Edouardine Boucher perched on her bed at Notre Dame
Hospital here on Friday and recounted the story of her night:
electric doors constantly opening and closing by her feet, cold
drafts blowing across her head each time an ambulance arrived in
the subzero weather, and a drug addict who started shouting at 2:30
a.m., ``Untie me, untie me.''
</P>
<P>
   But as nurses hurried by on Friday morning, no one thought it
remarkable that Ms. Boucher, a 58-year-old grandmother awaiting
open heart surgery, had spent a rough night on a gurney in an
emergency room hallway. After all, other hallways of this modern,
3-year-old hospital were lined with 66 other patients lying quietly
on temporary beds.
</P>
<P>
   To explain overflowing hospitals here and across the nation,
Canadian health officials are blaming the annual winter flu
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the mention of flu, Daniel Brochu, the veteran head
nurse here, gave a smirk and ran his pen down the patient list:
``Heart problem, infection problem, hypertension, dialysis, brain
tumor, two cerebral hemorrhages.'' On Thursday, he said, crowding
was so bad that he was able to admit one patient only after the
ambulance crew agreed to leave its stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   When Canada's state-run health system was in its first bloom, in
the 1970s, Americans regularly trooped up here on inspection tours,
attracted by Canada's promise of universal ``free'' health care.
Today, however, few Canadians would recommend their system as a
model for export.
</P>
<P>
   Improving health care should be the federal government's top
priority, said 93 percent of 3,000 Canadians interviewed last month
by Ekos Research Associates. In another poll last month, conducted
by Pollara, 74 percent of respondents supported the idea of user
fees, which have been outlawed since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a day when the newspapers do not talk of the
health crisis,'' said Pierre Gauthier, president of the Federation
of Specialist Doctors of Quebec. ``It has become the No. 1 problem
for Quebecois and for Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, Canada's largest city, overcrowding prompted
emergency rooms in 23 of the city's 25 hospitals to turn away
ambulances one day recently. Two weeks ago, in what one newspaper
later called ``an ominous foreshadowing,'' police officers shot to
death a distraught father who had taken a doctor hostage in a
Toronto emergency room in an attempt to speed treatment for his
sick baby.
</P>
<P>
   Further west, in Winnipeg, ``hallway medicine'' has become so
routine that hallway stretcher locations have permanent numbers.
Patients recuperate more slowly in the drafty, noisy hallways,
doctors report.
</P>
<P>
   On the Pacific Coast, ambulances filled with ill patients have
repeatedly stacked up this winter in the parking lot of Vancouver
General Hospital. Maureen Whyte, a hospital vice president,
estimates that 20 percent of heart attack patients who should have
treatment within 15 minutes now wait an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is a case of supply not keeping up with demand.
During the 1990s, after government deficits ballooned, partly
because of rising health costs, the government in Ottawa cut
revenue-sharing payments to provinces _ by half, by some accounts.
Today, the federal budget is balanced, but seven hospitals in
Montreal have been closed, and 44 hospitals in Ontario have been
closed or merged.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa also largely closed the door to the immigration of
foreign doctors and cut the number of spaces in Canadian medical
schools by 20 percent. Today, Canada has one medical school slot
for every 20,000 people, compared with one for 13,000 in the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   With a buyout program, Quebec induced 3,600 nurses and 1,200
doctors to take early retirement. And across the nation, 6,000
nurses and at least 1,000 doctors have moved to the United States
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, demands on Canada's health system grow every
year. Within 30 years, the population over age 65 is expected to
double, to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to meet the demand, waiting lists for operations now
stretch for months or longer _ five years in the case of Ms.
Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Canada has moved informally to a two-tier,
public-private system. Although private practice is limited to
dentists and veterinarians, 90 percent of Canadians live within 100
miles of the United States, and many people are crossing the border
for private care.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as waiting lists for chemotherapy treatments for
breast and prostate cancer stretched to four months, Montreal
doctors started to send patients 45 minutes down the highway to
Champlain Valley Physicians' Hospital in Plattsburgh, N.Y. There,
scores have undergone radiation treatment, some being treated by
bilingual doctors who had left Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been so good that the Plattsburgh hospital, which
was on the verge of closing its cancer unit, has invested half a
million dollars in new equipment. And on the Quebec side, the
program has allowed health authorities to boast that they have cut
the list of cancer patients who have to wait two months or more, to
368 last week from 516 last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, waiting lists have become so long at the Princess
Margaret Hospital, the nation's largest and most prestigious cancer
hospital, that hospital lawyers drew up a waiver recently for
patients to sign, showing that they fully understood the danger of
delaying radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   With the chemotherapy waiting list in British Columbia at 670
people, hospitals in Washington have started marketing their
services to Canadians in Vancouver, a 45-minute drive.
</P>
<P>
   A two-tier system is also being used for other kinds of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to buy Mother a plastic hip for Christmas, so she
doesn't have to limp through the year 2000 in excruciating pain,''
Margaret Wente, a newspaper columnist for The Globe and Mail in
Toronto, wrote last month. ``I could just drive her to Cleveland,
which is fast becoming the de facto hip-replacement capital of
Southern Ontario.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Rock, Canada's health minister, disapproves of such
attitudes. In an essay in the same newspaper, he wrote
sarcastically: ``Forget about equal access. Let people buy their
way to the front of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of Canada's state health system, he wrote, ``Its
social equity reflects our Canadian values.'' Rock, who hopes to
become prime minister one day, said that health delivery could be
improved through better, computerized planning. He attacked a
proposal in Alberta to allow private hospitals, warning readers,
``The precedent may be set for American for-profit health-care
providers looking to set up shop in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that there may be room in Canada's future for
private medicine is gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no significant crises in care for our teeth or our
animals, largely because dentists and veterinarians operate in the
private sector,'' Michael Bliss, a medical historian, wrote on
Wednesday in The National Post, a conservative newspaper. ``So we
have the absurdity in Canada that you can get faster care for your
gum disease than your cancer, and probably more attentive care for
your dog than your grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario, Canada's wealthiest province, the waiting list for
magnetic resonance imaging tests is so long that one man recently
reserved a session for himself at a private animal hospital that
had a machine. He registered under the name Fido.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Boucher, who jealously guarded her 15 square feet of
corridor space, such cocktail circuit anecdotes were not amusing.
Glumly eating her cold breakfast toast, she said, ``It scares us to
get sick.''

   BERLIN _ Germany has had its ``affairs'' before. The ``Spiegel
Affair'' of 1962 and the ``Flick Affair'' of 1983 come to mind,
pivotal moments when the postwar republic woke up first to its
stifling constraints on freedom and then to corruption at its
heart. But perhaps there has been nothing quite like the ``Kohl
Affair'' in its threefold drama: the dismantling of a demigod, the
burial of the ancien regime, the abrupt inversion of German
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was said when Helmut Kohl left office in 1998 that he had
gone straight from the chancellery into the history books. His
achievements over 16 years, in uniting Germany and binding the
country's fate to that of the European continent through the
introduction of the euro, were epochal. But now the underside of
that statesmanship _ secret bank accounts, bags of cash, bought
loyalty, servile aides, contempt for the law _ has emerged and,
with it, a need to review the Kohl chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A political and moral suicide'' was the crisp commentary of
the liberal weekly, Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   That power had a highly inflationary effect on Kohl's ego has
been known for some time. He never believed he could be defeated;
in the summer of 1998, Kohl threatened to fire his defense
minister, Volker Ruehe, just for mentioning in an interview that he
did not rule out being chancellor himself one day. His spreading
bulk was one measure of his ballooning self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   But hubris is one thing, crookedness another. That German Unity
could take over $1 million in secret payments, deposit the money in
secret party accounts, use it to cement his hold over the Christian
Democrats and then, when these activities were revealed in recent
weeks, flout his legal obligation to reveal the names of the donors
_ all this has had Germans asking whether they have suddenly awoken
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, however, is that they are not in Italy but in a new
Germany, one created by Kohl's very achievements. The country has
spent most of its modern history looking beyond its borders: to the
restive France on whose defeat the modern German state was founded,
to the victorious World War 1 powers that humiliated it, to the
eastern ``Lebensraum'' with which Hitler promised to overcome that
humiliation, to the Soviet threat, to its communist sibling state.
There was always a higher cause _ the stability of Germany itself _
for which domestic political battles, however ugly, had to be
fought.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl laid that chronic external turbulence to rest. He
settled the ``German question.'' Therein lies the enormity of his
achievement. He united the country, defined borders that are no
longer contested, bound the country irrevocably to the West. In a
sense, he made Germany a little duller. With these matters settled,
it is perhaps inevitable that German attention should now turn to
the internal workings of its political system.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear enough that, in Kohl's mind, the illicit activities
now emerging were subservient to his higher external goals. He
wanted complete party loyalty and highly centralized power in order
to pursue anchoring a united Germany in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was traumatized by the fall of Helmut Schmidt, a major
figure on the world stage whose rule ended because he lost control
of his party,'' said Hans-Peter Muller, a political analyst. ``Kohl
was ready to do anything, including use secret funds, to make damn
sure the Christian Democrats were not going to do that to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is still in an early stage. A criminal investigation
is underway. A parliamentary inquiry begins this week. Kohl has
been summoned as the first witness, and it is believed that he will
ultimately have to reveal the names of the secret donors. No
evidence has been found that the clandestine payments amounted to
bribes, but if any links were found to arms or real estate deals
the effect would be shattering.
</P>
<P>
   However the investigation develops, it seems clear that another
step has been taken in Germany's postwar political development. The
``Spiegel Affair,'' involving the arrest of the weekly magazine's
publisher, Rudolf Augstein, on charges of treason, was a critical
step toward the liberalization of the press _ and the general
environment _ in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Flick Affair,'' leading to the resignation of Economics
Minister Otto Graf Lambsdorff, revealed an ugly exchange of
corporate political donations and tax relief. After that, the
general view was that the air had been cleared. But perhaps it
could not be as long as there was a Cold War to fight, a Germany to
unify. Certainly, this seems to have been Kohl's view.
</P>
<P>
   But his era is ending, not in 1998, as it seemed, but at the
start of this new century. Now, as elsewhere in Europe, values of
transparency and accountability will take on central importance in
German politics. The Kohlian network of personal relations and
unbridled power were the politics of an abnormal state seeking an
elusive stability. Germany now wants to be ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it is safe to say the following: Wolfgang
Schauble, Kohl's protege and successor as leader of the Christian
Democrats, will be hard pressed to survive; Gerhard Schroeder, the
Social Democratic chancellor, has a new lease on life; Kohl will
not go quietly, either from the Bundestag or from his position as
honorary chairman of the party.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Kohl legacy, the history books? Friedbert
Pfluger, a young Christian Democrat, said that at recent party
meetings he had been greeted with the loudest applause when he said
Kohl was still the chancellor of German and European unity and
would always remain that. The rest, Pfluger added, would be an ugly
footnote. That sounds about right.

U.S. COURTING INDIA IN HOPE OF RESTARTING TRADE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite nuclear tensions and diplomatic false
starts that have dogged U.S. relations with India in recent years,
the Clinton administration plans to court India as an ally in
trying to restart global trade talks that collapsed in Seattle last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that closer cooperation will help defuse the
disputes between rich and poor countries that undermined the
Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the United States and India, the world's two largest
democracies, to forge a close friendship overnight. But
administration officials hope that upcoming high-level visits can
send the message that the rift between developing and developed
countries was confined to the chaotic Seattle meeting and did not
reflect a broader breakdown in globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers will visit India this week
for talks with senior Indian leaders on a range of international
economic and financial issues, including the best way to restore
confidence in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Summers will also pave the way for a visit to India by President
Clinton, tentatively scheduled for March, administration officials
said. It will be the first time a sitting U.S. president has
visited India since Jimmy Carter made the trip in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Seattle, there's definitely an economic challenge in
managing the integration between industrial and developing
countries,'' Summers said before leaving for India Saturday.
``India has had a major voice from the developing country
perspective. It's natural that the two largest democracies should
consider ways in which integration can be managed.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration is playing down the possibility of
tangible progress during Summers' trip, officials talk privately of
hopes that they are laying the groundwork for a ``quantum leap'' in
relations, forging a Third World-First World democratic alliance
that could prove warmer and more stable than U.S. ties with China
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, these officials say, the two sides would jointly find
ways to move globalization forward in a strategic dialogue that
would go beyond the often testy bilateral talks on regional
stability and nuclear proliferation in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that if we can find a meeting of the minds with Delhi,
that's a strong place to work the Third World,'' a Clinton
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   India, though also eager for better ties with the United States,
seems less optimistic about a breakthrough in the short term. Some
Indian officials are still smarting from what they characterized as
U.S. pressure tactics at the Seattle trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides agree that the time is ripe to create a more
positive atmosphere,'' said Naresh Chandra, India's ambassador in
Washington. ``But I think the U.S. will find that things move much
faster when we're not pushed.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of working out a new relationship with India was
on full display in Seattle. Apparently convinced that India might
back the U.S. trade agenda and help break an impasse with other
Third World countries, the Clinton administration put on a
full-court press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who visited the World Trade Organization negotiating
session to give a lift to the talks, seated himself next to
Murasoli Maran, India's commerce minister, at a business lunch.
Clinton also phoned Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee during the
negotiations, and Summers cajoled his Indian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, India stood four-square against the U.S. negotiating
position, deeply disappointing some U.S. officials. India was among
the developing countries that cried foul when the Clinton
administration pushed hard to link new trade talks to labor rights,
a position many developing countries viewed as a ruse to protect
workers in wealthy countries from competition.

   ``They hoped that India could be pried away'' from other
developing countries, Chandra said. ``But we do not believe that
trade and labor belong together.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials hope the time is right to push
ahead with diplomatic overtures to India. The two sides recently
broke a longstanding logjam over bilateral trade, with India
agreeing to stop requiring special permits for a range of imports.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the newly elected Indian government appears set
to open its market, speed up privatization of state-controlled
companies, increase economic growth and reduce the tangle of
regulation that has discouraged foreign investment. That should
provide the basis for a steady dialogue about common interests,
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of issues that have tended to distract
us,'' he said. ``My trip is in the spirit of building a more
cooperative relationship.''

ECUADOR'S SWITCH TO U.S. DOLLAR MAY BUY REPRIEVE FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ Just a week ago, President Jamil Mahuad of
Ecuador appeared to be finished, the only uncertainty about his
fate being whether he would resign or be forced from office by a
coup. But by announcing that he intends to replace the local
currency with the U.S. dollar, he has seemingly gained assurance
that he will survive to face at least the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a desperate, last-gasp measure, but he has bought
himself some time and got himself some oxygen,'' a Latin American
diplomat here said of the surprise move to try to establish
stability after months of an economic crisis. Mahuad made his
announcement in a televised speech Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat described the plan as a ``Hail Mary pass''
attempted because Mahuad ``was astute enough to realize the
probability that he would not be around on Friday'' if he relied
only on the state of national emergency he had decreed Jan. 6 for
this nation of 12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Radical though the shift to the U.S. dollar may be, most of the
evidence seems to indicate that Mahuad decided to make the change
more out of political expediency than ideological conviction. Just
days before the announcement, the former Central Bank president,
Pablo Better, noted in a resignation letter made public Wednesday
that Mahuad had dismissed the idea as ``a leap into the void.''
</P>
<P>
   As a short-term political tactic, however, dollarization has
worked even better than Mahuad, a Harvard-educated lawyer and
former mayor of Quito, had reason to expect.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken last week indicates that about 60 percent of
Ecuadoreans support Mahuad's decision and want to give
dollarization a chance to work.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of opposition parties, labor unions and Indian
organizations that was howling for Mahuad's resignation after the
sucre, the national currency, lost 20 percent of its value against
the dollar in the first week of the new year has been put on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this measure, Mahuad has been successful in changing the
national agenda, removing his person as the focus of debate and
substituting something else,'' said Simon Pachano, a professor at
the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences in Quito. ``We are
not talking now of when he will leave and who should replace him,
but whether this plan can work and is good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, protesters and opposition parties have shifted
their attack away from Mahuad to the dollarization program, which
they say will make the country poorer and limit its ability to make
decisions for itself. ``More than a dollarization of the economy,
this measure can be considered the Panamaization of the economy,''
said Leon Roldos, a Socialist legislator and rector of the
University of Guayaquil.
</P>
<P>
   The main group representing Indians, who constitute about
one-third of Ecuador's population, was planning to go ahead with an
indefinite campaign of civil disobedience beginning Saturday as
part of an effort to drive Mahuad from office. But a parallel
``people's parliament'' set up by Indians has also attacked the
plan, saying that it would ``dollarize poverty, privatize wealth
and repress the resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's general popularity has gotten a much-needed
bounce from the measure, though, with polls indicating that his job
approval rating has jumped to 22 percent from a dismal 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to see him make a decision, any decision,''
said Juan Manuel Urbina Palacios, a stationery store owner in
Quito. ``This government has been drifting for 18 months without
anyone at the helm, and the economy has gone to hell as a result.
Something had to be done to stop the collapse of the sucre before
we all went broke and starved to death, and I guess this plan is
worth a try.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has clearly gained some breathing space, Mahuad is by
no means considered out of danger yet. For one thing, the unending
political turmoil of recent years has left Ecuadoreans convinced
that their heads of state can be replaced at any time for any
reason _ and Mahuad is even weaker than some of his predecessors
because his party does not have a majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the country even had three presidents in one week.
Congress threw the eccentric but popular Abdala Bucaram out of
office on grounds of ``mental incompetence'' and, after a confusing
tussle, finally replaced him with Fabian Alarcon, a legislator who
is now facing corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bucaram, facing charges himself, finally fled to Panama. But in
order to gain his party's support for the legislation needed to put
dollarization into effect, Mahuad has had to agree to changes in
the criminal code expected to lead to the dropping of those charges
and Bucaram's return from exile. Given the transitory nature of
political alliances here, there would be more turmoil if Bucaram,
as most analysts here predict, came back and withdrew his support
for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   The president also continues to be held in low regard by the
armed forces, and he lost his best and most loyal intermediary with
the military when Jose Gallardo, a retired general, resigned as
minister of defense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a man, they have no respect for him,'' a diplomat here
said, describing how the military views Mahuad. ``And it amazes
them to have to stand up to their fellow citizens and defend
someone they view as corrupt and inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Pachano, the author of a book titled ``Chaotic Representation:
An Analysis of the Ecuadorean Electoral System,'' said, ``Unless
Mahuad can give clear signals that he will carry ahead the process
of reform, the lack of confidence in him as an individual will
continue to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he continued, ``people will say yes to the song
but no to the singer'' and demand that a stronger, more decisive
leader take Mahuad's place.

IN CHILE'S ELECTION, CANDIDATES CONVERGE IN CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ On paper, the choice that nearly 8 million
Chilean voters face on Sunday could not be starker.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Lagos, an austere Socialist, agnostic and the man
President Salvador Allende had picked as his ambassador to Moscow
before he was overthrown and killed in 1973, is the candidate of
the center-left coalition that has governed for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   His challenger is Joaquin Lavin, an ebullient, deeply Catholic
conservative who started his political career in Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's planning ministry and wrote several books defending the
dictator's economic record.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the many surprises of this tightly fought race has
been how Lagos, 61, has run to the right and Lavin, 46, has run to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   Although the election will probably be cast as historic whoever
wins _ Lagos would be the first Socialist president since Allende,
Lavin the first right-wing president since Pinochet _ the campaign
has been almost devoid of conflict, with both candidates skirting
discussion of human rights or any other of the sensitive issues
that make Chile's political past so painful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they are competing for an emerging majority that
rejects the political extremes: Christian Democrats, working-class
voters, tradition-bound women and a new, generally apolitical
generation that does not remember the 1973 military coup that
toppled Allende and brought Pinochet to power, or the intense
repression that followed it.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the small agricultural settlement
of Chepica, Lagos, whose party once pushed expropriations of
foreign enterprises and worker takeovers of factories, suggested
that he would be a reliable friend of business. ``Investors all
over the world want to invest here to cultivate our land and
promote our coastline and rivers,'' he said, ``and Chile will grow
as the money pours in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin, meanwhile, shared a stage in Santiago with Mapuche
Indians and working-class voters from around the country, promising
to better the educational opportunities of their children. ``I'm
going to govern for the poor,'' he said in what has become a stock
campaign line.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has highlighted a paradox of Chilean politics
today: a society with a long history of political polarization and
conflict now abhors confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Pinochet in the 15 months since he was detained
on charges of human rights abuses while seeking medical treatment
in London has helped submerge the rather messy political past. It
has particularly helped Lavin, who has been able to take a number
of liberal positions _ including a suggestion that military
spending can be cut _ without looking over his shoulder to see how
the former dictator would react.
</P>
<P>
   But both candidates have also shelved potentially hot social
issues, like whether divorce should be legalized or abortion
sanctioned to save the life of the mother _ issues that touch the
lives of millions in a Roman Catholic country with high rates of
illegal abortion and marriage separation.
</P>
<P>
   And neither man, nor Chile's rather passive and conservative
news media, has made more than passing mention of the arrests of
dozens of former military and police officers since Pinochet was
detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither candidate,'' said Loreto Rebolledo, an anthropologist
and journalism professor at the University of Chile, ``wants to
show himself to be a polarizer or extremist. So both are running as
centrists.''
</P>
<P>
   The news from London last week that a team of doctors has found
that Pinochet is too ill to stand trial and could return to Chile
as soon as this week added a potentially decisive new twist to the
campaign. The re-emergence of the former dictator could scare
centrist voters away from Lavin, some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But, even then, both candidates studiously kept to their scripts
on the stump, struggling to say as little as possible about the
general, who dominated politics here for almost two decades. Lavin
said he did not know whether he would have the time to welcome the
general at the airport on his probable return, while Lagos said he
could not celebrate the government's seeming diplomatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Both suggested that Pinochet, 84, could still face criminal
charges in Chile, although it is hard to imagine either pushing
very hard for a divisive trial. Lagos will need to assuage the
military, which remains a powerful political force and continues to
support its former commander. And Lavin is unlikely to upset his
conservative, pro-Pinochet base, or several former Pinochet allies
who are likely to hold high posts if he wins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of both candidates characterize their opponents as
Trojan horses who will show their true colors only after they are
inaugurated, and the rank-and-file activists for both men remain
highly polarized. Hinting at possible trouble if the election is
contested or even close, there has been a disturbing rise in
scuffles between the rival camps in recent days, and aides to the
two candidates have been trading charges of voter manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Lavin broke new ground for the right during the
campaign by visiting families of people who disappeared during the
Pinochet dictatorship, as a gesture of reconciliation. Last week,
he said he would ask the current defense minister, Edmundo Perez
Yoma, a Christian Democrat, to continue taking part in a new
dialogue between the military and human rights lawyers intended to
give families of the disappeared more information about them.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, for his part, startled some fellow Socialists by seeking
out icons of world capitalism like David Rockefeller so they could
appear together in photographs in the Chilean press. He is also
pushing a plan to attract foreign companies into joint ventures
with the state-owned copper concern, and pledging to hire more
police officers to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't aspire to the be the second Socialist president of
Chile,'' Lagos said in an interview last year. ``I aspire to be the
third president of the Concertacion,'' the ruling Christian
Democratic-Socialist coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos has run a sluggish, cautious campaign that has neither
excited his Socialist Party base nor instilled confidence in more
conservative Chileans. Lavin, with heavy financing from business,
has run a slick, marketing-driven campaign that enabled him to hold
Lagos, once seen as the runaway victor, to a virtual dead heat in
the first-round balloting last month.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Friday showed Lavin ahead by a whisker, 50.4
percent to 49.6 percent, with a margin of error of 2.1 percentage
points. The closeness of the race is in sharp contrast to the two
presidential elections since Pinochet stepped down in 1990, which
the center-left coalition won by landslides.

FRANCE PRODS U.N. TO HELP THE POOR GET AIDS DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As more international attention focuses on an
AIDS epidemic spreading out of control in a number of sub-Saharan
African countries and India, France is prodding the United Nations
to find ways to make cheaper drugs available to poor countries,
where treatment is beyond the means of most people who need it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also supports the cause championed by
France. But officials and AIDS experts contend that drug companies
have been resistant to pleas that they alter their pricing policies
or donate medicines to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Dejammet, France's representative at the United Nations,
proposed during an all-day Security Council meeting on the AIDS
crisis in Africa last Monday that a three-way conference be
convened to bring together rich nations, their pharmaceutical
companies and representatives of poorer countries in desperate need
of affordable medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Dejammet said the interests of pharmaceutical companies, who
fear the erosion of their patents on drugs developed at enormous
costs in research and testing, would have to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   He said that for this reason, France was proposing that the
companies and countries involved in both buying and selling drugs
get together to discuss how to avoid more confrontations over
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview Thursday that given the huge numbers of
AIDS cases in the developing world, treatment should not be
forgotten in the rush to support prevention efforts _ many of them
more educational than medical _ and the development of an AIDS
vaccine. The top 21 countries with the world's highest HIV
infection rates are all in Africa, and these nations are also among
the world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the same council session
Monday, also raised the question of how to make medicines more
readily available, an issue President Clinton had addressed at the
contentious World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also committed to helping poor countries gain access to
affordable medicines, including those for HIV/AIDS,'' Gore told the
Security Council. ``Last month, the president announced a new
approach to ensure that we take public health crises into account
when applying U.S. trade policy. We will cooperate with our trading
partners to assure that U.S. trade policies do not hinder the
efforts to respond to health crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the United States would add $150 million to next
year's budget for fighting AIDS. A third of that amount would go to
the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, which sponsors
medical research and works on the distribution of drugs to the
Third World. In total, the Clinton administration is seeking to
make $325 million available for the U.S. contribution to the
worldwide campaign against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Gore learned last year how complicated efforts to aid poorer
nations can be when negotiations with pharmaceutical companies are
involved. He drew protesters to his campaign rallies after he
presented the position of U.S. drug companies in talks with South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The talks concerned a 1997 South African law that allowed
imports of cheaper, but unlicensed, copies of U.S. drugs for AIDS
and opened the way for South African manufacturers to produce
generic versions of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Forty pharmaceutical companies responded by first lobbying the
South Africans and then filing a lawsuit. The suit was suspended in
September when South Africa said that the law would be re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet spelled out in detail how
the president will alter trade policy on pharmaceuticals, except on
a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Clinton said that the U.S. trade representative's
office would be responsible for assessing health crises in foreign
countries when governments charge that U.S. trade policy is
adversely affecting public health. The trade representative would
then have the authority to be ``flexible'' in making decisions in
disputes.

CONFERENCE SEEKS WAYS TO REDUCE HEROIN DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dr. Larry Campbell, chief coroner of British Columbia,
where deaths from drug overdoses have risen tenfold in the last
decade, to 407 last year, said he came to Seattle last week for one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to prevent these people from dying,'' Campbell
said, ``and I'd like to learn more about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell was attending an unusual conference here, ``Preventing
Heroin Overdose: Pragmatic Approaches,'' which was billed by its
sponsors as the first international gathering of experts to center
on the question of how deaths among heroin users can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The 400 people who attended gathered in a city that has a heroin
problem of its own: Seattle recorded a record number of
heroin-related deaths, 144, in 1998 and has one of the highest
per-capita rates of such deaths in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The conference included scholars, researchers, doctors and other
health care providers, drug-treatment providers and a handful of
police officials who discussed strategies for dealing with heroin
use.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategies, including needle-exchange programs and informal
pledges by the authorities not to prosecute drug users who call 911
or who are taken to emergency rooms by friends after an overdose,
are already being employed in some U.S. cities. Other approaches
are being gingerly experimented with, including distribution to
addicts of naloxone, a prescription drug that can counteract the
effects of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   But other strategies that health experts came from Europe to
discuss seem politically unimaginable here, including so-called
``safe injection rooms.'' In such places, drug users are allowed to
shoot heroin under the supervision of a trained staff, which can
ensure that needles are sterile or arrange for immediate medical
treatment in the event of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   The conference here was co-sponsored by the University of
Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute and by the Lindesmith
Center, a New York drug policy center that is financed by
billionaire George Soros and advocates alternatives that are more
liberal than the nation's drug policy. The Seattle police and
health departments were also listed as co-sponsors. The meeting had
extensive, and at times impassioned presentations that generally
favored an approach to drug abuse known in treatment circles as
``harm reduction.'' That approach is less focused on telling drug
abusers about the dangers of drugs than on getting them to use
drugs more safely.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the approach say that many drug abusers have heard
the ``just say no'' message countless times _ ``They hear it every
day of their lives,'' said Heather Meschery, director of a
needle-exchange program in Santa Cruz, Calif. _ but are determined
to use drugs anyway. The effort, these advocates say, should be on
minimizing the harm they can do to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Urban Weber, director of an agency that runs two of the four
safe-injection rooms in Frankfurt, Germany, said that the approach
had helped reduce overdose deaths there from 147 in 1992, shortly
before the injection program began, to 26 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is simply about keeping people alive,'' Weber said. ``We
say it's safer to do it here than on the streets.'' And, like many
of the advocates here, he rejected the notion that such places
encourage drug use, especially among the uninitiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is by no means an attractive place to see,'' Weber said.
``It is not like going to a cafe and having a beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Several officials from U.S. cities at the conference said the
point was not to adopt all such approaches now in use around the
world, but to get experts together to hear what was being tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one size fits all model to this problem,'' said
Dr. Alonzo Plough, the director of public health for Seattle and
surrounding King County, which operates one of the first and
largest needle-exchange programs for drug users, and is formulating
plans for a broader initiative to combat heroin-related deaths and
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good to see the range of things that have worked in
other places,'' Plough said. ``It's clear that not all those
approaches will work in any one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith Center, whose
critics say it undermines drug control efforts, was less restrained
in endorsing the ideas presented here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could cut heroin overdoses in half if the information from
this conference was widely disseminated,'' Nadelmann said.

   SCHOOL-MICROCASTS _ WASHINGTON _ Only 300 or so of the nation's
115,000 schools have applied for and gotten one of the 1,000 free
satellite dishes offered by Echostar Communications of Littleton,
Colo., so that school leaders can get monthly briefings on
security, violence reduction and detection of serious mental health
problems in youth. The first monthly ``microcast'' will be Jan. 20.
Three federal departments, the National Education Association and a
dozen other big associations of K-12 educators co-sponsor the
effort, which was announced by President Clinton last June.
Organizers say they still expect success because lots of schools
already had satellite dishes. (Mollison, Cox News Service) EDs:

   APACHE-INVESTIGATION _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army has launched
a special investigation into a complex flight-control system
suspected in more than 60 aviation incidents involving Apache
helicopters, including a much-publicized May 5, 1999, crash near
Kosovo that killed both pilots. At least three major accidents
since 1985 are linked to problems with the Apache's flight control
system, a Dayton Daily News examination found. In addition, the
examination found, the same system remains a suspect in at least
two other major crashes. One of them is the crash near Kosovo,
which is now part of a separate U.S. Justice Department
examination, the Daily News has learned. The other is a December
1997 crash near Fort Hood, Texas, which also killed both pilots.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 3 to 6 inches of snow will blanket parts of northern and
eastern New England on Sunday as a low-pressure system from Ontario
draws Atlantic moisture over a dome of obstinate cold air banked
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, arctic air will retreat across parts of the
southern New England and northern Middle Atlantic states, but the
retreat will be short-lived. For, in the wake of the Ontario low,
another blast of Arctic air will arrive for Sunday night and
Monday, accompanied again by strong winds from the north-northwest.
</P>
<P>
   By early Sunday morning, the Arctic invasion will be underway
across the upper Midwest, where bands of moderate to locally heavy
snow showers and squalls will spurt off the relatively tepid waters
of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, precipitation will be widespread across the Far West,
aided and abetted by a extremely wide plume of mid-level moisture
from the eastern Pacific. Along the West Coast, a compact but
potent disturbance will produce fitful showers of rain from western
Washington to central California Sunday morning, with a few
thunderstorms, perhaps with small hail in parts of western Oregon
and northwest California. The disturbance will produce a burst of
snow early in the northern Sierra Nevada, with the burst shifting
to the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The broad Pacific plume of moisture will aid snows in the
Wasatch and Unitas of Utah, with snowfalls in the latter mountain
range challenging 2 feet by Monday morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Chill Wind &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, at the summit of Mt. Washington in northern New
Hampshire, temperatures hovered near minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit
while winds gusted to 100 mph. This combination produced wind-chill
values below minus 100 degrees. Though such a value warrants
extreme caution, it has little physiological basis. Wind-chill
values are an artificial attempt to measure the cooling power of
the wind on exposed human skin. Originally, wind-chill values were
tabulated by Paul Siple circa 1940, when he measured how fast water
in plastic containers froze under varying Antarctic wind
conditions.

 PRAGMATIC McCAIN IS CONSERVATIVE WITH A POPULIST STREAK  
 (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not long into his campaign appearances, Sen. John
McCain often jokes about two Arizona mentors, one from the right
and one from the left.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls how a nostalgic Barry Goldwater once told him that if
he had defeated Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 presidential race,
then McCain would never have languished in a Vietnamese prison
camp. ``I said, `You're right, Barry. It would have been a Chinese
prison camp,''' McCain winds up. ``He was not amused by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else he tells how Rep. Morris Udall walked into a New
Hampshire barbershop during the 1976 Democratic presidential
primary campaign and said, ```Hi. I'm Mo Udall, and I'm running for
president of the United States.' And the barber said, `Yeah, we
were just laughing about that this morning.'''
</P>
<P>
   The stories break the ice and send the crowds into peals of
laughter. But they also do something more. They show that McCain is
someone who can reach across party lines, and they signal what is
to come: a tour de force by a candidate who at times can seem hard
to place along the modern ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   What is puzzling about this is that across his 17 years in
Congress, McCain has had a rock-solid conservative voting record
except for his defiance of his party leaders on campaign finance
overhaul and antitobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition gave him perfect scores on its top
issues for years until he dropped to a 73 percent rating in 1998.
The liberal Americans for Democratic Action, by contrast, has never
given him more than a 20 percent rating in the last decade, and in
the two years after Republicans took control of Congress the group
gave him a score of zero.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the campaign trail, McCain's passions are more populist
than traditionally conservative as he bashes ``lobbyists in $1,000
suits'' or criticizes Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut as too skewed
toward the rich, saying that he does not think Bill Gates needs a
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought that Republicans were mostly concerned
about the working men and women of America,'' McCain says. ``I
didn't know our concern was the wealthiest.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly McCain strikes conservative themes, too, such as when
he calls for a permanent ban on Internet taxation or points out
that his voting record has been steadily anti-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is an avowed small-government conservative who time and
again agrees with his questioners that programs deserve more money
and who just this week proposed a new government post for a
``reform czar.'' He wants to try out school vouchers, but will not
take money away from public schools to do so. Instead, he proposes
to raise the money for the pilot project by closing some corporate
tax subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   McCain can even sound remarkably like a Democrat when he says,
``Too many Americans go to sleep at night desperately fearing
illness or injury to themselves or a family member because they are
without health insurance to pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he rejects ideas like former Sen. Bill Bradley's plan
for universal health care coverage as ``big government solutions''
and admits, ``I don't claim to have some silver bullet'' to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's friends and supporters say that what is on display is
the thinking and improvisation of a man who hates dogma and canned
answers, who is more of a Goldwater iconoclast than a movement
conservative, and who, despite his rebel cries, is a conciliator
who wants to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   He is visibly uncomfortable when he has to deal with the
polarizing social issues that have come so much to define left and
right in American politics. That may be part of the reason he
botched the incendiary issue of the Confederate battle flag flying
in South Carolina, when he tried to see both sides this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the process _ hardly in the spirit of the bus he calls the
Straight Talk Express _ he first said that the flag was a symbol of
``racism and slavery'' and then later in a written clarification
aligned himself with the pro-flag movement by calling the banner a
``symbol of heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John doesn't see things in a doctrinaire way,'' said Sen.
Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., one of McCain's closest friends in the Senate.
``He understands that issues are complicated. He's not afraid to
think out of the box.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel acknowledged: ``Sure he walks himself into minefields; he
walks himself into swamps. That's the down side in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who has worked closely with McCain on
foreign policy, said: ``I think what John is is a pragmatist. He
wants to get things done. He wants to find a place of common
sense.'' Kerry added: ``He's still very conservative. People make a
mistake not to know this.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the tone of McCain's campaign comes from his own gut
instincts and reactions to people. The senator, who is running
things on a shoestring, has only one full-time issues aide, John
Raidt.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledges that in areas like health care, ``I'm not as
comfortable with it as issues I grew up with.'' Sometimes at his
town hall meetings he simply tells a questioner that he does not
have an answer and says, ``I'll be glad to educate myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An admission of not knowing all the answers is sometimes well
received,'' he muses to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cites Theodore Roosevelt as a role model, and his
campaign tries to pull together all the disparate threads of his
thinking into a Roosevelt-style Republicanism that challenges the
party's big-business establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, the model for McCain is TR,'' said Marshall
Wittmann, a congressional analyst at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, who is part of McCain's kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt ``was inherently conservative, a very conservative man
believing in the institutions of America,'' Wittmann said. ``But he
also prodded these institutions to reform,'' he added. ``He was the
great trust buster, so he could give more legitimacy to
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans, however, say McCain is straying too far from
his party's orthodoxy. After traveling with McCain one day
recently, William Bennett, the former secretary of education who
has been advising both McCain and Bush, said he told the senator he
needed more of a ``theme to this pudding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You know you're being outflanked here,''' Bennett
said. ``People wonder whether you're calling your conservative
voting record into question. You need to show some passion on a
couple of conservative issues on which you have a record already,
like missile defense or school vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as the first votes of the primary season near, has sought
to galvanize his party's conservative base. Originally Bush tried
to run from the center as if already in the general election
campaign, using his ``compassionate conservatism'' to distinguish
himself from the harder-edged conservatism of Congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with McCain drawing support from independents and
moderates, Bush has tried to paint himself as the true conservative
of the duo. He has charged that the senator's ideas on campaign
finance law would ``hurt Republicans and hurt the conservative
cause.'' He has put heavy emphasis on his sweeping tax-cut proposal
and constantly tries to tie McCain to Vice President Al Gore,
saying that they are the ``two voices'' in the campaign who say his
plan is too large.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in South Carolina, McCain has been sounding
conservative themes. He has been running ads in which Rep. Lindsey
Graham speaks of McCain's ``17-year pro-life voting record'' and
says that McCain ``has voted to take pornography off the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is clear on the stump that he yearns for a middle ground
even on intractable matters like abortion. He regularly says that
single-issue groups have made ``a cause into a business,'' and he
implores people on both sides to work together to improve foster
care and make adoption easier. ``I'm tired of the polarization that
exists on this issue,'' he told one ardent anti-abortion voter in
New Hampshire recently, after saying that though he is
anti-abortion he would not use that as a litmus test for
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing better illustrates McCain's desire for dialogue
than his friendship across party lines with Kerry, a decorated Navy
lieutenant who came home from Vietnam and led protests against the
war while McCain was being tortured in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   One night almost a decade ago, the two senators found themselves
sitting across from each other on a military transport plane flying
a congressional delegation to Kuwait after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The two not only became close friends, but they also worked
together to bring about normalization of U.S. relations with
Vietnam. Sometimes McCain tells his audiences how Vietnam veterans
searching for reconciliation are returning to see the country where
they fought and taking their children with them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry says he has watched his friend change and grow to become
the remarkably unguarded presidential candidate he is now. ``John
was more closed,'' Kerry said. ``I think he would have shut people
out faster. He would have shut ideas out faster.''

   Why Iowa? And Why New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Should Iowa, which holds the nation's first
presidential caucuses, and New Hampshire, which holds the first
primaries, be allowed to dominate the early going in the nominating
process?
</P>
<P>
   It's an old question. But once again it is up for consideration,
with Iowans scheduled to caucus only eight days from now and New
Hampshirites set to vote just eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who fare poorly in either or both states could very
well end up dropping out of the race, unable to raise enough money
to continue because they will be perceived as weak. That is what
has happened so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of this early winnowing system contend that it is
unfair and no way to begin picking the leader of the world's most
powerful nation. They argue that neither state is typically
American, with Iowa being too rural and New Hampshire too small.
</P>
<P>
   Iowans and New Hampshirites do not see it that way, of course.
They say their states are ideal political laboratories because
voters in both states still insist on ``retail politicking'' _
getting to know and test candidates firsthand, at town-meeting
style forums, in coffee shops and, indeed, in their own living
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, they argue, candidates
must have a ``ground game'' of hand shaking, eye contact and
one-on-one conversations because the ``air game'' of television
sound bites and advertising blitzes so often used elsewhere just
won't cut it in Hawkeye and Granite country.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a lot of political hokum?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say. But consider:

   Earlier this month, when The Des Moines Register polled Iowans
whom it considered likely to vote in caucuses on Jan. 24, one of
every three said they had met at least one candidate in this
election cycle. More to the point, one in four reported meeting the
candidate of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier survey in New Hampshire found that one of every five
voters had met at least one candidate, and often two, three or
more.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, a voter could probably go close to a lifetime
without meeting a presidential candidate.

   A Kennedy Stirs The Political Waters
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maryland's lieutenant governor and a
daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, showed up in Des Moines the other
day to campaign for an old political friend, Vice President Al
Gore. And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left town _ this being Iowa and she being a
Kennedy _ there was speculation that maybe, just maybe, she was
testing the presidential waters a bit herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, she told The Des Moines Register, noting that she was
considering running for governor in Maryland and therefore was
``committed to Maryland politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she added, ``For a good period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that meant, if anything, it didn't quiet the buzz that
followed her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, proclaimed that ``she has a
legitimate shot to be the first woman president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   And two Democratic legislators in Iowa agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has all the makings,'' said state Rep. Pam Jochum of
Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got that Kennedy flair,'' added state Rep. Polly Bukta of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A Call for Action On Matters of Faith
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Interfaith Alliance, a five-year-old
national organization of religious leaders and members of some 50
faiths and movements, expressed concern that while White House
hopefuls were increasingly talking about their religious beliefs,
they were nevertheless failing to live up to them on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance urged all the presidential candidates to reject
``degrading, disparaging or demeaning'' personal attacks and to
avoid ``innuendo or stereotyping or references likely to
dehumanize.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after several debates in which White House aspirants
discussed their personal faith at considerable length, comes
another expression of concern about mixing politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Industrial Areas Foundation, a national
organization of church-based community action groups that seeks to
improve the wages and living conditions of the poor, is calling on
candidates to back up their professions of faith with concrete
action.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally a few days ago at St. John's Episcopal Church in
Washington, across Lafayette Square from the White House, leaders
of the organization declared that they would follow the candidates
``to New Hampshire, Delaware, the Hamptons and the Texas hill
country, if necessary'' to pressure them to halt ``the rhetoric of
religiosity that permeates the presidential campaign.'' Instead,
the foundation speakers said, candidates should put their professed
faith in action by working nonstop on ``the central public issue of
this period,'' closing the gap between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want a moratorium on the empty religious rhetoric from the
presidential candidates,'' said Bishop John Hurst Adams, the senior
bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. ``We demand that
they address the real faith issue of our time. We will not let this
issue go.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Virginia Democrat Thinks Independent
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Virgil Goode, a Democrat from Virginia's solidly
conservative 5th Congressional District, often breaks party ranks
and votes Republican. In fact, he breaks ranks so often that
Republicans leaders, scrambling to keep their narrow edge in the
House, are pressing him to seek re-election this fall as one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, and if Republicans hold onto the House, party
leaders have hinted, he would be in line for some congressional
power perks. And if he doesn't, some have hinted darkly that, well,
it now looks like Republicans will be in political command of the
Old Dominion come redistricting time in 2001, and as a Democrat he
just might find himself gerrymandered out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The talk in state political circles is that Goode has about
decided to split things down the middle and run as an independent,
trusting he can keep his seat in the House by pulling conservative
votes from every political direction in the district, which is in
south-central Virginia and is fairly evenly divided between
Democrats and Republicans, with many of the Democrats as
conservative as any Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Then, so the talk goes, if Goode makes it back to Capitol Hill,
he plans to strike a deal with Republican leaders, agreeing to vote
mostly Republican in committees and on the floor in return for some
power perks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan may or may not work, and there is some talk that if
he wins as an independent he may end up dickering with both
parties. But in any case, it is not a unique plan. Rep. Bernard
Sanders of Vermont, the only independent in the House, worked out
such a deal with House Democratic leaders years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Are Term Limits The Final Answer?
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican from Jacksonville, Fla.,
said last fall that she was thinking about breaking her pledge to
serve only four terms in the House, U.S. Term Limits, the leading
term-limits advocacy organization, began saturating her district
with sharply worded television and radio advertisements accusing
her of political dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago she announced that she would stick by her
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just in case some of her constituents had missed her
announcement and might be left with the impression that she was
just another politically dishonest public servant, she took the
unusual step of running television commercials explaining what she
had done and why.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits was impressed, and last week it took an unusual
step of its own. It began running advertisements congratulating Ms.
Fowler for doing ``the right thing'' and for being ``a person of
real character.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: In the case of Rep. George Nethercutt, a Republican
from Spokane, Wash., who has broken a term limits pledge, U.S. Term
Limits is stepping up its broadcast criticism. Its latest
commercial, a takeoff on the television game show ``Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire,'' goes like this, in part:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Welcome to `Try to Be a Millionaire.' Name the
Washington state politician who said, `Your word is your bond,' and
then broke his word. Is it Tom Foley, Slade Gorton or George
Nethercutt?''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: ``Well, the politician best known for breaking his
word is George Nethercutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: ``Final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``You're right! Nethercutt's the one who broke his
word.''
</P>

EDITORIAL: BLOCKING NEW YORK VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush prides himself on his little-d democratic
style in his home state of Texas, but he has now fallen under the
spell of New York's exclusionary politics. In his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination, Bush has joined a plot by New
York state party leaders to bounce his leading competitor, Sen.
John McCain, from the March 7 presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   By filing objections to McCain's petitions in congressional
districts around New York state, Bush and New York's top Republican
leaders, Gov. George Pataki and the GOP chairman, William Powers,
have set the stage for challenging the McCain effort to get on New
York's ballot. A spokesman for the state party has said that any
challenge to McCain's access effort would be solely to ``protect
the integrity of the primary process'' in New York. Not so. These
objections are not about integrity; they are about narrowing the
choice for New York voters. They are about letting party leaders
control the names of candidates on the state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   State rules for adding a candidate's name to this year's ballot
are slightly different for Democrats and Republicans, but both
parties require thousands of voters' signatures on petitions, an
outdated political tactic that effectively limits choices to the
parties' favorites in the name of assessing a candidate's
grass-roots support in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For Democratic voters this year, primary choices will probably
include Al Gore, Bill Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche, who each
received more than the 5,000 required signatures statewide. For
Republicans, who need more than 20,000 signatures gathered under
intentionally difficult guidelines, Bush and Steve Forbes are the
only two candidates with almost certain access to ballots in all 31
congressional districts. McCain managed to get enough signatures
for only 25 districts. Other Republican contenders decided to
bypass the state altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Republican signatures has become an especially tricky
business because of a time limit of about 30 days and a requirement
that voters can sign only one candidate's petition. So, when
Republican Party regulars snared more than 90,000 signatures for
Bush, they also made those 90,000 names automatically off limits
for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   What most New Yorkers do not realize is that challenging these
signatures is a seasonal industry, providing thousands of dollars
of legal and paralegal work for a swarm of veteran nitpickers
around the state. They follow a list of requirements with surgical
precision, excising the name, for example, of someone who says he
lives in the village of Montauk, not the town of East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this unfairness, the state's party leaders are satisfied
at their lean ballot offering. There are no plans for Pataki,
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver to reopen the state's ballots so that candidates can be
chosen by voters, not a few party bigwigs. What is worse, Bush also
seems content to run in this skewed contest.
</P>
<P>
   William Dal Col, the campaign chairman for Forbes, who spent
about $750,000 to get on New York's ballot, fumed last week at the
expense and effort. ``The Berlin Wall fell 10 years ago in
Germany,'' he said. ``When will it fall in New York?'' That is a
good question.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``Start locking them up,'' Police Commissioner
John F. Timoney ordered as he saw enough of the latest crime
statistics from a particularly rough southwest neighborhood. As he
frowned, the depredations flashed onto a giant computer screen at
his weekly meeting with field commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's out of control out there,'' he declared, a
touch of his old side-of-the-mouth, New York Police Department
roots showing in his annoyance. ``I mean, two cars exchanging
gunfire before innocent civilians,'' he said. ``That's crazy. We
need a sense of urgency out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous glances were exchanged in the gathering of dozens of
subordinate brass in the Philadelphia police academy's gymnasium as
the commissioner made it clear he wanted a flood of personnel to
confront the raucous southwest drug scene. No one disagreed with
the commissioner until a respected 29-year veteran of the force,
Inspector Joe O'Connor, politely took it upon himself to warn
against police ``panic,'' noting that to shift too many officers
from such perpetually troubled areas as Sunrise might prove
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney beamed at the back talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't mistake a sense of urgency for panic, Joe,'' he said
with a smile and a glare that cut the room like a laser. ``We're
hemorrhaging in southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Up from Dublin by way of a street beat in the South Bronx and a
prodigious rise to the No. 2 spot in the police hierarchy of New
York City, John Timoney is obviously in control as he completes his
second year as Philadelphia commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, he was bolstered at the command meeting by a computer
specialist recruited to pump out each new deed and pattern of crime
in the high-tech manner Timoney revels in. He was also gauging,
praising and challenging his subordinates for the usual three hours
of face-to-face dialogue, repeatedly invoking ``shoe leather''
policing as the point of all the sophisticated tracking of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders of the department engaged in this edgy new
thrust-and-parry, the Timoney touch was clearly on the job in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides _ the bottom-line statistic among police professionals
measuring success _ have fallen markedly across the commissioner's
reign. There were 420 in the city in 1997, then 338 in his first
year, as he began drastically revamping the department's analytical
and operational methods, and 295 last year _ the first time in 16
years the toll was under 300.
</P>
<P>
   Until lately, this city, like Baltimore and Washington, had been
resisting some of the national drop in crime. And now, in the same
way Philadelphia turned to the generation of New York leadership
groomed under former Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, a new
mayor in Baltimore has signed on Edward T. Norris, New York's
deputy commissioner of operations, to take on the day-to-day
running of its Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   This city's satisfaction with Timoney was made clear during the
recent campaign for mayor as the major candidates praised his work
and vied in their promises to keep him on the job. Mayor John F.
Street called the commissioner soon after his victory to go out on
two of the precinct roll-call drop-ins that have become the Timoney
signature.
</P>
<P>
   But still more satisfying to the commissioner seems to be the
back talk of Joe O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's a good cop,'' the commissioner said after the weekly
``compstat'' meeting. This is a command technique adapted from the
New York Police Department that is a high-intensity blend of
careful information and candid vetting of police performance. It is
at the heart of the shake-up of the 7,000-member force Timoney has
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lie told in law enforcement is, `We work well
together,''' the commissioner said, noting that the tradition had
been for commissioners to stay in their five-star bunkers. The
method he learned and helped develop in New York was to get in the
face of the police officers and share ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compstat is a great forum for really talented people _ you
spot them right away,'' along with the phonies, he said, heading to
a meeting of city elders. On the way, he stopped at a funeral
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cop's kid shot himself,'' the commissioner said as he
offered his city a hard-eyed look, driving through it without a
siren or flasher. ``Wonderful kid. No explaining it.'' A sidewalk
crowd of mourners, many of them from the job, took careful note as
the commissioner arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning friends and influencing enemies is time well spent,''
Timoney, 51, later explained, emphasizing the need to show up at
the scene of the city's cares and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a street officer, he learned Spanish and ran marathons to
stay in shape. Now, while an ailing foot heals, he journeys from
his home in Rittenhouse Square and relives a classic Thomas Eakins
tableau three days a week, rowing on the city's shimmering river.
The serenity is a needed tonic, for the commissioner acknowledges
that he is frustrated by regular run-ins with the city's police
union and by the iron hand he says the city's board of outside
arbitrators exercises in protecting what he considers wayward
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even give detective shields out,'' he complained of
the city's heavy civil service tradition. ``The only way to change
it is to take them head on and use the bully pulpit every chance I
get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't underestimate the better instincts of cops,'' he said of
his reaching out to the rank and file by praise and prod. ``Don't
underestimate their need for a pat on the back, to be on a winning
team, on the cutting edge of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said he was fortunate the city has strong news
media. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently uncovered a years-old
problem of the department's miscategorizing some possible rape
cases. Timoney ordered a review and tightened the procedures under
which charges are investigated, but also quarreled with the
sweeping tone of the articles.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the Timoney department include an intense program
other forces are studying for dealing with the abuses of racial
profiling. ``When I came here, cops were getting credit for the
number of people they simply stopped every month,'' he said. ``Can
you believe that nonsense? We've reduced our stops by 50 percent.
You get credit when you lock them up.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said he most likely was working toward a ``burnout''
period two or three years hence when, he said, he might move to
federal law enforcement. ``Right now, my selfish ancillary goal is
to keep the feds out of Philadelphia,'' he said emphatically,
referring to the half-dozen federal court restrictions the
demoralized force was under when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In demanding the best of his new blue line, Timoney made sure
his most cherished mentors were at his swearing in: former
Commissioners Bratton, Raymond W. Kelly and Benjamin Ward of New
York. He seeks their advice, but he also holds dear the street
maxim he learned from his old South Bronx patrol partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name was Richie Sable, a tough, good cop, and he would
always say the mission of the police is to protect the most
vulnerable _ children and the elderly _ against the bullies and
cowards. For them, my cops here will take that extra step.''

 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The runway is 4,300 feet long, and the pilot's
manual says the corporate jet needs 4,000 feet. Can it land there?
</P>
<P>
   That depends on how the plane is owned, and even federal
regulators say the rules governing questions like this no longer
make sense because of widespread changes in the financial
arrangements that people make when they fly in business jets.
</P>
<P>
   Under a decades-old rule, charter operators follow one set of
guidelines, and corporate jets follow another. But a new class of
owners has suddenly blossomed outside either category, and that is
causing an uproar in aviation safety circles: those who have shares
in a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Charter flights _ air taxis, in effect _ must operate under
strict, airline-style rules. Charter clients are not expected to
know enough to make their own decisions about runway lengths,
weather or how tired a pilot might be. And the plane must be able
to land without using more than 60 percent of the runway's length.
</P>
<P>
   The company plane that ferries executives, on the other hand,
has looser rules; the owner is supposed to know more about safety,
and to take on more responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, 1,600 companies or individuals have
bought ``fractional shares'' in business jets, an ownership
arrangement akin to buying a week at a time-share condominium. And
no one is sure what rules should apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, scrambling to keep up, has
set up an advisory panel made up of members of the different
segments of the industry to draft new rules by the end of the
month. Agency officials are determined to change the safety rules
for business jets and to stay on top of the new economic
arrangements, before a crash forces them to act.
</P>
<P>
   People in the industry say that the crash of such a plane would
hurt business aviation, even planes operated as charters.
</P>
<P>
   Shared operations now rival airlines in the number of planes and
pilots. Some say they adhere to airline-style rules, but they do
not get airline-style oversight from the Federal Aviation
Administration, and critics say some operators, especially smaller
ones, may take advantage of looser rules. Those rules include
these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter and airline pilots may work 14 hours a day, including
no more than 10 hours at the controls; corporate pilots have no
limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter pilots must have a weather report from the ground
before they may begin an approach; corporate pilots may begin the
approach, take a look and make their own judgment. Corporate pilots
also have looser limits on weather acceptable for takeoffs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charter operators must have a maintenance plan approved by the
FAA, with work done by mechanics screened for drugs; corporate
pilots may use any licensed mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the new type of ownership has meant more flexibility in
flying. Mark Fruchter, an air charter operator in Reading, Pa., had
two clients who wanted to charter his Beechjet to Hilton Head,
S.C., which has a 4,000-foot runway. He flies that plane there with
his family, but his customers were stymied by the rule about runway
length. Now they are fractional owners of an eight-passenger
corporate jet offered by one of Fruchter's competitors, and make
the flight routinely.
</P>
<P>
   To others, the looser rules may have brought too much freedom. A
fractionally owned Learjet 60, operated by Bombardier Aerospace on
a flight from Dulles International Airport outside Washington, had
brake trouble while landing at Hyannis, Mass., and ran off the
runway, destroying the plane. No one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The crash is still under investigation, but an FAA official
studying safety issues for corporate aviation pointed out that if
the flight had been a charter it would never have been allowed to
land at Hyannis, because the runway is shorter than called for
under charter rules.
</P>
<P>
   To charter a plane, said Jack Olcott, the president of the
National Business Aviation Association, all you need is ``a credit
card and a Yellow Pages.'' Such people should be protected from
risk, Olcott said. People or corporations who own their own planes
are much more sophisticated, and have earned the right to decide
what is an acceptable level of safety, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your lawyers get very deeply involved,'' he said. ``As an
owner, you're liable for that airplane even though you're not in
it. Nobody goes into fractional ownership with the same degree of
naivete that they book a charter flight.''
</P>
<P>
   But others in the industry say people who used to charter planes
but now own fractional shares to fly 100 to 200 hours a year
probably know little about the details of operating the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate-type aviation, whether by charter or under fractional
ownership, is extremely safe. No passengers have died in
fractionals in seven years, and other than the crash that killed
golfer Payne Stewart last year no deaths have occurred on charter
trips in the period.
</P>
<P>
   And the web of rules about safety, financing and ownership can
have perverse complications. A company bringing Stewart to Dallas
said it would pay for his flight. Even though he was a fractional
owner of a Learjet, he could not use it for hire _ it would then
have to meet the stricter rules for charter operations. So Stewart
chartered a different plane, which crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory group's meetings have been bitter at times,
participants say, with huge financial stakes apparent to all sides.
Charter operators contend that management companies for fractional
owners have prospered under looser regulations. Fractional
advocates say they actually operate at a high level of safety, with
potential purchasers often sending in auditors to evaluate safety
programs that are in many ways stricter than those used by
corporate flight departments or airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants say the panel is developing a hybrid rule,
borrowing some sections from the rule on charters and airlines and
some from the section on private planes. Whether this will pass
muster with the FAA remains to be seen; some officials there have
said they would be uneasy about adopting the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree one one thing: that the way the rules are
finally written and put into effect will be an important test for
the industry and the regulators, who often find themselves racing
to catch up with new economic models for aviation that have an
unexpected impact on safety.

   ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's hit series about a New Jersey crime
family, will begin its second season Sunday, and from billboards
and bus stops all across the city Livia Soprano, the
passive-aggressive materfamilias, stares out at us like the
spokesperson for some hostile search engine. Her doe-eyed son, Tony
_ the Anyman of the series _ stares at us too, as do his wife,
Carmella, his therapist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi, and the rest of his
crew. Last season ``The Sopranos'' was the kind of surprise that
television rarely delivers, a comic drama marked by sensitive
pacing and unpredictability. What made it work were the Jersey
locations, the writing and a remarkable cast of players, including
Nancy Marchand, James Gandolfini, Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
</P>
<P>
   What also made it work, of course, was the fact that America
loves nothing more than a good mob story. But for every ironic take
on the subject, every ``Married to the Mob'' or ``Prizzi's Honor,''
there are a dozen films, like ``The Godfather'' or ``Once Upon a
Time in America,'' that aspire to transcend the genre or merely
blow it out of proportion. Whatever the crude realities of
organized crime may be, the movies have long since developed a
myth, a stylization, of mob behavior that is self-sustaining. It is
the kind of myth that depends, like the Western, on the
sociological marginality of its subject. There were never many
gunfighters in the American West, and there have never been many
mobsters in American cities. By now, the number of actors who have
played made men over the years probably exceeds the number of men
who were ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Still the fascination endures, and ``The Sopranos'' helps
explain why. Tony Soprano may be the lead character, but the
ethical vision of the series is framed by his wife and his
therapist. For all the menace Tony projects, for all his struggles
with the nature of manhood, fatherhood and clan leadership, these
two tough, insightful women make it clear that Tony is also
struggling with the very idea of the mob. A Mafia tale is usually a
tale about ethnic insularity, a lingering reflection of the
immigrant experience in a vast new nation. The mob is often
portrayed as an oasis of tradition, a society with a clear vision
of authority and fraternity, a refuge for men of sentiment, a place
where a certain social insecurity is veiled by the tightness of
family and the threat of force.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tony that insecurity is plainly visible. He never gets to
play Don Corleone, the old-world gentleman whose violence is so
beautifully sublimated among the tomato vines. When Tony resorts to
violence, he looks like the thug he is. There is nothing balletic
about him except his inexplicable sense of loss, nothing courtly
except his anxiety. He does not realize that he is caught in an
adolescent fantasy about manhood until he plays golf with his
white-collar suburban neighbors. They respond to him much the way
Gandolfini, the actor who plays Tony, must find his fans responding
nowadays, with a credulity that reinforces the fantasy Dr. Melfi is
working so hard to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, half the fun of watching ``The Sopranos'' is watching
a family that is really a paramilitary organization. The tensions
that normally surface in family life are forced underground,
ultimately making them that much more lethal. In this family, as in
every family, the veneer sometimes cracks. But for the viewer,
there is a kind of vicarious freedom in knowing that when it does,
instead of silence around the dinner table, there will be no limit
to the repercussions, no end to the havoc let loose.

<P>
   KATZRIN, Golan Heights _ Everybody here knows Moshe Zaidon, the
white-haired manager of a local cafeteria, who walks the pleasant,
orderly streets with a sense of ownership that many of the pioneer
settlers possess. ``There goes Moshe from the cafeteria,'' people
say, and they wave.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't know, however, because it is a hard thing for Zaidon
to admit, that for more than two decades he has possessed a
deep-seated belief that the time would come when they all would
have to pull up stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew from the beginning that we were living on Syrian
land,'' said Zaidon, 59. He was reclining in his favorite
leatherette chair in his immaculate living room, which is decorated
with Laurel and Hardy figurines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, the Golan became by law an inseparable part of
Israel,'' he continued. ``But deep inside, I knew this day might
arrive. If there was a chance of peace with the Syrians, I always
knew that we were the bargaining chip.''
</P>
<P>
   With the revival of the Israeli-Syrian peace effort after a
nearly four-year stalemate, the Golan Heights, a scenic northern
region replete with gorges, waterfalls and sometimes snow-capped
mountain peaks, has entered a state of flux. On the surface, the
apparatus of opposition to any Israeli concession of the Golan can
be seen revving its engine, as with a mass rally that the settlers
sponsored in Tel Aviv last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface, at the collectives, the kibbutzim, the
military bases and the businesses that have established themselves
in this area about the size of Rhode Island, a quiet psychological
and practical preparation has begun. In the four large Druse Arab
towns in the Golan, where many residents are self-protectively
working to suppress their excitement at a possible return to Syrian
control, planning for a very different future is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Any peace agreement would entail an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, experts agree. But since a peace agreement is by no
means certain, much of Golan life is frozen, with residents
anxiously continuing their daily lives. Some Israeli settlers are
digging in their heels defiantly, like those who collectively own
the Golan Heights Winery, which is considered Israel's finest. They
are planting new vineyards, boosting their bottling capacity and
expanding into new export markets.
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Zaidon, who has sponsored several residents'
meetings with lawyers and property assessors, have started to think
about what it would it take to dismantle three decades of Israeli
life in the Golan Heights. Eden Springs, Israel's principal water
bottling company, under pressure from its public shareholders, has
already prepared a detailed plan for relocating its entire plant to
northern Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at least one kibbutz has made a quiet decision to
move as a group to the Galilee, the northern region that most
closely resembles the Golan. The Golan religious council has
written a clause into its standard divorce agreement stating that
no property division would be adversely affected by the outcome of
diplomatic negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And one Golan business has used the possibility of a withdrawal
as a marketing tool. An advertising flier for the two-year-old
Howard Johnson hotel at Mount Hermon asked, ``Who knows how long
you have to visit this enchanted spot?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For decades, the military, which captured the Golan after brutal
battles in 1973, considered the area a strategic necessity to
defend northern Israel against what used to be sporadic shelling by
Syria. Now, though, in the face of what some believe to be a
severely deteriorated Syrian army, it is reassessing its security
plans. Last week, the Israeli army's alpinists, who guard Israel's
only ski resort, conducted their routine training exercises in the
deep snow at the peak of Mount Hermon. But they felt sentimentally
aware that this could be the last winter that their elite unit of
reservists was called into duty to patrol the quiet northern border
on snowshoes and skis.
</P>
<P>
   For the Druse in the Golan Heights, who will stay put, the mood
is very different. Dr. Taiseer Maray, 40, for instance, a
biologist, lives in Majdal Shams, bordering the cease-fire line
between the Golan Heights and Syria. Since childhood, he has been
separated from his older brothers, who made lives in Damascus. Now,
in an exchange of phone calls, the estranged siblings have
discussed reuniting on the family land in the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How incredible that would be,'' Maray said, ``all to live
under the same flag.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS AS USUAL: Planning for Growth, And for Closing  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Victor Schoenfeld is a thoroughly Californian figure: a Palo
Verde-reared winemaker trained at the University of California at
Davis. He exudes the kind of easy informality that masks formidable
technical mastery and an intense competitive drive.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last nine years, Schoenfeld has labored in the
unlikely vineyards of the Golan Heights, where the grapes are grown
amid the rusting wrecks of Syrian tanks. He is chief winemaker for
the Golan Heights Winery, the region's largest employer, whose
tallest blending tank is topped, like an army command post, with an
Israeli flag.
</P>
<P>
   With a thousand acres of local vineyards supplying an
ultramodern winemaking complex, the company produced four million
bottles last year. It also chalked up a record $12 million in
earnings. More important to Schoenfeld, his complex cabernets and
fruity chardonnays are beginning to be recognized internationally
as more than just kosher curiosities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, with the prospect of Israeli withdrawal and Syrian
sovereignty, the coming fall harvest could be the winery's last.
``It's a little bit hard on morale,'' Schoenfeld said. ``To think
that a big chunk of your life might be in vain . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But Schoenfeld and his colleagues don't let themselves think
that way. The company is undertaking an $8 million expansion
despite the political uncertainty, and projecting sales to double
to $24 million by 2001. ``The investment program is going forward
as if there were no peace process, because as a business there is
no alternative,'' said Adam Montefiore, the winery's international
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The winery's plans stand in stark contrast to those of Eden
Springs, its next-door neighbor in the Katzrin industrial park. A
publicly traded company seeking foreign investors, it has already
bought rights for what it says is a comparable mineral water source
in the upper Galilee. If Syria takes over, the plant and its work
force would all be moved, managers told employees here this month.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Golan Heights winery, relocation is not an option,
its executives say. This cool highland plateau is the only area
under Israeli domain capable of producing a lot of high-quality
wine grapes, they say. And, for the moment, there is no outside
pressure on the company to seek alternatives. The eight
shareholders are all kibbutzim and collective farms in the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Montefiore, an English immigrant, chooses to believe that no
matter what flag flies over it, the winery will survive. But
Schoenfeld is less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have assumptions that have no basis in
reality, that we'd be able to lease the vineyard from the
Syrians,'' he said. ``If this were France and Belgium, I'd have an
easier time imagining some kind of cooperation. But it's the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing, in his New York Giants parka, at the gate to Mount
Hermon, Yitzhak Tsuela worried that international sentiment could
not be aroused to defend the ski resort that his moshav _ a
collective _ had built.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't create a sympathetic image,'' he said, waving at
the skiers. ``Everyone will say, `They're rich.' But they forget,
when we came here there was nothing. We started with a single
Austrian chairlift that the Israeli government gave us to help us
get off the ground.'
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Majdal Shams, which is adjacent to the moshav, are
furious when they hear these Israelis talk about how they created
something from nothing. That nothing was their land. They seethe
when Golan settlers talk about how they, unlike the West Bank
settlers who displaced Palestinians, took over barren territory.
When Syria lost the Golan to Israel during the 1967 Israeli-Arab
war, an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 Arabs fled.
</P>
<P>
   In the foothills of Mount Hermon, many of the Druse stayed put,
and grew into a community of 16,600, outnumbering the Jewish
settlers, according to Israeli government statistics. The
government says there are 14,400 Jewish settlers, which the
settlers believe is an undercount.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those in the West Bank, the Golan settlers are primarily
secular and traditionally affiliated with the Labor Party of Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike those in the West Bank, few make biblically based
claims to the Golan as part of the greater land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet hillside town, Majdal Shams, within shouting distance of
Syria, is the largest community in the Golan. Its residents belong
to the Druse religion, which considers the Koran sacred but also
has its own religious texts. In Israel, many Druse have sworn
allegiance to the state, and serve in the army. But in the Golan
Heights, most have refused to take Israeli citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people here have never lived in our country,''
Maray said recently, at the clinic he runs. ``But to be so close to
the cease-fire line has kept our dream realistic. At night, we can
see the lamps burning in our brothers' and sisters' homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in Israel has been a mixed experience for many in Majdal
Shams. They say they have always felt like second-class residents,
with textbooks labeled ``Mathematics for Druse'' or ``History for
Druse.'' Maray, who received a doctorate in biology from Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, said he cannot find work in his field in
Israel. Still, he acknowledges that he, like others, benefited some
from the educational and material opportunities of a Westernized
society.
</P>
<P>
   Maray said he expected that Majdal Shams would turn into a
crossroads if peace were made. It is a border town, and its
residents are fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic. After feeling
isolated in Israel, the Druse would be poised to become part of the
Syrian elite, he said. Their savings, which do not amount to much
in Israel, would count for significantly more in Syria's
underdeveloped economy, and their ability to negotiate the two
cultures could be valuable.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations proceed, the town's residents try to remain
calm. In the mid-1990s, when peace talks reached a peak before they
were frozen, the atmosphere among the Druse was almost hysterical.
Construction projects halted; businesses stopped placing orders;
some residents even traded in their cars for models that would have
higher resale value in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very optimistic,'' Dr. Maray said. ``But we have
learned not to take too many concrete steps.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A CRUCIAL VANTAGE POINT: A Coveted Aerie From Which to Spy  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dressed hood-to-toe in a white Windbreaker with legs, Roni Idri,
29, carried an Uzi on his back as he schussed down a snowy ridge of
Mount Hermon several hundred feet from the Syrian border. One of
the elite army alpinists whose days may be numbered, he was asked
whether the skiing soldiers ever caught anyone trying to slip
across the mountaintop border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' he asked, mystified until it dawned on him. ``You mean,
the enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   Above him, the geodesic crown jewels of Israel's electronic
espionage network sat on twin promontories of the snowy
7,300-foot-high ridge. After escorting journalists to the
off-limits peak the week before last, the army announced that the
two dense clusters of dish-encrusted antennae and Buckminster
Fuller radar domes were off the record and should not be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But they can be clearly viewed not only from the ski resort
below but from Damascus, just 26 miles to the north. And Damascus
wants Idri's ridge back, military hardware and all _ even if the
spy stations are staffed by American or other Western troops.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, this is the hardest piece of the heights to give
back. The Mount Hermon early warning stations give it unimpeded
surveillance of Syrian skies and military bases. Its top-secret
listening devices can reportedly monitor almost all electronic
communications throughout Syria and southern Lebanon. Though
Israeli military posts dot vantage points throughout the Golan,
none offer the strategic advantage of Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts here say the withdrawal of the heavy artillery
and tank battalions Israel maintains across the Golan can be safely
compensated for by an extensive _ and very expensive _ system of
airborne and satellite radar stations, antiballistic missiles and
new wings of F-16 fighter jets. But Israeli negotiators are
demanding some continued Israeli military presence, at least
transitionally, on the mountaintop itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to our advantage to be up on the hill rather than down
in the valley,'' said a senior officer at a Golan Heights military
base. ``Peace would make a difference, but it depends on what kind
of peace you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said the commander, who keeps a daily eye on his Syrian
counterparts encamped across the fortified border, a genuine peace
would justify this painful trade-off. ``They act like we act,
according to the rules set up after 1973,'' he said respectfully.
``I would like one day to see Syrian officers as people I could
talk to, as people who share the same mission that I have.''
</P>
<P>
   A CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY: Lives Hang in the Balance As Talks Go On
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resume Wednesday in the
Washington area, are a fact of life in the Golan. Tandem trailer
rigs drive the picturesque, winding roads beside the Sea of Galilee
adorned with banners that say, ``We will not budge from the
Golan.'' Cappuccino-serving waitresses in the cafe here wear
T-shirts with the same slogan.
</P>
<P>
   The real estate market is frozen with uncertainty. ``There is
not a single house on the market in the entire Golan Heights,''
said Gila Yaakobi, the manager of Golan Realty. Construction has
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in an unclear situation now on the Golan,'' said
Moshed Hed, a factory owner who has stalled plans to build on a new
site. ``There is an atmosphere of hesitation, and it has
repercussions in every field.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Jewish Golan Heights, as in Majdal Shams, the 1995
negotiations with Syria served as a kind of fire drill. During that
period, many underwent counseling about how to reorient themselves
psychologically and how to prepare their children for a traumatic
move. In the last few years, many received job retraining in
preparation for leaving agricultural life. Those people, to some
extent, have been bracing for the moment when they might have to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   New immigrants from the former Soviet Union make up a third of
Katzrin's population, and they have been pestering Aryeh Eilat, a
Russian who works as a kind of answer man for the municipality.
They want to know how much compensation money they will receive
from the government and whether they will get green cards from the
United States, too. That kind of gritty pragmatism turns off Eilat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think peace is worth a lot,'' he said. ``Maybe it's worth
the future of my child and my family. But it's such a disgusting
thing to let yourself be sold in the market like an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and his wife are already discussing the relative
merits of other regions. Scuttlebutt claims that the government
would be willing to help them relocate in either the sparsely
populated Negev or the Galilee, which they prefer. They have not
gone as far as some neighbors, though, who are taking weekend
drives to scout out new lives.
</P>
<P>
   Few like to admit any kind of preparation publicly, because it
makes it seem as if they have given up the fight. ``We certainly
don't want to give anyone the impression that we have reconciled
ourselves to the situation,'' Zaidon said. ``On the other hand, we
can't stick our heads in the sand. That's what they did in the
Sinai.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Israeli government handled the forcible evacuation
of the Sinai after the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord of 1979 serves
as the model for what not to do, many Israelis say. But Nurit
Kliot, a geographer at the University of Haifa and an expert on the
Sinai evacuation, said she had already seen the government
repeating past mistakes. She said officials were sending
conflicting signals to the Golan settlers, as they did to the Sinai
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kliot was referring to leaks last week suggesting that Barak
was asking the Syrians to let settlers stay in the Golan after the
Israeli military withdraws. Most experts consider this a condition
that Syria would never accept and see it as a ploy aimed at
convincing the settlers that the government is pushing for their
rights. But many settlers are taking the reports at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The government's evacuation from the Sinai town of Yamit, which
ended with violent clashes between settlers and soldiers, led them
to overcompensate the settlers financially, Ms. Kliot said. Instead
of being paid the value of their property, they were paid ``their
property-plus-plus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This fostered animosity toward the settlers, who were
derogatorily referred to as the ``Yamit millionaires.'' With that
lingering bad impression still fresh, the ski resort operators say
they have never calculated the worth of their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be seen as Shylock, giving up everything for
money,'' Tsuela said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sharon Tsuela, added, in a reference to Syrian
President Hafez Assad, : ``If Assad comes and makes us go, we will
go to Canada. That will be enough of Israel for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking in his living room, Zaidon said he could not imagine
starting over at the age of 59. ``For younger people, it may be
easier,'' he said. ``But I have to make myself face it. Holding on
to the land with our fingernails would be a mistake. After there is
an agreement, and then a referendum, that will be the beginning of
our end here in Katzrin.''

SPORTS COLUMN: ALCHEMY IN ST. LOUIS FOR CARDINALS AND RAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ This city normally shivers in January, but the
excitement of holding its first professional football playoff game
is generating a warmth that cuts the chill.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Friday, the streets were filled with fans wearing Rams
blue and gold, turning out for two sizzling pep rallies. Organizers
handed out sombreros at the first rally. Later, a sea of blue and
gold Rams jackets and caps flooded Union Station. A band blasted
music and fight songs; cheerleaders led cheers.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This season marks the confluence _ and a clash _ of four
distinct legacies: St. Louis, the Cardinals, the Rams and Los
Angeles. This weekend the distinct identities may finally merge,
though only time (and winning) will tell.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the master of ceremonies introduced Cardinal stars of
the past: defensive back Roger Wehrli (1969-82), tight end Jackie
Smith (1963-77) and quarterback Jim Hart (1966-83). Each received a
hearty round of applause. But the introductions of the former
Cardinals crystallized the awkward juxtaposition of Los Angeles and
St. Louis; Rams instead of Cardinals, blue and gold instead of
cardinal and white. This was a mixed metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said: ``It's a very weird feeling; it's a tough thing, for
the old Rams and for us, too. We don't really have a home anymore.
Whatever history was here before is not going to be perpetuated by
these guys and certainly not by the Cardinals in Phoenix.'' Smith
has campaigned for a kiosk at the Trans World Dome with St. Louis
Cardinals memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place in the stadium where people can come by and
take their kids in there and say, `Here is St. Louis football
history,''' Smith said. ``It's not going to be put out there,
because football history here starts when the Rams came here as far
as most people are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart has adopted these Rams out of an emotional necessity to
have football roots. ``They welcome me here,'' Hart said. ``I'm not
welcomed out there.'' Meaning Phoenix. Hart played on three
Cardinal teams that reached the playoffs. He is the Cardinals'
career leader in touchdowns thrown, total passing yardage and
passes completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to the Cardinal offices out there and felt like a
total stranger,'' Hart said. ``They go, `Who?' I said: `Hey, wait a
minute! I had a small part in building this organization.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson for the National Football League from St. Louis is to
guard its rich history more rigorously. Baseball covets its history
with the intensity of a fetish, while pro basketball and until
recently the NFL were content to stay in the here and now. In an
ideal world, to keep fans' discomfort at a minimum, franchises
would be free to move but teams' colors and nicknames would stay
put, as with the Cleveland Browns. ``When the NFL allowed Mr.
Bidwill to take the red and white colors and the name, that was a
foregone conclusion: people were going to forget about red and
white and Cardinals eventually,'' Hart said. ``These playoffs will
do a lot more to make them forget about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans move on. They adjust, take what's given, and learn to like
it. In Indianapolis they love the Colts, stolen from Baltimore;
Tennesseans love the Titans, stolen from Houston. Here they now
love the Rams, stolen from Los Angeles. ``We're football fans,''
said John Hartfield, a native of St. Louis who began following the
Cardinals football team in 1969. Hartfield was enraged when the
Bidwills took the team to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us felt like jilted lovers,'' he said. ``When the team
left, they in essence divorced us, so we divorced ourselves from
the team. Bill Bidwill is a guy who steps on your loyalty and takes
advantage of you. We love the old Cardinals players: that's our
memories; that's our history.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century this franchise has represented _ and
played with _ the emotions of so many football fans. They began in
1898 as the Morgan Athletic Club in an Irish-American neighborhood
in Chicago. They became the Chicago Cardinals, the St. Louis
Cardinals and now the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   This is an odd marriage. The Rams began in Cleveland, moved to
Los Angeles in 1946, to Anaheim in 1980 and to St. Louis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Vermeil, the Rams' head coach, is a sun-drenched
Californian who coached high school and junior college in
California. He was a Rams assistant, then head coach at UCLA. As
head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles he played against St. Louis
from 1976 to 1982. Vermeil thinks the transplant has successfully
taken root.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans appreciate being able to identify with a
winning team,'' he said. ``I think now it's the St. Louis Rams and
no longer the Los Angeles Rams who moved here.''
</P>
<P>
   For old St. Louis Cardinals players, dyed in cardinal and white,
the Rams are still hard to digest. ``To say that the Rams are my
team, in my heart, no way,'' Hart said. ``The last playoff game I
played in was against the Rams, and they beat us pretty soundly, so
there wasn't much love lost there.'' In 1975 the Rams beat the
Cardinals in Los Angeles, 35-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head says, `Yes, I'm in St. Louis, and that's my team,'''
Hart added. ``But in my heart, my team is Jackie Smith and Dan
Dierdorf and Johnny Roland. They are my team.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: ANOTHER NIGHT OF RECKLESSNESS AND DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The games continue. League and life carry on. One day after a
service and hours before a funeral, the grieving Charlotte Hornets
came to Madison Square Garden Saturday night to play the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a guess Saturday if David Wesley, the point guard in
the other Porsche, was going to play. He stood up in the church
Friday afternoon in Charlotte, N.C., and said of his friend, Bobby
Phills, ``He was my partner in crime.'' A term of endearment,
perhaps, but with an ongoing investigation of drag racing as the
cause of the accident that took Phills' life, at 30, it was, just
the same, a peculiar expression.
</P>
<P>
   Not to overanalyze, because few of us can really imagine what
it's like being David Wesley right now. But there are more people
than Wesley realizes who can, said one who had survived a
comparable experience, one so harrowing it nearly swallowed him
whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you eventually find out in a situation like the one this
young man is in is that there are so many people who have been
there,'' said Bobby Ojeda. ``There are people who have survived
trauma, a plane crash, the loss of a child in an accident they feel
they could have prevented. They are out there, complete strangers,
and what I found is that they want to share these stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time but these were the people that I did
listen to more than anyone else. If the opportunity arose, I would
most certainly do that for this young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda, onetime Mets' pitching star in a fantasy we simply
remember as '86, would tell David Wesley a story he would find
chillingly similar, in that it involved professional athletes and
recklessness, bad luck and death, and Ojeda as the one, chosen by
some unseen force, by fate, to get on his with life after burying
two Cleveland teammates, two friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's been well documented how Ojeda couldn't, how he slipped
into self-destructive grieving that included long periods of
isolation, tormenting his wife, shutting out his kids. The sight of
them reminded him too much of the fatherless children left behind
by his buddies in the speedboat that March night in 1993: Steve
Olin and Tim Crews.
</P>
<P>
   They were out on Little Lake Nellie near Winter Haven, Fla.,
when it was too dark, and as the autopsy revealed, Crews, the
driver, had had at least one too many beers. They never saw the
pier. Ojeda survived because he was slouched in the boat.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't look at himself in the mirror for six months. When
people told him that he would eventually feel better, he felt fury
as never before. On the telephone Friday from his home in Rumson,
N.J., he said he was certain that people who care about David
Wesley were telling him the same thing; he could almost feel
Wesley's anger, his confusion, his need to revisit those last,
tragic moments, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can get a whole lot lower than I was at
the bottom,'' Ojeda said. ``No circumstances are ever alike, but
he's going to have issues, no doubt. And there's no blueprint, no
one man who has answers. I would tell him to not shun the people
who have been there for him. I wouldn't tell him to move forward
too quickly but to continue doing things you've got to do. To sit
and dwell isn't a real good idea. This young man, he's a basketball
player. It's something to hold onto.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ojeda said he didn't emotionally recover for three years.
It took him months to be receptive to therapy, a long and painful
process that is not to be confused with the psychological testing
baseball ordered for John Rocker. If therapy taught Ojeda one thing
that has helped him cope, it is that life is not necessarily an
off-target curve ball that can be gripped better next time. Young
people, especially athletes, often think of life as a
self-correcting process, but the reality is that things happen to
people, terrible things. In retrospect, what Ojeda and the others
did was careless, undoubtedly preventable, but they were imperfect
people.
</P>
<P>
   If people paused to consider the potential outcome of every
single act, maybe they would never do anything. Then they would be
withdrawing from life, as Ojeda tried to do after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Even while lamenting the irresponsibility of what transpired
last week it should be put in the context of a culture that is
fascinated with speed and toys, from kids with their Playstations
to adults who have made Nascar the country's fastest growing sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took the number of people who drive too fast in their
cars, what would it be, 80 percent?'' Ojeda said. ``Now, I know 80
percent of the people don't have Porsches, but I have seen guys in
Fords doing 85 miles an hour. What happened here is that they wound
up with the worst possible ending, and thank God they didn't kill
anyone else. But I think the racing is almost irrelevant. The fact
is that only Wesley was there; only he knows what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And more to the point, only he has to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   Ojeda, of course, is not the critic speaking, as much as he is
the survivor of almost seven years. David Wesley is at five days,
and counting. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIOUX CITY, Iowa _ The ordinary Iowans who turn up to see Vice
President Al Gore have often been startled by the candidate they
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the Great Soporific whom they expect, a man as wooden
as a giant sequoia and about as capable of giving an engaging
speech, they have often been surprised to find themselves wowed and
inspired by Gore in his stump speeches. He even tells funny jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmingly the most common remark one hears from Iowans who
have come to listen to his talks, even from those who are not going
to vote for him, is that he is far more lively, charismatic and
humorous than they expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, he used to seem kind of cold, but he was so much better
than that,'' gushed Lorene Jambura, a retired alcohol counselor in
Davenport, Iowa, after she watched Gore speak. ``He seems very
human, very relaxed and very down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the other Democratic candidate, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, falters in his quest for the nomination, he will have
accomplished something that many thought was impossible: Gore's
aides acknowledge that it was the pressure from Bradley that, over
the last few months, led Gore to emphasize an informal, folksy and
sometimes passionate style. This has been a gradual shift, perhaps
still incomplete, but it seems to be working with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw him, he was so stiff, just the way Jay
Leno used to poke fun of him,'' said Don Paulson, a machinery
operator who saw Gore speak a few years ago and was stunned by a
stump speech the other day. ``Now he's so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's style had seemed a major weakness of his candidacy. He
cannot be faulted for lack of experience or knowledge, but his
difficulties inspiring voters or lighting a spark among audiences
created doubts about his electability.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And they raised concerns that even if he were elected, his would
be a ``passionless presidency,'' a characterization sometimes made
of former President Carter's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Gore's presentations are inconsistent. At times,
especially when he touches on highbrow or intellectual topics, he
can come across as distant and professorial. His gestures sometimes
seem guided by an aide with a remote-control transmitting device.
If Clinton is a master at feeling other people's pain, then Gore on
those occasions comes across as so robotic that he barely feels his
own.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he is fully charged, Gore can juice up his audiences
and keep Iowans almost spellbound, alternately laughing at his
jokes and riveted by his stories. He speaks in shirt-sleeves
without a tie, holding a microphone in one hand and strolling in
front of the crowd without a lectern or notes, his Tennessee accent
seemingly stronger than ever. He calls on members of the audience
and elicits their tales with the charm and vigor of a television
talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so glad to be back in Muscatine,'' Gore said with such
feeling as he began a speech in Muscatine, Iowa, that one might
actually have supposed he meant it. Strolling about in a brown
shirt and waving to a few people in the audience whom he
recognized, Gore chatted in a conversational tone, saying, ``First,
I'll tell a little about myself.'' Offering a brief biography in
which he described his parents growing up poor, he reminded people
of his past as a Vietnam veteran and onetime journalist and largely
skipped over his political career. He concluded by describing his
pride as a new grandfather and his conclusions on child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preferred technique is to give that grandchild whatever he
wants,'' Gore said. ``And if that causes any problems, give him
back to his parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore often asks all the grandparents in the audience to raise
their hands, and then asks if anyone has as many as 15
grandchildren, or 20, gradually raising the number until he has
identified and congratulated the person in the room with the most.
Although he sometimes asks the question several times a day, Gore
always seems suitably stunned that anyone could have as many as 27
or 30 grandchildren, and even if audiences know it is a bit of an
act, they love it.
</P>
<P>
   Audience participation seems to have become a central tool for
Gore. He often begins an event by going around the room and shaking
every single person's hand, even if it takes nearly an hour. In his
talk, he constantly asks for a show of hands on this or that, and
when he takes questions, he prowls the floor with a spare
microphone, asking people for their stories as well as their
queries.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on anecdotes, grandchildren and handshaking means
there is less time for hard-core discussions of the issues, which
plays into the campaign's decision to avoid controversy as Gore
sits on a comfortable lead in Iowa. And interviews with more than
50 Iowa voters who listened to Gore's speeches in recent days
suggest that at least in this state, the strategy is successful as
showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him three times in the last few months,'' said
Gertrude MacQueen, a longtime Democratic organizer in Iowa City,
``and I think he's getting better all the time. He's much more
relaxed than he used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bell, a paralegal who listened to Gore in Cedar Rapids,
said she was still not sure she would vote for him, but she was
impressed by what she saw. ``I think he's kind of funny,'' she
said. ``I was surprised, because people always say he's so
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore clearly studies his audiences and adjusts the message
accordingly. But paradoxically, he seems most effective and
passionate with farming and working-class groups, for whom he laces
his speech with ``God bless you'' and corny jokes that leave people
bubbling about how natural and sincere he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came across as just one of us, a down-home kind of guy,''
said James Munson, a retired auto worker who said he would probably
now vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In front of college crowds, Gore cuts out the ``God bless you''
refrain and becomes more measured and thoughtful _ but also more
distant and dry, and sometimes patronizing. Thus he ends up coming
across as most artificial in front of precisely the people who are
closest to him in education and background.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For years, one of the puzzles about Gore was that for all his
stodgy public image, in private he seemed relaxed, funny and
surprisingly willing to ham it up. He may well be, for example, the
best American politician at balancing a stick on his nose. Yet this
side of him used to vanish whenever Gore got within shouting
distance of a podium.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's informal approach has emerged as Bradley was capitalizing
on his image as an independent thinker, free from the constraints
of Washington. Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said the change was
partly a conscious effort to do away with the trappings of the vice
presidency on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice presidency is an impediment,'' Lehane said. ``You
want to strip it away, whether it's rope lines, stages or whatever,
and go back to the basics: a candidate speaking to a group of
people in a circle.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One factor that may work in Gore's favor these days is the
standard of comparison. In the past, he tended to be compared with
President Clinton, who is unsurpassed in his ability to empathize
with an audience and build a rapport, so that even Demosthenes
might seem stiff in comparison. These days on the campaign trail,
Gore is more often compared with Bradley, who has acknowledged his
own weaknesses as a public speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better speaker than Bradley was,'' said Christine
Carpenter, a school psychologist who listened to both men and has
still not decided how to vote. ``Gore was more entertaining, told
more jokes and was more animated. He really had a better speech.''

 NEW YORK: is violence.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Appan, who is studying at Kingsborough Community College and
hopes to become a business consultant, said victims like him got
little attention or support because they were poor and nonwhite. An
immigrant from Guyana whose sister and best friend were killed in
shootings, Appan said he was struck by the outcry over shootings in
middle-class schools across the country. But the phenomenon, he
said, is nothing new in poor urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they did all this because of Columbine,''
he said, referring to the Colorado school shootings last year.
``Because it touched home. Because it was in suburbia. What about
the thousands of young people who die or are wounded every year in
the cities?''
</P>
<P>
   Hermina Jackson, an adviser to the state on rehabilitation
programs for the disabled who has been paralyzed for 30 years, said
the system had failed those urban victims. She said that under the
current welfare system, there was no incentive to get jobs, because
those people would lose Medicaid and face thousands of dollars in
medical bills. They would need more than $40,000 a year on average
to pay their medical bills, a difficult task for young men who
often have no more than a high school education.
</P>
<P>
   For former criminals like Johnnie Montalvo, the lack of programs
and the lure of the streets can be overwhelming. That Montalvo is
even alive is astonishing. During his 35 troubled years, he has had
buckshot and bullets fired into his arm, cheek, neck, left thigh,
right forearm, left buttock, stomach, left hand and spine.
</P>
<P>
   He has only one lung, and reconstructed intestines. A 1996 razor
attack left a 10-inch scar from his right temple to his chin. The
seats of his Buick are still stained with his blood from a 1997
shooting. A portrait of Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead,
hangs from his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in December on the Sunset Park street corner he has long
dominated, he was holding court again. As he sat in his wheelchair,
friends and gang members paid their respects. Everyone, it seemed,
had heard the stories. Montalvo says his paralysis is his penance
for past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   And his wheelchair has clearly made an impression on some of the
young around him.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Rosario, 23, from Sunset Park, cited Mr. Montalvo and three
other people he knew in wheelchairs as among the reasons he was
becoming a police officer. ``He's like a prophet,'' Rosario said.
``It's all fine and dandy to be a tough guy, but in the end, 90
percent of the people wind up like him, or dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, Nick Corredor, a former drug dealer shot by a
rival in 1993, said he had learned his lesson. He enrolled in John
Jay College of Criminal Justice last fall, majoring in deviant
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Montalvo says his days of crime are over. He and Corredor speak
at schools against gun violence, part of a group called the
Gunrunners. Run by Ruben Tavares, 34, a former Bronx gang member,
the group ends its visits by having children play them in
wheelchair basketball, giving a sense of their confinement in steel
and rubber.
</P>
<P>
   But while Montalvo renounces his past, he struggles to make a
clean break. Last year he spent four months in jail in
Massachusetts before being acquitted of helping a man flee a
drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of his first child in 1997 put new pressure on him to
``do the right thing,'' he said. He is raising the boy alone. The
mother is in jail on a drug conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He and his son are living in an East New York public housing
project. They subsist on $670 a month in welfare. Montalvo, who
talks of opening his own gas station, says he is eager to do right
by his son, but is trapped by a criminal record that bars him from
bank loans, public housing and many jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get discouraged,'' he said, as he sat on the corner. ``It's
hard out here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to do it,'' he added, ``but sometimes you have
to do things to survive.`
</P>
<P>
   Aiken said renewed religious faith had given him hope of going
to college and becoming a recording engineer. But he said despair
and lack of opportunity were leading many friends down the wrong
path.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my close homeboys in wheelchairs, they're
incarcerated,'' Aiken said. ``A lot of people in wheelchairs end up
going the wrong way because they don't have other options.''

 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a teen-ager in the 1980s, Andrew Aiken rhymed and
danced his nights away as a master of ceremonies at house music
parties in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. A son of Jamaican immigrants,
he dreamed of glory as a rap and reggae star.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991 a robber shot Aiken for a gold bracelet on his wrist
and $90 in his pocket, paralyzing him from the waist down at 18.
For the next seven years he cycled in and out of public hospitals,
battling chronic bone infections and depression. Eighteen months
ago his left leg was amputated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept more than I was awake,'' he said, referring to his
illness. ``Because when I slept I was on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in the 1980s, Johnnie Montalvo ruled a swath of
Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with the power of a deity. A founding member
of La Familia M.C. Street Gang, he could have a rival drug dealer
shot dead with a wave of his hand. In 1988, a fellow criminal got
to him first, shooting Montalvo twice in the back and paralyzing
him from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, he has struggled to break the grip of the
streets, been arrested for selling heroin and carrying a gun in his
wheelchair, and been shot again. He says he prefers chairs with no
hand grips because he cannot stand being pushed by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't afraid of dying,'' he said. ``The only thing that
hurts me is that some stupid little young kid can put a bullet in
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Aiken has never met Johnnie Montalvo, not surprising for
two men whose lives were once on differing trajectories. Yet in
their two-wheeled prisons, they are stark reminders of one of
America's worst urban episodes.
</P>
<P>
   They are just two of hundreds of young black and Hispanic men
paralyzed by gunshot wounds during New York's crack epidemic a
decade ago. Across the country, an estimated 4,900 blacks and 2,000
Hispanics were paralyzed in violent incidents between 1987 and
1994, the peak of the epidemic. In neighborhoods like Brownsville,
Washington Heights and Harlem, the sight of a young man in a
wheelchair has become part of the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Like Aiken and Montalvo, they include the wholly innocent as
well as the wholly criminal. From those who have mustered the
strength to soldier on and gain independence, to those still
trapped in the lives that made them street corner targets. From
those who use family support or religion to soothe their ravaged
bodies and souls, to those who succumb to drugs to ease the pain
and frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Andrew and myself,'' said Daniel Appan, 28, a
friend of Aiken's who was shot and paralyzed for a leather jacket,
``we're sort of casualties of the ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   Now entering their 20s and 30s, they are faring poorly as a
group, vexed by the anger, depression and disappointment any victim
of paralysis suffers, as well as by an array of pitfalls beyond
their control or power of will to change. For the innocent, there
are the assumptions on sight that they were all drug dealers. For
the former drug dealers, there are the temptations to return to an
illicit life. For all, there is the isolation of being trapped in
the city's poorest corners and the disadvantages of not knowing
what rehabilitation and educational programs are available to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very different group,'' said Dr. Adam Stein,
director of the paralysis rehabilitation program at Mount Sinai
Medical Center. ``They tend to have fewer financial resources,
little family support.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost nine years after being shot, Aiken is still struggling to
overcome such obstacles. After his first hospital stay, he moved
into his mother's apartment. Because his wheelchair was too wide to
fit through a narrow bathroom doorway, he used a bedpan or crawled
across the floor each time he had to relieve himself. The stress of
crawling aggravated a leg abscess. It grew larger, became infected
and developed into chronic osteomyelitis, a potentially fatal bone
disease. For the next five years, he was in and out of hospitals
and operating rooms, and eventually his left leg was amputated.
Aiken says shoddy medical care has prolonged his suffering.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, his rage over an injury he did nothing to
cause grew so intense that he pushed away those around him.
``Whoever is dealing with me I force away, and whoever I want goes
the other way. Is there no hope for me?'' Aiken wrote in a poem
after he was shot. ``I'm a human. I'm a man. I'm Andrew Aiken.
Nothing can take that away from me. So legs or no legs, love or no
love, I must go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 26, Aiken said he had been too sick to find a job. He is on
public assistance and shares a Brownsville public housing project
apartment with another paralyzed gunshot victim.
</P>
<P>
   The stress of his injury destroyed his four-year relationship
with his girlfriend, Tina Katina. They are now close friends. Both
say they needed more counseling, particularly from people in
wheelchairs and their spouses. ``We needed people who could tell us
it could work,'' Ms. Katina said.
</P>
<P>
   So Aiken and other gunshot victims are creating support groups.
Aiken's ordeal resulted in a stronger bond with Appan, a friend he
once performed with at reggae parties, and in friendships with
other gunshot victims. In 1994, the thief trying to steal Appan's
jacket shot him in the neck, paralyzing him from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford a car with hand controls, Aiken must take the
bus to Appan's Crown Heights home. When he rolled through Appan's
door on a visit, it was a day of triumph. Aiken was eager to show
his friend the prosthetic leg he had been fitted with at the
hospital that morning. He loved to hoist himself out of his chair,
lean on the prosthesis and stare into the mirror at the image of
himself standing on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Both men complain that people in their neighborhoods often
assume they were criminals. Unlike in suburbia, where a wheelchair
might suggest a motorcycle accident, a wheelchair in their
neighborhood connotes one thing: a gunshot wound. While the leading
cause of paralysis among white Americans is motor vehicle
accidents, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical
Center in Birmingham, Ala., the leading cause of paralysis among
black and Hispanic Americans is violence.

`ARKAN,' SERB PARAMILITARY LEADER, SLAIN IN BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Zeljko Raznatovic, a notorious Serbian
paramilitary leader known as Arkan who was wanted on war crimes
charges in the Bosnian and Croatian wars, was shot and killed
Saturday in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was shot in the left eye by gunmen at about 5:15 p.m.
and was immediately taken to Belgrade's main emergency hospital,
where he was pronounced dead at about 6:40 p.m., reported Studio B,
the Belgrade television station.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at the Intercontinental, where blood still spattered
the entrance way an hour after the shooting, said a bodyguard,
whose name was reported to be Momcilo Mandic, known as Manda, had
also been killed. Other reports said an unidentified woman and an
unidentified man had been wounded or possibly killed.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen apparently escaped, although the police arrived
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was said to be accompanied by his wife, the
popular singer Svetlana Raznatovic, known as Ceca, and their two
children when he was shot. The attack bore the hallmarks of
political assassinations here, which have been carried out in
gangland style.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic's gunmen took part in the brutal three-month siege of
the Croatian city of Vukovar in 1991 and helped the Bosnian Serbs
overrun northern and eastern Bosnia a year later. There, he was one
of the pioneers of what came to be known as ``ethnic cleansing,''
the killing and violent expulsion of non-Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   He was secretly indicted in 1997 by the international war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, accused of crimes against
humanity in both Bosnia and Croatia. But his indictment was made
public by the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, only during
NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, which began last March.
</P>
<P>
   He was thought to be dangerous to President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia and other key members of the government because of
what he knew about the killings and atrocities of the war in
Bosnia. The Hague tribunal was said to be negotiating with
Raznatovic to get him to turn himself in and testify against
others, but Raznatovic regularly denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate speculation here was that Milosevic, who has
already been indicted by the tribunal for war crimes during the
Kosovo war, and his government would benefit most from the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was said by friends to have been worried about his
safety in the last few months, said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of
the Democratic Party, who had contacts with him. Djindjic, in an
interview Saturday night, described Raznatovic as having distanced
himself from Milosevic, while keeping strong contacts with the
Yugoslav and Serbian security services.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic led a paramilitary group called the Serbian National
Guard, known as the ``Tigers,'' who took part in both the Croatian
and Bosnian wars. He is also wanted by the international police
body Interpol in connection with a series of bank robberies across
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play a major role in last year's Kosovo war, though
some of his paramilitary Tigers were engaged in the forced
expulsion and killing of ethnic Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said Raznatovic had been strongly urged to go to Kosovo
by authorities in the Milosevic government. In fact, Raznatovic
spent much of the war in the Hyatt Hotel in Belgrade, where many
foreign journalists were also staying, and which was perceived as a
place NATO would not bomb. As an English-speaker, he was sometimes
interviewed by CNN and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said Raznatovic had told him that in late 1996,
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, offered Raznatovic and his men
money to break up pro-democracy demonstrations in Belgrade.
Raznatovic told Djindjic that he had refused.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo war, Djindjic said, Raznatovic kept him
informed about threats to his life, one reason Djindjic left
Belgrade then to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was one of the last of the criminal and paramilitary
leaders closely involved with both state security and the wars in
Bosnia and Croatia. Last month, Zoran Sijan, a mafia leader and a
man with experiences similar to Raznatovic's, was killed, Djindjic
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was a shrewd, intelligent and criminal personality,
Djindjic said, adding, ``He was baby-faced but very dangerous,
without moral scruples and a kind of beast.''

 &HT;    Republicans wade into S.C. flag flap
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ The leading Republican presidential
candidates stepped gingerly into the minefield of racial politics
last week on the subject of the Confederate battle flag that flies
atop the South Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Republican primary is Feb. 19, and the
state's largely white Republican electorate is listening keenly for
any suggestion that the flag should come down, knowing they risk
offending African-Americans and white voters elsewhere who find the
flag offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush said he would not fly the flag in
Texas ``because of the symbolism,'' but left it to South
Carolinians to decide what to do in their state. Bush also attended
a campaign event last week at a former plantation in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) gave varying answers so often last
week that he took the highly unusual step (for him) of reading from
a statement when asked about the flag.
</P>
<P>
   He began the week by telling a national television audience that
the flag is a ``symbol of racism and slavery.'' That description
upset some of his South Carolina supporters, and he amended his
words a couple of days later to say the flag is ``a symbol of
heritage,'' more in line with the language used by advocates for
keeping the flag flying.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after that on a radio program in New Hampshire, a
caller asked McCain if he sees the flag ``in any way as a symbol of
a movement that was to some degree based on the enslavement of
human beings?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``Historians differ on the original causes. For
years it was viewed strictly as a states' rights issue. Later
historians have viewed it as also an issue of slavery as well. And
I think there's still divided opinion. But I don't think there's
any doubt that slavery played a major role, particularly as far as
fostering of the abolitionist movement is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to his campaign bus, reporters again asked
McCain what caused the Civil War. ``I don't think there's any doubt
that slavery was the prime factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN WALL RESURFACES
</P>
<P>
   _ IN NEW YORK STATE
</P>
<P>
   McCain lashed out Thursday at Bush's New York state supporters,
accusing them of trying to keep him off the March 7 primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the Berlin Wall came down. ... Let us not have the kind
of Stalinist politics that the state of New York and the Republican
Party have been practicing,'' McCain said, specifically citing Gov.
George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers, both Bush
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans have complex and stringent requirements to
get on the state ballot, including obtaining signatures in all 31
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign has said it has gathered enough signatures to
get on the ballot in 25 or 26 districts. But Bush's forces in New
York are reviewing the petitions before deciding whether to
challenge them. Out-of-place punctuation is just one reason to
declare a signature invalid in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonan appealed to Bush to let his petitions stand. The
governor declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important for all of us to play by the same
rules,'' Bush told reporters in Portsmouth, N.H. ``It's a process
to encourage grass-roots participation, and I am confident that
Chairman Powers will run the party in a way that's fair for
everyone. ... What's fair is that we all play by the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and Steve Forbes are the only Republicans who will be
on the ballot everywhere in the state. Three of the six Republican
candidates did not even try.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes filed suit four years ago to force his way into the
primary, and McCain has filed a lawsuit to make it easier for him
this year.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ACCUSED OF PLAYING TRUMPED-UP RACE CARD
</P>
<P>
   Willie Horton, the black man who raped a woman while on a
furlough from a Massachusetts prison, resurfaced in Democratic
presidential politics last week. Bill Bradley accused Vice
President Al Gore of race-baiting because he was the first
candidate in the 1988 campaign to raise the issue of furloughs
against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racial dimension to that _ there were probably a lot of
other people who fit into that category,'' Bradley said in an
interview with the Boston Herald. He said he would have found
another way to question Dukakis' crime-fighting credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign enlisted Dukakis to dispute Bradley's
claim. Gore aides and Dukakis pointed out that Gore did not name
Horton or state his race when he brought up problems with the
furlough program in a Democratic debate.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.), another
presidential candidate in 1988, also came to Gore's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Horton became a symbol of negative campaigning when George
Bush's campaign used his case and picture in a commercial against
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ERA IN POLITICS?
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan says he represents the
future in politics. But he talked a lot about the past Friday at a
convention of students.
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the students that he is the ``reigning champ'' of
the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. He emphasized
his Republican roots by noting that he worked in the Nixon White
House ``before you were born, all during the Vietnam War, which I
thought was a just cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He did look ahead, as well. The former journalist and
presidential speechwriter predicted that NATO expansion would
eventually result in American troops fighting in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know it, but you and your brothers and sisters are
committed to go to war if Belorussia tries to grab Bialystok from
Poland,'' Buchanan said in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted that he would have a strong showing in the
presidential race this year, ushering in ``an era of multiparty
politics.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES, ONCE AGAIN ON DISPLAY
</HEADLINE>
   (hm) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite sports philosophers, Willem Hendrik ``Butch''
van Breda Kolff, who coached Bill Bradley in college (``Bill is not
hungry,'' he said at the time) and Wilt Chamberlain in the pros (he
benched the Dipper as a quitter), liked to declaim that ``each
man's strength is his weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch would say it so many times in so many ways _ ruefully,
bombastically, pointedly, kindly, self-referentially _ that it
seemed like an all-purpose description of the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it sounded like perfect descriptions of the three
very human conditions of Bill Parcells, John Rocker and Robert Wood
Johnson IV, the current trinity of sports, our secular religion,
the father, the son and the holy gold.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the least interesting and most vulnerable of the three,
has been treated with the greatest disrespect. Baseball's
implication that Rocker was mentally ill because of his expressions
of bigotry seemed almost Soviet; if they don't agree with Kremlin
policy, commit them to the loony gulags. Of course, one assessment
of mental illness is in the extent to which someone does not deal
with current reality. If indeed Rocker is mentally ill _ and his
behavior in uniform could lead to that conclusion _ it is in his
bent for self-destruction. In the current reality, an entertainment
figure does not attack the public unless it is a cry for help.
Otherwise, it seems crazy to blow your career blowing off steam.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand (and he is a left-hander), Rocker is a closer,
a very special type of athlete, Horatio on the Mound, the Lone
Ranger riding in from the bullpen with the game on the line. His
arm is the final barrier that every foe with a club is trying to
break down. It's not paranoia when they are out to get you. Perhaps
it's paranoia if you can't shut it off. But maybe he has to stay in
character all the time so as not to lose his edge. Do remember that
baseball was not publicly suggesting that he get psychiatric
testing or counseling while he was playing and winning and helping
to boost ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it's not as if Rocker called a news conference to express
his fear and ignorance. He offered it to a magazine writer while
tramping through the woods waxing wildlife. It wasn't even faux hip
and smirk-funny, like the mercenary bump-and-grind of drive-time
shock jocks who pretend their cruelty is satire. Rocker should
plead the radio defense.
</P>
<P>
   The strength/weakness of Parcells is more subtle. Street-smart
bully that he is, Parcells, like New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
has created a land-mined area around himself. He is rarely called
out, and then he generally sneers his way past the discussion. In
the wake of the first reports of Bill Belichick's here-and-where,
observers sighted Parcells' fine hand pulling the strings.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief time of uncertainty, a few dared remind that
Parcells had a history of leaving every franchise in disarray, the
same way that Billy Martin or Napoleon would win but burn out the
bullpen. But then the backlash was lashed back, and it was pointed
out that every franchise had improved dramatically under Parcells.
Even le deluge apres Bill was not as deep as the troubled waters on
which he walked.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' strength/weakness is his willingness, nay, his need,
to take responsibility/control. Of course. The coach has always had
to make a collective out of rambunctious, often selfish youngsters.
But the modern coach is dealing with young millionaires who need to
be intimidated by the raw power of a confident personality who can
make front-office as well as on-field decisions. You can't adjust a
modern star player's game unless you can also threaten to dump him.
Why would anyone ever think that the manipulative skills of a
modern coach wouldn't also extend to his own job?
</P>
<P>
   But even coaches need daddies, sugar daddies actually, and
everyone seemed happy that the Jets got a bona fide philanthropist,
a man dedicated to giving away the money of his father and
grandfather. The National Football League apparently found that
more appealing than the sports expertise of Charles Dolan, who
controls Cablevision, Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know either man, although I've met them: Johnson 10
years ago, when he was helping to pay for a public televison show I
was the host of, and Dolan last year, when I was the host of a
health show on one of his channels. Both appeared smart and
low-key, although it was not hard to imagine their competitive
juices.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast meeting, there was a current of restlessness
about Johnson; he did not seem self-satisfied and his questions
were probing. Dolan, self-deprecating in a speech to a group
honoring his philanthropy last month, introduced two good friends
in the audience: George Steinbrenner and Don King.
</P>
<P>
   For many rich and influential people who have quietly put their
thumbprints on their times but not their footprints in cement,
there must come a time when they want People Magazine/Sports Center
recognition, when fame becomes the name of their game.
</P>
<P>
   They have achieved goals with their energy and money, and in a
celebrity culture, they believe they can achieve even more as a
brand. That's strength and weakness. There are few faster ways to
boost brand equity than owning a major sports franchise. We give
them free publicity every day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that Rocker was not a football player, available
for the Jets to buy on eLinebacker. That would have been synergy.
Then the news media, instead of calling Rocker crazy, would call
him crazy like a fox, suggesting he was only feigning madness to
scare offensive lines and cause quarterbacks to sack themselves.
How wonderful if an enlightened new owner as dedicated to winning
as Johnson would buy him as part of a welcome-back package for
Parcells, a CEO-president-general manager-coach who would know just
how to spank and stroke him.
</P>
<P>
   The spin would go so: This boy is so fiery, so filled with the
toxic slime you need to succeed in the arena, that some of it just
leaked out. Hey, we can stand a little pollution in exchange for
all that light and heat. Just be glad he only talks dirty. He
doesn't crack up cars, beat up cameramen or kill his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rocker isn't crazy enough to stand up to his
rehabilitation. Alas, that may be his real van Breda Kolffian
strength and weakness.

MARC DAVIS, 86, MASTER ANIMATOR FOR WALT DISNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Davis, one of the top cartoon animators who have worked on
Walt Disney films, died Wednesday. He was 86 and lived in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was also a designer, worked for Disney from 1935
until his retirement in 1978. He was one of a core group of
animators whom Walt Disney, borrowing a phrase used to describe
U.S. Supreme Court justices, called ``the nine old men.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co., said Davis
``helped to define the art of animation'' and raised it to new
heights. ``His abilities as a draftsman were second to none,''
Disney added, ``and as a result, he often took on the most
complicated assignments of drawing heroines and villainesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was so highly praised for his work on female characters
that he was called Disney's ``ladies' man.'' He worked on the
design of characters like Cinderella and Maleficient, the evil
fairy in ``Sleeping Beauty,'' and imbued them with vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran animator who was one of the ``nine old men,''
Frank Thomas, said that a number of Disney people had a hand in
creating the appearance of Snow White, of ``Seven Dwarfs'' fame.
Davis then worked on her movements to make her look like a graceful
young woman, realistic and appealing. Thomas said that Davis ``did
the same for Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also worked his magic on Cruella DeVil, the eccentric
villainess in ``101 Dalmatians'' who wanted to make coats from
Dalmatian puppy fur.
</P>
<P>
   What has been called Davis' talent for ``personality animation''
has also been lauded for enhancing the appeal of cartoon animals
like Bambi.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was born in Bakersfield, Calif. He received art training
at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, the Otis
Art Institute of Los Angeles and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Davis worked on the Disney theme parks
Disneyland and Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of the rides for both parks have been designed by
Marc Davis,'' Christopher Finch wrote in his 1973 book ``The Art of
Walt Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He begins each of them as if he were planning a cartoon. His
first task is to establish the atmosphere and chief features of the
ride, including all the characters who will contribute to it. Then
he prepares a storyboard, which gives the project a structure and a
sequence.'' Davis also worked on other Disney recreational sites.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has
held an annual ``Marc Davis Lecture on Animation.''

2 CHALLENGERS REMAIN IN AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The hammerhead sharks and fishermen who
frequent the Hauraki Gulf will have a few days' respite from the
television helicopters and the spectator fleet that have disrupted
their routines of late.
</P>
<P>
   For now but not for long, the America's Cup races among the
challengers are over on the unpredictable stretch of water that
local yachting hero Peter Blake calls, quite appropriately, ``a
natural amphitheater.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 of the original 11 challengers remain. And though there
have been surprises in this marathon disguised as a regatta _ Young
America's early demise and Stars and Stripes' strong finish and
eventual defeat _ precious few are surprised to see that Prada
Challenge and America One have emerged as the Louis Vuitton Cup
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, which represents Italy's Yacht Club Punta Ala, has a
single sponsor, which deals in luxury and has afforded its team
exactly that in its first bid for the Cup. The Italians were the
first challenger to complete their compound here, and the first to
build their two boats. A year ago, they were already in Auckland,
honing their skills and learning the vagaries of the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   America One, which represents San Francisco's St. Francis Yacht
Club, has had to work much harder to pay its considerable bills.
``For me,'' said the skipper and syndicate head, Paul Cayard, ``the
toughest part was last spring and summer, dealing with the stress
of pushing the program forward operationally and hiring people. I
was telling them we were solid as a rock, while knowing that I
didn't have all the money yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of a top yacht designer (Bruce Nelson) and a
fine crew (which includes John Kostecki and Gavin Brady) and
Cayard, one of the most able and visible personalities in the
sport, ended up producing a successful campaign. And though Cayard
says he ``still needs to raise a million bucks to get all the way
to March,'' the performance of his new boat, USA-61, in the
semifinals should help the cause.
</P>
<P>
   With his French father, American mother, Swedish wife and deep
connections with Italy (he skippered Il Moro di Venezia in the 1992
America's Cup finals), Cayard can claim to represent a number of
constituencies. And after winning the prestigious Whitbread Round
the World race in his first attempt in 1998, he is in position to
become yachting's leading man if he can defeat Prada and then the
defenders, Team New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   America One holds a 3-2 edge over Prada in this regatta, but one
of those victories came when the Italians' mast snapped on the
first leg. The other four races have been won by margins of 17
seconds, one minute, 23 seconds and, most recently and memorably,
eight seconds, when the two boats sailed the final leg within a few
meters of each other and with the crews screaming at each other and
the referees. America One won that round, but it remains to be seen
which boat Prada will use against the Americans in the challengers'
finals, which begin Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be ITA-45, which they used in the first two round robins
and the semifinals? Or the newer ITA-48, which was used in the
third round robin and has been modified?
</P>
<P>
   Skipper Francesco de Angelis said that because of the
unpredictable weather, the decision will be made and announced at
the last possible minute. This being Auckland, each boat must be
able to thrive in all conditions. Both syndicates will announce
their choices on Jan. 20.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Looking at ITA-45 and USA-61, Stars and Stripes tactician Tom
Whidden said, ``I think they're both pretty good boats.'' He added:
``Probably America One might be a little better in the light air,
and Prada might be a little better in the breeze. And for sure
America One, the way it is today, is a little faster downwind than
Prada.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: In Cayard and the Italians, the America's
Cup, seldom a ratings buster (especially when the protests start to
fly), has an attractive challenger matchup and an audience on both
sides of the Atlantic, as well as in sailing-crazy Auckland. &QL;

 &HT;    Parties try to court a changing black electorate
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is the Democrats' not-so-secret weapon
among black Americans. But the president is not on this year's
ballot and that concerns Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   Black voters have turned out in force to support Clinton and
those he has campaigned for. The president has astronomical
approval ratings from African-Americans, as high as 87 percent in
some polls.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bill Bradley nor Al Gore, the Democratic candidates for
president, has yet to generate anywhere near the same level of
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   And for Democrats, the fewer African-Americans who vote, the
harder it is to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an eternal optimist, but I'm also a realist and looking at
it right now, we have a lot of ground to cover before November
2000,'' said Thompson, a 30-year veteran of Deep South politics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Democratic nominee can reach Clintonian heights
among black voters will go a long way toward determining his fate,
especially in some Southern states. Some Republicans believe Texas
Gov. George W. Bush also would make inroads among black voters if
he is the GOP nominee, but he will have to overcome a legacy of
distrust of the Republican Party by African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Thompson's worry about black voter turnout lies a story
of remarkable political loyalty. Democratic presidential candidates
have won at least 83 percent of the votes of African-Americans in
every election since 1964. That includes the Republican landslides
of 1972 and 1984 in which Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan won 49
states.
</P>
<P>
   But more and more African-Americans identify themselves as
independents, believing that the Democratic Party takes them for
granted. ``We're disrespected by one party and ignored by the
other,'' said Georgia Rep. Tyrone Brooks, a Democrat who has
supported Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is most pronounced among younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Williams, a Republican who heads Black America's Political
Action Committee, said Democrats should see the growing
disaffection of younger black voters as ``a warning sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are moderate to conservative on public
policy issues. There is no reason why the Democratic Party should
have a monopoly on our votes,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Issue by issue, Republicans would seem to be able to compete
with the Democrats, said David Bositis, an analyst with the Joint
Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington. For
example, black Americans are no less receptive to tough penalties
for criminals than are Americans as a whole, and church-going
African-Americans tell poll takers that they are open to
restrictions on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have, in fact, given Republican candidates up to a third
of their votes _ spectacularly strong showings for GOP candidates _
in scattered elections. ``We will no longer blindly support a
Democrat,'' said the Rev. Emmanuel Cleaver, a Democrat and the
former mayor of Kansas City, referring to a recent Senate election
in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But those occasions are the strong exception to the rule over
the past 40 years. Black voters are, by and large, Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they grow impatient with Democrats, they rarely move
into the Republican column. ``The level of mistrust is too great
and the party has done nothing to try to ease it,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the words of Renee Amoore, who heads the GOP's drive to
recruit African-Americans, ``Black people see Republicans as people
with two heads.''
</P>
<P>
   A MATTER OF TRUST
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent events illustrate the problem Republicans
face in attracting support from the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, black residents of South Carolina filed a
complaint with the U.S. Justice Department that alleges the South
Carolina Republican Party deliberately closed polling places in
black areas during the last two presidential primaries, which are
open to all voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans say, 'See, we hold this open primary.' But what
they're doing is holding a white primary,'' said A. Lee Parks, an
Atlanta lawyer who is best known for his advocacy on behalf of
opponents of majority-black electoral districts and affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if only 5 or 10 percent voted Republican _ it doesn't
matter,'' Parks said. ``You have to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied that race was at play in their decision to
close some polling places. But Democrats jumped all over the issue,
although they hardly could be in favor of having more blacks vote
in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   Also in South Carolina, controversy over the Confederate battle
flag, which flies atop the state Capitol, caused headaches for
Republican presidential candidates. They did not want to offend
white South Carolinians who vote in the GOP primary, but anything
other than a condemnation of the flag might serve to reinforce
perceptions of Republican insensitivity to black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the South Carolina incident, Donna Brazile, Gore's
campaign manager, asserted that Republicans use such high-profile
African-Americans as Gen. Colin Powell and Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma as political props.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans bring out Colin Powell and J.C. Watts because
they have no program, no policy,'' Brazile said. ``They'd rather
take pictures with black children than feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   There were cries of outrage from Republicans, including Powell
and Watts. Gore and Brazile offered apologies of sorts to Powell,
but no other prominent African-American or Democrat challenged the
premise of Brazile's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   And her words were only her most recent efforts to galvanize
African-American support for Gore by accusing Republicans of racial
insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's tepid response from African-Americans may
be a public relations problem, which could be corrected. Or it
could reflect a fundamental incompatibility. But whatever the
reason, it remains a vexing problem that shows no signs of easing
this year, not even if Bush is the party's presidential nominee,
according to Rusty Paul, the former Georgia Republican Party
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``In November 2000, you'll see traditional voting patterns take
hold,'' Paul said glumly. He tried to recruit black Georgians
during his four years as chairman from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who works for Republican Steve Forbes' presidential
campaign, was especially discouraged by the final weeks of the 1998
campaign in Georgia, when Republican candidates for governor and
lieutenant governor made what were widely perceived to be
race-based appeals to conservative white voters.
</P>
<P>
   One Mitch Skandalakis ad, for instance, criticized Lt. Gov. Mark
Taylor for supporting a change in the state flag and maintenance of
``racial quotas'' in state programs.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guy Millner and Skandalakis lost their elections, and
``three TV commercials probably voided everything I did in four
years,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   CYNICISM AND POWER
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who can still count on getting the vast majority of
black votes, are focusing their efforts on turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine-year-old Byrdie Malbory helped register more than
1,000 new voters in Atlanta last year. But she complained that she
faces cynicism about the value of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been trying to figure it out. Here's a white Republican
and here's a white Democrat and people tell me, 'What difference
does it make? They all stand for the same thing,''' Malbory said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been able to achieve incremental increases in the
turnout of minority voters in selected races. Democrats elected
Ronnie Musgrove governor of Mississippi, partly on the strength of
a strong showing from black voters, even though Musgrove lacked
strong ties to African-Americans, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   A concerted campaign to get blacks to the polls included three
intensive days of campaigning by Jesse Jackson and 50,000
pre-recorded telephone calls from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who were not at home and got it on their answering
machines were taking their recorders to church to prove the
president called,'' Thompson said, chuckling. ``These are people
who never in their wildest dreams ever expected to hear the
president's voice. ... I heard people saying, 'I'm going to have to
vote now.'''
</P>
<P>
   A similar turn of events helped a Democrat win a narrow victory
in the Philadelphia mayor's race. There, appearances by Clinton
late in the campaign were credited with driving up turnout among
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to think where we would have been without Clinton,''
said Regina Thomas, a Washington-based consultant to the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Similar targeted drives should work again in 2000, Thomas said.
In Florida, voters may have a say on affirmative action programs,
which Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.) predicted would produce a huge
black vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the proving grounds will undoubtedly be Missouri, where
Sen. John Ashcroft, a Republican, faces a tough challenge from
Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   Race already has taken center stage in the campaign. Ashcroft
and Sen. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond, also a Missouri Republican, led
fellow Republicans in rejecting the nomination of Ronnie White to a
federal judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans voted along party lines to reject White on the
grounds that he is too lenient when it comes to the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   White, a justice on the Missouri Supreme Court, is
African-American, and his supporters alleged that the Republicans
were playing racial politics with the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen such a statewide organization like the one
that has mobilized against Ashcroft,'' Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver was one of several leading African-Americans in Missouri
to back Bond in his 1998 election, when he ran against Attorney
General Jay Nixon. Nixon put off some blacks with his handling of
lawsuits over school desegregation and busing.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also built ties to the black community by helping direct
federal housing funds to Kansas City as chairman of a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee, Cleaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the black leaders in Missouri who backed Bond were
chastened when the senator announced his opposition to White, and
they have vowed to seek vengeance against Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Carnahan have tried to muddy the issue by digging
up 40-year-old photos of Carnahan in black face when he performed
in minstrel shows as a younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver predicted the move would backfire because Carnahan has a
solid record on civil rights issues. ``All it will end up doing is
reminding people that Ashcroft led the charge against Ronnie
White,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   RIPE FOR CHANGE?
</P>
<P>
   But the Missouri campaigns bring into relief the issue of
whether Democrats deserve so many votes from black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   By most economic measures, the Clinton administration has been
good for black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has helped raise black household incomes, cut
black unemployment rates and reduce poverty at rates faster than
for those of whites.
</P>
<P>
   But African-Americans still fare worse than whites in most
categories, and little has changed for the very poor, in which
blacks are disproportionately represented.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, Clinton has had a mixed record at best on
issues of concern to African-Americans, said Ronald Walters, a
political scientist at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the worst things that have happened were the crime
bill and welfare reform, both of which Clinton supported,'' Walters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intended both issues to appeal to moderate and
conservative white voters in his re-election campaign in 1996,
Walters said. But black Americans _ disproportionately represented
in prisons and on the welfare rolls _ had the most to lose from
harsher prison sentences and limits on government assistance
contained in both pieces of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But one other thing happened that galvanized black support for
Clinton: impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here were blacks who felt they had been put upon by the right
and Clinton was being punished by the right and there was a
tremendous sense of identity,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   But with Clinton set to leave office and impeachment a rapidly
fading memory, black Republicans believe the time is ripe for a
major push.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's candidacy and his message of compassionate conservatism
should appeal to black voters, said Terea Jeter Chappell, the
president of the Republican Vanguard, an organization of black
Republicans in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the things this man has done in the state of
Texas, test scores for black children have increased
dramatically,'' Chappell said. ``That's why he received 27 percent
of the black vote in his re-election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's support for something he calls affirmative access also
may help to blunt criticism of Republicans who want to end racial
preference programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's term is vague, but he has stated his clear opposition to
quotas. His call for equal opportunity may get a warm reception
from African-Americans, Chappell said.
</P>
<P>
   Amoore, who chairs the Republican Party's New Majority Council,
acknowledged the difficulty of addressing the affirmative action
issue when appealing for black support. ``It makes it real hard.
When you go into the black churches, you always get the question on
affirmative action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paul is pessimistic about Republican chances in the
black community, Amoore said she can break down resistance. ``My
thing is, all Republicans are not far to the right,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Smith, a losing candidate for the Virginia House of
Delegates last year, was succinct in his advice to his party. ``We
need to get off the anti-affirmative action kick,'' said Smith, who
is black.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting a sea of change anytime soon in the votes
of black Americans. Republicans appear far more interested in
drawing Hispanic votes this year, believing Bush's success in Texas
will translate into a strong showing nationally if he's the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But even slight increases in the number of blacks who vote for
Republicans could cause seismic shifts in Southern elections, where
Republicans already command large majorities among white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan Glenn, a black Republican running for Congress from
Georgia, said the party can only slowly change its image of being
dominated by southern white males.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton had it right when he said, 'I'm, going to make
my cabinet look like America,''' Glenn said. ``We've got to run
candidates for the school board, local offices, state and federal
office and the presidency.''

RETIREMENT RATE OF NEW YORK POLICE OFFICERS RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Capt. John Murolo joined the Police Department
in 1979, he says, he intended to spend at least 25 years on the
job. But last November, when Murolo, the commander of the 114th
Precinct in Queens, became eligible for retirement at the end of
his 20th year, he waited only a few weeks before filing his papers
and leaving the force for a new career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that is making people like me, who should
be the future of the job, leave,'' said Murolo, who is now a
security official at Columbia University. ``It is much more
difficult to be a precinct commander today than it was years ago.
You are held accountable for everything, and the hours that the
process stole from my family absolutely impacted on my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Murolo was part of a surge of retirements last year that union
officials say depleted the force of many of its most skilled and
experienced supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 some 66 officers who held the rank of captain or above
filed for retirement, a 53 percent increase over the year before,
when 43 filed for retirement, according to department statistics.
In addition, during the last six months, 96 lieutenants retired, or
twice as many as in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say the increase is really just a return to an
established pattern, set several years ago, when every year 60 or
so high-ranking officers would retire. For example, in 1996, 65
officers who held the rank of captain or above filed for
retirement, they said. And they said the officers who were leaving
now were, as often as not, being drawn from their jobs by
employment opportunities spawned by the vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials said the departures were also greatly
influenced by what they described as the officers' frustrations
with a constant pressure to produce, a burden that they said has
fallen particularly hard on precinct commanders as they struggle to
secure continuing drops in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among captains, the mind-set used to be `40 and out,''' said
John Driscoll, the president of the Captains Endowment Association.
``But the mind-set now is `20 and out' because the morale level is
so perceptively different that, given any opportunity to leave,
they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Several police officials said they considered talk of poor
morale to be something of a fixture of life on the force, like the
green globe lights that greet officers at the front doors of many
station houses. Often, they said, the discussion of slumping morale
grows louder when contracts are about to expire, as they are now,
and unions begin to jockey for leverage at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Michael Markman, who commands the Personnel Bureau, said a
larger factor in the decision of many officers to leave was their
ability to time their departures to coincide with a 6 percent
salary increase that is to go into effect March 1. With accumulated
leave for unused vacation and sick time, many supervisors were able
to file for retirement many months ago and will be carried on the
payroll through March, when the raise will be part of their pension
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Markman said that often even those retiring officers who do not
secure a job in the private sector find that with tax breaks and
other factors, their yearly pension payments come close to matching
their take-home pay while they were working.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of officers started to qualify for full
retirement benefits last November after a four-year lull stemming
from hiring limits in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of many senior officers would accelerate a trend
in which the experience level of supervisors has dropped in recent
years. For example, in 1995, more than 70 percent of the officers
who held the rank of captain or above had over 20 years on the job.
Today less than 50 percent do.
</P>
<P>
   But Markman said that supervisors who have less time on a job
are not necessarily less qualified, especially since many of the
younger captains came to the department better educated than their
predecessors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This young agency is achieving remarkable drops in crime and
addressing quality-of-life issues that were never addressed before
by the more senior agency,'' he said. ``They're out there. They're
energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment
Association, said book knowledge alone could never replace the sort
of street smarts that veteran officers acquire on the job. ``In a
year and a half I expect to lose most of the senior
investigators,'' he said, ``and these are the premier
investigators, the ones with the most experience. You can't replace
those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The department is trying to retain its talented people by
expanding the number of promotional opportunities, Markman said.
For example, he said, there are 468 captains today, compared with
394 four years ago. The increased number means there is an ample
supply of skilled replacements when veteran commanders retire,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' Safir said, ``we have tons of people who are
qualified to be precinct commanders, and we get to cherry-pick them
and select the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Several commanders who retired recently predicted that the
department would have to turn to its deep bench very soon, because,
they said, they expected the number of captains and other
supervisors filing for retirement to continue to increase this
year. Already, during the first 10 days of 2000, five officers who
hold the rank of captain or above have put in their paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Costello, who was the second-in-command in the vice
division until he filed his papers last October, said many captains
wince when they see qualified commanders transferred for slight
crime increases in their precincts. For some, he said, the pressure
to produce and avoid such a fate can become unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We end up brutalizing these cops to get your numbers,'' he
said. ``You take these rookies and you make them into summons
machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. John Palamar, who was the No. 2 commander for the Police
Lab until he filed for retirement last month, said his decision to
leave was complex, and included an interest in seeking
opportunities outside the department. But many of his colleagues,
he said, cited job stress in discussing their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With beepers and cell phones you found yourself working 24
hours a day,'' he said. ``People would tell me that if they worked
in private industry, in the same kind of job, they would be making
300 grand with a chauffeur and other perks.''

IN MATCH WITH U.S., IRANIANS SEE HOPE FOR DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Having traveled across the Atlantic Ocean and
a wider political gulf, the Iranian soccer team recently arrived
for the first time in the United States, only to discover that this
extraordinary road trip was really a homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's match against the Americans at the Rose Bowl will not
be so different from any match played at Azadi Stadium in Tehran.
An estimated 500,000 Iranian-Americans live in Southern California,
and they have given Los Angeles the nickname of Tehrangeles.
</P>
<P>
   Of the expected 50,000 spectators, officials said as many as
40,000 could be there to support Iran, where soccer is a consuming
secular passion. Fans are coming from as far as Toronto and
Washington. Messages on Web sites have provided ticket holders with
instructions on wearing shirts of red, white and green, Iran's
national colors, depending on the location of their seats. ``If we
do this around the stadium, we will have the flag of Iran just by
sitting there,'' one message said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go, Iranian people come to see us,'' said
Mohammad Khakpoor, a defender on the Iranian team. ``We are never
strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting, Iran defeated the United States, 2-1, at
the 1998 World Cup in France. The rematch does not carry the
importance, novelty, emotion or anticipation of the first game. It
will, after all, most likely be played in a half-empty stadium with
nothing officially at stake in the outcome. Some Iranians in and
out of Iran have also grown cautious about this game's symbolism,
given their disappointment over the slow pace of change in the
government of the relatively moderate president, Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game represents the most visible appearance of a
sports team from Iran in the United States since diplomatic
relations between the countries were severed after the 1979 Islamic
revolution and the taking of hostages that year at the American
Embassy in Tehran. Tens of millions are expected to watch on
television in Iran, where the match starts at 1:30 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran participated in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and, next month,
Iranian wrestlers will compete in their fifth tournament in the
United States in the past five years. American wrestlers are
traveling to Tehran this weekend for the second time. Soccer,
however, is the national sport in Iran, and as an important
unifying and political force, it could provide a useful foundation
for rebuilding the relationship between the two countries,
Iranian-Americans, Iranian players and officials say.
</P>
<P>
   No one is naive enough to expect that 20 years of enmity will
cease because of one soccer match. But Sunday's game could serve as
a kind of chisel for chipping away at demonizing stereotypes that
portray Iran as a country of fanatics and the United States as the
Great Satan, Mayereh Tohidi, a professor of political sociology at
the California State University at Northridge, said.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, the match confirms what many Iranians in
and out of Iran believe, that the ``angry, no-talk policy'' with
the United States is no longer useful. And it reflects a desire for
improvement in everyday connections between families, like easier
acquisition of visas, Farideh Farhi, a political scientist in
Honolulu, said.
</P>
<P>
   Jalal Talebi, who coached Iran in the 1998 World Cup and is now
the team's general manager, said: ``I believe this is a good way to
start. Nothing will happen if we keep ignoring each other. We are
in 2000, the new millennium. They have to sit down and talk. Sooner
or later they will do that. That's what everyone wishes. The people
in Iran do, at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Iranian-Americans interviewed pointedly wanted to distance
the game from politics, saying they had been exhausted by decades
of such talk. Instead, they embraced the match as a means of
exhibiting kinship, sportsmanship and rejuvenated pride in what it
means to be Iranian. Many said they would have dual loyalties. Tens
of thousands of paper flags, featuring the American flag on one
side and the Iranian flag on the other, have been printed for the
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to realize that life is beyond politics,'' Alireza
Ghaffari, 44, a research engineer at the California Institute of
Technology who has lived in the United States since 1977, said.
``This is purely sport. This is everyday life. I hope Iran wins,
but it is not important who wins. What is important is that the
game is being played.''

   Iranian players and officials have commended American soccer
officials for respectful treatment during their stay in the United
States. The atmosphere has been decidedly relaxed and informal, and
security has been so low-key as to be invisible. A largely
Iranian-American crowd of 30,000 showed up on Wednesday night at
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Iran's 2-1 victory over
Ecuador, with spectators waving flags, blowing plastic horns,
standing through the sunroofs of Mercedes-Benzes in ecstatic
support.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the players visited Universal Studios then
trained at the University of Southern California, simply changing
into their shorts and jerseys on the practice field, posing for
photos, speaking briefly with reporters and offering to continue
the interviews at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to see the team,'' said Beshid Bahmanyar, a
loan officer who lives in Los Angeles. ``I'm also sad that the
mullahs have destroyed my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Heightened security is expected for Sunday's match, Iranian
officials said. Some form of demonstrations is expected. At the
1998 World Cup, several thousand Iranian supporters protested at
the American match in Lyons by wearing T-shirts and hanging banners
in support of expatriate leaders based in Iraq and France. Some
Iranian-Americans have said they plan to raise black-gloved fists,
distribute posters and to refuse to sing Iran's national anthem in
protest of the fundamentalist Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being a sporting event, Sunday's match will carry
inevitable political intrigue as well, coming several weeks before
momentous February elections in Iran, in which the opposition hopes
to gain a majority over conservatives in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A match that is cleanly played and undisturbed could reinforce
the position of those who want a dialogue with Americans, while a
match troubled on the field or in the stands could play into the
hands of conservatives who view the United States government as the
devil incarnate, Middle East experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For diplomacy, it's more important that the Iranians win,''
Richard Dekmejian, a professor of political science at Southern
California, said. ``Politically and psychologically, it means much
more for Iran than for the U.S. At this stage of their national
development, it could go a long way toward repairing their hurt
sense of pride and dignity. The push for change is there. This is
one more element that could contribute to it. When you are most
sure of yourself, you can bring yourself to negotiate with the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Khatami, Iran's president, called for cultural
exchanges to break the ``wall of mistrust'' separating Iran and the
United States. While the governments remain far apart, the two
countries are well into re-establishing links on personal and
sporting terms. Southern California has the largest Iranian
population outside of Iran. Many of the wealthy, well-educated
expatriates fled to places like Beverly Hills and the San Fernando
Valley when the Shah was deposed and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
came to power.
</P>
<P>
   Khakpoor, the Iranian defender, played last season for the
MetroStars. Talebi, the World Cup coach, lived in Palo Alto,
Calif., for 17 years, and his family still lives there. At the 1998
World Cup, the Iranian players handed flowers to the Americans as a
gesture of peace, the teams posed for a picture, exchanged jerseys
after the match and were given the Fair Play award by soccer's
world governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, remarked in a
speech that the ``strong and arrogant opponents felt the bitter
taste of defeat,'' the celebration in the streets of Tehran was not
heavily politicized, according to Farhi, who joined in the
reveling. She said Iranians who wanted to burn American flags were
halted by the crowds, as were those who wanted to spray
anti-American graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for friendship,'' Khakpoor said. ``We don't
have any fight with any people. I try to be a good representative
for our culture, our people, our country.''

INDICTED NURSING-HOME OWNER SEEKS APPROVAL TO EXPAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Health Department is considering
an application to expand a nursing-home business in Brooklyn, even
though the owner was recently indicted in a $62 million Medicaid
fraud case and has been suspended from the Medicaid program, a
health official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Lawrence Friedman, submitted the application on Dec.
13, two days before he was indicted by a grand jury in state
Supreme Court in Brooklyn following an investigation by the state
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given our ongoing legal action, we are adamantly opposed to
the application,'' said Scott Brown, a spokesman for Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer, ``and feel strongly it should be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   In late December, Spitzer criticized the Health Department for
allowing Friedman's two adult day-care centers in Canarsie to
continue operating after Friedman was indicted on charges of grand
larceny, conspiracy and falsifying medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-count indictment accused Friedman of drawing robust
immigrants into the centers, which are intended for the frail, and
billing the Medicaid program for unnecessary or nonexistent
services. The centers will continue to receive the bulk of state
reimbursements for services deemed appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment was issued after an 18-month investigation, in
which the Health Department ``fully'' cooperated with the attorney
general, the department has said. During that time, however, the
department approved six expansions of Friedman's business, which
enabled him to increase his billings from $4 million a year to $47
million by the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's two adult day-care centers _ intended to provide
physical therapy and rehabilitation to the disabled elderly who can
still live independently _ quickly grew to account for one-quarter
of all state adult day-care Medicaid billings, the attorney general
has said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent application, Friedman asked for permission to
transfer the operation of 41 beds at the financially troubled Dover
Nursing Home in Brooklyn to his own Parkshore nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, as Friedman's application awaited approval in
Albany, the owner of the Dover home, Morey Adler, was also waiting
to hear from the Health Department so he could close his nursing
home and transfer his elderly clients.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Friedman started building a 41-bed unit at his
nursing home, according to records.
</P>
<P>
   A department spokesman, John Signor, said ``no decision has been
made'' on Friedman's application.
</P>
<P>
   Signor said that because the review process included an
assessment of character and competency, ``the actions the attorney
general has taken would be weighed heavily in our consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department did not tell the attorney general's office
of Friedman's pending application, said Brown, Spitzer's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Friedman's day care center, Dan Klores, said,
``The Parkshore nursing home hasn't done anything wrong, runs a
first-rate facility, and anyone is welcome to see it at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler could not be reached for comment. But as recently as
Tuesday, his health care consultant, Anthony J. Maddaloni, wrote to
the Health Department, saying that while the application was
pending, Dover would begin discharging its residents because of
financial losses.

RAMS-VIKINGS GAME COULD PRODUCE POINTS APLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (hm) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ There were demons and hexes and jinxes that the St.
Louis Rams needed buried.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, they had been a stumbling bunch, especially
on offense. There were turnovers and dropped passes, fumbles and
broken assignments. And a timid approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams kept gathering better players, and this season placed
the offense in the hands of Mike Martz, the new offensive
coordinator who arrived from the Washington Redskins. He decided
the Rams were rich in perimeter players. So that is how the Rams
decided they would play it this season, fast and loose in a daring
perimeter passing game.
</P>
<P>
   A true test of this strategy surfaced after the Rams bolted to a
3-0 record. It was in a home game in October against San Francisco.
Talk about demons and jinxes _ the 49ers had clobbered the Rams in
17 consecutive games. Ahead by 28-10 with 1 minute 59 seconds left
before halftime, the Rams had the ball at their 9-yard line. Martz
called for a pass, but the play exploded. San Francisco safety Tim
McDonald hit quarterback Kurt Warner, and the ball was fumbled into
the end zone, where 49ers end Junior Bryant recovered it for a
touchdown. The Rams' halftime lead was 11 points instead of 18. But
Martz kept firing, and St. Louis won, 42-20.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, some Rams talked about being greedy in that
situation and maybe learning a lesson of self-control.
</P>
<P>
   But Martz then and the rest of the Rams now insist on being
greedy and attacking relentlessly. It is what they are. It is what
they do and plan to do in their playoff battle with the Minnesota
Vikings today in the Trans World Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very first day I got here, we said this is what we
want to do: set the tempo and control the pace of the game,'' Martz
said. ``Now, that can get you some three-and-outs. It can get you
some turnovers. But we talked about it, thought it out and said we
want to use our perimeter people to make plays and have our
quarterback get rid of the ball and score points. It's what we
do.''
</P>
<P>
   They do it exceptionally well. So do the Vikings. That is why it
would not be a surprise if each team scored 30 points today.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams rank first in the league in total offense (fifth in
rushing and first in passing). Their 526 points led the league.
They average 400.8 offensive yards a game. They scored 13 rushing
touchdowns and 42 passing touchdowns. Warner, the league's most
valuable player, led all passers with 41 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings rank third in total offense (14th in rushing and
fifth in passing). They average 362.1 offensive yards a game. They
scored 13 rushing touchdowns and 32 passing touchdowns. In 11
starts, quarterback Jeff George threw for 23 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle for control Sunday between Martz and Ray Sherman, the
Vikings' offensive coordinator, will be explosive.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rams have continually accelerated their attack, the
Vikings have sought to become more of a pounding, deliberate team
with running back Robert Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strive to keep some balance between the run and pass, and
that can be hard to do with Jeff and a couple of receivers like
Cris Carter and Randy Moss on your side,'' Sherman said. ``But you
can see that Robert brings a home run hitter in the running game.
He is hitting his stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings Coach Dennis Green said: ``Our style of play is moving
toward two tight ends and more toward the regular formation over
the last four games, with a fullback in the backfield. We think
that is really our biggest weapon. When you do that, you have to
have patience in the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings can run it, they will keep the explosive St.
Louis offense from the ball. But sooner or later, the Rams will get
to touch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things about our offense is that we've got
some tough guys; it's not all speed,'' Martz said. ``We've got some
physical people and we take pride in being physical. You can't make
the plays we've made in our offense without having a physical
offensive line that protects. And we're proud of that group _ there
is only one starter, Orlando Pace, in it from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' offensive line has also meshed lately; it pounded
the Dallas Cowboys in Minnesota's wild-card playoff victory last
Sunday. And yet the Vikings still burned Dallas with fancy passes
to Carter and Moss.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, however, features running back Marshall Faulk as a
pass-catching threat and four receivers with impressive speed. The
star among them is Isaac Bruce, a Pro Bowl selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac can play the game in a different zone,'' Martz said.
``He can be outrageous. He is so fast, so quick, so energized.
Isaac can play lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   So can both offenses.

RUSSIAN ARMS IN PIPELINE TO CHECHNYA, GEORGIA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Russian troops have sold arms on the black
market from one of their bases in neighboring Georgia, and some of
the weapons are being smuggled to rebels fighting in Chechnya,
according to Georgian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say they seized a truck with contraband weapons
soon after it left a Russian military base outside the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, and have documented the episode on videotape that
has been shown on Georgian television and on Russia's independent
network NTV.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials, however, say that the tape was fabricated and
that the allegations have been made for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A former Soviet republic, Georgia has been gradually emerging
from Moscow's shadow and has sought to develop economic and
political ties with the West. The Georgian president, Edward A.
Shevardnadze, has even said that Georgia plans to apply for NATO
membership in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya has worsened the strains in Russian-Georgian
relations. Tensions grew late last year when the Russians proposed
stationing troops on the Georgian side of the border with Chechnya,
which is formally a Russian republic although its status was left
in limbo after the 1994-96 Russian-Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian purpose in proposing the troop deployment in Georgia
was to seal the southern approach to the Chechen highlands _ where
Chechen rebels can easily hide _ but the Georgians refused, balking
at being drawn into the Chechen conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Russians have complained that rebel supplies and
fighters continue to make their way across the frontier,
allegations the Georgians assert are not true. Russian warplanes
and helicopters have also occasionally strayed into Georgian
airspace and dropped bombs on the Georgian side of the border,
drawing protests from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994-96 war, there were reports that Russian troops
stationed in Chechnya sometimes sold weapons that ended up in the
hands of their adversary. Russian officials insist that their
troops are far more disciplined this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgians say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians are selling weapons which are being used to fire on
their own people,'' Avtandil Ioseliani, Georgia's deputy security
minister, said in a telephone interview. ``They should stop blaming
others and instead put the blame on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Georgian officials said they had intercepted a truck
filled with arms from the Vaziani military base near Tbilisi.
Russian troops stationed there are scheduled to be withdrawn under
a recent Russian-Georgian agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Vakhtang Kutateladze, Georgia's minister of national security,
said in a telephone interview that a Georgian truck had been hired
and its driver told that he would be picking up a supply of food
and delivering it to Tskhinvali, capital of the separatist South
Ossetia region in northern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   After he arrived at the base, however, the truck's civilian
license plates were replaced with Russian military ones. The driver
delivered one shipment to Tskhinvali, but became suspicious and
informed the Georgian Ministry of Security.
</P>
<P>
   The next day a second shipment was stopped by Georgian security
forces. Georgian officials say they did not follow the truck all
the way to Tskhinvali to apprehend the buyers because they were
wary about venturing into South Ossetia, which has been struggling
to secede from Georgia and merge with North Ossetia, a Russian
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials said the buyers were believed to be people of
the region, but offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Kutateladze said the truck was filled with about $50,000 worth
of arms, including boxes of mortar shells; more than 50,000
cartridges for machine guns; pistols; explosives, and guns and
shells designed for mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot be sure, but we think the shipment was intended for
Chechnya,'' Kutateladze said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been pounding the rebels from the air,
including 180 strikes in the past 24 hours, and using artillery.
The rebels, however, have mounted fierce resistance, using
relatively light arms like machine guns and mortars, which are
especially effective in Grozny, the Chechen capital, and in the
highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman for the Federal Security Service,
told Russian television that allegations of illicit arms sales from
Russian bases in Georgia had been investigated, but that no proof
had been found.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the videotape was a fabrication, implying that
the Georgians were trying to cover up their failure to stop
smuggling by attributing it to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tape was made primarily for domestic political consumption
and only secondly for Russia and the international community,'' he
said.

COMMENTARY: FINDING GOOD IN PRESENCE OF KLANSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, N.Y. _ James W. Sheeley had his moment of fame and
disdain in the big city last October when he led a puny Ku Klux
Klan rally in New York City. Then the grand dragon scampered back
to his home among the largely white hamlets of northern Orange
County.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Brian Randazzo came calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Hey, Jimmy. What's going on here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy and Brian had grown up, played ball and gone to church
together in the village of Coldenham. Brian became a substance
abuse counselor and pastor at the Brick Reformed Church. Jimmy
became a prison counselor and a substitute high school teacher. In
October it became clear that he had also become a Klansman.
</P>
<P>
   Even before joining in 1997, he said: ``I had white feelings. I
felt it was time to stand up and be proud to be a white man.'' He
hadn't been trying to hide, he told Randazzo, saying, ``I washed my
hood and robe and hung it outside on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeley's coming out as the New York-New Jersey leader of the
American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan has stirred months of meetings
and discussion here about race and intolerance, issues rarely
raised publicly in the small towns of this region.
</P>
<P>
   It has seeped into people's lives. Erica Cron was studying the
civil rights movement in the eighth grade when her teacher,
referring to Sheeley, told the class, ``It could still happen
today.'' Students at Valley Central High School say there is more
emphasis on Black History Month this year. There was a candlelight
unity rally at the school last month. On Sunday, Randazzo is
preaching Martin Luther King Jr.'s sermon ``Loving Your Enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said Jimmy Sheeley had an evil influence,'' Randazzo
said. ``I think Jimmy Sheeley had a good influence.''
</P>
<P>
   It has given King's birthday a meaning here that eludes many
communities. ``I remember when they first come out with the
holiday, it was like you had to be politically correct and think
about it,'' said Karsten Wilson, a physical education teacher.
``But now it's actually serving a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Randazzo has invoked King to guide his parishioners through
their anger toward their neighbor. ``We didn't respond to him with
hate, because as King said, hate begets hate, violence begets
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Randazzo invited Sheeley, 46, to a meeting at his church in
November. Sheeley told the audience that the Klan was not violent
or hateful, but was a white separatist group fighting for white
people in the face of intermarriage and civil rights for
minorities. The crowd grew especially tense, Randazzo said, when
``he called everyone in the room mongrels.''
</P>
<P>
   The community wanted to separate itself from Sheeley. ``If we
accept this one, how many more will there be?'' said Carrie Meyer,
17, a high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Shorter-Magwood, a black woman involved in the protest,
said: ``I felt Randazzo had taken a very bold move. He lived in a
community that was predominantly white, in a congregation that was
predominantly white, but he saw a need to bring the community
together.''
</P>
<P>
   She has childhood memories of racist activities in the small
towns of Orange County. Her parents feared harassment while driving
to Newburgh in the 1950s from their home in the Catskills. ``I
remember my mother saying we had to drive slowly and `Children, be
quiet,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheeley, a slight, nasal-voiced man who lives with his mother
and twin brother, shrugs off the town's reaction. ``When you go
public as a Klansman, you have to deal with it,'' he said. He quit
his prison job after being caught there with Klan literature, which
is considered contraband, and he stopped doing substitute teaching
last year. He says he is running for the U.S. Senate and plans
another rally in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although a pariah to some, he said, ``I get a lot of people who
come up to me in the store and say, `Keep going.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Randazzo will also keep going.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the sign in front of Montgomery's Brick Reformed
Church reads: ``Rev. Dr. King's Dream Is Still Alive in Montgomery,
Alabama and New York!''
</P>
<P>
   And so is his nightmare.

<P>
   William Shakespeare said all the world's a stage, and Reid Stowe
took him at his word. On a glorious day last week, Stowe sat in the
sun-baked pilothouse of his 70-foot schooner, Anne, and took in the
glistening Hudson River from the peace of his Manhattan berth. But
his mind was still adrift with thoughts of his most recent
adventure, a meandering six-month journey of offshore performance
art that he and his bride, Laurence Guillem, theatrically dubbed
the Odyssey of the Sea Turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally happy to be alive right now,'' he said. ``It
wasn't the smoothest voyage throughout. But we're back. It's real
nice to be here, and we're real positive about going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Stowe's travels in the three decades since he chucked his
surfboard and began cruising _ across the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans, to Antarctica, up the Amazon River _ have filled dozens of
logbooks. But all of his treks have been a mere tune-up for where
he is headed.
</P>
<P>
   This December, Stowe and Guillem plan to start a three-year,
nonstop ramble around the planet, an expedition they've entitled A
Thousand Days at Sea. If successful, it will be the longest sea
voyage out of sight of land and without resupplying ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measure of man's enlightenment has often been gauged by
what he could do with a boat on the sea,'' Stowe said somewhat
euphorically. ``I feel like we can help a little bit in the
evolution of mankind, just by leaving the earth and going to live
on the water. It's sort of a simple thing. But it's not that simple
because no one has ever attempted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent 194-day sea-turtle safari was a test run during which
the 48-year-old sailor and artist quite literally used the South
Atlantic as a broad natural canvas. Before hoisting sail last June
5 _ he and Laurence were married the week before _ Stowe drew a
picture of a giant turtle on a navigational chart. Once under way,
he plotted a course that would allow his 60-ton vessel to trace the
image as closely as possible through the sea.
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol, the sea turtle fulfilled several purposes. ``All of
my voyages have been centered around themes,'' Stowe said. ``I
prefer to sail a course that's beautiful as opposed to straight or
functional, like work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also something to be said about not racing around all
the time. So this voyage was sort of an antidote to our
speed-obsessed society. And the turtle is also a reminder about
endangered species and the environment. I'm sure it's going to be
interpreted in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stowe didn't know it beforehand, he soon learned that the
actual rendering of giant marine reptiles across a liquid domain
subject to the vagaries of wind and weather is no easy task. Just
days after leaving New York, his engine failed, and his tired,
bagged-out sails also limited his maneuverability. But he pressed
on across the equator and into the southeast trade winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get far enough south and east, so there would be
room to give the turtle some volume,'' he said. ``And with our old
sails we weren't able to hold as close a course into the wind as I
wanted, so we weren't able to draw out the spotted fin like we'd
planned. And we had envisioned a huge turtle, but we were making
slow progress, so we had to make it smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished work, which can be seen on Stowe's Web site,
www.1000days.net, was still 1,900 nautical miles long by 1,400
nautical miles wide. ``On the map you see our day-to-day points
like a constellation,'' he said. ``It's a turtle drawn there,
clearer than any constellation in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Stowe says that he and Guillem ``lost touch with the shore''
during the weeks of the cruise but that they also ``lost that sense
of timelessness'' once the mission was accomplished and they
realized they'd have to sail quickly to arrive back in New York by
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   A brush with Hurricane Lenny in late November as they negotiated
the Caribbean on their northbound leg brought some anxious moments,
but real danger loomed on their approach to the city in
mid-December. ``We were trying to tack in but we were blown
backward 30 miles by a sleet squall,'' Stowe said.
</P>
<P>
   But they persevered, and on Dec. 17, ``we came screaming up the
Hudson and got stuck in the mud right next to the dock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Guillem was recently in her native France visiting
relatives, Stowe continued making plans for his thousand-day trip,
for which he is actively seeking sponsorship. Part of that process
involves dealing with members of the news media, some of whom find
his earnestness and motivation ripe for ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   Stowe is unfazed. ``Sure, we get teased a bit, but that's OK,''
he said. ``I know what we've done and where we're going.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Lessons on King leave out leader's impact, some educators say
 &HT;    By Rochelle Carter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Small brown, black and tan hands shot into the air and
giggles resounded through the auditorium as hundreds of students
indicated their love for Happy Meals, pizza, and the Discovery
Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Morani Bonner, a teacher's aide at Brookview Elementary School,
explained to the children that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is
largely responsible for their ability to enjoy those childhood
pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to pretend it's the 1960s,'' Bonner said. He
changed his diction to a Southern drawl. ``No Happy Meal for you,
boy, because our restaurant says `Whites Only.'''
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta students know that King wanted children of
different races to go to school together. They know he was the
leader of the civil rights movement, for which he won a Nobel Peace
Prize in 1964. They know about Selma and Montgomery, Ala., the
March on Washington and ``I Have a Dream.'' They can recite his
birth date, the date an assassin gunned him down in Memphis, Tenn.,
and the milestones of the 39 years between.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their grasp of the facts about King, said Asa Hilliard,
a Georgia State University professor of urban education, ``It is
also my experience that not only here, but everywhere else, it is
superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren may know the words to ``We Shall Overcome,'' but
because there is no uniform emphasis on King, they may not
understand what life would have been like for them under
separate-but-equal laws, Bonner explained to the Brookview
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to pass along trivial knowledge (about history), and I
guess they get the cherry tree story on George Washington,'' said
Hilliard, who reviews social studies textbooks for publishers. He
has found them lacking in-depth information about King and most
other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that we have a high priority on cultural
knowledge,'' Hilliard said. It would be impossible to focus on
every historical figure, he acknowledged, ``but some figures stand
out so much, and King would be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia mandates on social studies education provide many
opportunities for classroom discussion of King's legacy. The
significance of King's birthday, which is officially celebrated
Monday, and holidays like Presidents' Day and Memorial Day are
taught in first-grade lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-grade history covers the civil rights movement as part of
the political and social change that took place after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Influential Georgians are an eighth-grade subject and the civil
rights era from 1947 to present day is studied through high school.
Each school district has its own mandates.
</P>
<P>
   But the curriculum does not guarantee students will understand
how important King is, said Howard Taylor, a Georgia State
University assistant professor of social science education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear the biggest celebration will be `Good, I'm out of
school tomorrow,' '' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about instruction that go beyond the curriculum, such
as field trips to the King Center for Non-Violence Social Change in
downtown Atlanta, are left up to each school and sometimes the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the priority, it's usually exercised by individual
teachers, a principal here or there that has some kind of
consciousness,'' Hilliard said.
</P>
<P>
   Brookview students have been studying King since they came back
from winter break. But emphasis on King is not so apparent at
Atlanta's Booker T. Washington High School _ King's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   King's birthday is recognized at Washington, but not
overemphasized, Principal Shirley Kilgore said. Every morning last
week, junior Charles Allen, 16, read parts of King's life story to
his classmates during the daily announcements. Some teachers
discussed King in class and the media center continuously played a
video of King's life, which various classrooms came to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the classroom, King is primarily discussed based on his
connection to the school, Kilgore said. There is a corner in the
school's archives for King. Lena Horne, another alum, has one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore wants students at the school, which is on the rebound
from a period of low student performance, to learn from King that
``if this man was here in this building and he achieved great
things, it's possible for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors influence the unevenness in recognition, Taylor
said. King was a black man who rose to fame during one of this
country's ugliest periods. He was a relatively recent figure, and
adults don't agree on his significance and contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Also, reading and math are pushed in schools, which often
lessens the emphasis on history. And, Taylor said, patriotic
holidays have lost so much significance that most people celebrate
them by catching department store sales.
</P>
<P>
   He said King's accomplishments, courage and martyr status and
the moral lessons students can learn from his life, should make him
more significant to metro Atlanta children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard to find an Atlantan that has been more
influential than Dr. King, as a thinker, as a man, as a leader,''
Taylor said. ``There is not a person who is more significant, and
yet, I would like to see more of an emphasis in the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dacula High School in Gwinnett County, Principal Dolford
Laysom said he does not want to weigh the significance of one
influential historical figure over another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to place a value judgement on either, but (King
is) probably more on the forefront than a George Washington''
because of his influence on modern times, Laysom said.
</P>
<P>
   King's contributions are recognized in history classes and
during Black History Month at Dacula. But the students seem to be
well-versed on King, Laysom said. And King's dream is exemplified
at Dacula, where less than 10 percent of the school's 1,800
students are nonwhites.
</P>
<P>
   The students recently elected an African-American Mr. Dacula and
the multiracial Black History Month Committee is co-sponsored by
white and black teachers, Laysom said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Alexander, whose two daughters attend the predominately
white Peachtree Elementary School, also in Gwinnett, said she is
satisfied with what her daughters have been taught about King. She
said she doesn't want them to be overwhelmed in elementary school
with too much information about the civil rights movement to avoid
the ``major baggage'' that adults still have about the divisiveness
and violence over race during that time period.
</P>
<P>
   But when they graduate from Gwinnett schools, she wants them to
have a complete and balanced picture of the contributions made by
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want white kids graduating thinking it's a black
problem and it was just black people working on it,'' Alexander
said of the civil rights struggle King led. ``I want them to
recognize there were many white people working on it and it was a
priority.''

 &HT;    Hill, Garnett `bring it'
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's something that might spice next month's
All-Star Game: Grant Hill and Kevin Garnett have a rivalry going.
</P>
<P>
   The pair had fun going after one another last Saturday, starting
in the second quarter when Hill drove to the basket and threw a
Karl Malone-style off-arm elbow into Garnett's face. Then, early in
the fourth quarter, the two stood face-to-face jawing. ``I am
coming right at your (bleep),'' Hill said. ``Bring it,'' Garnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill brought it, hard. Eventually, Hill's nonstop drives to the
basket caused Garnett, as well as Joe Smith and Radoslav
Nesterovic, to foul out. Hill finished with 40 points. Garnett had
22 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists and Minnesota won.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, all parties tried to downplay what appeared to be a
pretty zesty feud between two of the game's top players. ``We're
just having fun,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said it was personal, but in a
competitive sense. ``Believe me, Kevin Garnett is telling his
coaches that he can stop Grant Hill and Grant Hill is saying, `No,
I don't think you can,''' he said. ``It's just the competitiveness
of the game. There is no bad blood. Everything was forgotten once
they walked off the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the sentiments of many in the league, Garnett said:
``Isn't that incredible? Three big men foul out.''
</P>
<P>
   COMPLAINTS &AMP; COMPLIMENTS
</P>
<P>
   After the Pacers beat Washington, Wizards players complained
afterward about coach Gar Heard's substitution patterns. Said Rod
Strickland: ``You have to play the starters. You can't take
everybody out, because you have a whole different flow. I feel you
should just live and die with your starters and we don't always do
that. This wasn't the first time.'' ... Bucks coach George Karl is
softening on his center, Ervin Johnson, who plays because Robert
Traylor has struggled. ``He's kind of proved me wrong. I think
Ervin could start for a lot of teams in this league and play 30
minutes. When he left Seattle, I didn't think he could be a
starter. Now he's one of our top four players.''
</P>
<P>
   NO DEAL
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons are not interested in Donyell Marshall despite
reports that the contract of retired center Bison Dele would be
dealt to the Warriors, who could clear Dele's money off their cap.
The two teams earlier spoke about Loy Vaught for Marshall. Nothing
came of it.
</P>
<P>
   LAYUPS
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, coach Butch Carter took a shot at free agent-to-be
Tracy McGrady, saying he ``is good defending second-tier players
and not good enough, or old enough, right now, to guard first-tier
players.'' ... Dee Brown and the Raptors are in a fight over his
left knee. Brown did not require the surgery that was performed on
his left knee Wednesday in Orlando, according to Raptors team
physician Paul Marks. ... Rick Carlisle and former Pacer Byron
Scott are on the short list to replace Larry Bird as Pacers coach.

 &HT;    Phillis a tragic loss to league
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Phills graduated from Southern University with
3.8 GPA in biology. Phills had intentions of becoming a
veterinarian, yet ended up an overachieving NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   His death in a traffic accident last week was painful for those
who knew him, because he was a thoughtful man and role model. And
it hurt because it was unneccessary.
</P>
<P>
   Phills, 30, died _ and left his wife without a husband and his
two small children fatherless _ because he engaged in the immature
act of drag racing with teammate David Wesley. Worse, Phills had
been ticketed for speeding on Charlotte streets in the past, which
should have slowed him down.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday happened, and a man atypical of the NBA was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way before I thought I could do this, I expected to work 9 to
5 as a veterinarian,'' Phills told the Charlotte Observer the week
before his death. ``I know what I have up here, mentally. I don't
need to be a basketball player to be a success in life.''
</P>
<P>
   He cherished the life basketball created for him and did not
abuse it. Rather, he was a significant server of the community.
</P>
<P>
   His father is the head of the agriculture department at Florida
A&AMP;M, which accounted for the son's belief in higher education and
for his personal demeanor. He carried himself without the swagger
of many athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing how many athletes get lost after their
careers are over because that's their only niche,'' Phills said.
``They don't know how to live their lives without a basketball in
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very secure with myself. I have a great family. I was
raised by a great family. I have the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   And his family now has a nightmare, as do the teammates who were
the last to see him alive. Wesley, in particular, is taking Phills'
death hard. He was his closest friend on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Phills held the good of the team close. He sacrificed his
starting small-forward position by volunteering to come off the
bench. Starting was important to both Anthony Mason and Derrick
Coleman, two forwards with strong personalities who probably would
not have accepted coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of that situation, Phills went to Paul Silas and told the
Charlotte coach he would become a reserve to keep Mason and Coleman
happy. The Hornets went on to win 12 of their next 18 games, with
Phills averaging 14.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told (Silas), `If it would solve the problem, then
have me come off the bench,''' Phills said.
</P>
<P>
   Silas said: ``This goes to what's deeply inside of a real pro.
You don't find that often in this league. An attitude like that has
to evolve. It comes with experience and character. Bobby would
choose a championship ring over a start or a couple of minutes of
playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in Charlotte, Phills was playing golf when a motorcyclist
crashed nearby. The rider was on fire, and Phills ran to the scene
to help extinguish the flames. Unfortunately, the man eventually
died because of the burns, but the family acknowledged Phills for
allowing them a chance to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Phills' good-guy nature, Detroit coach Alvin Gentry said:
``The fact that he was a good player is about the 20th most
important thing on the list. If you polled the people in the NBA,
you'd be hard pressed to find anybody who didn't think that he was
a great guy with great character.''

 &HT;    Washington needs Jordan
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe Michael Jordan could be the elixir to a toxic
situation in Washington. Not only are the Wizards underachieving,
but they have internal tumult that has turned Gar Heard's first
year as a head coach into a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan could become the Wizards' president of basketball
operations this week, with part-ownership quickly following. For
certain, Jordan would not embrace the madness that has wrecked a
franchise wallowing in poor attendance and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Rod Strickland bickered with Heard almost
immediately. Guard Mitch Richmond came into the season out of
shape, got injured and had his own run-ins with Heard. Strickland
and Richmond complained publicly about not playing late in games.
Forward Juwan Howard, who has a contract worth $106 million, gets
booed regularly at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jordan nor his agent, David Falk, has spoken about the
negotiations. A deal is far from complete, because owner Abe Pollin
insists on maintaining control of the team at least until after the
2001 NBA All-Star Game in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Vancouver interim coach Lionel Hollins. He has led the
Grizzlies to a 6-7 record, including a 4-1 on an Eastern road trip.
The players prefer his calm approach over fired Brian Hill's
forceful nature.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Golden State Warriors. They were so horrible that they
got P.J. Carlesimo fired, though he had something to do with that,
too. And their losing streak under Garry St. Jean reached 11 going
into Saturday night. They are totally uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   KUKOC TRADE RUMORS
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc showed his value to a team last week when he returned
to the lowly Chicago Bulls from the injured list and led them to
their first three-game winning streak since Michael Jordan retired
two years ago. And so, he's now trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any team that feels close to an NBA title is interested
in the 6-foot-11 Croatian, who becomes a free agent in the summer.
One rumor has him going to the Lakers for Glen Rice, with the
Lakers moving Kukoc to Toronto for Tracy McGrady, and a first-round
Raptors pick going to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Another rumor has Kukoc going to the Lakers, who would deal Rice
and either Derek Fisher or Tyronne Lue to Miami, which would send
Jamal Mashburn, Voshon Lenard and a draft pick to the Bulls. PIPPEN
NOT PULLING PUNCHES
</P>
<P>
   All that winning on Michael Jordan's coattails has gone to
Scottie Pippen's head, apparently. Asked a simple question about
Dallas forward Michael Finley's chances to make the All-Star team,
Pippen went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an All-Star-caliber player,'' Pippen said, ``but look at
his team's record. Who can't put up numbers for a team that's
playing to ... outscore you and not playing to win?
</P>
<P>
   ``No knock against him as a player; he's a good player,'' Pippen
said. ``But I don't consider him an All-Star just because he's
putting up numbers. I can take some of the worst players in the
league (and put them) on that team and they can score.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.

 &HT;    Growl with the Grizzlies
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apparently Bill Laurie is running the Grizzlies, even
though he's trying to wriggle out of a bid to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Vancouver Sun says general manager Stu Jackson wanted to
fire Brian Hill and replace him with assistant coach Lionel Hollins
on Nov. 24 after the Grizzlies were whipped in Charlotte. Although
current ownership approved, Jackson could not dismiss Hill because
Laurie would not give his approval. Terms of the stalled deal
stipulate that the Missouri billionaire have a say in significant
personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson waited, the Grizzlies went on to lose 10 of their
next 11 games. Hill was fired Dec. 16, and under new coach Hollins,
the Grizzlies recently completed their most successful road trip,
winning four of five games on a difficult Eastern swing.
</P>
<P>
   ISSEL JAWS WITH PAYTON
</P>
<P>
   Recall Dan Issel's shouting match with Utah's Jerry Sloan? Now
the Denver coach has gotten into a verbal dispute with Seattle
trash talker Gary Payton. It backfired on Issel, big time.
</P>
<P>
   Payton had been trash talking all night, especially with Ron
Mercer, who had the temerity to suggest that Nick Van Exel give him
the ball in the post so he could go at Payton. Mercer and Payton
went mouth to mouth until Issel chimed in during the third quarter.
Payton cursed Issel, both were hit with technicals and Payton, then
scoreless, scored 23 points over the final 18 1/2 minutes of the
game, won by Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Issel called Payton over to the side and apologized to him.
Payton shook his hand and said, ``I'm sorry, too, Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   MAVS COOL ON RODMAN
</P>
<P>
   New Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, while still interested in
flamboyant free agent Dennis Rodman, has no interest in waiting
until February for Rodman to decide whether he wants to play in his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not acceptable,'' Cuban said of Rodman's apparent
desire to wait until after attending the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl
before returning to the NBA. ``I just told (Rodman's
representatives) that we didn't want to be strung along.'' WHO
NEEDS FRIENDS?
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant does not have a relationship with any of his Laker
teammates. He's so distant, Rick Fox says, ``Maybe he's moving
toward the intimidation factor. Maybe he has a game plan in his
mind he's putting to work. I just think that it's going to be a
long 20 years in this league if he continues to isolate and not
reach out or let people in.'' TARPLEY SIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   The setting _ the Kirov factory sports center in Perm, located
in Russia's distant Ural Mountains _ isn't quite what Roy Tarpley
was used to when he starred with the NBA's Mavericks nearly 15
years ago. But that's where Tarpley is, playing for Perm's Ural
Great team. Tarpley, 35, lives there with his American girlfriend
in a three-room apartment and apparently is happy to be playing and
getting paid.

   HARTSDALE, N.Y. _ For young women in a culture saturated with
alluring images of riches and sensuality, it is an unlikely
advertising come-on. Turn your back on money and men, and spend
your life helping people who are sick, poor and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ultimate tough sell, but the message is: Forget the pop
star Madonna. Become a nun.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, one of the
nation's largest orders of Roman Catholic nuns, is making the pitch
with a vengeance, and it is using all the tools of the modern age:
test markets, target audiences, catchy graphics and, new this
month, a Web site (www.sistersofmercy.org). One recruitment poster
that was sent last week to college campuses shows a close-up of
God's hand reaching out to Adam's from Michelangelo's ``Creation of
Adam.'' Adam is holding a cellular phone, and the text reads: ``Do
you have a call waiting?''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters have no choice. For more than three decades, the
number of Catholic nuns in the United States has fallen like a
stone, to 83,000 last year from 180,000 in 1965. Compounding the
decline is the aging of their population; the median age of
American nuns is 68. The result has been a draining of resources
from the many charities and institutions that the sisters helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a personnel crisis,'' said Professor Scott Appleby,
director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism
at the University of Notre Dame. ``Sisters really did build the
American Catholic Church through their teaching in the parochial
school system and their staffing of Catholic hospitals. They have
been the backbone of the church in this century, and it's
absolutely critical to address the question of the next generation
and who will succeed them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recruitment campaign, the New York, New Jersey and
Brooklyn chapters, or communities, of the Sisters of Mercy teamed
up to create the posters and brochures, which are aimed at women 21
to 35. ``If you appear old and nonvibrant, that becomes an obstacle
to anyone wanting to enter religious life,'' said Sister Patricia
Wolf, president of the New York community, adding that the images
showed a ``connection to the world and also to humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars and sisters themselves point to a number of factors
responsible for the dwindling population of nuns, a decline far
more precipitous than the corresponding drop in the number of Roman
Catholic priests.
</P>
<P>
   The women's movement and cultural revolution of the 1960s opened
up a world of new opportunities for women, from careers in law to
stints in the Peace Corps. Moreover, where it was not uncommon in
the 1950s and 1960s for Catholic women to join the ranks of nuns if
they were not yet engaged to be married by their college
graduation, in the 1970s and beyond it became more acceptable for
women to marry later in life. And given the booming economy of
recent years and a return to family values, taking vows of poverty
and chastity is, in some sense, a countercultural, even radical,
move.
</P>
<P>
   As laypeople steadily replace nuns on the staffs of Catholic
schools and social service agencies, young women are losing their
exposure to nuns and the more modern ways in which they live today
_ wearing street clothes, often residing in apartments and holding
down demanding jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conundrum,'' said Appleby, ``is that as the number of
sisters falls and the ones who remain are drawn into leadership
positions, there is less opportunity for that personal contact that
was so effective earlier in the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious orders now are trying to turn the tide by
injecting some of that face-to-face contact. The Religious of the
Sacred Heart of Mary, an order with 1,100 members worldwide, is
taking advantage of its Hamptons real estate by holding ``Come and
See'' weekends several times a year at its retreat house in Sag
Harbor in eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to come and get to know us in an informal
setting,'' said Sister Mary Alice Young, director of development
for the order on the East Coast, based in Tarrytown. ``The sisters
talk about their own experience, and people can ask questions
without being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sisters of Mercy, the Religious of the Sacred Heart of
Mary last year created a Web site
(www.marymt.edu/library/info/staff/haber/rshm/index.htm), and for
the last two years the community has run advertisements in Catholic
newspapers. ``One of the things you're constantly hearing is that
the baby boomers and generation X are totally separate entities,
and you have to learn to reach the generations differently,''
Sister Mary Alice said. ``It's speaking to a whole different world
than the one I grew up in.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, there are similar efforts. In Indiana, the
Sisters of Benedict assembled a lay committee of professionals with
experience in marketing and communications. The sisters now have a
toll-free number, a Web site (www.thedome.org/sisters/)and
advertising. One ad beckons with the cheeky line: ``You don't have
to be perfect to be a nun. God knows we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   And in California, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles
has made the recruitment of nuns and priests a high priority. Later
this month, the archdiocese will invite 150 to 250 people to its
annual ``7 to 11 Day.'' Starting at 7 a.m., the men and women trail
the priests and nuns as they go about their day. Later they are
treated to dinner with Cardinal Roger Mahony and a talent show.
Past acts have included comedy and line dancing.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope among nuns that they can tap into this millennial
moment, when gift shops sell nothing but angels, and best-selling
books, rock songs and television shows unabashedly deal with issues
relating to religion, the soul and the afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that probably more than at any recent time, there is a
real quest today for spirituality,'' said Sister Patricia of the
Sisters of Mercy. ``The media gives evidence of that. You have
something like `Touched by an Angel' on television and other shows.
So an attraction to religious life is perhaps even more possible
than it has been at other times.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A sampling of reactions on two traditionally Catholic campuses
in Westchester County, however, found that for most students, the
idea of becoming a nun was just short of unthinkable. Jessica
Hogan, a senior at Iona College in New Rochelle, said: ``I never
considered it. It seems outdated and old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Delia, a 29-year-old graduate student at Mercy College
in Dobbs Ferry, who is from a ``very strong Catholic family,'' said
she had considered the profession as a girl. Ms. Delia's mother was
a nun for seven years before leaving, and both her aunt and cousin
are nuns. ``I've grown up around nuns, so I have a different
outlook than a lot of people,'' Ms. Delia said. ``You can be part
of a religious order and still be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she decided the religious life was not for her. The
recruitment posters might help, Ms. Delia said, but she believes
that the reason young women have shunned the sisterhood is the
diminishing power of the Catholic Church over their lives. ``The
problem is young people don't stay in the church,'' she said. ``You
have to have that belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a nun is a lengthy affair. At the Sisters of Mercy, an
international order with 5,700 members, first there are periodic
discussions between a prospective sister and a vocation director
for six months to a year. A formal application is then made to the
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted, the candidate lives with other sisters for two
years but retains her outside job and assets. For the next two
years she is a ``novice,'' giving up her job and pursuing spiritual
development. Then, just before taking her first vows, she disposes
of her assets and begins a ministry in keeping with the order's
mission. Three to five years later, she takes her final vows.
</P>
<P>
   The New York, New Jersey and Brooklyn regional communities of
the Sisters of Mercy are determined to increase the minority
representation among their members, who are overwhelmingly white.
One of the posters shows an African-American woman in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't r%flect as a community the ethnic background of New
York City,'' Sister Patricia said in her spacious office on a
former estate here. ``Just walk around. We have a significant
amount of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Barbara Ann Catherine Gourdine, 40, is a relatively new _
and young _ member, having made her temporary vows two years ago.
She is also African-American, one of only two in the New York
community, which has 187 members. She actually joined the order at
21 but left in 1988. ``In leaving it gave me a chance to grow and
find out who I was as a person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has had to adjust to living with three women in a house
after years of living alone in an apartment, and she recently took
a job teaching in a Catholic school after 10 years in a public
school. ``It's not what I expected,'' she said, ``but I am happy.''
</P>
<P>
   With members from Staten Island to the Adirondacks, as well as
the Worcester, Mass., area (the result of a merger), the New York
community of the Sisters of Mercy is spread thin. The order
sponsors two high schools, three health-care centers and three
social-service agencies. There are pastoral duties and community
outreach, as well, but half the members are retired.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nuns resist the idea that they face extinction, and they
look to their history for solace. ``In some ways, you could say,
`Well, it's dying out and the last person should turn out the
lights,''' Sister Mary Alice said. ``But we were founded by only
six sisters 150 years ago. So what you need are committed women.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, there will always be those.

IS IT HARASSMENT OR IS IT THE LAW? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four times in 10 months, always early in the morning,
the knocks came at Naoka Honda's door and a stranger handed her
legal papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fail to make complete payment of the rent or surrender
possession of the premises within said time period,'' the papers
said, ``the landlord will commence summary proceedings to recover
possession of the above referenced premises.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the rent for Ms. Honda's apartment on East 22nd
Street had already been paid in full and on time.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth proceeding, the landlord, Thurcon Development
Co., signed an injunction, agreeing to pay Ms. Honda $8,000 in
overcharges, $7,000 in legal fees and a $3,500 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a citizen in this country, so I am not fully
knowledgeable about the law,'' Ms. Honda, a jazz singer from Japan,
said. ``I was really scared.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all a series of unfortunate errors, the landlord's
lawyer, David Brody of Borah, Goldstein, Altshuler and Schwartz,
said. ``I think the best way to phrase it, the most accurate way,''
Brody said, ``is that there were mistakes made and the proceedings
started because there is no fail-safe system set up to keep such
mistakes from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Eviction attempts, in the torrid residential market of today,
rarely resemble the thuggish, brutal harassment that screamed into
headlines during New York City's last real-estate boom: the co-op
and condominium conversion frenzy of the mid- to late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, scores of buildings _ solidly maintained apartment
houses as well as decrepit single-room-occupancy hotels, even
tenements _ were coveted for conversion, and sometimes aged, poor
residents suddenly found themselves and their possessions dumped on
the street.
</P>
<P>
   These days, instead, efforts to get rent-regulated tenants out,
particularly in the more desirable neighborhoods of Manhattan, have
taken more subtle, sophisticated and legalistic turns: immediate
summons for a slightly late rent payment, sudden citation for an
old lease-breaching dishwasher and, more substantially, charges
that a roommate is illegally subletting, challenges to a family
member's right of succession when the primary tenant leaves or
dies, a landlord's demand to personally occupy the apartment (or
several apartments).
</P>
<P>
   It is an evolution, driven by breath-snatching market-rate rents
and scant supply, that partisans on opposite sides of the
landlord-tenant divide see either as entirely proper pursuit of
procedure or as grinding, often baseless legal harassment.
</P>
<P>
   There are still isolated cases of outright viciousness, like
that of a Lower East Side landlord, Alvin Weiss, sentenced to seven
to 14 years in prison for attempted murder last March after
confessing that to make apartments vacant he had hired a hit man to
burn out one tenant and to give another, an addict, a potentially
fatal overdose of heroin. But those are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the type of cases that we saw in the mid-1980s,
when they put the goons in the buildings,'' said Ralph Carbone, the
union leader for lawyers in the enforcement unit of the New York
State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which prosecutes
harassment cases.
</P>
<P>
   A few malicious landlords ``would get several vacancies in the
building, put their goons in to live as theoretical tenants and
then have them cause excessive noise at all hours, verbally and
physically abuse legitimate tenants, literally destroy the property
by breaking walls, knocking out windows, doing all sorts of vicious
things. That's not what we are seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the city's largest landlord organization,
Joseph Strasburg of the Rent Stabilization Association, rues those
days. ``You had owners, and there were some, who went to great
extents of conduct, criminal in nature, to evict a tenant,''
Strasburg said. ``They knocked down the stairs, closed down the
elevators, turned off electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone, Strasburg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a hypothetical that you'll always find some owners
who wish to harass a tenant? Maybe,'' he said. ``But the owners we
deal with on an everyday basis, it's my experience that they want
to know what their rights are and to make sure that the tenant has
not taken advantage of them. Then they follow a legitimate legal
process recognized under the rent laws.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way in the last 15 years in cleaning up our
industry,'' Strasburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenant advocates charge, however, that there are still tactics
to decry in the arsenals of some landlords. ``We have definitely
seen a flood of cases where rent-regulated tenants are brought to
court for what we consider frivolous claims by landlords seeking to
regain possession of the apartment,'' said Angelita Anderson,
executive director of the Citywide Task Force on Housing Court. The
task force is a nonprofit organization that advises tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants
and Neighbors Coalition, said: ``It's important to say that not all
landlords do this. There are some landlords who would never harass
a tenant. So I'm not trying to tar every landlord.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a market that tenant advocates say includes quite a few
contentious new landlords as flush with Wall Street profits as are
their prospective renters or buyers, ``the stakes are so much
higher,'' McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landlords see gold at the end of the tunnel,'' he said. ``If
they can just get those pesky rent-regulated tenants out they can
cash in. If you have somebody paying $7,200 a year in rent and you
can get them out and decontrol the apartment, you can start
collecting $60,000 a year, which you can in some neighborhoods in
Manhattan. That's a tremendous incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   The incentive lies in the fact that if a landlord is able to
raise the rent to $2,000 during a period of vacancy, the apartment
becomes permanently decontrolled and the owner is free to charge
market-rate rents.
</P>
<P>
   There are several steps a landlord can take to reach that $2,000
level. First, upon achieving a vacancy, the owner is entitled to
the statutory vacancy bonus, enacted two years ago by the state
Legislature, which adds a minimum of 20 percent onto the rent for a
two-year lease, or 18 percent for a one-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   If the landlord renovates the apartment, he or she can then _
under what is termed an Individual Apartment Improvement _ add
one-fortieth of the renovation costs to the monthly rent. If, for
example, the landlord spends $40,000 on renovation work, which in
upscale neighborhoods would almost be necessary, $1,000 would be
added to the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not hard for a landlord to get an apartment, no matter
what the old rent was, up to $2,000 a month,'' McKee said. ``He can
then charge the incoming tenant whatever the market will bear _
anything that a rich person from, say, Europe or Hong Kong is
willing to pay.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Judge Walter Strauss, who retired from the Housing Court bench
in September, said: ``This goes on to a much greater extent in
Manhattan than in the other boroughs. In Manhattan, because there
is so much interest in residing there, the landlords are very
aggressive if there is a nonpayment or another reason for them to
try to obtain the apartment again, to evict.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss spent four years in Housing Court in Manhattan and his
last year in Brooklyn. ``My experience in Brooklyn, and I suspect
the other boroughs,'' he said, ``is that landlords are not so
inclined to want to get the apartment back _ they just want to get
their rent.''
</P>
<P>
   The salvo of eviction notices against Ms. Honda, the jazz singer
from Japan, apparently was sparked when she discovered that her
apartment at 31 East 22nd St. had been improperly decontrolled.
``After she asserted her right to be treated as rent-stabilized and
filed an overcharge complaint, she began receiving baseless
nonpayment proceedings,'' said her lawyer, Seth Miller of Collins,
Dobkin and Miller. ``In each instance my client had paid the lease
rent on time; they had cashed the checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Honda's initial market-rate rent, in 1994, had been $1,000 a
month. After the Division of Housing and Community Renewal found
that her apartment should have remained stabilized, her rent was
set at $875.
</P>
<P>
   The first proceeding against Ms. Honda was filed in October
1997; the second in March 1998. In both of those actions, the
landlord, Thurcon Development, agreed to drop the case. The third
time, in May 1998, a Housing Court judge fined the landlord $150
and dismissed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after the fourth action in August 1998, Miller said,
``We brought an injunction proceeding and after some legal
wrangling, they decided to sign a consent injunction'' _ requiring
that Thurcon Development pay Ms. Honda's legal fees, overcharges
and a $3,500 penalty by Feb. 7, 1999; a total of $18,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrifying experience,'' Ms. Honda said. ``Especially
because I am a singer and I'm not in the apartment all the time _
sometimes I go out of town to sing _ I was scared that when I come
back my stuff would be out on the street. It's a hard way I have to
learn how to live in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Brody, the landlord's lawyer, said: ``In terms of the four
nonpayment proceedings, essentially, Thurcon's bookkeeping
operation was in two separate offices, and the easy way to say it
is that the person sending in the information to us honestly
believed there were rents outstanding. And the way my office is set
up, we probably generate 2,000 to 3,000 nonpayment proceedings a
month, so the person who received the information wouldn't have any
reason to know there was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the way this practice operates, you would realize
that to a large extent it relies on paralegals,'' Brody continued.
``I talked to the attorney who actually handled the nonpayment
proceedings and it is her recollection that with at least three of
the four proceedings, at the time we served the demands for
payment, there actually was rent outstanding, although by the time
the petitions went out the rents may well have been paid. And that
happens with a certain amount of regularity simply because
sometimes checks do not clear or we do not get told of that before
the petition goes out, which is pretty much on an automatic
cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Quantifying harassment by landlords is a murky exercise.
Different agencies deal with different aspects of the problem in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the police handle some instances as criminal
complaints. Then, although it may seem confusing, tenants cannot
file harassment charges in Housing Court, but can only bring
actions for specific code violations. At the same time, baseless
litigation brought by landlords in Housing Court is sometimes
withdrawn before being adjudicated.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants can file harassment complaints of all kinds with the
State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The most frequent
complaints these days, said Carbone, the union leader in the
division's enforcement unit, ``concern baseless litigation, failure
to provide basic services, verbal abuse by an owner or an owner's
employee; intrusive acts, for example, entering an apartment under
false pretenses, putting cameras in hallways, investigators spying
on tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   While the nature of complaints filed with the state has shifted,
their numbers have decreased sharply. ``We got about 2,100 in
1997,'' said Joseph Lynch, the commissioner of housing and
community renewal, and about 1,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch pointed out that the higher numbers in 1997 may have been
prompted by the fact that ``that was when the rent-regulation laws
were being renewed through a fight in the Assembly and Senate, and
extensive media coverage of that went on for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the commissioner said, some cases ``fall out because
they are not really harassment; they end up as somebody complaining
about loud music in the building, and they blame the owner for
that.'' And, at the same time, many charges are first winnowed
through a mediation process to determine if they should be
prosecuted by the enforcement unit. ``A lot of these cases are
settled over the phone with the tenants and the owners,'' Lynch
said, ``so they don't become a docketed case.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves parties to the process disputing whether, in
fact, there has been any marked increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners are being much more aggressive,'' McKee of the tenants
and neighbors coalition said, ``because even if a landlord doesn't
have a case, they can hope that the tenant won't fight back, won't
be able to afford a lawyer or will just be too frightened and move
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson of the Housing Court task force said: ``We have
seen, I'd say, at least three or four new cases every day for the
last two years, and before that, maybe, once a day, maybe none _
the kinds of cases we never saw a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an attorney working on a case,'' Ms. Anderson said,
``where tenants are living on the Lower East Side in a
rent-stabilized walk-up and the landlord wants the apartment for
his grandmother in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Justice Fern Fisher-Brandveen of state Supreme Court, the
administrative judge for Housing Court, sees no marked increase in
frivolous proceedings. ``Our judges meet on a monthly basis and
that's not an issue on the front burner,'' she said. ``There's
always going to be some abusers of the system, by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Strasburg of the Rent Stabilization Association, the landlords'
group, concurred. ``We can point to tenants who harass owners,'' he
said. Strasburg cited the case of a woman on Manhattan's East Side
who, he said, left her bathtub water running for three years before
reaching a buyout settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the landlord in that case, Sally Unger of
Kossoff, Alper and Unger, declined to discuss specifics of the
settlement and said that the tenant was forbidden to discuss the
case, under a confidentiality agreement. But, she said, the dispute
began in 1996 when the landlord challenged the woman's succession
rights to the apartment after her mother moved out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a means of retaliation, she started running the hot water,
incessantly,'' Ms. Unger said _ from about the end of 1996 through
November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the landlord's workers heard the water running, through
the hallway,'' Ms. Unger said. ``She didn't answer the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The building's boiler, installed in 1994, began breaking down,
regularly. Eventually the police were called. ``We had a cop
testify at the trial,'' Ms. Unger said. ``She had installed a sheet
of plastic over the tub so it would run off quietly. The porcelain
had been worn away and was black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome,'' Ms. Unger said, ``is that we settled it and
she's going to be moving out.''
</P>
<P>
   Succession rights are also at issue in the proceedings initiated
by Standard Realty Associates against Candela Prol _ as is an
elderly man's old roof deck.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that Ms. Prol and other tenants in the six-unit
brownstone at 107 West 11th St. enjoy a remarkable deal. The
previous landlord, St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center,
barely raised rents for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   For a three-bedroom apartment, Ms. Prol pays $275 a month _ up
from $225 in 1962. And that's the highest in the building.
</P>
<P>
   For the last eight years, until the death of her father, Julio,
of a stroke in June at age 74, Ms. Prol and her husband lived in
the apartment with her father. A friend of the family also shares
the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Julio Prol, a classical guitarist, built a wood
deck atop the building, lining it with white fences and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the building was bought by Standard Realty. Soon
after, Standard's president, Kenneth Rosenbloom, sent a letter to
the tenants saying that until their residency rights were verified,
their rent checks would not be accepted. ``He was concerned about
who was in occupancy and who wasn't entitled,'' said Rosenbloom's
lawyer, Joseph Burden of Belkin, Burden, Wenig and Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They immediately issued eviction notices to four of the six
tenants,'' said Ms. Prol's lawyer, Stephen Palitz of Finder,
Novick, Kerrigan, Anderson and Palitz.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Palitz said, Rosenbloom arrived at Julio Prol's
apartment with police officers. ``They conducted a bogus search,''
Palitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prol said her father was terrified. ``For him to cry, I just
haven't seen it in a long time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the police had been brought to the apartment, Burden
said: ``St. Vincent's had corresponded with Prol that the deck was
not in a legal condition. There's a violation issued by the
Buildings Department from September that the deck has to be
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, however, Cassandra Vernon, a spokeswoman
for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said a
violation was issued when inspectors questioned whether the roof
deck ``may have required plans to be filed with the Department of
Buildings (DOB).
</P>
<P>
   ``HPD then referred the information to the Department of
Buildings,'' the statement continued. ``DOB inspected the building
on 9/27/99 and found no cause for action.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on Nov. 23, workers sent by the landlord tore down the roof
deck.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, on Aug. 12, the landlord had sent an eviction notice
to Candela Prol, saying her right to be in the apartment had
``terminated on the death of the tenant of record'' _ her father.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the grounds for eviction, Burden said: ``Ms. Prol
has connections to another apartment on Jane Street. And my client
was aware that a portion of the Prol apartment had been sublet to
nonfamily members.''
</P>
<P>
   Palitz countered that it is Ms. Prol's mother who lives in a
studio apartment on Jane Street. And, he pointed out, the Rent
Regulation Reform Act of 1997 states that the daughter of a
regulated apartment's primary tenant (as well as other specified
family members) who has lived in the apartment for ``no less than
two years'' is entitled to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The law also protects roommates who have lived with the tenant
for two years and can demonstrate an emotional or financial
connection with the primary tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Burden then indicated that the landlord was reconsidering the
eviction proceedings against Ms. Prol. ``First we thought it was
rent controlled,'' he said. ``But there is an order from, I think,
1966, saying that it was not subject to rent control any more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding was that it was no longer subject to any
regulation,'' Burden continued. ``But Palitz has brought to my
attention a case from 1980, very similar to this one, which says
that if a unit becomes decontrolled, then it became stabilized in
1974. I'm evaluating it along with my client to determine how we
should proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Burden said, Rosenbloom's goal ``is to have, not
himself, but various members of his family living in the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very big family,'' Ms. Prol said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Rosenbloom hopes to go to market-rate rents, Burden
said, ``No, it's not his intention at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Burden notified Palitz that his client was dropping
eviction proceedings against Ms. Prol.

GORE SHIFTS ATTACK TO BUSH, CRITICIZING STAND ON FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENACOOK, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore is stepping up his
appeals to independent voters here, criticizing Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the likely Republican nominee, over the Confederate
battle flag and soft-pedaling his criticisms of his Democratic
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Confederate battle flag should be removed from the
South Carolina Capitol because it was a symbol of racism and that
Bush was ducking the issue because he needed to preserve his
conservative support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he, Governor Bush, has avoided taking a position or
has ducked the issue because he is playing to some of his
supporters that I think have some pretty obsolete and even hateful
attitudes,'' Gore said Saturday in an interview with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson on CNN's ``Both Sides With Jesse Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   With the New Hampshire primary less than three weeks away, Gore
is trying to tone down his previously harsh criticism of Bradley.
Gore's goal in the state, where there are as many independents as
Democrats and Republicans, is to shuck any vestiges of the rancor
that has characterized his campaign for weeks and instead to seize
the mantle that Bradley has worn so well here, as a nonpolitician
above the bickering.
</P>
<P>
   He told a rally at a school gymnasium here, where he campaigned
with former Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who galvanized the anti-war vote
in 1968, that what he had in common with Bradley was more important
than their differences.
</P>
<P>
   At a town meeting on Friday night in Salem, N.H., Gore boasted
of his cross-party credentials as a member of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was so intent on reaching as many voters as possible that
he insisted on taking his motorcade Saturday into the teeth of an
ice storm in Berlin, in northern New Hampshire. The Secret Service
canceled Gore's plans to fly to Berlin because of the weather, so
Gore decided to drive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Later this year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will
be able to have conversations with their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the car to get on the information superhighway, and it will
download e-mail using relatively slow cellular phone connections. A
computerized ``voice'' will be able to read the e-mail through the
car's stereo speakers, automakers say. It will call out sports
scores on command, not just when a radio station programs them. It
will quote the latest stock prices. It will even be able to check
the traffic and give directions.
</P>
<P>
   About half a million cars and trucks in the United States are
expected to have this conversational capability by the end of the
year, using voice-recognition software to translate drivers' words
into a limited list of computer commands. That is not quite enough
to surf the Internet, but enough to splash in it.
</P>
<P>
   Some marketing experts are skeptical about the need for this
innovation, even if it can be made to work properly. ``Most people
don't want to talk to their car,'' said Jack F. Trout, president of
Trout &AMP; Partners, a marketing strategy firm based in Greenwich,
Conn. ``They want their car to shut up and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, auto executives are forging ahead. Some Americans
have always used their cars as living rooms, dining rooms and
offices, and they expect this to be no different. Just as
cupholders allowed drivers to sip coffee during their commutes,
executives say, these devices will allow them to work on their way
to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within three years it will be in all of the new vehicles that
we're doing,'' Jacques A. Nasser, Ford Motor's chief executive,
said here last week at the North American International Auto Show,
where many of the talking cars were shown. ``We will do nothing
short of transforming our cars and our trucks into a portal for the
Internet.'' Ford's first talking cars will be the 2001 model year
Lincolns, on sale by the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The first General Motors Internet-connected talking vehicles
will roll out of factory doors in a few months, and by year's end,
more than 400,000 cars, sport utility vehicles, pickups and
minivans will be ready to talk back to their owners, said Todd R.
Carstensen, a company spokesman. Many other automakers are rushing
to get their versions ready by next year, if not sooner. One
supplier, Delphi Automotive, already has $2.5 billion in orders
from seven automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Providing Internet access is one of a series of moves by
automakers to add safety and entertainment features _ and the added
charges they bring. Many minivans now come with video screens that
allow passengers in the back seat to watch movies. Some Ford and GM
cars are already equipped with wireless connections to operators
who can give directions, make dinner reservations or call a tow
truck, tracking the car with a global positioning satellite system.
If an air bag deploys, operators can send an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Voice-recognition technology is intended to give motorists
access to computers without requiring drivers to type and steer at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicles have to be safe,'' said Lawrence D. Burns, vice
president for research, development and planning at General Motors,
anticipating criticisms that computers might distract drivers and
cause accidents. ``Driving requires your eyes on the road and your
hands on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are concerned that even if the car does most of the
talking, drivers can be distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only think about so many things at once, and if you're
in a traffic jam and changing lanes and thinking about your stock
quotes,'' that may be too much, said Michael J. Suman, a group vice
president at Johnson Controls Inc., which is working on the
systems. ``We want to be sure that the driver isn't talking to the
car and forgetting to keep the car on the road safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will not be able to do many of the things they can do on
their home or office computer, and they will not get results as
quickly because of limits on the vocabulary of the
voice-recognition systems and the relatively slow speed of the
cellular Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the GM and Ford versions will not be able to send
e-mail. Ford's voice recognition software would understand just 200
words. While the systems are intended to be simple to use, Ford
drivers would need to know they should say ``get e-mail'' or ``read
e-mail'' and not just ``e-mail'' to cue the system, which listens
for verbs, or ``tell me the NPR news'' to hear National Public
Radio's latest Internet report.
</P>
<P>
   The system is by no means foolproof. If a backseat driver
interrupts, a Ford's ``voice'' is likely to pause, then utter a
patient-sounding ``say that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice recognition in cars ``is really just in its toddler stage
now,'' said Richard F. Doherty, director of research for
Envisioneering, a technology assessment and market research firm in
Seaford, N.Y. ``It is somewhere between being a great show-me
gimmick and a convenience, and it is getting closer to being a
convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most people keep the same car for years, automakers are
trying to design communications systems that can be updated as
better technology becomes available. So instead of equipping each
car with a computer that would be outdated almost as soon as it
made it out of the factory, Ford and GM plan to install cellular
communications equipment that links cars to land-based computers
that can be updated as new technology becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet cars would then use cellular phone connections to
link up to an Internet home page preprogrammed with the driver's
preferences for traffic, weather, news and stock reports, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler, on the other hand, plans a ``bring your own
laptop'' approach. ``How many phones do you want to deal with? How
many Internet accesses?'' asked Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's
vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to install a small screen, microphone and
cellular phone modem in its vehicles sometime within the next two
years. Drivers would then plug in their own equipment, said Stephen
J. Buckley, a DaimlerChrysler electronics specialist.
</P>
<P>
   While no manufacturer has yet set prices on the devices, the
bulk of revenue is likely to come from monthly wireless connection
and Internet access fees, with expected charges of $7 to $75 a
month. With that, drivers could turn on the ignition, tune in to
the Internet, and drop out of the boredom of commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Talking cars have been produced before. In the mid-1980s,
Chrysler New Yorkers would tell drivers ``your fuel is low'' or
``your door is ajar'' or ``fasten your seat belts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the car was a nag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hear it all the time, and if you didn't address the
issue right away, it would go on and on and on and drive you
crazy,'' said Steve Aretakis, the president of Hasco Spring
Industries in Oak Park, Mich., who suffered through a couple of
years of driving a 1984 New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   Aretakis isn't holding his breath for the latest Internet
version of the talking car. ``I haven't had a car since like
that,'' he said. ``I don't really know if I'd want one, either.''

EDWARD HANLEY, 67, LONGTIME UNION LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward T. Hanley Sr., who faced accusations of associating with
organized crime in his 25 years of leading the United States'
largest union of hotel and restaurant workers, died Jan. 7. He was
67 and lived in Wadsworth, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed in a traffic accident near his country home in
Land O' Lakes, Wis., the Wisconsin authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley was president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union from 1973 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For decades he was a prominent, back-slapping fixture in
organized labor and was respected for turning his union into one of
the nation's most aggressive in organizing members: hotel maids,
bellhops, barmaids, bartenders and waiters.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley was frequently criticized for his lavish way of life;
he had the union buy a $2.5 million jet for his use and also had it
maintain an office near his vacation home in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional hearings and in prosecutors' papers, Hanley was
frequently accused of maintaining ties with organized-crime
families, which he denied. In the 1980s the President's Commission
on Organized Crime found that the hotel workers union was one of
the four most corrupt in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those labor leaders with two sides,'' said
Richard Hurd, a professor in labor relations at Cornell University.
``The most important thing he did for the union was to create an
organizing department that really meant something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a very high salary, enjoyed all the privileges of
office and was aloof from the rank and file. And while he never was
convicted of any criminal ties to organized crime, he was always
suspected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley was pressured into retiring in July 1998 when a federal
monitor accused him of financial wrongdoing. The monitor, Kurt
Muellenberg, found that Hanley had bought a union-leased Cadillac
Allante sports coupe, worth at least $60,000, at an improperly low
price. The monitor also found that Hanley had received $31,000 from
the union's Chicago local even though he did no work for that
local, which was run by one of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   Muellenberg also found that Hanley had set up a fake union local
near his Wisconsin vacation home so that the local's president
could do favors for Hanley and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley maintained that he had not engaged in financial
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Wilhelm, who succeeded Hanley as president, praised him
for allowing the federal monitor to help clean up the union.
Wilhelm said the monitor's main purpose was to examine whether
Hanley and the union had been influenced by organized crime, and
Wilhelm said the monitor's most important finding was that both
were free of organized crime influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He invited the federal government into our union,'' Wilhelm
said. ``He gave them unfettered authority to look everywhere, and
to take any action whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Thomas Hanley was born in Chicago on Jan. 21, 1932, the
son of James and Doris Hanley. He grew up on Chicago's West Side, a
working-class neighborhood. He graduated from St. Phillip's High
School in Chicago in 1949 and served in the Air Force in the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s he tended bar at his father's tavern, and in
1964 he was elected president of the Chicago Bartenders and
Beverage Dispensers Union.
</P>
<P>
   A likable man, he quickly climbed the union's ladder and became
president of the parent union in 1973, when he was 41. That year he
married Kathryn Dekker.
</P>
<P>
   In his 25 years as its president, the union, like many other
unions, saw its membership plunge, falling to 230,000 from 400,000.
But it climbed again to more than 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hanley's supporters praised him for preventing membership from
dropping further, noting that he hired Wilhelm and other
organizers, who recruited thousands of casino and hotel workers
from Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hanley, the union's organizing efforts slowly adapted to
the huge changes in the industry as it transformed from small,
independent operations to large, corporate-owned chains.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hanley's critics say he focused on attracting members
largely to ensure that there was a steady supply of dues money to
support his comfortable way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very generous to himself with our money,'' said
Jonathan Palewicz, a banquet waiter and union dissident in San
Francisco. ``He was a labor dictator, and he wasn't that successful
organizing when you consider how the industry expanded
exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanley is survived by his wife, Kathryn; two sons, Edward Jr.
and Thomas, both of Chicago; two sisters, June Hansen of Sacramento
and Dolores Calabrese of Chicago; and four grandchildren.

DAVID MELLINKOFF, 85, ENEMY OF LEGALESE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Mellinkoff, a lawyer, professor and writer who waged
fierce and clever battle against lawyerly language _ ``contagious
verbosity'' in his phrase _ died in Los Angeles on Dec. 31. He was
85.
</P>
<P>
   Mellinkoff waged his war in books, articles and lectures,
attacking what he called `nk antiques'' of the legal
vocabulary, those streams of ``forthwiths,'' ``heretofores'' and
``whereases'' that tumble endlessly through lawyers' writings.
Sometimes called the dean of legal writing specialists, he began
his campaign for clarity and brevity with his 1963 book, still his
most influential, ``Language of the Law'' (Aspen Publishers).
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Garner, a Dallas lawyer who heads a company that teaches
lawyers to write more clearly and who edited the most recent
edition of Black's Law Dictionary, said ``Language of the Law''
proved that ``the argument that legalese is more precise is
poppycock.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the attack on gobbledygook dates at least to the
English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham, Garner said
Mellinkoff's influence was profound because he made the case for
plainer language in a style lawyers appreciate: with lots of
footnotes and case citations.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of Mellinkoff's Dictionary of American Legal Usage
(West Publishing Co., 1992), Arthur Gilbert, a California judge,
wrote: ``He cross-references words and expressions, enabling you to
see how they relate to each other and how they are different from
one another. He compares and contrasts ordinary and legal usage so
that you can use a legal term with precision.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellinkoff's work provided ammunition for a mounting movement in
the 1970s and 1980s to simplify insurance policies and other
consumer documents, to streamline state and federal legislation and
to add writing instruction to law school curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious reform did not begin until 1963 when David Mellinkoff
published his scholarly and influential book,'' John Lindsey, a
Temple University law professor wrote in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But progress can be devilishly fitful. When New York state
passed a law in 1981 requiring that consumer agreements be written
in ``a clear and coherent manner using words with common and
everyday meanings,'' Mellinkoff smelled legalese. ``Common and
everyday are redundant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His views on words were piercing. ``Actual,'' he wrote, is ``a
good luck charm to ward off disbelief.'' Absolutes rarely are.
``Hereby'' is superfluous, and ``saith'' a worthless anachronism.
``Chilling effect''? ``Unless applied to a dry, white wine, chill
is pejorative, with some chills worse than others,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mellinkoff, whose father was a businessman, was born in
McKeesport, Pa. The family soon moved to Beverly Hills, where his
father owned a chain of shoe stores, and he completed high school.
He graduated from Stanford and Harvard Law School. He developed a
lucrative Beverly Hills law practice; one of his clients was Mae
West. During World War II, he served as an Army captain in the
field artillery in Dutch New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Los Angeles invited him to teach
part time after his 1963 book. The next semester, he accepted the
university's invitation to stay on as a full professor. He had
begun writing about legal verbiage years earlier, including a 1953
article in the Stanford Law Review titled ``How to Make Contracts
Illegible.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books included ``Legal Writing: Sense &AMP; Nonsense''
(West Publishing, 1988). Besides relentlessly pushing the novel
idea that lawyers other than John Grisham could write clearly, he
also clung to a belief that lawyers could have consciences. In
1973, West published his ``Conscience of a Lawyer,'' which used a
Victorian murder trial to demonstrate a lawyer's ethical dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 50 years, Ruth, said his life and work were infused
with pointed humor. She cited his losing battle to keep UCLA's law
school from following other law schools in changing the name of its
degree to ``doctor in law.'' In a long and stinging letter, dated
March 1, 1967, he wrote, ``When the theater manager asks `Is there
a doctor in the house?' must he specify that the dying man doesn't
want a lawyer?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mellinkoff's son, David, who lives in Pacific Palisades, Calif.,
said another characteristic was immense discipline, not to mention
vanity. He said his father would weigh himself twice a day to make
sure he never exceeded what he had weighed in college.
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors are a brother, Sherman of Los Angeles; a sister,
Ruth Watt, of Palo Alto, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mellinkoff's ultimate prescription for legalese was as simple as
it was unlikely. He once wrote, ``The most effective way of
shortening law language is for judges and lawyers to stop
writing.''

OUTDOORS: ANGLING FOR THE EXOTIC IN THE AMAZON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One-hundred-degree heat and melting humidity suddenly didn't
seem so bad when, on my very first cast into the waters of the
Amazon Basin, something left a swirl the size of a bathtub behind
my surface lure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a piraracu,'' said Eduardo von Muehlen, who seemed
unfazed as he held our tippy wooden canoe in position with his
paddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How big do they get?'' I asked, gawking at the last of the
rings now lapping against our boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not very large in this lake,'' he said. ``Maybe 40
kilos.''
</P>
<P>
   For the metrically challenged like myself, that's well over 80
pounds. And von Muehlen was right; a full-grown piraracu, which
looks a little like a giant guppy, can reach lengths up to 15 feet
and weigh over 400 pounds, making it the world's largest strictly
freshwater fish. The usual method of catching one involves hurling
a harpoon into its scaly side and then chasing the impaled fish for
a day or two before it gives up.
</P>
<P>
   But the unseen fish never did come back, despite my best efforts
to raise it again with the popper.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, this lake was just one of hundreds found during the
dry season in the sprawling Mamiraua Sustainable Development
Reserve in northwestern Brazil, part of a triptych of reserves that
make up the largest block of protected rain forest on earth, bigger
than the entire nation of Costa Rica. My friend Marcio Ayres, who
studies primates in Mamiraua for the Wildlife Conservation Society,
says that during the annual wet season the Amazon rises 30 to 40
feet, eventually covering most of the lakes and the surrounding
forest for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the reserve began playing host to tourists in a
floating lodge house along one of the coves that meander off the
main-stem Amazon. Most of the visitors come to watch Mamiraua's
array of birds, uakari monkeys, or pink river dolphins that forage
among flooded kapok trees and strangler figs.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to ignore the staggering fish life that boils
beneath Mamiraua's surface. Over 300 species are found here, from
the spectacular peacock bass (called tucunarce locally) to
tambaqui, a delicious, slab-sided fish with massive jaws designed
to crush the fruits and seeds on which it feeds exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   I persuaded von Muehlen, a student of endangered river turtles
at a nearby research station, to spend a couple of hours paddling
me around. As far as anyone knew, this particular body of water had
never been fished with a rod and reel before.
</P>
<P>
   After another half-hour of fruitless casting with my popper, I
switched to a large, in-line spinner that would have been perfect
for northern pike fishing some 4,000 miles due north.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, this geographic hurdle was not a problem, as
something walloped the spinner halfway through the first cast. The
fish bore for the bottom, and I tried to picture what bizarre,
unimaginable species I was about to set eyes on for the first time.
A tiger-striped rayado catfish? An electric eel?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was an oscar, which I used to keep in a fish tank
back home. I had forgotten that so many tropical fish found in pet
stores have their roots in the Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   I felt a little sheepish unhooking it, as if I was torturing
someone's pet. I then released it, my first ``wild'' oscar, and
watched it dart away.
</P>
<P>
   A few casts later, something clearly larger grabbed the lure and
immediately tore line from my spinning reel with relative ease. The
line suddenly rose, and a fish that at first looked like a slender,
brown tarpon flew from the water.
</P>
<P>
   It jumped a second time, and again I recognized it from the pet
shop _ an aruana, a serpentlike fish with a cavernous mouth and two
fleshy barbels that extend from the tip of the lower jaw like a
mine sweeper. They are sometimes called monkey fish for their
ability to coil their body and spring from the water to snatch
insects from overhanging branches.
</P>
<P>
   I finally lifted the fish into the boat, where it thrashed
wildly in the bilge. It looked to be around 30 inches long and
weighed maybe six pounds.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to let this one go, too, but von Muehlen persuaded
me to keep it, saying they make fine eating and are considered by
the locals to have medicinal values.
</P>
<P>
   Three casts later, I caught its twin, another hard fighter,
which von Muehlen insisted I keep as well. I now understood the
rule in this still-wild part of the Amazon: whatever is caught is
eaten. That night, after dinner, I was reminded of this once more
when I scraped the last bits of the aruana steak into the river. A
school of piranha immediately came charging to the surface and
stripped the fish to bare bone. &QL;

STUDY OFFERS GLOOMY FORECAST FOR EARTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT BRAILE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From eroding soil in Kazakhstan to melting glaciers in the
Peruvian Andes to depleted fisheries off New England and elsewhere,
the world's ecological health at the dawn of the millennium is
deteriorating, the Worldwatch Institute concluded in its annual
State of the World report, which was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Species are disappearing, temperatures are rising, reefs are
dying, forests are shrinking, storms are raging, water tables are
falling: Almost every ecological indicator shows a world on the
decline. And with the global population expected to hit 9 billion
in the next 50 years, those indicators are likely to worsen, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scale and urgency of the challenges ... are
unprecedented,'' said the Worldwatch president, Lester Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a growing population is especially disturbing, he
said. ``If we continue the irreversible destruction of these
systems, our grandchildren will never forgive us.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year since 1984, Worldwatch has examined indicators such as
energy production and tropical deforestation to get a measure of
how the world is faring. It has often painted a bleak and
unforgiving portrait, spurring the fury of conservative think tanks
and the fervor of environmental groups. It has done so again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old stuff _ just more doom and gloom about the
Earth coming to an end because of what humans are doing,'' said
Myron Ebell, director of international environmental policy at the
Competitive Enterprise Institute. ``And it's all nonsense, of
course. They've been saying this for years, and it never happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the Environmental
Defense Fund, said the reports ``provide us with a road map, not
only to the immense problems that the global environment has
encountered, but also to solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings this year:
</P>
<P>
   --Earth's temperature has risen 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit in 30
years, and glaciers have melted, sometimes with striking results. A
prehistoric body surfaced in 1991 in the Alps, as did another last
year in the Yukon. ``Our ancestors are emerging from the ice with a
message for us: the Earth is getting warmer,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   --Extinction threatens 11 percent of bird species, 25 percent of
mammal species, and 34 percent of fish species.
</P>
<P>
   --The world is pumping 160 billion tons of water a year in
China, India, North Africa, the Middle East, and the United States.
This is more than aquifers can provide without running dry. The
water irrigates farms that produce 160 million tons of grain a year
to feed 480 million people. The pumping cannot be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   --Vicious circles known as ``feedback loops'' are wreaking havoc
with nature. For instance, global warming is causing more frequent
and more damaging hurricanes. They are destructive in part because
they cause mudslides, especially in developing countries: Hurricane
Mitch provoked a slide in 1998 in Central America that killed
10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mudslides are more likely where land has been stripped of trees.
And when burned, the trees spew greenhouse gases that fuel global
warming. ``As pressures on the Earth's natural systems build, there
may be some disconcerting surprises as trends interact, reinforcing
each other and triggering abrupt changes,'' said the report's
author, Chris Bright.
</P>
<P>
   If the population and climate are not stabilized, ``there is not
an ecosystem on Earth that we can save,'' Brown said. He urged a
limit of two children per family and a faster transition to solar
and wind power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worldwatch forecasts represent a mixed picture in my
mind,'' said Dan Esty, director of the Yale Center for
Environmental Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten some things right and some things wrong,'' Esty
said. ''It's still important for people like Lester Brown to raise
the alarm on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a slight danger of a Chicken Little,
sky-is-falling effect that might inure people from taking that
message seriously, especially if mistakes in forecasts are not
corrected and analyses are not based on good foundations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Competitive Enterprise Institute, which like many
conservative think tanks champions free-market capitalism and
ecological solutions based on free enterprise rather than
government regulation, issued an advance rebuttal last month to the
report. It is called ``Earth Report 2000: The True State of the
Planet.''
</P>
<P>
   It notes among its findings that American life expectancy in the
20th century has risen from 56.4 to 76.5 years. Cancer incidence
and death rates have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, Lester Brown and the Worldwatch Institute try
their darndest to spin a tale of impending woe, and every year they
come up empty,'' said Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource
studies at the Cato Institute, another conservative think tank.

ANNE DEVENNEY, 79, COMMUNITY ORGANIZER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anne Devenney, the spark plug of community
organization who helped keep the tidy, solid neighborhoods of the
northwest Bronx from turning into another burned-out urban slum,
died Jan. 9 in the Bronx. She was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   A former resident of Norwood, the Bronx, she recently lived with
her daughters in Yonkers, just outside New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Devenney was a founder, president emeritus and living
legend of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which
started in the mid-1970s. An umbrella organization for nine
community groups, it champions home ownership, tenant-controlled
housing, street safety and local investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a no-nonsense Bronx grandmother who took leadership of
a whole part of the Bronx in some of its darkest times as the head
of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition,'' said the
Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who had known her for
some 20 years. ``She led the charge against arson for profit,
housing deterioration and unresponsive politicians. She was a real
original.''
</P>
<P>
   At times it seemed that her coalition was fighting sluggish
bureaucracies and corporate obtuseness as much as the obvious
symptoms of urban blight. It took on the problems of drug dealing,
street crime, vacant buildings and the flight of residents that
those things would set off, but it also attacked mortgage redlining
and the deterioration of city services.
</P>
<P>
   Anne O'Hanlon was a child of the Depression, the youngest of
seven children born to Irish immigrant parents in Hell's Kitchen,
on the West Side of Manhattan. She lived in tenements there, in
Harlem and in Morningside Heights. As a teen-ager, she washed and
ironed and scrubbed floors for the well-to-do on Riverside Drive
for $1.25 a day.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped out of high school and got a $12-a-week dime-store
job, but returned to night classes to earn a high school diploma. A
defining experience of her youth was the eviction of her family
from their apartment house, which was demolished to make room for a
ramp to the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 she married John Devenney, and in 1956 the couple moved
to Putnam Valley, from which Devenney commuted to his draftsman's
job in New York City. But the suburbs were not her natural habitat,
and Mrs. Devenney later said that she hated being dependent on a
car and that all the rain and snow and hard mud for months on end
made her long for the swept pavements of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 the family moved back to the Bronx into a fifth-floor
five-room apartment on Perry Avenue, but in a few years, the
ailments of the inner city moved into the neighborhood. Black and
Hispanic refugees from the South Bronx moved in, with the causes of
their flight in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Landlords, frightened by the wave of arson sweeping the borough,
began to neglect their buildings and even abandon them. Many white
working-class families started to think of moving to other places
for a haven. But Mrs. Devenney's upbringing among people of
different races and creeds had taught her that the struggle against
community destruction knew no color.
</P>
<P>
   Banding together with members of the clergy and young community
organizers, she began to haunt hallways and community centers,
trying to shake people out of their complacency and into
partnerships with residents of surrounding areas where the blight
was setting in.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy
Coalition. It and its affiliated groups badgered city officials for
decent sanitation services and the money to keep streets, parks and
other public places in good repair. They trooped to City Hall,
demanding action against landlords who burned their buildings for
the insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   They homed in on redlining by insurers that refused to write
policies in their neighborhoods for fear of losses and by banks
that denied mortgages in the community despite the large amounts of
deposits that they held from its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members picketed corporate headquarters, invaded
annual meetings with proxies from stock-owning churches, and met
personally with politicians and executives who knew little of the
people living in those communities.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Devenney's husband died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, Betty Devenney and Carol
Gibney, both of Yonkers; two sons, John, of Macon, Ga., and Joseph,
of Mahopac, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Devenney stayed in the forefront of the campaign for
neighborhood survival until the late 1980s, negotiating with
commissioners, mayors and banking and insurance executives for a
fair share of city services and private-sector investment.
</P>
<P>
   She described herself as ``conservative-liberal-radical,''
explaining, ``I have to be conservative because I want to conserve
my neighborhood, liberal to keep my mind open and radical to carry
a picket sign.''

KEEPING GAINS TAX-FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago Congress gave homeowners an
extraordinary gift _ the ability to shield from taxation as much as
$500,000 in profit from the sale of a primary residence. But the
gift is of little use to homeowners who wish to continue living in
their homes and leave them to their children when they die.
</P>
<P>
   Such people, estate-planning specialists say, may increase the
likelihood that their estates will be subject to state and federal
inheritance taxes because the property would be included in the
estate of the last spouse to die. Under current law, estates of
more than $675,000 would be subject to such taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The estate-planning specialists say, however, that some
homeowners may be able to take advantage of the capital gains tax
exclusion by using what is called a ``sale and leaseback.'' With
such a transaction, they would sell their primary residence to
their children _ thereby eliminating exposure of the asset to state
and federal estate taxes _ while continuing to live in the property
until they die.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Engel, a Manhattan estate-planning lawyer, said, ``It
makes sense for homeowners to take full advantage of the capital
gains tax exclusion whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that under current law, an individual who has owned
and lived in a home for at least two of the five years preceding
the sale of the home is allowed to exclude up to $250,000 in
profits from taxes; the exclusion is $500,000 for a married couple.
And since many states follow federal law for capital gains tax
purposes, similar exclusions would likely apply on the state level
as well.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Engel said, if a house bought for $200,000 is now
worth $700,000, the owners would have a potential capital gain of
$500,000. If the owners are a married couple who use the house as a
principal residence, he said, they could sell the home without
having to pay federal and, in most cases, state capital gains
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But, says Gary Schatsky, a Manhattan lawyer and financial
adviser, ``there are many empty-nesters who have no desire to
downsize. Just the thought of moving could itself be enough to keep
some people from selling.'' Those who wish to keep their house
until they die, of course, increase the chance that their estate
will be subject to inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Schatsky explained that under current law, individuals are
allowed to transfer out of their names up to $675,000 to others
during a lifetime _ either as gifts while they are alive or through
their estate _ before being subject to federal gift and estate
taxes. (He added that the amount will increase to $700,000 in 2002
and to $1 million in 2006. He also said that individuals are also
permitted to make gifts of up to $10,000 a year to as many people
as they want without reducing the lifetime exclusion, currently
$675,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, if the last surviving spouse with the
$700,000 house were to die today, $25,000 of that person's estate,
plus any other assets that the person died owning, would be subject
to state and federal estate taxes. In other words, Schatsky said,
the house alone would have ``eaten up'' the last surviving spouse's
entire $675,000 exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, if that person were to die 10 years from now,
any additional increase in the value of the property would be
included in the estate and exposed to taxes, unless the increase in
the value of the estate had been outstripped by the increase in the
automatic exemption. And while there are various estate-planning
techniques that can be used to decrease the exposure of a person's
estate to taxes, most have disadvantages that somewhat offset their
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, however, it may be possible to minimize or even
eliminate those disadvantages by using a sale and leaseback to
transfer the property to children or other future beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Fatoullah, an estate-planning lawyer, said that with a
typical sale and leaseback, parents sell the family home to their
children for its fair market value. Using the above example, that
means that the parents sell the house to the children for $700,000.
The parents and children then enter into a lease agreement that
gives the parents the right to continue living in the house at a
fair market rent.
</P>
<P>
   If the children have the ability to obtain a mortgage for all or
part of the sale price, Fatoullah said, they can do so. If the
children are not in a position to obtain a mortgage from a lender,
he said, the parents can ``take back'' a mortgage, which the
children would then repay out of the rent being paid by the parent.
</P>
<P>
   With such a transfer, Fatoullah said, the parents have
effectively transferred the house to their children without having
had to pay taxes on the first $500,000 in gain and without ``using
up'' any of their federal gift and estate tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   And while the parents now have the $700,000 in proceeds from the
house _ an asset that would pass through their estate if they take
no steps to protect it _ that money can be ``gifted'' back to the
children or others tax-free, as long as the gifts do not exceed
$10,000 from each parent in each year.
</P>
<P>
   Engel said that as with any other estate-planning device, ``one
size does not fit all,'' and each individual's personal
circumstances must be taken into account before an effective plan
can be devised. He added that those for whom a ``sale and
leaseback'' makes sense, should also take great care to construct
an ``arm's-length'' transaction _ even though the transaction might
be between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get an appraisal of the house to ensure that it's
sold at fair market value and you have to get an expert to tell you
what would be a fair market rent,'' Engel said. ``You can't just
pick numbers out of the air.''

   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ In the final Republican debate for this key
state's Jan. 24 presidential caucuses, front-runner Gov. George
Bush sparred with his two closest rivals Saturday over his record
of cutting taxes in Texas and whether his $483 billion tax-cut plan
helps low-income women.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon meeting, sponsored by the Des Moines Register, was
more amicable than one in Durham, N.H. last week where Bush and
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., pointed fingers at each other and argued
vociferously over taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As they began their last week of campaigning before the Iowa
caucuses, the candidates ranged over a wide variety of topics, some
old and some new. Among them: Education, preserving family farms,
environmental protection, and U.S. policy on China.
</P>
<P>
   Bush holds a commanding lead in most Iowa polls. The Des Moines
Register's Iowa Poll, for instance, last week put Bush at 45
percent, with publishing magnate Steve Forbes running a distant
second with 18 percent. The other candidates, McCain, conservative
activist Gary Bauer, conservative radio commentator Alan Keyes, and
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, all lingered far behind in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is officially not competing in Iowa and has no formal
organization in the state.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates were allowed to question each other, Bush
criticized McCain's $170 billion tax plan that would deny
deductions for business expenses for transportation, meals and
continuing education. Bush said the plan would hurt working
Americans, particularly the ``single mom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I have to say to the single mom is that I've
got a tax cut for you and Gov. Bush doesn't,'' McCain shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Bush responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it is true,'' McCain said, insisting his plan addresses
the looming financial problems of the Social Security trust fund
while paring down the $5.6 trillion national debt. Bush defended
his plan, saying it sets aside $2 billion to save Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Forbes charged that the real estate tax cuts that Bush
supported in Texas had no impact on the wallets of six of 10
Texans. Bush, raising his voice in one of the few heated moments of
the debate, told Forbes _ the scion of the wealthy Forbes
publishing family _ that ``it may not be real in million-dollar
houses, but it's real if you got a $40,000 house.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his real estate tax cuts could amount to a 25 percent
reduction for some Texas homeowners. ``It's really real for a lot
of folks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on taxes was interspersed with a few unusual moments,
including Hatch's repeated touting of his paid TV commercial, a
so-called ``fireside chat,`` and Keyes substituting a prayer for
his closing remarks.
</P>
<P>
   With Iowa's economy much improved since the rust-belt era of the
1980s, morality and character are top agenda items for Iowa
Republicans, according to the Register's Iowa Poll. Among
Republicans, 72 percent responded that upholding the highest
standards of personal conduct is an ``unbreakable rule'' for
candidates. By contrast, only 40 percent of Democrats agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a morality-and-character question, Bauer invoked
his service in the Reagan administration, recalling that Reagan
always wore a coat and tie in the Oval Office. ``I don't have to
remind or embarrass this audience about what the current president
did in this office,'' Bauer said, referring to President Clinton's
meetings with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky for Oval
Office trysts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a president's oath of office includes an implicit
pledge to preserve the dignity of the office of the presidency.
Bush said that if elected, he would appoint officials who see
``service to our country as a privilege and will not stain the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Iowa caucuses, registered voters in each party meet
around the state to select delegates to their party's presidential
nominating conventions.

BUSH BACKPEDALS ON REMARKS BY S.C. OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ Backpedaling from a stance he took last week,
Governor George W. Bush of Texas agreed Saturday to repudiate
racist remarks by a politician in South Carolina who made racially
controversial remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a challenge from Republican opponent Alan Keyes
during a presidential debate here, Bush said state Senator Arthur
Ravenel was ``out of line'' when he said the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People was actually for ``retarded
people.'' Four days earlier, Bush had said it was ``up to the
senator'' to decide whether he should apologize.
</P>
<P>
   But when pressed by Keyes to demand an apology from Ravenel,
Bush said Saturday, ``I agree with you, Alan. His comments are out
of line and we should repudiate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's shift came during the fourth Republican debate in
two weeks, in which the six contenders squared off for the last
time before the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses. It will be the first contest
in an election, still 10 months away, that has raised at least $150
million in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   The forum was serious, avoiding some of the featherweight topics
focused on in earlier debates, and displayed the vitriol over tax
cuts that has developed between Bush and millionaire publisher
Steve Forbes in recent days. Senator John S. McCain of Arizona also
wrestled with Bush over taxes, fleshing out his tax-cut plan before
voters he has hardly visited during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain announced months ago he would skip Iowa as part of an
insurgent-candidate strategy that focuses on winning New Hampshire
on Feb. 1 and South Carolina three weeks later. But Saturday, he
tried his hand at farm lingo anyway, calling Bush's tax plan ``all
hat and no cattle'' _ in other words, all show.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is promoting a plan that would slash taxes by $483 billion
over five years, which he says would offer cuts to all earners in
all tax brackets. McCain has offered a proposal that is roughly
half that size _ $237 billion over five years _ arguing that some
of the existing surplus in the federal budget should be used to
shore up the Social Security system instead. Bush has said the two
goals _ making tax cuts and funding Social Security _ are not
mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are in a tight race in New Hampshire, where
both have launched tough television ads in the days leading up to
the primary. But the harshest attacks came from Forbes, a longshot
candidate who is under criticism for his use of negative ads.
Saturday, Forbes called both McCain and Bush ``timid tax cutters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, appearing comfortable and upbeat, also went after McCain
on taxes, challenging his proposal to eliminate tax-free benefits
from employers for benefits such as transportation and continuing
education. Bush challenged McCain: ``Why would you say, to a single
mom who's getting educated, that she's got to pay taxes on those
benefits?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'd say to a single mom is, `I've got a tax
cut for you, and Governor Bush doesn't,' '' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Bush shot back.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the debate, after a question about the so-called
marriage penalty, Forbes accused Bush of never delivering on a tax
cut he promised Texas as governor. Bush, gesturing calmly,
dismissed the claim: ``You know something, Steve? Nearly 69 percent
of Texans said overwhelmingly in 1998, `You're the man, we
appreciate your tax cuts.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, hosted by the Des Moines Register at the
headquarters of Iowa Public Television, kicked off with a question
from a private citizen about what each candidate would do to ensure
affordable long-term health care. Both McCain, a former Vietnam
prisoner of war, and Gary Bauer, a conservative who served in the
Reagan administration, emphasized providing health care to military
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah referred to his record on home
health care legislation. Keyes, Forbes and Bush warned of the
perils of leaving health care decisions up to a federal
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring opinion gap was over ethanol subsidies to
farmers _ a policy that every candidate but McCain supports, and
which many analysts believe could damage the Arizona senator in
this agricultural state. Overall, however, the candidates agreed in
principle on almost everything, leaving them little choice but to
hammer away at the familiar issues of abolishing abortion, posting
the Ten Commandments in schools, and restoring values to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is at least 30 percentage points ahead of second-place
Forbes in most Iowa polls, appeared as comfortable as he has in any
debate thus far. In particular, he was given the chance to discuss
his commitment to returning control of public education to states,
as well as his desire to shore up Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Keyes referred to a Texas town that had approved
Spanish as its official language and suggested that Bush had not
sufficiently upheld the importance of English. Bush, who speaks
Spanish, said: ``No es la verdad.'' Translation: Not true.
</P>
<P>
   On another Keyes question, Bush's reversal on the South Carolina
senator's remarks came a day after the NAACP in Texas pleaded for
the governor's support in getting the Confederate flag removed from
the state Supreme Court building. Bush faced questions about his
sensitivity to racial issues last week, when he not only refused to
condemn Ravenel's NAACP remark but also declined to weigh in on
whether South Carolina should fly the Confederate flag _ to many a
symbol of slavery and racism _ over its state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, will return here for
another debate. The caucuses are a week later.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Republican Party said Saturday that approximately
110,000 registered Republicans, or 20 percent of the total in the
state, are expected to participate.

STEPHEN J. JATRAS, 73, FORMER PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF
TELEX CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen J. Jatras, former president and chief executive of Telex
Corp. and a member of the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education,
died at his home in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan. 8. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from a brain tumor, his
daughter, Stephanie Buffum, said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in McKeesport, Pa., Jatras worked at Lockheed Corp. and
Midwestern Instruments before joining Telex as its president in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   Jatras held that post until 1981, when Roger M. Wheeler, the
entrepreneur who was chairman and chief executive of Telex, was
shot and killed at a Tulsa country club.
</P>
<P>
   Jatras added Wheeler's titles, and presided over seven years of
rising profits at the company, a producer of computer terminals and
peripheral equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times hit Telex in 1987, however.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings began to shrink and its stock price fell sharply. In
response to those developments, a group led by Asher B. Edelman,
the New York investor, began a hostile $888 million bid for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Telex repelled the takeover, but was left heavily in debt and
tied to a new partner, Memorex.
</P>
<P>
   Jatras became vice chairman of Memorex Telex, a position he held
until 1990, when he greatly scaled back his role at the company, a
move leading to his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his business career, Jatras was active in
education.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he was named a member of the University of Tulsa board
of trustees. In 1991 he was appointed to the Board of Regents of
Tulsa Junior College, which subsequently became Tulsa Community
College.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma named Jatras to a vacant
seat on the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education. In May of the
following year he was appointed to a full nine-year term on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 inductee into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, Jatras was a
strong advocate of the expansion of OneNet, Oklahoma's statewide
telecommunications and information network for education and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jatras received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
from Carnegie Mellon University, and an M.S. degree, also in
electrical engineering, from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He was a lifetime trustee of Carnegie-Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage to the former Frankie Jean McKinney ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Jatras is survived by five children, Stephanie, of Tulsa;
Andrew, of Boulder, Colo.; Cindy Hadden, of Tulsa; Todd, of
Brooklyn, N.Y.; Shawn, of Ramona, Calif.; and six grandchildren.

TWO TRACKS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    For Use Mon., Jan. 17 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to build momentum this week(CQ) for the most
ambitious foreign policy goal of his remaining term, President
Clinton is slated to host the three key players in his crusade to
broker peace in the Middle East before he leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa return Wednesday for their third round of
land-for-peace negotiations under Clinton's auspices.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
comes to the White House, amid talk of a possible Barak-Arafat
peace summit near here in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to help press Barak and Sharaa forward in talks he
initiated between the two men in December, then followed up with a
week of slow-starting negotiations earlier this month in the rural
hamlet of Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   He also means to prod Arafat and Barak along toward their
pledged goal of completing a so-called framework agreement _ at
least outlining areas of broad agreement and a timetable for
resolving outstanding disputes _ by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   If there is ``sufficient progress,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright might try to arrange a February summit between
Arafat and Barak, said her spokesman, James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to rule out the possibility that Clinton might
bring together Barak and Arafat this week, as was reported in the
Israeli press, though no such meeting has yet been announced in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Making peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors is a goal
that has eluded successive presidencies since the Jewish state's
birth half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   That quest is far from over. Israel faces both hard bargaining
and painful compromise if it is to strike meaningful peace accords
with Arafat and Sharaa, both of whom must confront similar
difficulties to win agreements with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind's eye, though, Clinton can doubtless already imagine
an October White House ceremony, with Arabs and Israelis inking an
historic peace pact on the sun-splashed lawn, before the admiring
gaze of a grateful nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is now looking to history,'' said Michael Hudson,
director of the Center for Contemporary Arab studies at Georgetown
University, where Clinton attended law school. ``Strangely enough,
he may actually have the possibility of a major foreign policy
victory in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't erase from Clinton's biography his mixed overall
policy record and his House impeachment _ and subsequent Senate
acquittal _ over his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. If it wouldn't remove the stain of scandal,
though, it would go a long way toward taking out the sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could pull it off, I think he would be in the same class
as Jimmy Carter, who, with Camp David, really did leave an
important legacy,'' said Hudson. ``Even if he can pull off half of
it, he'll be remembered as a peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to suggest that Clinton's Mideast peace gambit
is being driven only by his need to resurrect his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is this country's strongest ally in the oil-rich Middle
East, and American presidents have tried since 1948 to ensure
Israeli peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It might well be argued, in fact, that five decades of treaties
and betrayal, enmity and war, somehow stretch beyond recognition
the definition of a peace process.
</P>
<P>
   What it has all been about, though, is far more than settling a
border dispute. The grand geo-strategic vision has always been to
build a Jewish state in a sea of Arab opposition stretching back at
least to 1917.
</P>
<P>
   That's the year when British Foreign Secretary Arthur James
Balfour declared his country's support for ``the establishment in
Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people.''

   Inconveniently for large numbers of Palestinians, Britain had

<P>
   President Jimmy Carter brokered peace between Israel and Egypt
in 1978, during the summit at Camp David, the presidential retreat

</P>
<P>
   Arafat's Palestinian Authority struck a broad peace accord with
Israel in 1993 _ in office for less than a year at the time,
Clinton had little to do with the agreement, other than to host a
formal signing ceremony on the White House lawn. Jordan struck its
own peace accord with Israel the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians agreed to formally recognize Israel's right to
exist, however, only in December 1998, when Clinton journeyed to
Palestinian controlled Gaza. Even now, far from all Palestinians
have bought into peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, Syria and Israel remain in a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, Clinton is encouraged by several
factors.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Barak was elected last spring on a pro-peace
platform. The highly decorated career soldier visited the White
House a few weeks later vowing to ``leave no stone unturned,'' in
the pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for Israel would be peace with its neighbors for the
first time ever. Not only would Israel be able to, in theory at
least, reduce the high state of military alert the country has cut
its teeth on, but it could begin to look to the day when it is
fully integrated into the Arab region, economically as well as
socially.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's adversaries, moreover, appear to be living on, if not
borrowed time, certainly not an excessive amount of it.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, 70, and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, just one year
his junior, have begun to realize they don't have forever to strike
a deal on terms they can at least influence heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's control over the Palestinian people isn't exactly
unchallenged: he stays in power, and alive, largely with the help
of an extensive security force. He appears to understand that to
prevent his thin consensus for peace from shattering, he must
deliver, and sooner rather than later, on the fruits of peace. That
is, chiefly, long-delayed economic development for the Gaza and
West Bank lands Israel is handing over to Palestinian control as
part of the price of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak have pledged to work out, by mid-September, the
outstanding issues dividing them, such as the future of Jerusalem
and the question of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Observers believe Assad is ready to end his country's state of
war with Israel to prepare the way for his son to one day succeed
him. If war continues, along with the heavy reliance on military
influence in Syria that comes with it, those prospects are
considerably dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the price for Israel is land, in this case, the return to
Syria of the Golan Heights, strategic land Israeli troops seized
during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. Barak _ ``He has put peace at the
top of his agenda,'' Clinton said last spring _ has signaled his
willingness to give up the Golan, over the objections of many
Israelis, in exchange for security guarantees and the establishment
of economic and diplomatic ties with its large Arab neighbor to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Syrian-Israeli deal is a deal that can be structured,''
said Mideast expert Jon Alterman of the U.S. Institute of Peace, a
quasi-governmental think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither side wants to fight the other,'' said Alterman, ``and
the United States is serious about wanting to make (a peace accord)
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   These factors, and others, argue in favor of Clinton being able
to help broker peace between Israel and Syria and Israel and the
Palestinians. The question on many an analyst's mind is, ``At what
cost?''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which already sends Israel some $3 billion a
year in military and economic aid, is likely to have to increase
that dramatically to help compensate Israel for lands it plans to
withdraw from and for military facilities in intends to leave
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also weighing an Israeli request to deploy U.S.
troops to the region, perhaps as part of a larger U.N. mission to
help police the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately a lot of this is about making people feel
comfortable,'' Alterman said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is unquestionably good at that, and he's clearly
committed to putting in the time it takes to help shepherd talks on
the Israeli-Syrian track as well as the Israeli-Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
   What's unknown, and at this point unknowable, is just how flawed
a set of accords Clinton is willing to swallow in the interest of
being able to declare himself the first great peacemaker of the new
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can probably lock up the treaties he needs,''
Alterman said, ``but the durability of the peace will depend on the
implementation, and that is something he can't control.''

EDITORIAL: OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Jan. 16:
</P>
<P>
   At a time when family relationships are changing, the Supreme
Court is weighing a case involving grandparents' visitation rights
that raises the fundamental question of who decides how children
are reared. The justices heard arguments last week on a Washington
state statute that permits grandparents and others to seek
court-ordered visitation, over a parent's objections, if such
visits would be in a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have a right under the Constitution to rear their
children without government interference. Only in cases where harm
or threat of harm to a child exists has government been allowed to
usurp the decision-making rights of the parents. But Troxel vs.
Granville poses a case where a state court overrode a parent's
judgment in recognizing other ties.
</P>
<P>
   Jenifer and Gary Troxel petitioned for visitation with their two
young granddaughters after their son, Brad Troxel, the children's
father, committed suicide. The children's mother, Tommie Granville
Wynn, who was not married to Brad Troxel, did not cut off the
children's contact with the Troxels but opposed overnight stays.
The trial judge went against the mother's wishes and ordered one
weekend visit a month, along with other requirements. The
Washington Supreme Court ruled that the statute violated the
mother's protected right to autonomy in making child-rearing
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The states generally have laws that allow grandparents to seek
visitation with grandchildren, but Washington's law is unusual
because it allows ``any person'' at ``any time'' to petition a
family court and get visitation rights if the court determines that
such visits would be best for the child. During argument, the
justices seemed clearly troubled by a law that Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor called ``breathtakingly broad.''
</P>
<P>
   The statute allows virtual strangers with no significant
relation to the child to petition for visitation, forcing parents
to incur legal costs to oppose frivolous requests in court. The law
also sets the bar for visitation far too low in using a ``best
interest of the child'' standard. That standard may be appropriate
in custody disputes when state intervention is necessary because
the parents cannot agree or when there is no fit parent to whom the
court can defer. But when used in a visitation context, the ``best
interest'' standard, which is subjective and broadly defined,
allows a state court to substitute its judgment for the parent's.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court should affirm the Washington court's decision
that the statute is clearly unconstitutional. Parents have
longstanding legal primacy in child rearing that must be protected
from state intrusion. But in some extraordinary cases, a child may
have exceptionally close attachments to grandparents or other
adults, and arbitrarily ending those bonds could cause a child
substantial psychological harm. A law based on a standard of harm
might provide the court reason to look more closely at this issue,
but the Washington statute does not serve as a basis for doing so.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to build momentum this week(CQ) for the most
ambitious foreign policy goal of his remaining term, President
Clinton is slated to host the three key players in his crusade to
broker peace in the Middle East before he leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa return Wednesday for their third round of
land-for-peace negotiations under Clinton's auspices.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
comes to the White House, amid talk of a possible Barak-Arafat
peace summit near here in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to help press Barak and Sharaa forward in talks he
initiated between the two men in December, then followed up with a
week of slow-starting negotiations earlier this month in the rural
hamlet of Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   He also means to prod Arafat and Barak along toward their
pledged goal of completing a so-called framework agreement _ at
least outlining areas of broad agreement and a timetable for
resolving outstanding disputes _ by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   If there is ``sufficient progress,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright might try to arrange a February summit between
Arafat and Barak, said her spokesman, James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   He also declined to rule out the possibility that Clinton might
bring together Barak and Arafat this week, as was reported in the
Israeli press, though no such meeting has yet been announced in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Making peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors is a goal
that has eluded successive presidencies since the Jewish state's
birth half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   That quest is far from over. Israel faces both hard bargaining
and painful compromise if it is to strike meaningful peace accords
with Arafat and Sharaa, both of whom must confront similar
difficulties to win agreements with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In his mind's eye, though, Clinton can doubtless already imagine
an October White House ceremony, with Arabs and Israelis inking an
historic peace pact on the sun-splashed lawn, before the admiring
gaze of a grateful nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is now looking to history,'' said Michael Hudson,
director of the Center for Contemporary Arab studies at Georgetown
University, where Clinton attended law school. ``Strangely enough,
he may actually have the possibility of a major foreign policy
victory in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't erase from Clinton's biography his mixed overall
policy record and his House impeachment _ and subsequent Senate
acquittal _ over his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. If it wouldn't remove the stain of scandal,
though, it would go a long way toward taking out the sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could pull it off, I think he would be in the same class
as Jimmy Carter, who, with Camp David, really did leave an
important legacy,'' said Hudson. ``Even if he can pull off half of
it, he'll be remembered as a peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to suggest that Clinton's Mideast peace gambit
is being driven only by his need to resurrect his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is this country's strongest ally in the oil-rich Middle
East, and American presidents have tried since 1948 to ensure
Israeli peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It might well be argued, in fact, that five decades of treaties
and betrayal, enmity and war, somehow stretch beyond recognition
the definition of a peace process.
</P>
<P>
   What it has all been about, though, is far more than settling a
border dispute. The grand geo-strategic vision has always been to
build a Jewish state in a sea of Arab opposition stretching back at
least to 1917.
</P>
<P>
   That's the year when British Foreign Secretary Arthur James
Balfour declared his country's support for ``the establishment in
Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Inconveniently for large numbers of Palestinians, Britain had
just seized control of Palestine from the Ottoman Turks, and so was
able to translate what became known as the ``Balfour Declaration,''
into a policy promoting Jewish migration to the area in the years
prior to World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust provided global impetus to speed that process and,

REAL ESTATE: A DORM ROOM RENT-FREE, WON IN AN ONLINE LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day there seems to be a geometric increase in the number
of deals being offered through the Internet. Get Rich Quick! Lose
Weight Now! Earn Free Dollars!
</P>
<P>
   So when Ray Shawn Williams decided on a lark to fill out a form
for an online lottery that promised the winner a semester of free
student housing, he figured it was just another gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he also figured he had nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a sophomore at Long Island University in Brooklyn, had
been living on campus, but the cost of room and board, nearly
$4,000 a semester, wasn't covered by his student aid. His college
adviser suggested that he would probably find it less expensive to
live off campus.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams, who gets some money from his parents in Boston but
also works 20 hours a week in the shipping department at Sony,
began searching for a place in November. Brokers told him he could
get a studio in Bedford-Stuyvesant for about $515 a month, and he
was about to take a place when he got a call from someone telling
him that he had just won six months of free housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caller said, `I have good news to tell you. You filled out
a form for free rent, and you won.' I said, `Really? I did? I don't
even remember. You're kidding me? This has to be a joke.''' But it
wasn't a joke. An organization called Educational Housing Services,
which describes itself as the largest noncollege provider of
student housing in New York City, had randomly selected his name in
a drawing that had 10,000 entries. Beginning Jan. 1, he was
entitled to free rent in one of the company's dormitories, at 200
Tillary Street in downtown Brooklyn, not far from his campus.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams asked if he would get the offer in writing, and
the voice said yes, he decided that the call was probably valid.
``I was, like, thank you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the new year, Williams moved into the
building, a former produce distribution center that is now filled
with large loftlike rooms, each occupied by three students. He has
what can only be called an instant bedroom: a single piece of
furniture with a bed on top, desk underneath and on the end, a
closet. ``I've never been in a bunk bed so high,'' he says. ``At
night it's beautiful, looking out on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800-square-foot space, in addition to accommodating his two
roommates in similar setups, has a large kitchen area, a television
hanging near the ceiling, and a bathroom with lockers for each
student. If he decides to stay in the dorm after this semester, his
rent will be $700 a month.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall by his bed is a poster for Missy Elliott, a rapper,
producer and director whose work he admires. ``I just love her
music,'' he says. ``She's original.'' Since the age of 3, he says,
he has wanted to sing and dance, and remembers as a young child
mimicking Michael Jackson in his video for ``Thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, he began working for radio station WJMN in
Boston, and continued after he graduated, but eventually his
parents prevailed on him to go to college, to have training that
would offer him a backup if he doesn't make it as an entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams, who is 22, seems to be off to a good start. He
appears in a music video now airing for ``Do It Again (Put Your
Hands Up)'' by Jay-Z, and will be in one coming out later this
month for Ja Rule. This semester, he is taking all his classes at
night so he will be free for daytime auditions. He is majoring in
media arts, which is giving him training in television and video
production.
</P>
<P>
   Although Williams is gratified by his good fortune, and
estimates he'll be able to save a few thousand dollars between now
and June that will help him rent an apartment in the future, it's
not the first time he has been a winner. Three or four times over
the years, he says, he has been the ``lucky caller'' to a radio
station, getting free tickets to concerts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never won cash,'' he says, ``but you never know. I'm a
living witness that you should go for something you see.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: PARTISAN RANCOR THREATENS EFFORT TO OVERHAUL NEW
YORK'S COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After New York's chief judge called last week for a
sweeping restructuring of the state's antiquated court system,
experts predicted that the proposal would end up like a similar one
did last year _ a victim of death by partisanship in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   For a quarter-century, partisan rancor in the capital has
scuttled efforts to streamline one of the most byzantine court
systems in the nation, law professors and watchdog groups say, and
this time is expected to be no different, although the idea is
gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   In her annual state of the judiciary address on Monday, Chief
Judge Judith S. Kaye announced an investigation into political
patronage in the courts. She also outlined efforts to deal with
chronic low-level criminals who escape with light sentences, and
low pay for court-appointed lawyers. But her most far-reaching
proposal by far would broadly reconfigure the court system.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said that the proposals that Judge Kaye could
implement herself, like the patronage inquiry, would be carried
out. But they predicted inaction on the far more sweeping _ and
some argue far more necessary _ structural remedies that would
require the agreement of Albany's three top leaders _ Gov. George
Pataki, a Republican; Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican leader of the
Senate; and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that it doesn't need legislation, she will do
it,'' said Steven Zeidman, executive director of the Fund for
Modern Courts.
</P>
<P>
   Simplifying New York's courts is far from a new idea. Previous
chief judges and former Gov. Mario Cuomo have floated proposals,
but the same constitutional standards and political squabbling
between Republicans and Democrats that threaten Judge Kaye's
proposal scuttled those plans.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the two parties have cited a wide variety of
reasons for the lack of an overhaul, but the repeated deal breaker
has been the inability of the two sides to agree on the numbers of
judges for each jurisdiction. The key to a deal has been political
horse trades, in which an increase in judges for a
Republican-controlled area, for example, would be exchanged for a
similar increase in judges in a Democratic district. But the two
sides have been largely unable to agree for the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a series of patchwork remedies that have
created an arcane state court system that causes average citizens
to scratch their heads, wastes resources and in low-level criminal
cases is derided as a plea bargain mill.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on
how to add more judges in New York City to deal with the flood of
cases generated by the state's tough new Rockefeller drug laws.
Democrats essentially favored changing the state Constitution,
which limits the election of state Supreme Court justices to one
for every 50,000 people. But upstate Republicans opposed that plan
because more judges in the city would have meant more Democratic
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, legislators agreed to allow ``acting'' justices
appointed by court administrators and the governor. Twenty years
later, the compromise stands. As a result, in a state with a
Constitution that mandates an elected Supreme Court, nearly half of
the justices in the city are appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the sharp drop in serious crime in the city, the court
system has too many justices, according to court officials. More
lower-level criminal court judges are needed to handle the flood of
misdemeanor cases generated by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's crackdown
on quality of life crimes. The result is a system that pressures
judges to decide minor cases in as little as two minutes, which can
result in what critics call generous plea deals for chronic
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   And Family Court, which has seen its caseload rise by 30 percent
in the last decade, is also in need of more judges. Court
administrators shift judges back and forth to deal with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Problems also exist in the appellate courts, whose districts
were last readjusted in 1894. Today, one appellate court hears all
cases from Manhattan and the Bronx, for example, while another
court hears all cases from Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk,
Westchester and four Hudson Valley counties _ an area holding half
the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye's broadest proposal would reorganize the nine courts
in the city into two courts, create a new appellate court and
generally give judges greater flexibility in handling cases. Pataki
and Bruno backed a version of the proposal last year. But Assembly
Democrats opposed it, offering their own plan, which died after it
left the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Pataki and Republican and Democratic leaders, as well
as a myriad of lobbying groups like the State Bar Association, all
say they support streamlining the system. But engineering a horse
trade that would ensure each party's de facto control over enough
judgeships remains, as before, the sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature fails to enact restructuring this year, it
will have to be put off for two more years, because it requires a
constitutional amendment approved by two consecutive state
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   One lobbyist who supports the restructuring said the problem was
in part Catch-22. Other than lawyers, the people who deal the most
with the state court system are accused criminals, a group with
scant political power in Albany. And the public, he said, is either
uninterested or confused by the state's labyrinthine judicial
system, making restructuring less than a hot-button issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no political motivation,'' said the lobbyist. ``Most
people tend not to think of the courts.''

SPORTS COLUMN: QUITE A NIGHT TO BEHOLD AT HOOPS CENTRAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It is quite enough just to walk into the
spacious, new, high-tech fieldhouse of Conseco Arena, with its
serious basketball jones _ in one of the display cases, Oscar's
jersey from Crispus Attucks High.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll talk about architecture and Hoosier madness down the
road. Friday night was about the Lakers and the Pacers, not just
another National Basketball Association midwinter plod-through, but
maybe an emotional prelude to finals in June.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of a night that clears the palate. Oh, yeah, that's why
pro basketball can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   The retro standings board told the story. At both ends of the
new arena, there are manual top 10 lists of the league's leading
teams. On Friday, the list began: L.A. Lakers 31-5. Portland 27-8.
Indiana 23-11. Two out of three ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were on a 16-game roll. Big story in Sports
Illustrated. People were asking Phil Jackson if his team could beat
the league record of 33, set by the 1971-72 Lakers of Wilt and
Elgin and West.
</P>
<P>
   No, Jackson had been saying. Just no. Too many good teams these
days. He has shed his hermit sackcloth and ashes and instilled a
bit more discipline in these Lakers. But now, he has been saying
with deep gravity, the turnaround has been so sudden that everybody
is pointing at his team.
</P>
<P>
   One of those good teams is the Pacers, a clubhouse jammed with
adults like Reggie Miller, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin and Mark
Jackson. After the sourness of the Knicks, what a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's active skull was shimmering on the court at 5:30 p.m.,
fully two and a half hours before game time. He is from L.A. His
sister, Cheryl the great, would be doing color analysis for TBS. He
pumped shots from the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stands, Donnie Walsh, the New Yorker who runs the
Pacers, was talking about Phil Jackson's impact this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a confirmation that good coaches mean a lot in this
league,'' Walsh said emphatically. ``We've had Larry Brown and
Larry Bird. They've got Phil. If they keep getting better, they'll
be tough to beat. They are winning through their defense. Shaquille
O'Neal is playing great defense. He's as big a man as I remember,
and he's very agile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers began warming up and Jackson shambled into the media
room to cop a bit of dessert. The young woman with the clipboard at
the door asked who he was with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bulls,'' he said absent-mindedly, before realizing his
mistake. ``The Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson paused to talk about his old pal Bill Bradley, who is
running for president. He thinks Bradley is doing well in the
Democratic nomination process. He also advanced the theory that
George W. Bush desperately wants four long shots _ Keyes, Hatch,
Bauer and Forbes _ to remain in the Republican race as long as
possible, because they make Bush seem so, so, so safe. Phil Jackson
was always good on theories.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal rumbled back to the locker room and sat still for the
reporters. He had behaved remotely toward two previous coaches, but
O'Neal had respected Jackson before he even arrived because, he
said: ``I was raised to respect authority, and Phil is the guy
who'll take us over the hump. He's a no-nonsense guy. His record
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The word has been that Jackson has not been up to his penchant
in Chicago for passing out selected books to his players, but
O'Neal revealed that Jackson has given him a book by Friedrich
Nietzsche.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq would not say which one, but, he added with his rapper's
knowing inventiveness, ``I'm analyzing it, scrutinizing it,
dissectisizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   First quarter. The two teams began dissectisizing each other on
the court. Shaq made a gorgeous bounce pass to Kobe Bryant early,
but the Pacers were digging in. With 15 seconds left in the period,
Bryant took a premature drive and missed, and Perkins fired the
ball to Miller who found his spot from the five-minute-30-second
workout, and drilled a jumper at the buzzer for a 33-30 Pacer lead.
</P>
<P>
   Second quarter. Mo Mullins, who had the first 12 DNP-CD (Did Not
Play-Coach's Decision) of his career this season, made two
3-pointers within 49 seconds. Lakers up at the half, 58-57.
</P>
<P>
   Third quarter. Bryant, still only 21 with no college experience,
kept freelancing, Spree-style, outside the familiar Bulls' triangle
offense. Lakers up, 77-75.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth quarter. Two Indy subs, Travis Best and Austin Croshere,
scored 20 points between them, as O'Neal kept missing shots near
the basket. The public-address system blasted the annoying Indy-car
whine. Miller buried another three. His sister, standing near
courtside, sideline mike in hand, appeared to swallow a smile.
Pacers win. Final score, 111-102.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a great basketball team, best we've seen so far,''
Bird said. ``A big win for us. It seemed like playoff intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things come to an end,'' Phil Jackson revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching game films,'' said Sam Perkins, who played
two years for the Lakers. ``Teams just try to roll with them.
Showtime, you know. We figured, if you get down and dirty with
them, you might have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They played well but we beat ourselves,'' Shaq said. ``I'm
blaming the SI jinx.''
</P>
<P>
   The two teams rushed separately out into the cold Indiana night.
The Pacers would play at Orlando Saturday night. The Lakers would
play at Minnesota Saturday night. Nobody will touch the 33-game
streak any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   However, in this high-tech fieldhouse, with memories of the past
_ photos of a young John Wooden, the team photo from ``Hoosiers'' _
there was a hint of late spring, when the evening sun might glow
through the huge windows at the top, as these two teams could be
back at it again, here in the heartland, here in Basketball
Central.

PIERRE CLEMENTI, 57, WHO EXUDED MENACE AND SEX APPEAL IN FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Clementi, the darkly handsome French character actor who
made a specialty of seductive and menacing roles, died on Dec. 27
in Paris. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said Catherine Verret, the executive
director of Unifrance USA, a French film association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Though he appeared in dozens of films, Clementi was probably
best known for Luis Bunuel's ``Belle de Jour'' (1967), the story of
a respectable woman whose sexual awakening is spurred by a foray
into prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Clementi plays a young gangster, a scarred, limping
lothario who slowly seduces the film's heroine, played by Catherine
Deneuve. The role, which he played with a sneer and a simmering
sexuality, sealed Clementi's reputation as a bad boy, both in life
and on film.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after ``Belle de Jour,'' Clementi went on to appear
as the devil (in Bunuel's ``Milky Way''), as a cannibal
(``Pigpen''), and as a bisexual jazz musician (``Steppenwolf'').
While the reviews for each were decidedly negative, critics almost
always took note of Clementi's ability to raise a film's sex
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he was arrested in Rome and charged with possession of
LSD and cocaine. He served 17 months in an Italian prison before an
appeals court acquitted and freed him. Lacking a resident visa,
however, he was given 24 hours to leave Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bunuel, Clementi was also a favorite of the
Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, who featured him in
``Partner'' (1968) as a drama teacher and his alter ego, and in
``The Conformist'' (1970), as a homosexual chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he returned to the screen in ``Hideous Kinky,'' about
the spiritual awakening of a young woman (Kate Winslet). True to
form, he played Santoni, an elderly libertine.

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES CRITICIZE BUSH TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ Seeking to undermine Gov. George W. Bush in the
last Republican debate only nine days before the caucuses here, his
rivals Saturday questioned his credentials as a tax cutter and
ridiculed his centerpiece plan to reduce taxes by $483 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were led by Sen. John McCain, who warned that Bush's
plan favored the wealthy at the expense of lower and middle income
taxpayers. His own proposal, he said, would address a more pressing
matter of paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security,
not one penny for Medicare and not one penny for paying down the
national debt,'' McCain said. ``And when you run ads saying you're
going to take care of Social Security, my friend, that's all hat
and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, ``That's cute, but it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' McCain said, ``they're always cutest when they're
true.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush defended his proposal, saying, ``I've got 2 trillion
set aside to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush provoked the quarrel when, posing a question to McCain, he
accused the Arizona senator of backing a loophole that would
essentially amount to a $40 billion tax increase for working
Americans through worker-related benefits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeatedly tried to turn the attention back to Bush's
plan, at one point tossing off a another quip by suggesting that he
was dancing a ``Texas two-step'' in trying to justify a plan the
would not benefit working-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring between Bush and McCain made for the most stirring
moments of a 90-minute forum _ the seventh debate with all six
candidates _ at the Iowa Public Television studios here that
otherwise was striking for the lack of hard-edged exchanges this
close to the first actual voting.
</P>
<P>
   While the event was billed by its sponsor, The Des Moines
Register, as a debate, the candidates did not take much of an
opportunity to challenge each other; instead they mostly restated
their stands on matters like health care and helping family farmers
to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the event four years ago, when the combatants at this
event ganged up on Steve Forbes and ridiculed his flat-tax plan,
which had been gaining steam, this time they were far more
cautious. Polls show that Bush is well ahead of the pack of the
Republican candidates campaigning here, with Forbes a far distant
second. McCain, who is neck and neck with Bush in polls in New
Hampshire, is not actively campaigning in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several candidates, led by McCain, did raise questions
about Bush's tax plan. Forbes questioned the governor's record on
taxes as governor of Texas. ``Most Texans have never seen those tax
cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah repeatedly said he was the only
contender who could steer a sweeping tax cut through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to have somebody who knows how to get a
tax plan through congress,'' Hatch said. But he also aimed his fire
at McCain, saying, ``I think we could have gotten President Clinton
to give us a bigger tax cut than John McCain's.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 90-minute event, Bush appeared somewhat
rattled, and sought to defend his credentials as a tax cutter by
declaring, in a response to a question by Forbes, ``Well you know
something Steve, nearly 69 percent of Texans said overwhelmingly in
1998, `You're the man. We appreciate your tax cuts.''' He added,
``It's really real for a lot of folks who live in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   During the exchanges, the candidates differed chiefly on
questions of taxes, ethanol subsidies and China policy, but spent
much of their time taking turns railing against the ethics of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the country, I'm worried about whether we
are going to have a continuation of the current leadership,'' Sen.
Hatch said at the debate's opening. ``I want to see the
Clinton-Gore team go.''
</P>
<P>
   The main point of disagreement in foreign policy came when Gary
Bauer, long a critic of the Clinton administration's China policy,
declared that he would revoke China's trading status with the
United States, at a moment when the Clinton administration is
trying to make China's ``normal trade status'' permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That policy has failed,'' Bauer said, adding that China was
``in a mass build-up'' of its military forces. ``We need a Reagan
policy,'' said Bauer, who worked in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, China has been granted what was previously known as
``most favored nation'' status every year since 1980, including
every year of Reagan's presidency, on Reagan's initiative and with
the approval of Congress. But none of the Republican candidates who
agree with the Clinton administration and favor the extension of
normal trade relations with China made that point. Alan Keyes, a
former ambassador, asked Bush about the town of El Cenizo in Texas,
which he said had passed rules to conduct all its business in
Spanish. Bush quickly responded in Spanish that ``it's not the
truth.'' Keyes shot back, also in Spanish, ``It is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that he had consulted with the attorney general
of Texas and that all of the town's meeting are now ``conducted in
English under the laws of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for English-plus,'' said Bush, describing his approach,
chiefly for the schools, that English must be the main language of
instruction, but that other languages also be used in school
environments.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates talked about aggressively opening up foreign
markets for farm goods, from Iowa and elsewhere. But none referred
to the series of trade agreements struck by the Clinton
administration in recent years to do just that, and only Keyes
described a general strategy for forcing Europe to open its markets
to American-made agricultural products.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But much of the session was devoted to taxes. The candidates
used a question posed by Bernard Hayes of Cedar Rapids on the
marriage penalty to defend their own tax plans and attack those of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued, once again, that the government budget surplus
should be used primarily to pay down the nation's debt and support
the Social Security program. ``I do want to give middle and lower
income people a much needed tax break,'' he said. ``But we have to
take care of other obligations over the years. We are staggering
under a $5.6 trillion debt and cannot lay that on future
generations. And the Social Security fund is a ticking time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bauer assailed Bush's plan of ``rearranging the deck chairs
on the Titanic,'' Bush visible bristled and said: ``I'm the one
person who has fought for and signed tax cuts. I've laid out a plan
to make sure the economy continues to grow and to make the tax code
more fair. My plan hears the call of people who live on the
outskirts of poverty. I believe it is important to have to have tax
programs that keep money away from Washington where people will
spend on more and bigger programs. The best way to reduce the fat
is to send money back to the people who pay that taxes and that's
what I intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain used the opportunity to pick up on his centerpiece attack
on corporate influences in Congress. ``Last fall Congress passed
one of the most obscene pieces of legislation, a pork-laden bill
that would have spent the entire budget surplus. I fought against
it and I railed against it. The president should force Congress to
spend less money.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the strongest language on taxes, Keyes, who wants the
income tax eliminated, said: ``The simple logic of the income tax
is that it is a slave tax and we are a tax and slave people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes, who first raised the issue of tax cuts with his
calls for a 17 percent flat income tax criticized McCain and Bush
as ``timid tax cutters'' and said Bush's tax cuts in Texas were
``more apparent than real.'' Currently, Forbes is running attack
television ads saying Bush broke an anti-tax pledge while governor
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To this, Bush responded by pointing to an advertisement run in
Saturday's Des Moines Register by Bob Dole, whom Forbes attacked in
a negative television campaign in the 1996 Iowa primaries, that was
a thinly veiled criticism of Forbes' attack ads in this campaign.
``Bob Dole wrote a pretty interesting advertisement today,'' Bush
said. ``He said if you talk about the record talk about the whole
record. I cut taxes. If not, our budget would have grown by $3
billion. Ask the elderly person whose homestead exemption was
raised by $10,000. That's real. It may not be real to those who
live in million dollar houses. But it is real for the people who
live in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to a question about religion in schools, the
candidates were asked whether they would support the posting of the
Ten Commandments. . Forbes favored it and Bush said, ``It seems
like to me that thou shalt not kill is pretty universal and I think
our districts ought to be allowed to post the Ten Commandments.
These are inherent values that make our society better for
everybody. Our schools ought to expand character educations. We
have to have character education that teaches our children right
from wrong, good from bad.''

WALSH FRUSTRATED WITH 49ERS AND CRITICS WHO SAY HE'S TOO OLD AT

   Bill Walsh will always be known as one of the smartest men in
professional football. As the coach and architect of the San
Francisco 49ers throughout the 1980s, Walsh was the leader of a
football renaissance and one of the main reasons the franchise
captured five Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh, the team's vice president and general manager the
past year, is no longer the strapping genius who patrolled the
sideline. When meeting with reporters for an end-of-the-season
briefing, he conducted a rambling and at times emotional session
that covered everything from the team's terrible salary-cap
situation to sleazy journalism. It was one of the oddest moments of
the 49er season and was exemplary of the state of disarray one of
the National Football League's most storied franchises.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about suggestions that he should retire
because of his age, Walsh, who turned 68 on Nov. 30, angrily
responded: ``I think there is a form of discrimination related to
my age in years. I don't know. I think those who know me fairly
well can see that I'm physically fit and have my wits about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is captain of a rapidly sinking vessel, and many of the
openings in the hull are of his doing. His signing the troubled
running back Lawrence Phillips proved to be disastrous. Walsh
brought back Charles Haley, who was a failure, and he has managed
the team's draft and salary-cap situation poorly.
</P>
<P>
   But Walsh is not the 49ers' only problem. The owners of the
team, the DeBartolo family, have in the past few years engaged in a
civil war for control of the franchise, and those battles have
certainly been a major distraction. And stars like Steve Young, 38,
and Jerry Rice, 37, have aged to the point where they are not
effective players any more.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is $24 million over the projected $62.2 million
salary cap for the 2000 season. Six veterans have been asked to
take dramatic pay cuts, including Young (who is scheduled to earn
$8.1 million next year), Rice ($5.49 million), linebacker Ken
Norton ($3.572 million), guard Ray Brown ($3.492 million), safety
Tim McDonald ($3.035 million) and center Chris Dalman ($4.766
million). At it now stands, these players alone would count an
astounding $28.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The team has until March 1 to get back under the cap, or it will
face penalties of up to $1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are in such a desperate situation that they have been
talking to other teams about trading their No. 3 overall pick and
moving lower in the round. The 49ers cannot afford the salary-cap
obligation that would come with paying the third selection.
</P>
<P>
   How do the 49ers fix their problems? There have been discussions
about trading or cutting Rice and Young, though it seems more
likely that the team will work out something so both can finish
their careers in San Francisco. The 49ers may also be considering
giving coach Steve Mariucci more say in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is bound for the Hall of Fame. It is to be hoped that what
is now happening with the 49ers will not irreparably damage what
has been a great career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Dilfer's Cost
</P>
<P>
   During the last part of the regular season Tampa Bay Buccaneers
quarterback Trent Dilfer spent most his time as the backup to the
rookie Shaun King. Occasionally television cameras would show
Dilfer on the sideline, cheering the team. And there is no question
that Dilfer, at one point the team's longtime starter, played the
good soldier while King led Tampa Bay to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer's stay in Tampa Bay has been largely unsuccessful.
Nevertheless, he is due $4.5 million if the team chooses to
exercise an option on the remaining two years of his contract.
General manager Rich McKay and coach Tony Dungy wanted to see how
King performed down the stretch of the regular season and in the
postseason before making any decision about Dilfer. But make no
mistake about it: The team is ready to cut Dilfer loose.
</P>
<P>
   King displayed tremendous poise for such a young player, going
4-1 as a starter in the team's final five regular-season games, and
avoided his previous trap of turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly Favors Houston &UR;  &LR;  Charley Casserly, the former general
manager of the Washington Redskins, who was fired by owner Daniel
Snyder, is one of the hot commodities in football. Casserly was
expected to have his second interview this weekend with Houston
owner Bob McNair about the football operations job there. Casserly
is also to meet with New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson about the
same position.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly has privately said that if he were offered both
positions, his preference would be Houston. Casserly would have
lots of salary-cap room and plenty of extra draft picks since
Houston is an expansion franchise. With Casserly's skill at
evaluating talent and an abundance of picks, he could build a
playoff team faster in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints will have $17 million in salary-cap room for the 2000
season, but because of last spring's trade for running back Ricky
Williams, the team does not have a first- or third-round pick for
the April draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Casserly might have some stiff competition for both
openings. Tom Donahoe, another outstanding talent evaluator,
resigned on Friday as the director of football operations for the
Pittsburgh Steelers, mainly because of his differences with coach
Bill Cowher. Both Saints and Houston officials will almost
certainly interview Donahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Carson's Fleeting Fame
</P>
<P>
   One of the NFL's best run-stoppers was the former Giants
linebacker Harry Carson. He was a brilliant, ferocious player, and
he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame. Carson is one of 15
finalists for the honor.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Carson gets in is a close call. The Hall of Fame
bylaws state that at least 4 of the 15 finalists must be voted in,
but the total class cannot be more than 7, which means the
competition will be stiff. The San Francisco 49ers teammates Joe
Montana and Ronnie Lott are locks. Wide receiver James Lofton was
one of the most productive ever at his position and will most
likely make it, as will tight end Dave Casper, who spent much of
his career with the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably four spots taken there, and while a maximum of
seven players can get in, look for only four or five to do so,
which makes Carson's chances tough. Other candidates include
Pittsburgh Steelers teammates John Stallworth and Lynn Swann,
defensive end Howie Long and Los Angeles Rams defensive end Jack
Youngblood.
</P>
<P>
   Saban a Belichick Fan &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nick Saban, the new Louisiana State coach who left Michigan
State, contacted Bill Belichick about becoming the team's defensive
coordinator, NFL team officials said. Saban knew it was a long
shot; Belichick is expected to become the head coach of the New
England Patriots once Belichick's contract mess is sorted out by
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue as early as tomorrow. Saban and
Belichick have been friends since Saban served as Belichick's
defensive coordinator when both were coaches with the Browns. &QL;

the background, Erez Zur ,32, and Rachel Kogan. Erez's brother
Alon, from Kibutz Ortal in the Golan Heights, was killed in the war
between Israel and Lebanon in 1982. Wreckage of an Israeli tank in
the background is a clear reminder of the war. For decades, the
military, which captured the Golan after brutal battles in 1973,
considered the area a strategic necessity to defend northern Israel
against what used to be sporadic shelling by Syria. Now, though, in
the face of what some believe to be a severely deteriorated Syrian
army, it is reassessing its security plans. (Rina Castelnuovo/The

   (NYT6) KATZRIN, Golan Heights -- Jan. 15, 2000 -- ISRAEL-GOLAN-5
-- Moshe Zaidon, 59, a manager of a local cafeteria in Katzrin,
talks with some local children. Zaidon has possessed a deep-seated
belief that the time would come when all Israeli settlers in the
Golan Heights would have to pull up stakes and leave. ``I knew from
the beginning that we were living on Syrian land,'' he says. ``Over
time, the Golan became by law an inseparable part of Israel. But
deep inside, I knew this day might arrive. If there was a chance of
peace with the Syrians, I always knew that we were the bargaining
chip.'' (Rina Castelnuovo/The New York Times)

PATAKI'S POWERBALL PUSH: HIGH ODDS, BUT DON'T COUNT IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Would anyone turn down a lottery jackpot worth
$124 million a year? Certainly not all those frenzied New Yorkers
who flock to Connecticut for a shot at a bank-busting payout from
the Powerball lottery.
</P>
<P>
   And not Gov. George Pataki either, even though by most accounts,
he is not a betting man himself.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, lobbied again last week to bring Powerball
to New York even though a similar effort last year failed to win
support in either the Republican Senate or the Democratic-led
Assembly. His proposed budget counts on $124 million in revenue
from ticket sales in a multistate lottery game that would, at least
on paper, support education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Legislature has resisted buying into multistate
lotteries, putting New York at odds with its neighbors, Connecticut
and New Jersey, and a growing number of places across the country
where sky-high jackpots generate revenue for everything from new
schools to highways. Indeed, in recent years, lawmakers have
repeatedly rebuffed Pataki's overtures to expand gambling in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal for a multistate lottery is part of a running
budgetary numbers game in the back rooms of the Capitol, where
lawmakers hold out for their pet programs and then shuffle around
millions _ even billions _ of dollars to pay for everything. During
the 1995 budget crisis, for instance, Pataki won approval for a
Quick Draw lottery game from reluctant legislators with the promise
of new revenue. In the last four years, Quick Draw, a keno-style
game that is played on video monitors in bars and delis, has
generated more than $470 million for the state.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the law creating Quick Draw got caught up in a
budget battle and expired on March 31. Although lawmakers
eventually resurrected it, they passed on his request to expand
Quick Draw into more bars and delis. And in 1997, they turned down
a constitutional amendment that Pataki backed to allow casino
gambling in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's odds at getting Powerball this year may not have
improved much as a resilient economy pumps dollars into the state's
coffers and lawmakers are loath to alienate the powerful base of
conservative and religious voters fiercely opposed to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one is counting Pataki out just yet.
</P>
<P>
   A multistate lottery would provide an influx of new money for
education programs, which are the cornerstone of the governor's
proposed budget and potentially the most divisive issue between
Republicans and Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to discount anything,'' declared the Senate
majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the powerful Republican from the
Albany area, when asked whether he would support the governor's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York has the highest lottery sales in the nation,
those sales have flagged in recent years, in large part because of
fierce competition from multistate lotteries and casinos. For
example, tickets sales for the 34-year-old New York lottery
declined 7.5 percent to $3.69 billion in the 1999 fiscal year from
$3.99 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, countless New Yorkers jettison state loyalty and
take their dollars to Connecticut in search of $1 Powerball
tickets. Powerball, which is sponsored by 20 states and the
District of Columbia, has become wildly popular since it began
eight years ago, and its huge jackpots can make a million-dollar
payoff seems downright paltry. The Powerball jackpot starts at $10
million and climbed as high as $296 million in August 1998.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But critics say the high stakes are addictive and cause people
to waste money on something they have little chance of winning.
``People have only so much money,'' said Sen. Frank Padavan, a
Republican from Queens who opposes expansion of the lottery. ``When
people gamble, they're not spending their money on goods and
services which create jobs and income for the local government.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what are the odds of hitting the Powerball jackpot, anyway?
Try 1 in 80 million (compared with, say, 1 in 18 million for the
New York State Lottery).
</P>
<P>
   George Wandrak, who oversees lottery operations in Connecticut,
said the long odds don't drive away the players _ in fact, quite
the opposite. His state added Powerball in 1995 after years of
waning lottery ticket sales. Last year, Powerball tickets raked in
$124.5 million in sales in Connecticut, or 14.3 percent of the
state's total revenue from gambling, including casinos and dog
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any product, there are choices _ you have Coke,
classic Coke, diet Coke, caffeine-free Coke, caffeine-free diet
Coke,'' Wandrak said. ``The lottery gets a bit stale, so we try to
freshen up the game and give them what they want _ higher
jackpots.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has sold three winning tickets in the Powerball
jackpot _ including the $10.3 million windfall that went to Sergio
and Elena Martini, of Brewster, N.Y., in January 1997. Wandrak
estimated that 10 percent to 15 percent of his state's Powerball
tickets are bought by New Yorkers and other out-of-staters.
</P>
<P>
   Since multistate lotteries were introduced in the mid-1980s,
state officials have come to depend on the high-profile games to
plug holes in their budgets. They typically share operating and
advertising costs for the lottery, and then keep a part of the
proceeds from ticket sales. In Powerball, for instance, the state
keeps half and the rest goes back for prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one states currently take part in one of three multistate
lotteries, said David Gale, executive director of the North
American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. Last year,
these games helped propel ticket sales for all lotteries nationwide
to a record $36.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, for instance, joined its first multistate lottery in
May after a slump in its Pick 6 Lotto sales. Since then, lottery
players have spent more than $126 million for a crack at the Big
Game, which is also sponsored by Michigan, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Virginia, Illinois and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball remains the undisputed king of lotteries with average
ticket sales of $1.2 billion a year, said Charles Strutt, executive
director of the Multi-State Lottery Association, which oversees the
game for the sponsoring states. Strutt predicted that New York,
with its 18 million residents, would fatten the jackpots even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very good for the game,'' said Strutt, who has
already been in touch with New York lottery officials. ``It would
increase sales in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   But no bets yet, please. Almost as soon as Pataki revived his
proposal for the multistate lottery last week, his opponents were
loudly protesting what they described as a major expansion of
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grey, a United Methodist minister and executive director
of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, said he was
surprised and disappointed that Pataki had again raised the issue.
``In good economic times, with no one clamoring for it, this seems
to go against what other politicians are doing,'' he said. ``In an
election year, to vote to expand gambling will only cost you
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   And Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the influential Democrat
from Lower Manhattan, could barely wait to express his disapproval.
``I'm once again troubled by the re-emergence of the Powerball
lottery,'' he said at a news conference in the Capitol building
after the governor unveiled his budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bruno, Pataki's staunchest ally in the Legislature, said
that he was not optimistic about its chances. Without endorsing the
governor's proposal, Bruno pointed out only that another source of
money would have to be found if the multistate lottery were
scratched. ``You either cut something or do something to replace
the revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers were not swayed by that argument. ``That's
always a straw man,'' Padavan said. ``We're talking about a $77
billion budget _ this amount is infinitesimal.''

 &HT;    Bush tax plan `all hat and no cattle,' McCain says during debate
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ GOP presidential front-runner and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush on Saturday took criticism in Texan and from Texans.
</P>
<P>
   At a nationally televised debate, top foe Arizona Sen. John
McCain opted for cowboy lingo in branding Bush's tax plan as ``all
hat and no cattle'' because it does not attack the national debt.
He also accused Bush of doing a ``Texas two-step'' on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The rare home-state Republican criticism of Bush came from a
former and a current member of the State Board of Education. Member
Bob Offutt of San Antonio and ex-member Donna Ballard of Midland
showed up in Iowa to endorse Bush rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's debate, the seventh of the campaign, was the final
GOP forum prior to the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses that kick off the
presidential season.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show Bush with a commanding lead here. A Jan. 8-11
survey for two Iowa television stations showed Bush with support
from 46 percent of the respondents. Forbes was second at 20
percent, with McCain in third at 8 percent. GOP contenders Alan
Keyes, Gary Bauer and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who participated in
Saturday's debate, each have single figures in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is skipping the Iowa caucuses in favor of concentrating
on the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary and the Feb. 19 South Carolina
contest. Forbes is counting on a strong showing here to boost his
lagging standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-McCain squabble on taxes, now played out on several
debate stages, centers on whether to spend projected budget
surpluses on tax cuts (Bush's preference), or a mix of tax cuts and
efforts to shore up Social Security and Medicare and chip away at
the national debt (McCain's idea).
</P>
<P>
   Bush ignited the tax talk by asking McCain why his plan taxes
some employee benefits, such as continuing education. Bush said it
amounts to a $40-billion tax hike on employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you say to a single mom who's getting educated that
she would have to pay taxes on those benefits?'' Bush asked McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the first thing I would say to that single mom is that
I've got a tax cut for you and Gov. Bush doesn't,'' McCain replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' replied Bush, whose tax plan does include
cuts at all income levels, albeit of varying amounts.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, McCain issued a statement saying that his $240
billion, five-year plan, makes changes in taxes on benefits as part
of an effort to close ``a loophole that allowed corporations to get
a tax benefit for giving employes things like golf and health club
memberships and free parking.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued his criticism of Bush's plan as doing too much
for the rich and not enough to attack the national debt and
preserve crucial programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security,
not one penny for Medicare and not one penny for paying down the
national debt,'' McCain said. ``And when you run ads saying you're
going to take care of Social Security, my friend, that's all hat
and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cute,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they're always cutest when they're true,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, Forbes continued his effort to show that
Bush's much-touted Texas tax cuts have not cut taxes for all
Texans. Forbes also used Offutt and Ballard to dent Bush's
self-spun image as an education reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five years that I have served under Governor Bush have
been a series of one disappointing surprise after another,'' Offutt
said here. ``His failure to deliver on his campaign promise to `end
the regulatory authority' of the state education bureaucracy were
empty words.''
</P>
<P>
   Former board member Ballard, who was rejected in an attempt to
rejoin the board, said Bush's record is one of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you determine improvement of education? By testing. The
problem with Governor Bush's claims of improving education is the
test in Texas is developed, distributed and assessed by the state
government. The fox is guarding the hen house,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   But former Board Chairman Jack Christie of Houston, in Iowa to
help the Bush campaign, was ready with quick support for the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone to more local control under Governor Bush,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Forbes got a Saturday boost from the Texans, he took a
hit from Bob Dole, the GOP's unsuccessful 1996 nominee who was a
target of Forbes' ads.
</P>
<P>
   Dole bought an ad in the Des Moines Register to warn Iowans
about Forbes _ without mentioning his name _ who has stepped up his
ad attacks on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept full responsibility for our loss in 1996, but anyone
who followed that race closely would agree that the millions of
dollars of deceptive and distorted negative television ads were a
major factor in that loss,'' Dole said in the ad. ``I have been
virtually silent on this subject since 1996 and speak up now only
because it may be happening again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole has not endorsed anyone, but his wife Elizabeth, who
decided to bow out of the run for president, is backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he could see the Bush campaign's hands all over the
ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is part and parcel of the Bush campaign of having
others do their attacks,'' he said. ``That ad was simply part of
the establishment attempt to try to create a coronation.''

<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ ``I'm going to Des Moines.'' This is what I
told the woman at the ticket counter at Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, she didn't literally say that, but it was tonally
implied, as always. Tell anybody you're abandoning Austin, Texas,
for Des Moines _ a self-conscious, pimply adolescent of a town _
and you're barraged with Kleenex and hugs as if you've just
announced you've got some horrible progressive disease.
</P>
<P>
   But every four years something bizarre and amazing happens here:
It's where, at the Iowa caucuses, they start to pick presidents.
The politics and media road show: It's a lot like being on tour
with a rock band, except the participants have fewer piercings, the
sex is more furtive and the abused substances are different. And
there's no other place to watch this odd little scene than here.
</P>
<P>
   Des Moines happens to be in Iowa, which happens to be, like
Texas, a state. This is the beginning and end of their
similarities. Texas is big, boastful, freaky, ready to secede, just
say the word. Iowa has a not entirely unwarranted inferiority
complex. Its principal characteristic is inoffensiveness. Its
people are invariably described as plainspoken and polite. Even the
sound of the states' names is dramatically different: ``Texas''
with its hard ``T,'' line-crossing ``x'' and copperhead ``s'' comes
off the tongue hard and declarative. The sound of ``Texas'' says
don't mess with it. ``Iowa,'' with its three meandering vowels and
``W,'' the lone consonant, sounds tentative, if not questioning:
Iowa? I'm so sorry.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place that clings white-knuckled to its agricultural
tradition even as family farms have dwindled. It used to be that
farm families just required a little help from the government.
These days they need a little more help, meaning somebody has to
take a job in town.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place that consume enormous quantities of Jell-O and
crank, (Iowans love their methamphetamines) though usually not at
the same gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   It's where, a long time ago, a group of immigrant farmers
stopped their wagons and wondered, Should we stop or keep going
until we get someplace colder? And they stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be my people. I'm from Iowa. To cop a line from
cranky author and former Iowan Bill Bryson, somebody has to be.
</P>
<P>
   Every four years, this place becomes, for a fleeting but intense
moment, the center of the media universe. The sound of satellite
truck generators rattle in the night. The city mice come visit the
country mice. They interview locals about the state of contemporary
politics. This confers upon Iowans a certain quadrennial status
they enjoy even as they acknowledge its fickle nature. The morning
after the caucuses, the
</P>
<P>
   media will stomp off to Manchester. But it's a welcome winter
distraction here, something to think about other than how far off
spring is, the answer being: quite a ways ... Look, it's Bob Novak!
Look, Thomas Oliphant! Look, the guy who wrote the book about the
guy! Believe me, if you are trapped in an Iowa winter, the
possibility of spotting a pundit or two _ doesn't even have to be
anybody A-list _ is to be highly anticipated, and Iowans hang
around hot spots like pensioners hovering over their mailboxes
around the first of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Jeff Greenfield munch supermarket-brand potato chips in
the media room of the Iowa Public Television studios _ from which
Saturday's underwhelming Republican debate aired _ might not be
much, but ... well, on second thought, it really isn't much, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to elect a president? Why should a state where
pigs outnumber people 10 to 1 _ 20 million to 2 million, and God
help us if they ever get the vote _ have such enormous and lasting
impact in selecting the leader of the free world?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the second question is, nobody really remembers.
It seems to have something to do with ``retail politics,'' a
``level playing field'' and someone named ``Jimmy Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter got a leg up here in '76, as did George McGovern four
years before. Gary Hart played well in '84. Caucus critics adroitly
note that not all these candidates technically were elected
president, that Iowa is full of nothing but wrinkly old white
people on tractors (except for the mayor of Des Moines who is,
inexplicably, African-American, and does not, so far as I know,
even own a tractor) that there's no good reason for everybody to be
stomping around here every four years and anyway it's too damn
cold. (Although not so far this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Iowans, ever-polite and deferential, absorb the criticism, note
that no state is a perfect microcosm of the country as a whole and
suggest that the process does a fair amount of culling the weak and
the delusional candidates from an unwieldy herd. Then they charge
you $150 for a night at the downtown Des Moines Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates win Iowa by having a message that sells and by
spending a punishing amount of time here building a network that
will get the faithful out come caucus night, when voters will stand
up before their neighbors and make the case for their guy. You
can't just buy a ton of media and move on to the next contest. Even
with his bursting war chest, George. W. Bush was reduced this
weekend to sucking up to prospective voters in person in small
towns, autographing golf balls, asking folks to remember in eight
days that he'd come to ask for their vote. He said it Friday before
handfuls of people in the hamlets of western Iowa, then he said it
before several hundred in the comparatively swanky headquarters of
the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation in West Des Moines on Friday night.
The Iowans in their winter coats laughed in the right places,
applauded in the right places and pretended they hadn't heard this
rap 632 times since last summer, when W., the Lone Consonant, began
</P>
<P>
   pitching serious woo.
</P>
<P>
   While all this was going on, the traveling press, who appear to
outnumber Iowa's porcine population by at least 10 to 1, roll their
eyes and ask their colleagues to throw them into the path of an
oncoming tractor-trailer rig before they have to listen to any more
stump speeches. In this respect the media have an advantage over
the presidential wannabes they cover: Members of the media are not
prohibited from openly hating the whole show _ the plowed-under
fields, the parochialism, the fact that you can't get a REAL New
York Times anywhere, the pointless travel and the fact that ...
Omigod I forgot to pack my Sharper Image Turbo Groomer 2.0 and now
my nose hairs will freeze while I'm doing my stand-up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, dear readers, we members of the press are willing to endure
unimaginable hardships in the interest of keeping you enlightened
and informed.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, my rental car doesn't even have a CD player.

Kosovo that killed both pilots. At least three major accidents

system, a Dayton Daily News examination found. In addition, the
examination found, the same system remains a suspect in at least
two other major crashes. One of them is the crash near Kosovo,
which is now part of a separate U.S. Justice Department
examination, the Daily News has learned. The other is a December

AN AD PUTS FOCUS ON FORBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ The six Republican presidential candidates woke
up in Iowa Saturday to read an advertisement in the Des Moines
Register signed by their 1996 nominee, Bob Dole, warning that the
party's 2000 nominee ``could be damaged again because of distorted
negative television political ads'' in the current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dole did not name names, the quarter-page ad was
directed at Steve Forbes, who roughed up Dole with a barrage of
negative commercials in the 1996 contest here, and who is now
targeting Texas Goveronor George W. Bush in a media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The ad carried no imprimatur other than Dole's name, but it
represented an admonition from the Republican establishment, which
is coalescing behind Bush as next week's Iowa caucus approaches.
The message: Lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Before Forbes left his Des Moines hotel for Saturday's debate,
he was asked about Dole's broadside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that ad is typical of the whole George Bush campaign,
ducking and dodging,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes indicated that he had no intention of withdrawing an ad
running in Iowa, in which a Texas woman scolds Bush for breaking a
tax pledge. Indeed, he trotted out two more Texans Saturday with
connections to the state board of education, who lambasted the
governor on another issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true record of Governor Bush on education in Texas is one
of broken promises,' said Robert Offutt, a member of the state
education board.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he intended to continue to report ``stark
contrasts'' between Bush's statements and his record.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not until the debate was more than an hour old did Forbes
get around to challenging Bush on the tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona as ``timid
tax cutters,'' Forbes looked at Bush and said: ``In Texas, George,
your tax cuts were more apparent than real. Most Texans have never
seen those tax cuts, and the same things are going to happen to
your proposal on the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush laughed and recalled that during his re-election campaign,
``nearly 69 percent of Texas said overwhelmingly in 1998: You're
the man; we appreciate your tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insisted that the cuts had failed to six out of 10
districts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true,'' said Bush, who followed with a lecture: ``Steve,
look, Senator Dole wrote a pretty interesting advertisement in this
morning's paper. If you're going to talk about a man's record, tell
the whole record.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the flap over the Dole ad was more interesting
than the debate itself.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCain chose not to campaign in Iowa, the contest here
has been effectively reduced to a clash between Bush and Forbes,
two candidates with almost unlimited funds. Forbes has eight days
to close a gap that some polls measure at more than 30 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Forbes's bravado before the debate, he barely nibbled at
the Texas governor Saturday, in their last public encounter
together before the caucuses. It was as though he recognized he had
been chastened by the party's titular head.
</P>
<P>
   Making his only appearance of the month in Iowa, McCain carried
the fight against Bush. He used Texas idioms, calling one Bush
proposal ``all hat and no cattle.'' At another point, McCain
parried with Bush over their respective tax-cut programs and said,
``Let's not do the Texas two-step here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush, McCain and Forbes dominated Saturday's debate with
their colloquies, Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Utah Senator Orrin G.
Hatch were left battling for standing in the party's strong
conservative constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer sought to draw some distinctions by castigating the
Republican Party for opposing a patients' bill of rights. Keyes
countered by saying that Bauer's embrace of the bill would turn the
system over to judges and trial lawyers and become ``an excuse for
government domination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch repeatedly touted his own 30-minute ``fireside chat,'' a
paid political advertisement scheduled to be shown on Des Moines TV
Saturday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If a medal for political valor in this year's presidential
campaign were awarded today, Senator John McCain would win easily.
His forays into the unconventional are sensible as well as bold.
</P>
<P>
   McCain earned a reputation as a maverick during his 14 years in
the Senate and has reinforced that image during the campaign. He
has told Iowa corn farmers he wants no part of their wasteful
ethanol subsidy. He has flouted common political wisdom by
suggesting that America's senseless economic sanctions against Cuba
might be lessened if Fidel Castro became less repressive. He has
ripped into the free-spending tobacco industry with righteous
vehemence.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks often cut an attractive figure, but many of them turn
out to be ineffective. Their strengths become their weaknesses.
McCain, in his personal dealings, can be impatient and brusque. His
Senate record, however, lends confidence that he can work
effectively in Washington, even though he has been at odds with
Republican leaders in Congress on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Could McCain, as president, secure passage of badly needed
campaign finance reforms? McCain rightly points out that
significant reform already enjoys majority support in both branches
and that the election of a candidate who so clearly embraces reform
would supply a heavy mandate to push the issue over its last
parliamentary hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly McCain could be counted on to change the military
dramatically and for the better, jettisoning new Seawolf
submarines, helicopter carriers, and other high-ticket hardware in
favor of combat readiness and better treatment of the men and women
in uniform. If Congress is allowed to continue funding needless
weaponry, he joked last week, ``we'll have a B-2 bomber in every
schoolyard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain stands apart from the other Republican candidates for his
competence on an array of foreign policy issues ranging from
military strategy in Kosovo to the subtleties of diplomacy between
China and Taiwan to the impact of telecommunications advances on
global markets.
</P>
<P>
   We disagree with McCain on some issues and believe he showed
poor judgment in interceding with government agencies on behalf of
financial backers _ undercutting his own core attack on special
interests. We also would like to see fuller proposals on health
care and education.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, McCain has distinguished himself by running a
campaign that would translate well from the primaries to the
general election. His tax cut proposal, for instance, is deep
enough to please many conservatives but tilted toward relief for
low- and middle-income taxpayers in an overt effort to narrow the
nation's troubling income gap. Many other Republican candidates, by
contrast, are focusing on their party's conservative wing by taking
extreme positions on abortion or tax cuts or by blasting campaign
finance reform as harmful to the party, even though it is popular
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The courage McCain demonstrated in a North Vietnam POW camp has
developed into a fearless independence in the Senate and a bold
presidential campaign. Added to it is a dollop of healthy populism,
raising the hope that McCain might inspire people to shake off
their alienation and participate.
</P>
<P>
   Risk inevitably accompanies mavericks like McCain. But the
Republican Party would be well served with a nominee who carries a
whisper of Harry Truman about him, a candidate who speaks his mind
boldly and is willing to suffer the consequences _ and reap the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is an underdog on the national scene. But we would like
to see more of him, and we hope New Hampshire voters will give him
a chance to fight on another day. The Globe endorses McCain for the
Republican presidential nomination in the primary on Feb. 1.

FOR THE DEMOCRATS: GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is freighted with the burden of Bill
Clinton, who, although still popular, has come to stand for a
tainted administration. Many voters in New Hampshire may feel that
it is time to turn the page, but the sins of the president should
not be visited upon his deputy, and this newspaper believes that it
is possible to turn the page without throwing away the book.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably no vice president in history has come before the
electorate better prepared for the job. Al Gore has been a player
in many of the foreign policy decisions that have faced this
country in the last year. The Globe has criticized some of these
decisions and praised others, but there is no doubt that Gore is
the most competent among the Democrats to lead the country in a
complicated world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore understands the need for free trade, which too many of his
fellow Democrats do not, and he understands the implications of new
technologies on the world economy _ even if he didn't invent them
all. His ``new security agenda'' emphasizing foreign policy,
macro-economics, the environment, and education reveals a profound
understanding of the world's interconnectedness. He can achieve a
proper balance between human rights and national interests in this
country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his rival for the nomination had remarkably similar
voting records when they were in the US Senate, but one important
exception stands out. Gore was in the minority of his party to vote
in favor of rolling back Saddam Hussein's aggression against
Kuwait. He understands when to apply American power abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign has been stronger in pragmatism than soaring
ideals, but that is because he has had to deal in the real world
and knows what can be accomplished and what cannot. He has a sense
of what things cost and is the better equipped to maintain the
unprecedented economic good times that this country has enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led the way toward streamlining and reinventing government
and bringing his party toward the political center. The present
administration taught Democrats that responsible stewardship of a
trillion-dollar federal government can be both progressive and
stimulative, ending a period of debt accumulation that suppressed
growth and incomes alike.
</P>
<P>
   With vision and discipline this country can responsibly move
beyond the Clinton administration to make major progress in
addressing a crowded agenda topped by too much poverty and an
endangered Social Security system, inconsistent health care,
inadequate education, and a fragile natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's insistence on a $374 billion investment in a Medicare
system that might otherwise be bankrupt in 10 years shows that he
understands that every dollar used to shore up the system today is
a dollar that does not have to come out of existing benefits
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an era of surpluses, but they may not last forever.
By setting priorities, Gore hopes for the best but prepares for
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is the Globe's choice for the Democratic nomination for
president of the United States in the New Hampshire primary on Feb.
1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Zeljko Raznatovic, a notorious Serbian
paramilitary leader known as Arkan who was wanted on war crimes
charges in the Bosnian and Croatian wars, was shot and killed
Saturday in the lobby of the Intercontinental Hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was shot in the left eye by gunmen at about 5:15 p.m.
and was immediately taken to Belgrade's main emergency hospital,
where he was pronounced dead at about 6:40 p.m., reported Studio B,
the Belgrade television station.
</P>
<P>
   A witness at the Intercontinental, where blood still spattered
the entrance way an hour after the shooting, said a bodyguard,
whose name was reported to be Momcilo Mandic, known as Manda, had
also been killed. Other reports said an unidentified woman was
wounded. She was believed to be Lidija Velickovic, the sister of
Raznatovic's wife, Svetlana, a famous Serbian folk singer known as
Ceca.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified gunmen, described by the state news agency
Tanjug as masked assailants who used automatic weapons, apparently
escaped, although the police arrived quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was said to be accompanied by his wife and their
two children, who were not reported to have been hurt. The attack
bore the hallmarks of political assassinations here, which have
been carried out in gangland style.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic's paramilitary group, called the Tigers, took part in
the brutal three-month siege of the Croatian city of Vukovar in
1991 and helped the Bosnian Serbs overrun northern and eastern
Bosnia a year later, where he was one of the pioneers of the
killing and violent expulsion of rival ethnic groups, a practice
that came to be known as ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   He was secretly indicted in 1997 by the international war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, accused of crimes against
humanity in both Bosnia and Croatia. But his indictment was made
public by the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, only during
NATO's bombing war against Yugoslavia, which began last March.
</P>
<P>
   He was thought to be dangerous to President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia and other key members of the government because of
what he knew about the killings and atrocities of the war in
Bosnia. The Hague tribunal was said to be negotiating with
Raznatovic to get him to turn himself in and testify against
others, but Raznatovic regularly denied those reports.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate speculation here was that Milosevic, who has
already been indicted by the tribunal for war crimes during the
Kosovo war, and his government would benefit most from the killing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the very few occasions at which Milosevic and Raznatovic
were ever seen together was the 1997 funeral of Radovan Stojicic, a
former deputy chief of Serbian police whose name was linked to
atrocities during the Croatian war and who was gunned down in a
Belgrade restaurant. His killers have never been found.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was said by friends to have been worried about his
safety in the last few months, said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of
the opposition Democratic Party, who had contacts with him.
Milosevic was particularly irked by Raznatovic's support of the
Montenegrin President, Milo Djukanovic, after the Montenegrin
turned against Milosevic in 1997, Djindjic said in an interview
Saturday evening. At the same time, Djindjic said, Raznatovic kept
strong contacts with the Yugoslav and Serbian security services on
whose orders he is said in the past to have carried out
assassinations in western Europe of exiles viewed as enemies of the
Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was also wanted by the international police body
Interpol in connection with bank robberies across western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play a major role in last year's Kosovo war, though
some of his paramilitary Tigers were engaged in the forced
expulsion and killing of ethnic Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said Raznatovic had been strongly urged to go to Kosovo
by authorities in the Milosevic government. In fact, Raznatovic
spent much of the war in the Hyatt Hotel in Belgrade, where many
foreign journalists were also staying, and which was perceived as a
place NATO would not bomb. As an English-speaker, he was sometimes
interviewed by CNN and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said Raznatovic had told him that in late 1996,
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic, offered Raznatovic and his men
money to break up pro-democracy demonstrations in Belgrade.
Raznatovic told Djindjic that he had refused.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo war, Djindjic said, Raznatovic kept him
informed about threats to his life, one reason Djindjic left
Belgrade then to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was one of the last of the criminal and paramilitary
leaders closely involved with both state security and the wars in
Bosnia and Croatia. Last month, Zoran Sijan, a mafia leader and a
man with experiences similar to Raznatovic's, was killed, Djindjic
said.
</P>
<P>
   The last such figure still alive is Ljubisa Buha, known as Cume,
who is based in Belgrade, Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic dabbled in politics in 1992-93, and was also involved
in business, both open and criminal, reaping what was thought to
have been a considerable fortune through his control of gasoline
smuggling and illegal sales during the international sanctions
imposed on Yugoslavia during the war years. He had been a
well-known soccer fan, leading the club of the fans of the famous
Red Star soccer team. Later, he bought his own soccer club,
Belgrade Obilic.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic was a shrewd, intelligent and criminal personality,
Djindjic said, adding, ``He was baby-faced but very dangerous,
without moral scruples and a kind of beast.''

<P>
   Given what the candidates have left unsaid about foreign policy
and security issues, the presidential campaigns thus far might seem
to reflect a nation unconcerned with threats from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxical as it might seem, however, America's extraordinary
prosperity and its status as the sole surviving superpower combine
to make the international challenges awaiting the next president
more central than they appeared in 1992. Back then, just after the
implosion of the Soviet Union and the ejection of Saddam Hussein's
forces from Kuwait, President George Bush was defeated by Bill
Clinton, who suggested that he was more attuned to domestic
anxieties induced by corporate downsizing, budget deficits, and a
recession that was already ending.
</P>
<P>
   Today the candidates are debating the cost of health care, their
belief in God, the future of Social Security, and how to spend
budget surpluses that were unimaginable in the 1992 campaign. These
are arguments about choices only a prosperous people have the
luxury of debating. Very little has been heard about the country's
vulnerabilities: looming threats to national security; the wisdom
of commitments to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions; the
prospect of destabilizing conflicts in strategically important
areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom among political consultants is that
there are no votes in abstruse foreign policy matters. When the
next president takes office next January, however, his most fateful
decisions are likely to be about distant parts of the world such as
Russia, China, and Iraq. If foreign and security policies have not
been highlighted in the presidential debates, they ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   The voters are entitled to know how the candidates propose to
balance America's interest in dismantling Russia's nuclear arsenal
against American feelings of revulsion at the Kremlin's slaughter
of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been properly attentive to the
danger of loose nukes in Russia and other states of the former
Soviet Union. There are programs with bipartisan support for
dismantling Soviet warheads and finding employment for weapons
scientists who might otherwise accept contracts to work in Iraq or
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates from both parties ought to be discussing whether
Washington has done enough to preempt the proliferation of a
nuclear capability and long-range ballistic missiles to Baghdad or
Tehran. There should also be debate about the tone and content of
the administration's relations with what Russians call the party of
power in Moscow. Was the enlargement of NATO wise or foolish?
Should the next president take steps to prove to Moscow that NATO's
bombing of Serbia does not presage a new Western attempt to contain
or humiliate Russia?
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have also produced a regrettable silence on the
subject of the nuclear tests conducted last year by India and
Pakistan. These hostile neighbors on the Asian subcontinent have
ushered in an era of nuclear anxiety. For both technical and
psychological reasons, they are more likely to launch their nuclear
missiles than were the Soviet and American superpower rivals.
</P>
<P>
   A closely related question the candidates should answer is what
their approach will be to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, which the Senate refused to ratify this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The voters also deserve to hear the candidates' views on the
feasibility and wisdom of a national missile defense. And those
candidates who want to deploy antimissile systems ought to explain
how they intend to win the Russians over to a revision of the 1972
ABM Treaty limiting such defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most immediate security issue that will face the
next president is what to do about Saddam Hussein's regime, which
has had more than a year to rebuild its chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Does it still make sense to impose sanctions on
Iraqis while allowing Saddam to keep out weapons inspectors?
</P>
<P>
   There are similarly important questions to be answered about
North Korea's nuclear programs and its export of long-range
missiles. And the candidates should say what price they think
Washington should be willing to pay for a peace treaty between
Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   If the candidates do not begin talking about the world beyond
America's borders, one of them will take office a year from now
with a blank check for existential decisions. When such electoral
distortions occur in Russia, Americans see them as symptoms of a
dysfunctional democracy.

KING'S FARSIGHTED VISION

<P>
   In 1967, Martin Luther King was talking about technology. He saw
the ``worldwide neighborhood . . . brought into being largely as a
result of the modern scientific and technological revolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he were speaking for listeners in the year 2000, King
offered this wise advise: Bridge the gap between scientific
progress and moral progress. Injustice, he argued, should have no
place in a world of jets, astronauts, and life-prolonging medical
advances.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community,''
King wrote: ``Nothing could be more tragic than for men to live in
these revolutionary times and fail to achieve the new attitudes and
the new mental outlooks that the new situation demands.''
</P>
<P>
   King lamented what he saw: industry and government ``woven into
an intricate computerized mechanism'' that ``leaves the person
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   These thoughts point toward goals _ as-yet unreached pinnacles _
where the best human values and the best human technology would
converge. At such heights, better cars and washing machines would
be mere byproducts. The most celebrated technology would embody
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways this revolution has begun. Even the language of
desktop and laptop computers extols individual, human-scale access
to the wired world. The genome project puts technology's machines
on a microbiological journey of exploration to map human DNA. And
good old e-mail is a simple but dynamic step toward the global chat
_ with both the neighbors down the street and the ones across the
ocean _ that could help lead to the global triumph of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Society, however, is still in a footrace, running hard so its
lagging values can catch up with the whirlwind pace of its gadgets.
In honor of King's birthday, this race ought to be joyfully run. As
serious as it is, the work of spreading just ideas amid
technological abundance should also be inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   The tally of failed moral progress is saddening. But the change
we have made is a beacon of the change we are capable of making.

HORNETS PLAYERS PATIENTLY MADE DECISION NOT TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association and its players were faced
with a quandary last week: deciding when it is proper to play a
game in the wake of misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of Bobby Phills' grieving teammates and the
players union, the NBA eventually postponed Friday night's game
between the Hornets and Knicks in Charlotte, N.C. Released of the
burden to play that night, players and other employees of both
teams were able to attend an afternoon memorial for the Hornets
guard, who was killed in a car accident on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, arriving at that decision was agonizing for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any guidebooks for this kind of thing,'' Russ
Granik, the league's deputy commissioner, said. ``Reactions to
tragedies like this become intensely personal. We just tried to do
what was right. Hopefully, we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond obvious problems in rescheduling _ the league had already
postponed Charlotte's home game against Chicago on Wednesday night
_ the union and the league weighed the request of Phills' grieving
widow to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 10 p.m. Thursday that the game was postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with members of the clergy and counselors, Hornets
players voted as a team on Thursday morning to honor the request of
Kendall Phills, Phills' widow, who urged them to play ``because
that's what Bobby would want.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials went so far as to research similar cases
involving the death of athletes during a season. They found that
the Yankees had played a day and a half after Thurman Munson died
in a plane crash in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years ago, the Philadelphia Flyers played their next
game five days after goalie Pelle Lindbergh was killed in a car
accident.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those deaths, Phills' teammates were on the scene
moments after he was killed, less than a mile from the Charlotte
Coliseum after a morning practice. Baron Davis, whose vehicle was
positioned behind Phills' and David Wesley's cars before they
accelerated when the stop light turned green, ran to Phills'
mangled car to look in and check on his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a call sometime in the early part of the afternoon on
Thursday, and that's when Elden indicated he was starting to
legitimately worry about what they all knew would be an emotional
ceremony,'' Granik said, referring to Hornets center Elden
Campbell, who was conveying the wishes of his teammates via a
conference call with Granik; commissioner David Stern; the union
president, Patrick Ewing, and the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had indicated to him that it was very difficult to postpone
games,'' Granik said. At some point, Granik said he and Rod Thorn,
the senior vice president of basketball operations, told Campbell,
``We owe it to our fans not to hold this off beyond today.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik was sympathetic to the players' concerns during that 4
p.m. conference call, union officials said. But a decision had to
be made in the next few hours to prevent a logistics nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and the Hornets were facing their own anguish. The team
did not want to postpone the game until Campbell talked to Kendall
Phills. He had no luck reaching her for the next six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter stayed in contact with Campbell, telephoning him each
hour. Finally, with the league offices closed and no announcement
made, the union released a statement from Hunter recommending that
the game be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Granik learned about the recommendation via a reporter's phone
call to his home at 9:15 p.m. The release mentioned the sensitivity
displayed by the NBA, but Granik was privately miffed that the
union seemed to be putting public pressure on the league to
postpone the game when the two sides had been working in concert
all day long.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., he had spoken again to Campbell and decided to
postpone the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much doubt that we did the best thing,'' Granik
said late Friday afternoon. ``The memorial service just ended. The
idea of having a game tonight would have been somehow wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Bulls guard B.J. Armstrong, a friend and former
teammate of Phills, said: ``I don't think there's a right and wrong
way in how you handle that. You do what you believe is right and
hope it works out.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say when is OK to play, I can't answer that. But you need
time to heal. Those people close to the situation, they needed more
time than they probably first realized.'' &QL;

FALK-JORDAN ONE-TO-ONE  
 WEIGHING THE EFECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; FALK-JORDAN ONE-TO-ONE  &LR;  David Falk is the man responsible for, in
his own words, ``projecting and protecting'' the image of Michael
Jordan for much of the last two decades. He has earned a reputation
as the league's most feared agent.
</P>
<P>
   The label is primarily based on his clientele, which includes
more than a dozen of the game's top players, and his negotiating
savvy. Falk is fond of telling team owners and general managers
during the crucible of contract dealings, ``Don't forget to protect
your investment.''
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when Falk's greatest investment, Jordan, stares
him down at the other end of the bargaining table? With Jordan
nearing completion of a part ownership stake in the Washington
Wizards, he may oversee all basketball operations and eventually
have to do battle with Falk over player contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Although David Stern would never admit it, the notion of the
relationship between Falk and Jordan disintegrating over the next
few years is a tantalizing proposition for the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In Stern's world, Jordan would finally understand how dangerous
Falk is to the game. He would see firsthand the agent's meddlesome
ways in tearing apart franchises by leveraging his clients.
</P>
<P>
   In Falk's world, Jordan, the owner and general manager, would be
viewed as one of the few people who understand the dynamics of
superstar athletes and how they need to be compensated by their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   With Jordan's basketball knowledge and Falk's clientele, they
could work together in creating a dynasty, usurp more of Stern's
power and make the commissioner yearn for the days of competitive
balance.
</P>
<P>
   Let the tug of war over the game's pre-eminent figure begin.
</P>
<P>
   Given the mammoth egos involved, it is tough to root for either
Falk or Stern at times. After all, for those who missed Falk's
special holiday greeting on his work voice mail, here goes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, this is David. With the holiday season upon us, the
words of the immortal Bing Crosby ring in my ears: I'm dreaming of
a White Christmas, just like the ones I used to know. Where the
treetops glisten, and the owners listen to the salaries continuing
to grow. I'm dreaming of a White Christmas, with every $100 million
contract I write. May your days be merry and bright and may the
clients always be right.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WEIGHING THE EFFECT  &LR;  The Hornets entered this season with a
legitimate chance at contending for the Eastern Conference title.
Coach Paul Silas did not have the most talented team in the
conference, but the offensive firepower and depth was, and still
is, undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is much too early to discount their chances in a
conference without a dominant team, the death of Bobby Phills last
week could have major repercussions for Charlotte's success the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   More than a reserve, Phills was their leader, the co-captain who
approached Silas earlier this season and said he did not mind going
to the bench if it meant Derrick Coleman and Anthony Mason could
both start.
</P>
<P>
   In the mold of a Michael Curry in Detroit, P.J. Brown in Miami
or Charles Oakley in Toronto, he meant more than his modest
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the accident in which he was killed involved the
team's starting point guard, David Wesley, who was believed to have
been drag-racing with his best friend on the team when Phills lost
control of his Porsche and skidded into oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department who
spoke on condition of anonymity said Wesley may be facing a number
of charges like speeding, reckless driving, spontaneous speed
competition, the legal term for drag racing, and the more serious
charges of misdemeanor death by vehicle and involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the second this season involving Hornets
players. In October, the reserve guard Eldridge Recasner was left
with a broken shoulder and partly collapsed lung after an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Coleman, driving the sport utility vehicle in which
Recasner was a passenger, was arrested on a drunken-driving charge.
A woman in the vehicle was hurt in the collision with a
tractor-trailer. Recasner remains on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Coleman and Kenny Anderson were two of the most
promising young players in the league on an up-and-coming team.
That summer, after the Nets' first playoff success in nearly a
decade, Drazen Petrovic _ an easygoing guy from Croatia whom
teammates liked and admired and also one of the game's top
perimeter threats _ was killed in a car accident in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   On and off the court, the reverberations of his death lingered
for years in the Meadowlands. You only hope the Hornets can recover
more quickly than the Nets. &QL;

DOWNHILL IN THE CAUCASUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Russia's siege of the Chechen capital, Grozny, lurches on
under Boris Yeltsin's successor, Vladimir Putin, two nasty
prospects loom, one conceded by Russian officials and the other
veiled in denial. What Russian authorities admit is that even after
they take Grozny, they will have to go on fighting Chechen
resisters in the southern highlands for months or years.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous is the likelihood that the Kremlin's
politically useful war on the Chechens will set off a conflagration
in the Caucasus, both within the Russian Federation and in the
independent nations of Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The region is already racked by actual and potential conflicts
among ethnic groups living within borders drawn in the Bolshevik
era to suppress or punish national minorities desiring independence
or autonomy. There are also profound grievances among peoples
deported en masse by Stalin in 1944 as ``criminal nations.'' Nearly
all Chechens were shipped to harsh settings in Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan then, and those who survived the ordeal were permitted
to return only in 1957. But the Ingush, the Karachai, the Balkars,
and Meskhetian Turks suffered a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Upon their return, these ``rehabilitated'' peoples found
themselves living under the domination of others. They have been
striving to secede from districts, oblasts, or countries, and the
Kremlin's second savage war against Chechnya is almost certain to
teach a terrible lesson: that radicalism and armed struggle are the
only possible means to achieve their disparate ends.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the destabilizing effect of Chechen refugee flows
into neighboring Ingushetia, Dagestan, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Most dangerous of all are foreshadowings of the Kremlin's
readiness to make Georgia and Azerbaijan the next targets of a
drive to revive Moscow's dominance in what Russians call ``the near
abroad.'' The Kremlin has used the excuse of war in Chechnya to
demand a Russian troop presence in both countries. This fire should
be put out before it spreads any further.

 &HT;    Judge's office still waiting for government to deliver Davidian
documents
 &HT;    By Cindy Van Auken
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Government officials had not delivered documents
in connection with the surviving Branch Davidians' wrongful-death
lawsuit against the government as of mid-afternoon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for Branch Davidian attorney Mike Caddell said
none of the files had been received Saturday and that Caddell
expected to receive them next week. Caddell could not be reached
Saturday afternoon because he left the office to attend a family
outing.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to produce the documents by the end of the day would
violate a federal judge's ruling which set the delivery deadline
for Saturday. However, a source from The Associated Press said
Caddell told her that Tuesday would be considered the unofficial
deadline since the date fell on the Saturday of a holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell reportedly said U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr.
had not realized the deadline was on a Saturday and thus there was
an unofficial agreement making Tuesday the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose office is in Waco, denied a request from the
Justice Department on Thursday to push the deadline back to Jan.
31. The motion, which was nearly 30 pages long, included affidavits
from record-keepers at the FBI, ATF and the Department of Defense.
It said ``competing interests'' would probably keep the government
from meeting the Saturday deadline. Justice Department attorneys
are producing documents for the court, Congress and the Office of
the Special Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked Smith earlier in the week to fine the government
$50,000 for its tardiness in producing the documents, saying he had
never had this much difficulty getting things done in a timely
manner in his 20-year law career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been told by people within the Justice Department that
the person running that particular division thinks this is some
kind of game and takes the attitude that it should all be
hardball,'' Caddell told the Waco Tribune-Herald on Thursday.
``They want to make everything a battle and do everything at the
last minute and delay as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Bradford, U.S. attorney for the Eastern Division of
Texas, denied the government was playing games. He said the large
volume of materials has caused the government to take longer than
anticipated to produce them. More than 30,000 pages of documents,
``numerous'' videotapes, 300 audiotapes, more than 4,600
photographs and 4,000 pages of documents from the FBI laboratory
have been made available to the plaintiffs, according to the
Justice Department motion.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he got a letter Thursday from the government saying
he was being shipped 23,000 pages of documents, with another 50,000
to 100,000 pages to come later.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions for noncompliance were not included in Smith's order,
but Caddell said he thinks Smith will determine appropriate action
after seeing how diligent the government is in producing the
documents. The case is set to go to trial May 15.

GUNMEN KILL PARAMILITARY LEADER WANTED BY WAR TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX TODOROVIC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Masked gunmen Saturday killed the most public face of
Yugoslavia's last violent, gang-ruled decade, Zeljko Raznatovic,
better known as the paramilitary leader Arkan, who was wanted by an
international war crimes tribunal but lived openly in this capital
as an ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic, 47, was slain in a shootout in the lobby of
Belgrade's luxurious Intercontinental Hotel. The two gunmen
escaped, and there was no word of a motive.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what effect his death, if any, would have on the
internationally reviled administration of Milosevic, who has
presided over the disintegration of this Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the evening attack were Raznatovic's associate,
Momcilo Mandic, and another member of his entourage known as Gera.
</P>
<P>
   According to unofficial reports, Raznatovic's sister-in-law
Lidia also was wounded in the gunfight.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the gunmen opened fire on Raznatovic's entourage
shortly after they exited the Intercontinental's restaurant.
Raznatovic was shot three times in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said Raznatovic's death was a natural result
of the lawless society he helped create. ``We are living in a
country where the legal state is not functioning,'' said Vladan
Batic, coordinator of the opposition group Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, assassins have killed Serbia's police
chief and a top official of Yugoslav Left, a party led by
Milosevic's wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign leaders shed few tears for the baby-faced Raznatovic,
who dominated television airwaves last year as Belgrade's de facto
official voice in the early days of NATO's air campaign to push
Milosevic out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkan lived violently, so it is therefore no surprise that he
died violently,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. ``I
regret his death because it prevents us doing justice to the
victims of his atrocities by seeing him in the dock at the Hague
tribunal,'' he added, referring to the war crimes panel.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic's well-scrubbed appearance and polite mannerisms
belied a criminal legend. The father of nine children and husband
of Yugoslavia's top folksinger, Svetlana Velickovic, Raznatovic
robbed numerous banks, escaped from European prisons and headed the
Tigers, considered the most brutal and efficient paramilitary force
during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He was indicted on war crimes charges in Bosnia in September
1997, but the indictment was kept under wraps until the NATO air
campaign in the Balkans began last March. His paramilitary forces
also have been accused of involvement in atrocities during the
Croatian war, which broke out in 1991. His forces sided with Serb
rebels in both wars.
</P>
<P>
   Full details of the charges have not been released, but former
British defense minister George Robertson said last year that
Raznatovic was indicted for the 1991 massacre of 250 men taken from
a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   In an April 1999 NBC interview, he said that his militia, whose
members wore distinctive black uniforms, had ``been under the
command of the Yugoslav Army'' at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic sponsored Raznatovic's brief stint in parliament as a
Kosovo legislator in 1992. The state-run media controlled by the
president lauded his ``heroism'' in Muslim areas. Milosevic
repeatedly rebuffed Western complaints about Raznatovic and once
told Warren Zimmerman, former US ambassador to Yugoslavia, that
``as I understand it, he is no more than a simple sweetshop
owner,'' referring to Raznatovic's ownership of a Belgrade ice
cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   According to a December report by investigators with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Raznatovic's
Tigers militia committed atrocities in Kosovo between last March
and July.
</P>
<P>
   Raznatovic rose to become one of Yugoslavia's wealthiest
individuals. Making his fortune in black market currency trading,
oil smuggling, and arms dealing, he later bought a chain of
bakeries and the Obilic soccer club, which was banned last year
from all international competitions because of his links with war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Raznatovic married Serbia's most famous folksinger,
known popularly as Ceca, with whom he had two children. On Jan. 1,
Ceca released her most recent CD, Ceca 2000. In recent days, she
and Raznatovic appeared on television together promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Raznatovic's enemies is long. Some analysts say that
he recently distanced himself from the Milosevic regime, while
others noted that for years, Raznatovic had remained loyal to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   During NATO's 78-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia last year,
Raznatovic was a fixture at the Hyatt and Intercontinental hotels,
where he enjoyed giving interviews to reporters, and repeatedly
claimed he was not active in Kosovo.

IN COLOMBIA, ALBRIGHT BACKS PLEDGE OF US SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia _ Facing criticism in Washington and abroad
for a $1.6 billion, military-based aid package for Colombia,
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright reassured leaders of this
violence-scarred nation Saturday of Clinton administration support
in two struggles: against drugs and for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's two-day visit to Colombia, the first by an American
secretary of state in 14 years, marked another dramatic shift in US
policy toward Colombia and was meant to promote the assistance
proposal that President Clinton announced last week. The package
must be approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a top US official in Colombia will also be
likely to bolster President Andres Pastrana, whose popularity has
plummeted among citizens tired of a worsening economic situation
and continued violence from drug trafficking and a 40-year-old
civil war that shows few signs of ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test that Colombians themselves must pass,''
Albright said at a news conference with Pastrana just before her
departure for Panama and Mexico. ``But I pledge that the United
States will do all that we could to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid package has been heartily supported by some Republican
members of Congress and Colombian leaders, who say more resources
are needed to stop the production of illegal drugs to the United
States. Some Democrats and human rights officials, however, have
warned that the plan's heavy emphasis on military equipment will
lead to more violence rather than less drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money for the package would pay for 60 US-made
helicopters, increased eradication of coca and poppy fields,
advanced intelligence equipment, and the creation of two more
antidrug battalions, whose members are trained by US personnel. A
smaller portion of funds would be used for crop substitution
programs and rural economic and social projects.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said drug trafficking remains Colombia's greatest
threat. ``More than anything else, it fuels the insurgency, feeds
violence and delinquency, breeds insecurity and fear, and threatens
our democratic institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is concern, even among US officials, that the aid
package could lead to more violence between the government and the
various left- and right-wing rebel groups operating in the country.
Many say the insurgent organizations, the largest being the Marxist
guerrillas known as the FARC, have become more dependent on
proceeds from drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   After several starts and stops during the past year, peace
negotiations between the Pastrana administration and the FARC began
again in October.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the FARC's official reaction to the aid package,
however, has been difficult. On Thursday, a FARC spokesman, Raul
Reyes, said the aid package would make peace negotiations ``more
difficult.'' But on Friday, the group's longtime commander, Manuel
Marulanda Velez, also known as ``Tirofijo,'' spoke publicly for the
first time in months, hinting that peace was now within reach.
</P>
<P>
   General Fernando Tapia Sterling, the commander of Colombia's
military forces, said the aid money from the United States would go
strictly toward antidrug efforts. ``We are going to fight the war
against narcotraffic,'' Tapia said, ``And that includes everyone
who is mixed up in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit created a brief stir throughout this tropical
Caribbean city. National police officers, wearing fatigues and
wielding rifles, stood guard at most Cartagena street corners. The
colonial-era town center, where Albright and most of her aides
stayed, was closed to normal traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, she attended a private dinner with Pastrana and
Nobel laureate author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Albright met with eight prominent Colombian
women in political and civil affairs. She then toured the city's
port facilities, where police have mounted new antidrug strategies
funded largely with US assistance. In a ceremony following the
tour, a marching band played traditional songs known as
``cumbias,'' as Albright danced with a local girl.

GORE GREETS N.H.; A COMIC JABS AT BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, N.H. _ The high ground and the low road met again
Saturday in the Democratic race for president.
</P>
<P>
   With the contest growing more negative as New Hampshire's Feb. 1
primary approaches, Vice President Al Gore took to the stage at
Merrimack High School in Penacook and told the audience that he
respects Bradley and wants to conduct a civil campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep all of our disagreements and differences on the
basis of issues and substance,'' Gore said, repeating his offer to
debate Bradley twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   But moments earlier, liberal comedian Al Franken had warmed up
the exuberant crowd of 500 with some withering observations about
Bradley's lifestyle since he left the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest example of how Gore and Bradley have relied on
surrogates to deliver their harshest messages. On Friday, Nebraska
Senator Bob Kerrey boarded Bradley's campaign bus to lambaste the
Clinton-Gore administration as ``corrupted'' and failure-plagued.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the candidates' detailed policy initiatives have
been replaced by competing potshots _ even as each man says he is
committed to positive campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Gore focused Saturday on race and the Republican Party. Meeting
with a multiracial group at a Nashua home, Gore said the GOP has
been insensitive on racial issues such as the Confederate flag,
hate crime laws, and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for CNN's ``Both Sides with Jesse Jackson''
Saturday, Gore said ``the Republican Party does not have an agenda
that is supported by and helpful to African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   And he toughened his words about GOP front-runner George W.
Bush's refusal to take a position on the flying of the Confederate
flag over South Carolina's State House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is worried about alienating some supporters who he
believes have a different attitude,'' Gore said. Bush has ``ducked
the issue because he is playing to some of his supporters that I
think have some pretty obsolete and even hateful attitudes,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   In the GOP debate Saturday afternoon, Bush did not address the
flag issue, but said the GOP should ``repudiate'' a South Carolina
state senator who had insulted the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore's aides were delighted by the words of Franken,
who lampooned Bradley's claim to have conducted ``a dialogue with
the American people'' while traveling the country as a businessman
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks that a Gore aide urged reporters not to miss, Franken
depicted Bradley as a pampered, overpaid speechgiver cozy with
corporate moguls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fly first class to . . . Vail to do your dialogue with the
American people, which usually involves the head of Merck,''
Franken said. ``Then you go to dinner and sit with the head of
Salomon Brothers or Pfizer, and you continue your dialogue with the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving the Senate, Bradley has earned hundreds of
thousands of dollars giving speeches and acting as a corporate
consultant. But a Bradley spokesman noted that Bradley also taught
a public policy seminar at the University of Notre Dame and
cochaired a coalition pushing for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Al Gore's negative attacks are even dragging Al
Franken down into the gutter,'' said Bradley press aide Kristen
Ludecke.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said there was no contradiction
between Gore's call for a substantive campaign and Franken's
zingers, saying that such humorous attacks should not be taken too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that Al Franken is acting as a comedian and
was acting in his capacity as a comedian,'' Lehane said. ``There's
a pretty clear difference between that and Senator Bradley
attacking us every day this week in a very negative way himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech was interrupted by a group of environmental
protesters, several of whom were ushered from the hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a man was forced from the auditorium by police
after he became violent with audience members and scuffled with
police. Concord police later identified the scuffler as a
49-year-old Laconia man who had legally changed his name to R. U.
Outavit. Police said he was not armed or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Newsweek magazine poll showed that Gore has the support
of 50 percent of New Hampshire voters who plan to vote in the
primary, compared with 34 percent for Bradley. The poll, which
differed from other polls that showed a neck-and-neck race in the
state, has a margin of error of 7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek poll also showed that on the Republican side, John
McCain was supported by 42 percent of voters, compared with Bush's
34 percent.

DRUGS-BORDER-OVERVIEW (Introduction to an eight-day special report)
_ Every day, guerrilla smugglers invade Arizona's southern border
with payloads of pot, coke, meth and smack. The drugs are spread
across the country _ to schoolkids in New York, to stockbrokers in
Phoenix, to farm workers in Seattle. The United States has spent
billions of tax dollars on border checkpoints, undercover agents,
air patrols and money-laundering probes. But the truth is
inescapable: The fight against narcotics, which costs Americans
nearly $18 billion a year, is the nation's most failed police
action since Vietnam. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DRUGS-BORDER-1 (Day 1) _ If America's drug war is not already lost,
it is clearly unwinnable. Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents
who chase pot runners through catclaw canyons west of Naco or the
inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry, using
everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for cocaine and
cash. After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, violence and public cynicism.
By DENNIS WAGNER and PAT FLANNERY. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DRUGS-PATROL-1 (sidebar to Day 1) _ Drug smuggling in the United
States is being squeezed into an ever-smaller corridor, now
centered in Arizona. Illegal immigrants are flooding into the state
through the same corridor, and the smugglers have learned to use
the crowded conditions to their advantage. By PAT FLANNERY. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN _ (Phoenix) This is where 14-year-old Shannon Smith
stood on the night of June 14, 1999. It's in the small backyard of
a red brick home in central Phoenix. Shannon Smith on the
telephone, talking to a friend, when a bullet that had been fired
randomly into the air fell and fell and fell, and struck her on the
head, ending the lives of her parents. By EJ MONTINI. Story will

TV-GOODY (Undated) - Forget the hype, the critical acclaim, the
unreasonable love you have for the show. Despite all that, one
nagging question haunts fans of The Sopranos: Can the second season
possibly be as good as the first? Judging from the first three new
episodes, the answer isn't just ``yes.'' The answer is that it
might be even better. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story will move in the

   In Iowa, Dole Offers Assault on Attacks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Just when it seemed there were enough
Republican candidates battling in the Iowa caucuses, another one
stepped into the fray: Bob Dole. In Saturday's Des Moines Register,
Dole took out a large ad as an ``open letter'' to Iowa Republicans
criticizing, in a thinly disguised way, television commercials for
Steve Forbes that attack Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole should know well. In the 1996 Iowa caucuses, Forbes ran a
series of harsh ads that tarnished Dole's image and, many say,
harmed his candidacy. Now, Dole took it upon himself to say that
the Republican Party, and ``our eventual presidential nominee''
could be hurt by Forbes ads running in Iowa and New Hampshire. In
his ad, Dole criticized ``distorted negative television political
ads'' and said he was speaking up now ``because it may be happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes ad in question is a 30-second television spot in
which the head of a Texas anti-tax group complains that in 1994,
Bush broke a promise when he supported raising the Texas sales tax
in a plan that was not enacted, but that overall, would have
lowered taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Dole also said, ``I accept full responsibility for
our loss in 1996, but anyone who followed that race closely would
agree that the millions of dollars of deceptive and distorted
negative television ads were a major factor in that loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole has not endorsed anyone in the campaign, but says he is a
close friend of Sen. John McCain. Dole's wife, Elizabeth Dole,
recently endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Blackwell, the Forbes campaign's national manager, said
it was ``purely foolish'' to suggest that the 1996 Forbes ads led
to Dole's loss. ``Mr. Dole's vision never took root with the
American public,'' Blackwell said. The Bush campaign, he said, was
just ``whining.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling comment about this back-and-forth was
in Dole's open letter: ``Politics is rough and tumble and all who
enter the arena do so at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Iowa? And Why New Hampshire?
</P>
<P>
   Should Iowa, which holds the nation's first presidential
caucuses, and New Hampshire, which holds the first primaries, be
allowed to dominate the early going in the nominating process?
</P>
<P>
   It's an old question. But once again it is up for consideration,
with Iowans scheduled to caucus only eight days from now and New
Hampshirites set to vote just eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who fare poorly in either or both states could very
well end up dropping out of the race, unable to raise enough money
to continue because they will be perceived as weak. That is what
has happened so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors of this early winnowing system contend that it is
unfair and no way to begin picking the leader of the world's most
powerful nation. They argue that neither state is typically
American, with Iowa being too rural and New Hampshire too small.
</P>
<P>
   Iowans and New Hampshirites do not see it that way, of course.
They say their states are ideal political laboratories because
voters in both states still insist on ``retail politicking'' _
getting to know and test candidates firsthand, at town-meeting
style forums, in coffee shops and, indeed, in their own living
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   To do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, they argue, candidates
must have a ``ground game'' of hand shaking, eye contact and
one-on-one conversations because the ``air game'' of television
sound bites and advertising blitzes so often used elsewhere just
won't cut it in Hawkeye and Granite country.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a lot of political hokum?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to say. But consider:
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, when The Des Moines Register polled Iowans
whom it considered likely to vote in caucuses on Jan. 24, one of
every three said they had met at least one candidate in this
election cycle. More to the point, one in four reported meeting the
candidate of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier survey in New Hampshire found that one of every five
voters had met at least one candidate, and often two, three or
more.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, a voter could probably go close to a lifetime
without meeting a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A Kennedy Stirs The Political Waters
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maryland's lieutenant governor and a
daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, showed up in Des Moines the other
day to campaign for an old political friend, Vice President Al
Gore. And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left town _ this being Iowa and she being a
Kennedy _ there was speculation that maybe, just maybe, she was
testing the presidential waters a bit herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, she told The Des Moines Register, noting that she was
considering running for governor in Maryland and therefore was
``committed to Maryland politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But then she added, ``For a good period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that meant, if anything, it didn't quiet the buzz that
followed her speech.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, proclaimed that ``she has a
legitimate shot to be the first woman president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   And two Democratic legislators in Iowa agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has all the makings,'' said state Rep. Pam Jochum of
Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got that Kennedy flair,'' added state Rep. Polly Bukta of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A Call for Action On Matters of Faith
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the Interfaith Alliance, a five-year-old
national organization of religious leaders and members of some 50
faiths and movements, expressed concern that while White House
hopefuls were increasingly talking about their religious beliefs,
they were nevertheless failing to live up to them on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance urged all the presidential candidates to reject
``degrading, disparaging or demeaning'' personal attacks and to
avoid ``innuendo or stereotyping or references likely to
dehumanize.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after several debates in which White House aspirants
discussed their personal faith at considerable length, comes
another expression of concern about mixing politics and religion.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Industrial Areas Foundation, a national
organization of church-based community action groups that seeks to
improve the wages and living conditions of the poor, is calling on
candidates to back up their professions of faith with concrete
action.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally a few days ago at St. John's Episcopal Church in
Washington, across Lafayette Square from the White House, leaders
of the organization declared that they would follow the candidates
``to New Hampshire, Delaware, the Hamptons and the Texas hill
country, if necessary'' to pressure them to halt ``the rhetoric of
religiosity that permeates the presidential campaign.'' Instead,
the foundation speakers said, candidates should put their professed
faith in action by working nonstop on ``the central public issue of
this period,'' closing the gap between the rich and the poor.

   ``We want a moratorium on the empty religious rhetoric from the
presidential candidates,'' said Bishop John Hurst Adams, the senior
bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. ``We demand that
they address the real faith issue of our time. We will not let this
issue go.''

   A Virginia Democrat Thinks Independent
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Virgil Goode, a Democrat from Virginia's solidly
conservative 5th Congressional District, often breaks party ranks
and votes Republican. In fact, he breaks ranks so often that
Republicans leaders, scrambling to keep their narrow edge in the
House, are pressing him to seek re-election this fall as one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   If he does, and if Republicans hold onto the House, party
leaders have hinted, he would be in line for some congressional
power perks. And if he doesn't, some have hinted darkly that, well,
it now looks like Republicans will be in political command of the
Old Dominion come redistricting time in 2001, and as a Democrat he
just might find himself gerrymandered out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The talk in state political circles is that Goode has about
decided to split things down the middle and run as an independent,
trusting he can keep his seat in the House by pulling conservative
votes from every political direction in the district, which is in
south-central Virginia and is fairly evenly divided between
Democrats and Republicans, with many of the Democrats as
conservative as any Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Then, so the talk goes, if Goode makes it back to Capitol Hill,
he plans to strike a deal with Republican leaders, agreeing to vote
mostly Republican in committees and on the floor in return for some
power perks.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan may or may not work, and there is some talk that if
he wins as an independent he may end up dickering with both
parties. But in any case, it is not a unique plan. Rep. Bernard
Sanders of Vermont, the only independent in the House, worked out
such a deal with House Democratic leaders years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Are Term Limits The Final Answer?
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Tillie Fowler, a Republican from Jacksonville, Fla.,
said last fall that she was thinking about breaking her pledge to
serve only four terms in the House, U.S. Term Limits, the leading
term-limits advocacy organization, began saturating her district
with sharply worded television and radio advertisements accusing
her of political dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago she announced that she would stick by her
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just in case some of her constituents had missed her
announcement and might be left with the impression that she was
just another politically dishonest public servant, she took the
unusual step of running television commercials explaining what she
had done and why.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Term Limits was impressed, and last week it took an unusual
step of its own. It began running advertisements congratulating Ms.
Fowler for doing ``the right thing'' and for being ``a person of
real character.''
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: In the case of Rep. George Nethercutt, a Republican
from Spokane, Wash., who has broken a term limits pledge, U.S. Term
Limits is stepping up its broadcast criticism. Its latest
commercial, a takeoff on the television game show ``Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire,'' goes like this, in part:
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Welcome to `Try to Be a Millionaire.' Name the
Washington state politician who said, `Your word is your bond,' and
then broke his word. Is it Tom Foley, Slade Gorton or George
Nethercutt?''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: ``Well, the politician best known for breaking his
word is George Nethercutt.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
   Contestant: ``Final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``You're right! Nethercutt's the one who broke his
word.''

RANGERS BEAT ISLANDERS, 5-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The longer Petr Nedved's slump continued, the
less other teams felt they needed to go after the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they thought, `Let him sleep,''' Nedved said.
</P>
<P>
   Not now. Nedved has been very much awake since the Rangers
acquired his countryman Radek Dvorak on Dec. 30 and then paired the
two with Jan Hlavac to form a Czech Connection line. Nedved had
better be prepared for a lot more attention, as was evident after
he scored a goal and set up two by Hlavac to lead the Rangers to a
5-2 victory over the Islanders Saturday afternoon before a sell-out
crowd of 16,297 at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nedved accused the Islanders' Steve Webb of
delivering a cheap shot with an elbow in the third period, a charge
Webb denied _ more or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no elbow,'' Webb said. ``He was admiring a pass he
had made. And if he wants to admire his passes, he should look out
where he's going, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedved was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't intimidate me,'' Nedved said. ``But he should be
ashamed of what he did. He's going to say he's a pretty tough guy.
To me, that's not tough. Somebody could get seriously injured like
that. I got a little whiplash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an elbow. I didn't have the puck. And I didn't see him
behind me. Obviously, that was intentional. I think he should get
suspended. That's brutal. And I'm not crying or whining.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our game, until somebody gets seriously hurt, it's OK. But
this is not OK. He should find me clearly when I have the puck. I
don't mind if he gives me a concussion, as long as I have the
puck.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, however, perhaps Nedved should consider the
attention a compliment. At least teams are starting to pay
attention to him again.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable.
</P>
<P>
   In the four games Nedved has centered for his Czech mates, he
has five goals and two assists. In the previous 12 games, Nedved
had gone without a goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since being united, the Czechs have teamed for seven goals and
seven assists and the Rangers have outscored their opponents, 13-8.
Most important, they have won three of the four games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Nedved's line teamed for the purest of hat tricks: an
even-strength goal; a short-handed goal (the Rangers' first this
season, in their 42nd game), and a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac might be the only player in the league who likes Nassau
Coliseum. A second-round draft choice of the Islanders in 1995, he
has scored four of his six goals here this season. His first goal
Saturday came 50 seconds into the game, on the first shot of the
contest _ a wrister from the left circle that beat Islanders goalie
Kevin Weekes, who had been 2-0-1 against the Rangers this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Jorgen Jonsson evened things at 12 minutes 45 seconds,
Nedved scored his 12th goal of the season. It came short-handed off
a brilliant feed from Dvorak, who somehow passed the puck to Nedved
in the slot from the right circle while falling to the ice because
Dave Scatchard had hooked Dvorak from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved then held the puck long enough to fake both Jamie Heward
and Weekes down to the ice, before shooting over Weekes for the
go-ahead goal at 19:08 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Radek's goal,'' Nedved said. ``He made that play
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac made it 3-1 Rangers at 3:42 of the second on the power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Coach John Muckler said the assistant coach Keith Acton
had been having Hlavac practice shooting the last two or three
days. ``He must have shot a thousand pucks,'' Muckler said. ``And
it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac said he did not want to shoot on this occasion, though.
But when the Islanders' penalty killers lagged off him as Hlavac
held the puck in the right circle, he finally shot through traffic.
It beat Weekes through the goalie's five hole.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, even Valery Kamensky and Theo Fleury got into the act.
Kamensky's goal at 5:04 of the second made it 4-1 Rangers and
chased Weekes from the game in favor of Roberto Luongo. The goal
was just Kamensky's second of the season and his first since Oct.
19, snapping a 15-game drought for the 33-year-old left wing, who
has been hampered by a sore right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   After Mats Lindgren cut the lead to 4-2 at 9:49 of the third,
Fleury beat Luongo (who made 15 saves in relief of Weekes) with a
wicked wrister from the left circle on a breakaway at 18:11 to
finish the scoring. For Fleury, it was his first goal since Dec.
29, snapping a drought of five games.

 &HT;    Vision of King legacy blurred by family acting on poor advice,
author says
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Juan Williams, who authored one of the most definitive
accounts of the civil rights era, says the family of Martin Luther
King Jr. should let history rest _ at least when it comes to King's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, author of ``Eyes on the Prize _ America's Civil Rights
Years, 1954-1964,'' spoke Saturday at a King birthday celebration
for Georgia Perimeter College.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent decision in a civil suit filed by the family,
finding the 1968 King assassination was the result of a widespread
conspiracy involving everyone from two-bit hustlers to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have is a jury saying to a family, `If you want to say
there was a conspiracy, go ahead,''' said Williams, a Washington
Post columnist. ``In many ways, they saw that verdict as a
vindication, but in terms of actual evidence, I haven't seen a
scrap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dec. 8 decision by a Memphis, Tenn., jury also concluded
that the late James Earl Ray, who spent the last 30 years of his
life in jail for the murder, was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't find anything that says that James Earl Ray
didn't commit the murder or that he was aided by a large
conspiracy,'' said Williams. He said the King family is not getting
the best advice from outside advisers on the assassination, and
also matters of money and their rights to King's words and works.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting arguments, he said, threaten to tarnish the
family's image _ and King's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is still loved and respected all over the world,
but the problem is they get involved in petty squabbles. It takes
away from King's electrifying legacy,'' said Williams, whose latest
book chronicles the life of Thurgood Marshall. ``Where is the large
vision and passion?'' Williams asked.

TAMPA BAY BEATS WASHINGTON, 14-13  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Trailing by 6 points and facing a third down at
the Washington Redskins' 1-yard line Saturday, Tampa Bay Coach Tony
Dungy did not entrust his season to his Pro Bowl fullback, Mike
Alstott.
</P>
<P>
   An Alstott rush up the middle might have been expected, but
Dungy instead put the playoff game in the hands of his rookie
quarterback, Shaun King, and John Davis, a third-string tight end
who had two catches during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   With 7 minutes 29 seconds remaining in the game, King took the
snap and rolled out to his right. Washington defensive end Ndukwe
Kalu met King there and was soon draped around his waist, but King
jumped and threw to Davis in the right side of the end zone for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The score gave Tampa Bay a 14-13 victory in a game in which it
had trailed by 13 points midway through the third quarter. The
Buccaneers will play in the National Football Conference
championship game next Sunday against either St. Louis or
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   King's dramatics were nearly upstaged by a final Washington
drive, which led the Redskins to line up for a 52-yard field-goal
attempt by Brett Conway with 1:08 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Conway never got to attempt his kick. The snap by Washington's
Dan Turk bounced to the holder Brad Johnson, who scooped up the
ball and tried unsuccessfully to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had moved to the Tampa Bay 40-yard line with an
11-yard completion from Johnson, the Redskin quarterback, to Skip
Hicks on a screen pass. Three plays netted 7 more yards, which
brought Conway onto the field. He had kicked three field goals of
50 or more yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   For King, the first rookie to start a National Football League
playoff game in nine years, the touchdown pass brought a winning
conclusion to an erratic game.
</P>
<P>
   King had played poorly for most of the first three quarters and
completed only 4 of 14 passes for 45 yards in the first half. But
in the second half, he completed 11 of 18 passes for 112 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After a listless first half, which ended with Washington leading
by &QC; 3-0, the Redskins greeted the second half with a sudden and
startling strike as Brian Mitchell returned the kickoff 100 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell stumbled through a pileup of players near the right
sideline before breaking into the open virtually untouched. Martin
Gramatica, Tampa Bay's kicker, made an attempt to tackle Mitchell
at the Redskins' 42-yard line, but Mitchell stiff-armed Gramatica
to the ground and outran the rest of the Buccaneers to give
Washington a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's score was the longest kickoff return in NFL playoff
history. The previous record was a 99-yard return by Desmond Howard
in the 1996 Super Bowl for Green Bay against New England.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the third quarter, after Darrell Green intercepted a
pass by King, the Redskins extended their lead to 13-0 with a
48-yard field goal by Conway.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it looked as if the NFC Central champion
Buccaneers were going to be run out of the playoffs without
scoring, Tampa Bay moved downfield and cut Washington's lead to
13-7 after John Lynch intercepted a pass by Johnson. Alstott scored
on a 2-yard run, a spectacular carry on which he eluded several
tackle attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Alstott was nearly tackled by middle linebacker Derek Smith in
the backfield just after the handoff from King, then was hit by
three Redskins in the middle of the line. Alstott kept his feet as
he backpedaled before dashing to his left and outside the pileup
into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Alstott's touchdown was set up by a pass-interference penalty on
Washington's Leomont Evans at the Redskins' 11. Evans had run over
Warrick Dunn as Dunn awaited a pass from King along the left
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appeared at times in the first half that neither
team would ever break the shutout, the Redskins eventually mounted
a second-quarter scoring drive behind the running of Stephen Davis
and the blocking of left tackle Kipp Vickers.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers was filling in for the usual starter, Andy Heck, who
tore his hamstring in last weekend's playoff victory over Detroit.
Vickers was making only his eighth NFL start in seven seasons, but
on two long runs by Davis, Vickers opened gaping holes while
blocking Tampa Bay's Pro Bowl tackle, Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' drive stalled at the Buccaneers' 10, but Conway's
28-yard field goal gave Washington a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, the Buccaneers were scrambling defensively, and
at times playing without two of their best defenders. Their best
defensive back, Donnie Abraham, had limped off the field with 9:33
left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who tied for the league lead in interceptions with
seven, missed most of practice this past week with a hamstring
strain, then sprained his left knee in Saturday's game. He returned
in the second half, but was clearly hobbled.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp, the Associated Press defensive player of the year, injured
his left leg in the first half. Although he returned to play, he
was limping noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers came into Saturday's game with the league's
third-ranked defense, while the Redskins' defense was ranked 30th.
But for most of the first three quarters, Washington's defense
dominated the game.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the Redskins seemed intent on pressuring
King in the pocket. And King seemed to be hurrying his throws in
the first quarter, as if he were a bit nervous. Washington was
happy to add to King's anxiety by frequently blitzing strong safety
Sam Shade. With Shade in his face, King misfired on four of his
first five passes.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's running game did not do anything in the first half
to relieve the pressure on King as Washington's defensive tackles,
Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson, stuffed the middle of the
line, which is the Buccaneers' usual point of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alstott could not get the Bucs going early _ he was stopped
short on third-and-1 in the first quarter and was held to 4 yards
on his first five rushing carries. Of the Buccaneers' first five
possessions, four lasted for only three plays.

FRONTIERE IS LUCKY LADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the giant figures of the 20th century ranking right up
there with the Einsteins, Salks, Churchills and FDRs, Georgia
Frontiere seems destined to continue her matchless success into the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The trailblazing owner of the St. Louis Rams is on the threshold
of taking her football team into the Super Bowl, reaffirming that
hoariest of axioms that good things inevitably happen to good
people.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the Rams are strong favorites in Las Vegas to make
such an appearance on Jan. 30 in Atlanta, a reflection of the
dazzling leadership of Frontiere, whose discerning personnel eye
has resisted all criticism since she somehow was able to bring to
gaffe Carroll Rosenbloom as her sixth husband.
</P>
<P>
   Before she pulled off that unlikely coup _ she had served as the
married Rosenbloom's mistress for a number of years _ she was just
plain old Georgia Hayes of Fresno, a nightclub singer of
appallingly limited talent who had survived her share of private
grief.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, she hit the lottery with Rosenbloom, then a
multimillionaire businessman who owned the Baltimore Colts and
later would wind up with the Los Angeles Rams.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rhyme or reason for one being bestowed with good
fortune in life. There are those individuals who stumble through
their days under the darkest of clouds. And then there are those
whose footsteps are paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   For much of her early years, Georgia Frontiere wasn't covered
with four leaf clovers. Her choice of men was disastrous. Her music
career was stumbling. And even during her marriage to Rosenbloom,
she wasn't exactly treated like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who attended dinner with the Rosenblooms who
would blanch perceptibly when Carroll would make cruelly derisive
remarks directed at his wife, who would endure such taunts in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   But the instant Rosenbloom took his ill-starred swim into the
Atlantic Ocean on April 1, 1979, the fate of his wife would turn
dramatically around, especially when his will would reveal that she
would inherit 70 percent of the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the advice of the late owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers,
Hugh Culverhouse, Georgia borrowed $10 million from a New York bank
and bought out the remaining 30 percent of the team from
Rosenbloom's five children that included two of her own.
</P>
<P>
   The milk of human kindness, a person of staggering charity and
goodwill, Georgia, obviously, wanted to make sure each Rosenbloom
heir would be well-indemnified for the tragic loss of the family
patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   But the $2 million each would receive turned out to be a mere
pittance, in light of the fact the Ram franchise has increased in
value the past 20 years a staggering 2000 percent, from an
estimated $30 million when Rosenbloom died to more than $600
million at the current time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Georgia would never do harm to anyone, even though
moments after she took over the Rams she reluctantly fired her
stepson, Steve Rosenbloom, who had been designated by his father to
run the team.
</P>
<P>
   And soon after that, Georgia, an avowed astrologer who claimed
the alignment of the stars dictated her actions, cleaned out her
organization, expunging from it such noble individuals as Don
(Duke) Klosterman, Harold (Sqeezer) Guiver and even E. Gregory
Hookstratten.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams would appear in a Super Bowl during her first year as
caretaker _ they would lose a thriller at the Rose Bowl to the
Pittsburgh Steelers _ and they would go on to have some fruitful
seasons in the early coaching tenure of John Robinson when Eric
Dickerson was dispensing his heroics in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Shockingly, Georgia's newest squeeze, Hubby VII, Dominic
Frontiere, got nabbed in a Super Bowl ticket scandal, which
resulted in his winding up in a federal prison. Natch, even though
Georgia owned the team, she claimed to know nothing about her luvvy
dear's shenanigans, and came out of the mess with her reputation
intact.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia in the subsequent years began spending more time in
London vainly seeking the Fountain of Youth, turning control over
her organization to a penny-pinching accountant named John Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams slowly began to unravel _ the watershed moment came in
1987 when Dickerson was peddled to the Indianapolis Colts _ and the
team and Georgia soon became the laughingstocks of professional
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   This sterling lady became a hated figure in these parts, even
being showered with a chorus of angry boos when she made her
traditional appearances on the Ram sidelines. How could such a
kind-hearted person described glowingly in the Ram press guide as
the latest incarnation of Mother Teresa be treated so savagely?
</P>
<P>
   Hurt beyond comprehension, Georgia decided to stay detached from
the Rams during their final years in Orange County, and gave Shaw
the go-ahead to cut a lucrative deal with the politicians of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL-starved city of St. Louis presented Georgia with a new
domed stadium and hefty relocation fees, and she moved the Rams out
of Southern California after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the team continued its ignoble struggles in its new venue,
but Somebody Up There likes Georgia Frontiere and you just knew
this decent woman soon would once again be riding a crest of
success.
</P>
<P>
   As though by divine intervention, the Rams came up with a
storybook quarterback out of nowhere named Kurt Warner to go with a
lot of other talented players that have fashioned a 13-3 season and
are expected to dump the Minnesota Vikings in today's playoff
match.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure Georgia Frontiere will be seen on the Ram
sidelines late in the game bestowing kisses on her minions if her
team is heading for a stirring victory.
</P>
<P>
   And who deserves it more than Georgia Frontiere, a God-fearing
septuagenarian who has lived such an exemplary life?

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The pass fluttered out of Dan Marino's hand
on Miami's first offensive play, like the first rock that slips
down a cliff, portending a landslide. It was easily picked off _
the first of seven Miami turnovers in what became the second-most
lopsided game in National Football League postseason history:
Jacksonville 62, Miami 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars (15-2) scored 38 points before Marino had even
completed a pass, moving into their second American Football
Conference championship game in their first five seasons. The
Dolphins (10-8) were sent reeling into an uncertain off-season in a
humiliating conclusion to an enigmatic season.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blowout in NFL playoff history came in 1940, when
the Chicago Bears overwhelmed the Washington Redskins, 73-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never experienced a game like this in my life, since I
was a kid,'' Marino said after playing perhaps the final game of
his career. He was 11 of 25 for 95 yards, with two interceptions
and one touchdown before being replaced in the third quarter by
Damon Huard. ``Nothing went right for us early and it just
snowballed.''
</P>
<P>
   What an understatement. This was an embarrassment from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson, trailing by 41-7 at halftime, had
wanted to replace Marino to start the second half. Marino had asked
for another chance from Johnson, with whom he has had a fractious
relationship. Johnson gave it to him, then watched, stone faced, as
the Dolphins went three plays and out to start the third quarter.
That was a typical series for the Dolphins, who had hoped to use
the run and their defense to slow the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Miami came out passing _ and then had to pass some
more as their deficit grew. The results were disastrous. On the
first nine times Marino dropped back to pass, he was intercepted
twice, sacked twice, fumbled once, and contributed to two quick
Jacksonville scores, all without completing a single pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing the team, about halfway through the second quarter we
knew we had the game,'' said Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, who
was able to rest his weary and braced knees after little more than
a quarter of work and two touchdowns. ``We were up 38 points and
our defense was playing well. I felt it was ours at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami would have no chance to recover, not with the Jaguars
capitalizing on almost every one of the frequent opportunities the
Dolphins gave them, including a blocked punt. The Jaguars, who will
play the winner of Sunday's Tennessee-Indianapolis game, outgained
the Dolphins by 530 yards to 131 (including 197 yards to minus-1 in
the first quarter), tearing through the Dolphins' defense as if it
had stayed on the field ever since last week's wild-card victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars scored 24 points in the first quarter and eight
touchdowns in all, on everything from a playoff record 90-yard run
on a simple draw play by Fred Taylor (135 yards in just one half of
play) to a 70-yard catch and run by Jimmy Smith (five catches, 136
yards) in concert with backup quarterback Jay Fiedler. Included was
a comical 16-yard fumble return by Tony Brackens after he sacked
Marino in the first quarter, stripped the ball and then received a
few pats on the back from teammates before realizing nobody had
touched him and he could run the ball into the end zone for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars scored with such ease, including three touchdowns in
the second half when the game was well out of reach, that Coach Tom
Coughlin might face a few questions about why the score was so
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we wanted to start fast,'' said Jacksonville offensive
tackle Leon Searcy. ``We wanted to put them in a situation where
they had to play catch-up. When we had a big lead, we had to stay
focused. We knew we had the game won. But we wanted some
carry-over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who have home-field advantage throughout the
playoffs, must wonder how they managed to luck into what amounted
to little more than an intrasquad scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson took the blame for the defeat afterward, saying he had
worked his team too hard in the short week after it had made the
cross-country trip to Seattle and back to win the wild-card game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we would have had a chance to win if we were
fresh,'' he said. ``I tried to prepare them too much. I should have
pulled back after Seattle. Obviously, we were dead-legged.
Unfortunately, we left it on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is the reason for this debacle, the Jaguars finally
proved that they could beat a winning team. Entering the game, the
Jaguars had been ornery, annoyed at reporters and opponents who
suggested that, though they finished the regular season with the
league's best record at 14-2, they were a bit soft because they had
not beaten a team with a winning record all season and that they
had lost both times they faced a winning team _ Tennessee. The
truth is they still don't know how they will perform when they are
in a tight game against a quality opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were certainly not that on Saturday.

A SPARK FOR THE FLAMES

<P>
   Looking for a roster boost, a dash of character on the wing, the
Flames last week called up Chris Clark, ex- of South Windsor,
Conn., and Clarkson, and dropped him into his first NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   Results: 14 shifts, 10 minutes of ice time, a couple of shots _
and, oh, a 2-1 overtime victory over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all pretty exciting,'' said Clark, reached by phone late
last week in Calgary. ``I was in the minors all last year and
didn't get a call, and I wasn't expecting anything this time; I
wondered if this would ever come. I thought I was having a good
season, but it's one of those things, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 22, had 13 goals and 28 points at St. John, Calgary's AHL
affiliate. More important, or more appealing to Calgary management,
he also led the club with 119 penalty minutes, showing the kind of
pluck he displayed during his four years at Clarkson (392 PIMs in
142 games).
</P>
<P>
   One thing we all know is that Flames coach Brian Sutter likes
feistiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys told me, whether I'd want to or not, I'd have
to fight _ because of the kind of game I play,'' said Clark, who
showed in his first Flames camp, in September 1998, that he
wouldn't shy away from the fight game. ``The fights are OK. For the
most part, they're fun. Most of them aren't nearly as bad as they
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark's overall game is to be physical, always on the puck,
doing what he can to frustrate the opposition. He didn't have to
answer the fight bell in his NHL debut, but the Flames were back on
the ice again Saturday night against Toronto. As a kid who grew up
dreaming he could play in the mold of a Cam Neely or a Kevin Dineen
(Whaler fans never die), inevitably he'll have his pugilistic
interludes.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the 77th pick in the '94 draft, was supposed to be in
Rochester, N.Y., this weekend, participating in the AHL's skill
competition (Sunday) and All-Star game (Monday). For now, he's
staying in southern Alberta, his pay bumped from $65,000 to
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, he couldn't be quite as aggressive as he's been in
the pros,'' said Clark's Boston-based agent, Mark Witkin, who also
represents Bruins Don Sweeney and Hal Gill. ``But he's always been
an aggressive, very honest player. No yapping. Just a good,
hard-nosed kid who isn't flashy but has shown what he can do at
every level.''
</P>
<P>
   It's rare in today's game for a rookie, especially an American
college player, to step into the league and fill a character role.
Those jobs still typically go to the quickly-disappearing Canadian
farm kid or the strapping European (hello, Krzysztof Oliwa), eager
and hungry enough to step in and make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fool's work to project Clark now as a budding power
forward, but he has a role and a method in mind, and it's that kind
of foundation that can lead to turning dreams into reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to do what I did in college,'' said Clark, who
was called up ahead of two prized first-round draft picks, Rico
Fata and Daniel Tkaczuk. ``It's the way I've played my whole life:
up and down the wing, bang and crash. If I make it, it's not going
to be on flash.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor unmade
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers last week were shuffling lines again. ``The question
is, what do we do with (Tim) Taylor?'' coach John Muckler told the
New York Daily News. ``Taylor's played really well and he's really
contributed to this club. We've asked him to play against the best
lines and check the best player on the other side, and he's done a
great job of that. I don't know where we would be if he hadn't done
that good of a job.'' The Bruins know that answer. With Taylor in
their lineup last season, they had the No. 1 penalty-killing unit
in the league. This year, they've gone from first to worst . . .
Ex-Bruin Andy Brickley, convinced more than ever that he wants to
get back in a broadcast booth, was back at Channel 38 last week,
compiling a resume tape. Brickley was impressed with the ESPN
telecast Sunday night that had analysts Bill Clement and Darren
Pang handling live questions submitted over the Internet during the
Colorado-Chicago matchup. ``The whole broadcast field, and
especially sports, is such a growth area right now,'' said
Brickley, who stopped by the Vault to see Thursday's Bruins-Leafs
game. ``I think I've got something to offer, and I'm working hard
to get that opportunity again.'' . . . Imagine what Boston's future
would look like with Jason Allison, Joe Thornton, and Keith Primeau
penciled in as the pivots for the better part of the decade . . .
Word around the Senators is that Vaclav Prospal, ordered to have a
refresher course in sensitivity training after his disparaging
remarks directed toward Patrice Brisebois, suddenly is a hot
commodity in the trade market, with Edmonton, Phoenix, Florida, and
Vancouver showing interest. Prior to the Christmas roster freeze,
when Prospal couldn't crack Jacques Martin's lineup, Ottawa
reportedly couldn't give him away. But it's not Prospal's tongue
that has 'em talking. Placed on a line with Daniel Alfredsson and
Shawn McEachern, he had 12 points in 10 games as of late last week
. . . Local player rep Matt Keator, who helped UMass-Lowell
netminder Scott Fankhouser catch on with the Thrashers, has a David
Robinson-like story unfolding in the minors. Andy Lundbohm, a
6-foot-3-inch, 215-pound center at West Point the last four seasons
(168 points), signed a two-way deal with San Jose over the summer
and recently reported to Ted Sator's New Orleans Brass (ECHL) for a
tuneup before heading for the AHL. Lundbohm, with at least another
18 months of Army time to serve, will play for the Kentucky
Thoroughblades while stationed at Fort Knox . . . Ex-Bruins
defenseman/coach/assistant GM Mike Milbury likes the idea here of
leaving the icing rule intact, for both sides, during penalty
situations. ``I'd also be in favor of making the net bigger,'' said
Milbury. ``If you go back and look at film from years ago, the
goalies have much less protection, they all look skinny by
comparison to what we've got today.'' . . . It's possible that
Scotty Bowman's 3-0 loss behind the Detroit bench Tuesday night in
Montreal will be the last game he coaches in his hometown. That's
assuming, of course, that Bowman retires at the end of this season,
which still isn't a fait accompli . . . The Lightning said they
wouldn't give Stephane Richer away, and Thursday they ended up
moving him to St. Louis, in yet another nicely-orchestrated deal by
Tampa Bay GM Rick Dudley. The Blues shipped out ex-Devils
defenseman Chris McAlpine, 28, and 27-year-old netminder Rich
Parent, a seventh-year pro who has seen very limited NHL action.
McAlpine brings immediate depth and experience to a young defensive
corps, while Parent might never be more than a minor leaguer. But
the Lightning were on the hook for another $3 million (through next
season) with Richer, and this move will save them at least $2
million. Now, can Richer rekindle that sniper's touch with fellow
ex-Canadien Pierre Turgeon dishing him the biscuit? It's a
tantalizing thought. Remember, they were Montreal teammates for
only nine games in '96-97, prior to Turgeon getting moved in the
Shayne Corson exchange . . . Ex-Bruin Andy Moog, under contract as
Vancouver's goaltending consultant, is working with Felix Potvin,
who has gone a lackluster 1-4-1 since getting swapped to Vancouver
from the Islanders. Moog was a consultant with Atlanta last year .
. . with Alexei Yashin in their lineup, the Senators had 51 points
in the first half of last season. This year, they had 50 points.
For a guy who wants $8 million or better _ and who snubbed his nose
at the $3.5 million he agreed to play for _ the numbers haven't
exactly gone his way . . . Coach of the Czech Republic squad that
won the recent World Junior title was Jaroslav Holik, father of
Devils center Bobby Holik . . . The Jan. 21 edition of The Hockey
News ranks Boston College defenseman Brooks Orpik the seventh-best
positional player available in the June draft at Calgary. Associate
editor Bob McKenzie also rates Boston University's Rick DiPietro as
the best available goalie . . . Another BC product, Jeff Farkas, is
expected to sign with Toronto at the conclusion of the Eagles'
season and report to St. John's in the AHL. The Leafs made him the
No. 57 pick overall in the '97 draft . . . Ex-Bruin Ken Linseman is
in Ontario this weekend to play in three old-timers' games. ``They
call us the Legends,'' said the 41-year-old Linseman, who now makes
a living in commercial real estate. ``Actually, it's a lot of fun,
especially when they put me out there with Guy Lafleur.'' Linseman
will head to Chile next week to pursue his other longtime passion:
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Tricks of the trade
</P>
<P>
   Only 58 days to go before the NHL's March 14 trading deadline.
By then, the Bruins will have played 69 of their 82 regular-season
games . . . The read here is that the Coyotes have almost no option
but to trade Keith Tkachuk following the failed Primeau-for-Tkachuk
deal. But with the new economics evolving in the league, there
probably isn't a single team out there willing to pay Tkachuk the
$8 million-plus he has coming in 2000-01. If the money cut is that
important to the Desert Dogs, they might be best to deal Tkachuk
for a cheaper talent and agree to pick up a portion of his future
earnings . . . To avoid losing Calle Johansson to free agency last
summer, the Capitals tossed the veteran point man $6.6 million last
week _ an average of $2.1 million for three years, with a $300,000
sweetener this season that amounted to a 20 percent salary bump as
a bonus . . . Word out of Toronto is that Allison's one-year
contract extension with the Bruins will bring him $3.5 million _ a
$900,000 increase over his 1999-2000 wages. Please stop saying
they're cheap on Causeway Street. Allison had the advantage of
choosing arbitration next summer, and Mssrs. Harry Sinden and Mike
O'Connell made the prudent, fiscally-sound decision to pay Allison
right around _ perhaps slightly more than _ what an arbitrator
would dictate . . . Jay Fee, the player rep with Woolf &AMP;
Associates, earlier this season lost a gentlemen's bet with
ex-Bruin Glen Sather, boss of the Oilers. The payoff was a case of
wine. ``An Australian red,'' declared Fee, whose clients include
the Oilers' Mike Grier. ``I couldn't go with the cheap stuff _ I
mean, how would that look, right? The first time I saw Glen after
sending it, he said, `Yeah, I got that wine, and it looked pretty
good, thanks. But I had someone taste it first.' '' . . . It cost
the Leafs only $200,000 to bring Wendel Clark back for a third tour
of duty. Sure, it's short money, but Clark couldn't cut it in a
playoff run with the Wings last season and quickly was bought out
in Chicago this season. Three's either a charm or a waste of
$200,000 _ more likely the latter . . . It appears even the
spend-free Red Wings are looking at the bottom line these days.
Management unexpectedly cut off contract talks with veteran center
Igor Larionov, after narrowing in on a two-year extension. The
front office not long ago agreed to extend Steve Yzerman at $8
million a year, only to see Pat Verbeek walk in for just over $1
million and provide some true pop. With so many vets willing to
work for pennies on the dollar, GMs leaguewide are going to stop
paying premiums to older unrestricted free agents. Larionov, making
$1.7 million this season, is a special person and a special talent,
but he also turned 39 last month. Chances are, the front office,
referring to ``payroll concerns,'' figured they were about to pay
him two or three times what he could get on the open market (maybe
$1 million, plus incentives) and decided to close the checkbook . .
. Prior to returning Thursday night, ex-Bruin Garry Galley had been
out of the LA lineup since Dec. 18, recovering from his fifth
career concussion. The Kings probably won't have him back next
year, which means the 36-year-old blue liner likely will return to
suburban Ottawa and retire. He and ex-Bruin Dave Ellett recently
sold the sports bar they co-owned in Almonte, Ontario . . . The
Thrashers, here Monday afternoon, last month added Nigerian-born
Rumun Ndur to their backline. Originally a Sabres pick (No. 69,
'94), Ndur was claimed off waivers by the Rangers last season, only
to be picked off again by the Thrashers on Dec. 11 . . . Thrashers
GM Don Waddell on Dean Sylvester, the ex-BC High winger from Hanson
who popped in a hat trick shortly after arriving in Atlanta this
season: ``Dean's fine. His scoring has tailed off a little, but
I've told him to relax about that. He's a goal scorer, and that
will come. If you start beating yourself up when the puck's not
going in, it can drive you crazy.'' Headed into weekend play,
Sylvester had 10 goals and 17 points . . . Joe Sakic, finishing out
his three-year, $21 million deal in Colorado, misses unrestricted
free agency by only six days this summer (he's 31 on July 7). He's
looking for a long-term, no-trade deal from the Avalanche. Don't be
surprised if he gets wheeled, possibly to Vancouver, where he would
be a perfect fit to improve the Canucks and also groom Swedish
twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin . . . Bruins coach Pat Burns, to the
Toronto Sun last week: ``One day it will happen to (Montreal coach)
Alain Vigneault and even to (Toronto coach) Pat Quinn. The clock
starts ticking backwards on a coach from the moment you take a
job.''

A WARNING TO RAMS FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin ital)``The Rams'll slaughter 'em.'' -- A Southern
California talk-radio caller this week(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   To that guy I'd like to say: You're not from around here, are
you? Either that or you're a fresh-faced youngster, innocent in the
ways of the Rams and the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   You say the Rams will beat the Vikings in the NFL playoffs?
Right, and Tony Soprano is planning a big Mother's Day party.
</P>
<P>
   I write this not as a Vikings fan. I write this as someone who
grew up a Rams fan in the days when the Rams belonged to Los
Angeles -- except in the postseason, when the Vikings absolutely
owned them.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the Dodgers were tortured by the Yankees, the
Lakers by the Celtics, the Kings by, well, everybody. And the Rams
had the Vikings. The damned Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' collision with the Vikings in an NFC division playoff
game today, even though it's taking place at the Trans World Dome
in St. Louis, brings home a million memories, all bad.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)St. Louis 7 Minnesota.'' -- Point spread favoring
the Rams(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if they're playing in a dome. Check the Weather
Channel before you bet. Where the Vikings are involved, it always
rains on the Rams. Unless it snows. Four times from 1969 to 1977
the Rams met the Vikings in the playoffs. Twice a Rams victory
would have sent them directly to the Super Bowl. Two different Rams
coaches, George Allen and Chuck Knox, led the team into those
games. Two owners, Dan Reeves and Carroll Rosenbloom. Three
quarterbacks, Roman Gabriel, James Harris and Pat Haden.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents changed, too. The Rams faced three Vikings
quarterbacks, Joe Kapp, Fran Tarkenton and Bob Lee. It didn't
matter. By the time the Vikings won their fourth consecutive
playoff meeting with the Rams, the phenomenon was openly referred
to as a jinx.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)``Speed Pulls Rams Away from Vikes'' -- Prediction
in a national newspaper this week(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   OK, the Rams are playing at home, and they're heavily favored.
Sounds l ike Minnesota has them right where it wants them. The
Vikings ``jinx'' reached its painful peak in a 1977 NFC divisional
playoff game. The Rams were 9 1/2-point favorites. They'd beaten
Tarkenton and the Vikings 35-3 in the regular season. Now Tarkenton
was injured and Lee was starting. The Rams were finally getting
them in the Coliseum, where it would be warm and dry. ``This Time
It's Advantage Rams,'' a headline declared.
</P>
<P>
   Right. It rained and the Coliseum grass turned to mud. The
Vikings took an early 7-0 lead on a short Chuck Foreman run.
Lawrence McCutcheon matched Foreman with a 100-yard day but Haden
had passes intercepted by Nate Allen and Paul Krause. It was 14-0
Vikings until the final minute. Then Haden threw a touchdown pass
to Harold Jackson and the Rams recovered an onside kick. Then Had
en threw his third interception of the day to Jeff Wright to end
any hope of a miracle. (begin ital)``Do the Vikings wear
lavendar?'' -- A talk-radio host this week, suggesting the Vikings
wear a less manly shade of purple these days(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   If memory serves, the purple found a hundred ways to win, and a
hundred guys to play hero. They came from 17-7 behind in 1969 to
win 23-20 when Kapp passed and carried them 65 yards to a go-ahead
touchdown in the fourth quarter at Bloomington. Carl Eller tackled
Gabriel in the end zone for the game-clinching safety.
</P>
<P>
   They used defense -- a Wally Hilgenberg interception in the end
zone, a Wright tackle at the Minnesota two after a 73-yard Harris
pass and Harold Jackson run -- to hold on 14-10 at Bloomington in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   They let the Rams figure out a way to lose 24-13 in 1976 on a
12-degrees-below day in Bloomington. The game was scoreless when
the Rams moved within the cold shadow of th e Vikings' end zone. On
second down, they ran a flanker reverse and Ron Jessie ruled down
short of the goal line. On third down, Haden tried to sneak for the
touchdown, but was the officials said he was stopped before his
second effort put the ball over the line. On fourth down from 6
inches, Knox sent in Tom Dempsey to try a gimme field goal. The
kick was blocked, the ball took an easy hop to Bobby Bryant, and he
ran it 90 yards for a touchdown. The Rams forever contended that
replays showed Jessie and Haden (begin ital)both(end ital) scored.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)``Rams 27, Vikings 17.'' -- Prediction in a Chicago
newspaper this week(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I know, times change, teams change. None of those '70s Vikings
and Rams are playing today. The Vikings have moved to a dome. The
Rams have moved to the Midwest. Nevertheless: If you were a Rams
fan back then -- even if you're not a Rams fan anymore -- you
cringe at the thought of a Rams-Vikings playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   I know, too, that those Rams did finally beat the Vikings. It
happened in 1978, when the Vikings were showing their age. Tied at
halftime, the Rams broke the game open with a Jessie touchdown --
this time it counted -- and won 34-10. At least I think I know
this. It was in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I believe the Rams beat the Vikings in the playoffs
because I didn't see it. When it finally happened, the game at the
Coliseum wasn't sold out, so it wasn't on local television. &QL;

COACHES GET CAPSIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are the Patriots on the cutting edge of football marketing for
the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   Think of how beautifully they've created free publicity for
themselves in this Bill Belichick situation. Firing the coach or
creating a coaching controversy is becoming one of the great
marketing tools for the NFL. That's because you can't fire the
player anymore. Salary caps have made that almost impossible
because signing bonuses are pro-rated over the number of years of a
contract, so if you get rid of a player with a substantial number
of years remaining, you're charged with his salary cap number even
if he's not with you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   If you fire the coach, you just pay him off, nothing's charged
to your cap and, well, you create media interest.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, newspapers, talk shows, and TV outlets were
abuzz when Bill Parcells staged his departure from New England.
After the Super Bowl loss to the Packers, the story created huge
interest in the Patriots because Parcells had left to go to the
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the masses wanted Pete Carroll out as coach.
What did Kraft do? He fired Carroll, then almost simultaneously
(this was a closer call than the Tennessee lateral) faxed a request
to interview Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   It has been in the papers and on talk radio for two weeks. This
is free and valuable advertising for the Patriots, at a time when
they need to sell luxury boxes and those expensive club seats for
the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Some will say, why don't they just let the Parcells-Jets
controversy go? Why not let it die?
</P>
<P>
   Why would they? This is a bonanza for the Patriots. Go out and
get Belichick, Tuna's Helper, and hope Parcells coaches again,
which would keep the New England-New York intrigue hot. People
would be very interested in the Patriots and the little soap opera
that plays out twice a year when the teams meet.
</P>
<P>
   It's great for the team. Great for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It obviously stinks for Carroll, who is sitting home in Medfield
without a job, but Kraft will take care of him, too, paying him for
the two years left on his contract while probably urging some of
his owner friends to hire Carroll so they can pay all or part of
the remaining salary.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, whatever the Patriots have to pay Carroll is worth
the publicity the team is getting.
</P>
<P>
   Offseason interest in the Patriots now towers over offseason
interest in the Red Sox. The majority of radio hosts and callers
still talk Patriots over Red Sox despite the wonderful season the
Red Sox came off and Carlton Fisk being elected to the Hall of
Fame. The Patriots are foremost on the mind of the Boston sports
public.
</P>
<P>
   Teams will resort to these marketing manuevers more in the
future, because it's the most inexpensive major change they can
make.
</P>
<P>
   This new trend is really bad for coaches. This is why you see
few top-name college coaches coming into the NFL. The job security
is terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft actually showed the patience of Job in giving Carroll
three years. Jerry Jones gave Chan Gailey two years in Dallas, Ray
Rhodes got one year in Green Bay. All coaches with 8-8 records were
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, 8-8 claimed Dennis Erickson in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   That's four coaches in two years who were fired because their
teams fell to .500. From 1990-97, only five coaches with .500 marks
were fired.
</P>
<P>
   This shows the increasing impatience of NFL owners, who are
beginning to pay exorbitant amounts for franchises and need a kick
to get their business jump-started.
</P>
<P>
   Washington owner Daniel Snyder was on Norv Turner's case from
the moment he paid $800 million for the Redskins. Win now or die.
</P>
<P>
   Owners like Kraft, who have seen the value of their franchises
soar, are building or have built new stadiums that require huge
investments by the local business community for luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   When a team is sliding, the owner responds swiftly. The coach is
gone. That's just the way it is. The day of riding through the hard
times as you build a program is over. The players can complain all
they want about the lack of continuity from year to year, but they
just have to adapt. Drew Bledsoe will have to learn yet another
offensive system next year. Sorry, Drew. Nobody is exempt. Even
with the great reputation Jimmy Johnson has, there has been talk
about his firing or resignation because he hasn't gotten the
Dolphins as far as many thought they should have come since
Johnson's tenure began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things that prosperity brings.
</P>
<P>
   Money is a good thing for everyone, and it has come mainly from
the $17.6 billion TV deal Kraft helped put together.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of money to go around, but coaches have
incredible pressure on them because the trend is to sign 5-7
players to huge contracts, then split the rest up among the
remaining 45 or 46 men on the roster. The mid-range players _ the
Todd Collins-Willie Clay-Sam Gash types _ are getting priced off
teams in favor of lower-priced players who can limit a team's
spirit and depth.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ink even dried on the TV contract, the players,
rightly so, were holding out their hands for their share. The
owners instituted tight salary caps to limit spending. But now they
have done what NBA teams have done: found ways around it. Now they
issue massive, pro-rated signing bonuses that enable them to fiddle
with the cap. The Patriots, for instance, paid out $75.2 million
last year, which is about $18 million over the salary cap. This
enables them to sign their top free agents, but when they want to
get rid of a player who is not producing, they can't, because the
hit on the cap would be so great. Though NFL player contracts
aren't technically guaranteed, they in essence become so.
</P>
<P>
   The cap is the single most compelling issue in the NFL. It has
become a coach-killer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, for instance, have $35.17 million tied up in seven
players against next year's salary cap, which will rise to about
$62 million from $57.2 million. That's more than half the payroll.
The other 46 players will split $26 million. Bledsoe's cap number
is $8.66 million, followed by Willie McGinest's $5.7 million, Bruce
Armstrong's $5.06 million, Ted Johnson's $5 million, Ty Law's $4
million, Ben Coates's $3.5 million, and Chris Slade's $3.25
million. Bledsoe's deal will likely be redone to lower his number,
but that by itself won't clear room for potential new megabuck
deals for Lawyer Milloy, Troy Brown, or Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the Patriots' big seven had healthy, productive
years, Johnson and Law, for example, missed significant portions of
the season, leaving Carroll with depth problems.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the big money players are now making: This season,
there were 514 players who made at least $1 million and 266 players
who made at least $2 million. Since 1994, the number of players who
make $1 million has doubled. There has been a 50 percent increase
in that number since 1997, when there were 340 millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have 21 of those players, tying Atlanta and
Carolina for the most.
</P>
<P>
   Of the league's 514 millionaires, 104 are offensive linemen, the
most at any position. The Patriots have five on an average to
below-average line.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend is teams trying to find themselves a nondrafted
free agent or two or three, as the Patriots did with Kato Serwanga.
Of the 1,643 players who played in the league this season, 393 were
nondrafted free agents; 249 were first-round picks, 218 were
second-round picks, and 197 were third-round picks. This shows that
teams are filling out rosters with undrafted or cheap players. Some
teams get lucky with such players, but most don't. When a coach has
to play these inexperienced players, there's a dropoff in quality
that eventually is reflected in the team's final record.
</P>
<P>
   Then, fans become restless, the coach is fired, and new hope
springs eternal _ until the new coach finds that the salary cap
will kill him, too.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions. Pittsburgh has had Bill Cowher since 1992.
Ditto Dennis Green in Minnesota. The Oilers/Titans have stuck with
Jeff Fischer and the Redskins with Norv Turner since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But patience is no longer a great virtue of NFL owners. And now
the Patriots have demonstrated that, in the immortal words of Globe
baseball writer Larry Whiteside, ``In confusion, there is profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nose smells of trouble
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot who may benefit most from a coaching change is Chad
Eaton. Despite Eaton's loyalty to Carroll, the team's postseason
evaluations and projections had him slated as a backup next year
unless he picked up his level of play. The Patriots felt Eaton's
play dropped because he wasn't fighting for a starting job, as he
had been the previous season with former nose tackle Mark Wheeler.
Toward the end of the season, the Patriots had Henry Thomas playing
a lot in Eaton's nose position. The coaching staff also was
concerned that Eaton was spending too much time on radio shows _
especially after a subpar performance by him or the team _ and
spoke to him about it . . . Clay has one piece of advice for his
good friend Milloy, who may consider offers from other teams:
``Life isn't always better someplace else.'' Clay called his
experience with the 3-13 Saints ``the worst of my NFL career.''
Clay spoke of complete chaos on the team and indicated that Mike
Ditka did not live up to the expectations he had of him. Clay also
had a beef with the Saints over compensation. He needed 20 plays in
the final game to kick in a $400,000 bonus; he got five plays. Clay
made the mistake of signing with the first team that called after
he was cut by the Patriots, but he won't make that mistake again.
``You've got to understand what you're getting into,'' he said.
``You have to do the research. No matter how much they pay you, if
you're in a bad situation, you're going to be miserable.'' . . . If
the current scouting and personnel staff remains in New England, a
top priority will be linemen on both sides of the ball. The
Patriots would like a big interior lineman on defense, another pass
rusher, and a young tackle or guard on offense. The Patriots were
pleased with the performance of veteran Ferric Collons and Chris
Sullivan at the end of the season, and with Brandon Mitchell's
emergence. The team has leaked reports that Steve Israel won't be
back, but Serwanga's stock rose significantly with two strong games
at the end of the season. And if they lose Milloy to free agency,
don't be surprised to see Tony George at strong safety and Tebucky
Jones at free safety next season . . . Former Boston College coach
Jack Bicknell hasn't gotten a sniff in the NFL, despite his
excellent records at BC and for eight years with Barcelona in NFL
Europe. One aspect of coaching quarterbacks he's going to get back
to this winter is working on play-action fakes, which Peyton
Manning has turned into an art form. ``It's one of those basics
that you teach, but maybe you don't spend as much time on it as you
should,'' said Bicknell. ``When you watch Manning and how well he
does it and how he can sell the run, it just makes you excited
about going back to the practice field and perfecting this with
your own guys.'' . . . It hit Rod Rutledge pretty hard when he
found out that Charlotte Hornets forward Bobby Phills had died in
an auto accident while racing against teammate David Wesley last
week. The Patriots tight end was involved in a similar incident
last year but is alive to talk about it. ``I guess I'm blessed,''
said Rutledge from his home in Birmingham, Ala. ``When you hear
things like that, you realize how lucky you are to be alive. That
could have been me.'' Back in September, just three days before the
first game of the 1999 season, Rutledge was driving in excess of 90
miles per hour on I-95, racing with Coates. Rutledge lost control
of his car and veered into a rest area, smashing into two
tractor-trailer trucks. He walked away from the accident with only
scratches. ``I realize now what could have happened,'' said
Rutledge. ``A tragedy like this just hits it home harder.'' As part
of his sentence for operating to endanger, Rutledge has done
community service work for the Brains at Risk organization, which
helps trauma victims. ``At first I didn't think it was going to be
something I wanted to do, even though I was required to do it,'' he
said. ``Now it's become more like something I look forward to
doing. I have a wife and kids, and when I think about the fact that
Bobby has left a wife and young kids . . . wow. I just feel like I
can thank God for the chance to live and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tug-of-Warrick
</P>
<P>
   Even though Florida receiver Peter Warrick has signed with agent
Michael George's Marquis Group in New York, other agents are still
trying to steal Warrick away. The agent business has become
cutthroat, and look for the NFL Players Association to lean on more
agents who break the rules. Once a player signs with an agent,
others are not supposed to speak to him or attempt to lure him
away. But it happens often . . . Irving Fryar is having so much fun
in Washington that he may want to return next season. Let's see if
the feeling is mutual . . . Where does Jefferson fit in the free
agent market? Possible parallels are Darnay Scott of the Bengals,
who signed a four-year, $12 million deal, with a $3.5 million
signing bonus, last season; Denver's Rod Smith, who signed a
five-year, $11 million deal, with a $2 million signing bonus;
Detroit's Johnnie Morton, who was in the four-year, $11 million
range, with a $3.5 million bonus; and Philadelphia's Charles
Johnson, with a five-year, $13 million deal, with a $2 million
bonus . . . If Belichick comes to New England, one player who may
benefit is Fall River's Marc Megna, who was activated toward the
end of the season. Megna was in the Jets' training camp last summer
and Belichick took a liking to him. But the Jets had other needs
and couldn't find room for him on the practice squad . . . The
Bills projected Doug Flutie and Rob Johnson to play together for at
least two years of Flutie's four-year, $22 million deal. Flutie is
scheduled to be paid $3 million next season. If he plays through
the third year of the deal, he doesn't have to give back any of the
$7 million signing bonus, a deal that was structured by former
agent and current Patriots executive Jack Mula. The Bills are
hoping to create a two-quarterback system in which the hot man
plays . . . Mark Feigenbaum of Andover has been chosen the
``ultimate Patriots fan'' by the Visa Hall of Fans. He will be
honored at the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, Tuesday.

IT'S NOT A POLITICAL ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The United States national team might feel
like it is under siege against the Islamic Republic of Iran at the
Rose Bowl Sunday. Most of the expected 55,000 crowd will be from
the Iranian community, which has renamed this area Tehrangeles.
</P>
<P>
   But once the match begins, the US will be the team on the
attack. Iran, as it did in a 2-1 victory over the US in Lyon during
the France '98 World Cup, likely will retreat into defense and
launch counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good style of play and they are confident with
it,'' US coach Bruce Arena said. ``It's been very effective. They
are a good defensive team and they are going to be difficult to
break down. They are experienced in midfield and they are better in
goal than they were in '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena has relaunched the national team after replacing Steve
Sampson following a disastrous World Cup performance. The US is
8-4-3 under Arena, and only four players from the Lyon loss _
Frankie Hejduk, Cobi Jones, Claudio Reyna, and Brian McBride _
likely will be in the starting lineup. The rest of the team had not
been determined, though goalkeeper Brad Friedel and midfielder Tony
Sanneh were likely to start and the Revolution's John Harkes was
slated to enter as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has lost to Mexico (2-1) in Oakland and defeated Ecuador
(2-1) in Los Angeles in the last week. The team is led by
Germany-based strikers Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi, and will have
veterans such as its goal-scorers from Lyon, Hamid Estili and Mehdi
Mahdavikia, MetroStars defender Mohammad Khakpour, and goalkeeper
Hadi Tabatabei.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what to expect, Arena said: ``We'll find out. It's
important we play well and get a positive result. But the world
won't be over if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena has injected spirit and confidence into a US team that was
in a mutinous mood after France. He has rehabilitated Harkes and
Marcelo Balboa and turned Chris Armas, Robin Fraser, and Eddie
Lewis into high-profile players, though Fraser will miss this match
with a broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has brought a hawklike attacking attitude to the team, but
also has kept the defense organized, largely through the deployment
of Armas in midfield and strong central defending. But for the US
to transcend its status as a persistent, physical but naive
opponent, the spark will have to come from midfield. The US has yet
to discover high-level creative midfielders who can take the game
to another level, and Arena cannot be expected to alchemically
produce such a player.
</P>
<P>
   So, the US will depend on Reyna, who has proven himself with
competitive clubs in Europe (Wolfsburg, Glasgow Rangers) but has
yet to make his mark on the national team. Reyna was especially
disappointing during the '98 World Cup as the US converted only one
goal in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``'98 is in the past,'' Arena said. ``If we used that as a
measure, we wouldn't have any players at all. We've played a lot of
games without Claudio and done all right.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first of several matches for the US against nations
that recently have been marginalized, pariah, or considered
outright ``enemies of the state.'' The US will meet Russia in
Moscow in April, play host to South Africa in June, and visit Cuba
in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Arena is being pragmatic. The US also will visit Chile Jan.
29 in preparation for the Gold Cup Feb. 12-27. Then, it will play
host to Tunisia in Birmingham, Ala., March 12. World Cup 2002
qualifying will begin in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The romance is over,'' Arena said. ``Forget about the results
in '99, the objective now is to qualify for 2002.''

IS JORDAN READY TO BITE THIS BULLET? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good luck, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is about to find out what many before him have
discovered. It's different when you're not on the court.
</P>
<P>
   If the reports are true, and Jordan will take over the
basketball business for the notoriously underachieving Washington
Wizards, he'll have his hands full. The Wizards have a gigantic
payroll dominated by a 30-something backcourt that hasn't clicked
and a frontcourt anchored by arguably the most overpaid player in
the game, no small feat in the petrodollar life of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Jordan will have one distinction no other GM has:
He'll be happy to take a call from David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to see Mike doing the detail work, like working the
phones or sneaking into a gym to see a prospect. He's never been
one of those guys; his name always has been enough. That may work
with restaurants, and it may work in getting some equity in the
franchise. But it won't work in rebuilding the Wizards, who are on
the hook next year for more than $52 million in player salaries and
more than $54 million the year after that. (Eight players divide
that mother lode. Juwan Howard will make $18.75 million next season
and more than $20 million the next. Meanwhile, both Rod Strickland
and Mitch Richmond are ``base-year'' guys, making them hard to
move.)
</P>
<P>
   Washington managed to go through an entire decade, the 1990s,
without winning a playoff game. Only one other non-Canadian team
can make that claim: Dallas. (Milwaukee won one game in the 1990
playoffs.) Washington appeared in only one playoff series in the
decade, sneaking in as the No. 8 team in 1997 and then getting
swept by Jordan's Bulls. It has not won a playoff series since
1982, and that was a bogus best-of-three affair. You have to go
back to 1979 _ 21 years ago _ to find an occasion when the
franchise last won any kind of meaningful playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   They've had the same owner for decades, a well-intentioned,
loyal man named Abe Pollin. He and Jordan had a few words during
last season's lockout when Jordan had the temerity to suggest that
Pollin sell the Wizards if he can't make a go of it. That turned
out to be the first wise thing Jordan said to Pollin.
</P>
<P>
   Pollin has stuck with Wes Unseld in more than one management
role despite pretty convincing evidence that the Hall of Famer has
not done the job. Unseld coached the team for 6 1/2 seasons, not
one of which ended with a winning record. In his last three years,
Unseld's teams won 25, 22, and 24 games. For that achievement, he
was promoted to general manager. Since then, he has traded Chris
Webber and Rasheed Wallace and kept Howard.
</P>
<P>
   For a competitive, driven, used-to-having-his-way guy like Mike,
it's going to be an eye-opening experience. Can you wait to see him
try to stare down an agent? He always was in control on the court.
He is about to find out that, despite his retirement, the tail
still wags the dog in the NBA. His magnetism, charm, and smarts can
go only so far.
</P>
<P>
   We've already seen once that Jordan is not afraid to fail. His
baseball experience showed a distinctly human side unknown to those
who saw him strictly as a basketball player. And, let's not forget,
he always saw himself as a quasi-GM in Chicago, where his public
personnel preferences were, you might say, suspect. He vehemently
opposed the Charles Oakley-Bill Cartwright trade. He wanted Scottie
Pippen out more than once. Generally, if a player had an Atlantic
Coast Conference pedigree, or had Falk as his agent, then Jordan
liked him.
</P>
<P>
   Washington presents a monumental challenge. If all the details
can be worked out _ we have to assume Jordan also will get a piece
of the team, a la Pat Riley _ and Jordan gets the power he needs,
then he should start the rebuilding process quickly: with a
flamethrower.
</P>
<P>
   No better in Boston
</P>
<P>
   While we're on the subject of struggling teams, we would be
remiss not to at least note our local five. We're now into Year 3
of the Rick Pitino Era, and can you honestly say you see any sign
of improvement? Or hope? You could even argue that there's been a
regression; they at least played hard in the first year. Pitino won
36 games that year. He won the equivalent of about 36 last year.
He's on track to win about 36 this year, although he said it's too
soon to make an assessment. He's made countless trades and other
moves and the team still is struggling. This can't be what he had
in mind. It certainly can't be what Paul Gaston had in mind.
Interest in the team is at an all-time low, as evidenced by the
paltry crowds at the FleetCenter and the pitiful television
numbers. Pitino, as undisputed hoop el jefe, is on the hook for all
of this. Generally, when a team isn't performing as well as people
think it should, you can look at a couple of main reasons: The
players have been overrated or the coach's message isn't getting
across. In either case, it's Pitino's problem. Those are his
players. Yes, they're young. But he brought them here. If they're
not responding, that's his problem as well, because it doesn't
matter how much talent, or purported talent, you have, or how well
you can coach; if the players aren't listening, you get nowhere.
Pitino insists he isn't going anywhere. ``I'm here for 10 years _
six years of coaching and four more as president,'' he said.
``Where am I going to go? I moved my family here. I love the
area.'' Where would he go? College? Been there, done that. And he
has said he hates the state of college basketball. If he were to
leave, it would run counter to his track record. Needless to say,
if he were to be fired, that would run counter to Gaston's track
record.
</P>
<P>
   Can't judge book by cover
</P>
<P>
   One of the many moves Pitino made was to pave the way for Dino
Radja to head overseas. (Looking back, that may have been Rick's
best moment.) Well, Radja has just published his autobiography in
Croatia, and the cover of the book shows Dino in a Celtics uniform
. . . Going into weekend games with Denver and Vancouver, the Heat
expected Tim Hardaway to make his long-awaited return to the
lineup. Though Hardaway has been out almost two months with a sore
knee, Miami has managed not only to stay afloat but to stay atop
the Atlantic Division. In the process, Riley found a serviceable
backup in rookie Anthony Carter . . . The Grizzlies may have
stormed through the East at a 4-1 clip, but, as Dennis Scott
pointed out, that shouldn't be cause for a parade. ``I remember
when we were 3-3 and guys were running around all over the place.
We were saying, `Whoa.' Let's see us win 14 out of 15, something
the good teams do. If we do that, then the arena will be packed,
there'll be more attention, more media people, and everything will
fall into place.'' Scott played for ex-Grizzlies coach Brian Hill
in Orlando and Vancouver. What did he think of the coaching change?
``In Orlando, we had horses,'' Scott said. ``It was the same system
there as we had here. But Country (Bryant Reeves) isn't Shaq. And
Mike (Bibby) is different from Penny (Hardaway). Maybe (Hill) could
have tweaked it a little bit, I don't know.'' . . . Speaking of
Penny, it has not been lost on a lot of people that the coach he
now has, Scott Skiles, was the man he supplanted in Orlando. Skiles
didn't take it well then. He also was enormously popular. ``Scott
was absolutely the hero of this town,'' said Magic executive Pat
Williams. ``And Scott wasn't going to give up anything. In Scott's
mind, he had a lot of basketball left in him. But he also handled
it very well. He never sulked. He never complained, although I'm
sure it was hard on him. But he could also see the handwriting on
the wall. But this is a guy who never wanted to come out of a game,
let alone not play. The only guy I've seen like that in all my
years was Jerry Sloan for sheer competitiveness, intensity, never
backing down to anybody. When Scott got the Suns job, (owner) Jerry
Colangelo said the team was going to become a little more snarly.
How snarly is he? Every night he comes home, he flosses the
piranha.'' Williams said projecting Skiles as Hardaway's coach
would have been tough, and it's further complicated by Hardaway's
(foot) injury: ``Scott was like Ty Cobb. He'd spit tobacco juice on
his foot and then say, `Let's play two.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Room to maneuver
</P>
<P>
   As we approach February and the trading deadline, two teams _
Chicago and the Clippers _ will be fielding a lot of calls. They
are the only ones with any kind of cap room for a three-team deal.
The Bulls are about $6 million under the cap after they gave Matt
Maloney a one-year deal in the $600,000 range. The Clippers are
almost $8 million under. But the team to watch is Orlando, listed
as $7 million over the cap, mainly because it is paying money to 28
players. On the books are the likes of Louis Bullock ($10,000),
Yinka Dare ($1.8 million), Terry Davis ($1.9 million), Armen
Gilliam ($3.7 million), and Harvey Grant ($1.2 million). But when
July 1 comes around, the Magic will have a ton of money to spend on
free agents. They also could have three lottery picks in next
June's draft, as they have their own pick, Golden State's, and
Denver's . . . Pitino mentioned that the Celtics considered signing
Maloney last fall, but decided it was not smart because Maloney's
agent wanted Boston to use its $1.1 million exception to do so.
Well, that's not quite how agent Keith Glass remembers it. ``I
never asked for the exception,'' he said. ``I never asked for
anything. I talked to Miami for two months and never got around to
money. Matt already had $17 million in hand, so I wanted to see
where there was interest and where he would have a chance to play.
But if you're not willing to use the exception, is he a priority?''
Celtics GM Chris Wallace said, based on his discussions with Glass,
he felt the agent was headed toward asking for the exception.
``That's tying up an option you have which you may want to use in
the summer,'' Wallace said. (The exception is available once every
two years.) Said Glass, ``I know Rick does it for the love of the
game. Sometimes, I have to do it for the money.'' . . . John
Calipari thinks he knows one reason why Keith Van Horn is
struggling: ``He was really good with Sam (Cassell). A lot of guys
didn't like Sam because he was outspoken and things like that.
Well, Keith loved him because he got him the ball.'' . . .
Congratulations to former University of Massachusetts center Lari
Ketner, who will be playing in the CBA's Rookie All-Star game
Tuesday in Sioux Falls. Ketner started out the year with the Bulls,
then was released and found work with the Fort Wayne Fury. He was
averaging 11.9 points and 6.1 rebounds a game . . . Condolences to
agent Frank Catapano and his family. Catapano's wife, Terry, died
this past week after a tough battle with cancer. She was 55.

EXCERPTS FROM REPUBLICAN DEBATE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an exchange about taxes by Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas during the
Republican presidential debate on Saturday in Johnston, Iowa, as
recorded by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH. During the last Iowa debate we had a disagreement over
ethanol. I support the tax credit on ethanol, you don't. As part of
your plan to pay for your tax cuts, you say we ought to eliminate
what's called employer-provided benefits to workers. These are
benefits where transportation or meals or continuing education is
given to a worker tax-free. That's $40 billion of your $170 billion
tax-reduction plan. __
</P>
<P>
   My question to you is, why would you say to a single mom who's
working, who's getting educated, that she would have to pay taxes
on those benefits? If you get rid of the employer-related benefits
the workers are going to have to pay taxes. It's a $40 billion tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Well, the first thing that I'd say to the single mom is
that I've got a tax cut for you and Governor Bush doesn't. That's
the first answer.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: That's not true.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Yes, it is. But let's talk about the real issue here.
The real issue is, my friends, is we've got a surplus. And for the
first time since Dwight David Eisenhower, we got a surplus and the
question is, what do you want to do with it? I want to give it to
low- and middle-income Americans as a tax cut. I want to give them
the benefits from this that they need that lower- and middle-income
Americans need.
</P>
<P>
   But I also think we got a ticking time bomb out there called
Social Security. That has got to be fixed. We've got a national
debt of $5.6 trillion that we need to pay for because we're laying
that debt on young Americans. We need to pay down that debt.
Governor Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security, not one
penny for Medicare and not one penny for paying down the national
debt. And when you run ads saying you're going to take care of
Social Security, my friend, that's all hat and no cattle.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: _ that's _ that's _ that's cute, but ...
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: You know, they're always cutest when they're true.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: It's not true.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: Yeah, it is. It truthfully is.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: I've got two trillion set aside for Social Security ... My
question to you is, and we can talk about taxes, I hope.
Everybody's got an interesting idea on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I thought that's what we were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH: My _ my _ no, we're talking about why would you _ why
would you have a plan that, in essence, raises taxes on working
people by $40 billion? Why would you support a plan that caused _
why would you take away benefits that people then have to pay tax
on _ taxes _ taxes on education and transportation and meals?
</P>
<P>
   McCAIN: I'm giving them a huge tax cut and that is a fact and
the _ and the reality is that your tax plan has 36 percent of it
going to the richest 1 percent in America. I don't do that. I think
that we ought to give a tax relief to the people that need it the
most.
</P>
<P>
   But I also think the best thing I can do for that woman you're
talking about is save her Social Security. Two trillion dollars is
in the Social Security trust fund. You know that. Let's not do the
Texas two-step here. It needs five to seven trillion dollars more
and we've got to do it soon so that they can invest their _ their
retirement into savings and investments of their choice. _ So we
can save the system.
</P>
<P>

JAGUARS EMBARRASS DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The night before the game, Jimmy Johnson
gathered his Miami Dolphins in a meeting room at a nearby hotel and
gave them what will most likely be the last motivational speech of
his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Johnson called five huge linemen to the front of the
room and challenged them to win their individual battles, telling
them that if they did, his team would beat the Jaguars in their
playoff game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made one mistake: He challenged the wrong guys. He
should have put his defensive backfield on the spot, because when
the game arrived, they were the most guilty parties in Miami's
crushing 62-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said after the game that he was guilty of overcoaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to prepare them too much,'' he said. ``I take the
blame for this one. I should have pulled back after the long trip
to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious from the start we were dead-legged. That's one
reason why we couldn't bring our feet, go through the tackles, or
couldn't run. I thought we had good practices, but unfortunately we
left it on the practice field.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's rout will be remembered as a record-setting
performance by the Jaguars and, in all probability, as the last
game for two future Hall of Famers, Johnson and Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Some think Johnson will resign as head coach of the Dolphins as
early as Sunday afternoon. Marino's closest friends expect him,
too, to finally give up on his career, which will put him in the
books as the finest passer in the history of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait to see as time goes on what the circumstances are
with the Dolphins, myself, and how I feel,'' said Marino. ``I still
think like I can win games in this league. I've proven that and
will continue to do that. So we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a game here Saturday; it was more like an upscale
scrimmage for the well-rested Jaguars. They dominated from start to
finish, scoring the first six times they touched the ball to build
to a 41-0 lead with 1:51 left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami secondary, supposedly one of the team's strengths, was
torn apart by land and through the air.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half alone, Jacksonville ran up 313 total yards,
while Miami responded with only 92 yards and 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor humbled the Miami
secondary. In the first period, with his team ahead, 10-0, Taylor
ran at right end with no help and with four defenders in his way.
He beat them all on his own, racing 90 yards for a touchdown, the
longest scoring run in NFL playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were out of it after that. It took Marino 20
minutes to complete his first pass, and, after one series, he sat
out the rest of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Johnson told me at the half that he was going to put
Damon (Huard) in,'' said Marino. ``I asked him for another shot,
and it didn't go so well.''
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart, Mark Brunell, hobbling on braced knees, also
didn't play the second half, but for different reasons. Coach Tom
Coughlin pulled him out three minutes into the second quarter to
save him for next week's AFC Championship Game here. ``Our first
drive was important,'' said Brunell, who completed 5 of 9 passes
for 105 yards and two touchdowns. ``We haven't been starting games
well. We talked about it all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs felt great today. I felt confident I wouldn't have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino just doesn't have it anymore. On his first pass, with his
team trailing, 7-0, he threw a floater that Aaron Beasley
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   After Taylor's 90-yard run, Marino got hit and fumbled just 25
seconds later. Tony Brackens, who caused the turnover, pounced on
the ball and, after some cajoling from teammates when they realized
the play wasn't over, ran 16 yards for a touchdown to make it 24-0.
</P>
<P>
   The game was out of control. The Dolphins couldn't do anything
right.
</P>
<P>
   Just 12 seconds into the second quarter, Miami blitzed but the
Jaguars had the perfect response. Taylor checked through the line
of scrimmage, took a little flip pass from Brunell, and danced 39
yards for a touchdown, embarrassing three defensive backs in the
final 15 yards as they all missed him with feeble tackling
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Johnson became animated on the sideline, waving
his arms in a tackling motion, trying to motivate his troops. They
didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin had preached to his players that they needed to make
big plays to beat Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 30 minutes, aside from Taylor's heroics, Jimmy
Smith caught a pass for 41 yards to set up the first touchdown, the
special teams blocked a punt, and the defense collected five of
their seven turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very crisp,'' said Coughlin. ``A lot of good things
happened to us. The reason that came about is that we had a good
week on the practice field. Our preparation was good. We got some
things done with X's and O's, and our players made some great
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino had 11 completions in 25 throws for 95 yards and a
touchdowns, but he was zero for his first 10, and eight of his
completions came on his final drive of the first half. If this is
the way it is to end, then his last important throw was a 20-yard
touchdown to Oronde Gadsden with time running out in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   There was some question before the game about the legitimacy of
the Jaguars as the No. 1 seed in the AFC; they ran up a 14-2 record
but had one of the league's easiest schedules.
</P>
<P>
   However, after this powerful performance on both sides on the
ball, there is little doubt that they will be favored next Sunday
when they play for a chance to go to the Super Bowl.

AUSSIES WHET APPETITE, HOPE TO END DROUGHT

<P>
   MELBOURNE _ The painted patriots of the general-admission pews
are ready to party again as the first summer sunshine of a new
century, and a hailstorm of tennis balls, descend in a golden glow
on the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   No major championship is as much fun as the Aussie, where
sitting space is more readily available and cheaper than at the
other three (French, Wimbledon, US Open), and young hordes fleeing
European winter show up in warpaint to boisterously cheer their
compatriots. Swedes in blue and yellow faces, Germans in red and
black, Dutch in orange, to cite the largest regiments, are clearing
their throats to ``barrack,'' as Aussies put it, with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the natives at Melbourne Park, predominating in green
and gold makeup, may be the most passionate during the fortnight
that commences Monday, their passion born of staggering deprivation
for a people so rich in championship history. Not for 24 years has
a homeboy won the title, Mark Edmondson, or a sheila, Chris O'Neil,
two years later in 1978. As the worst dry spell for the Down
Underdwellers in their 95-year-old tourney, it brings to mind the
saddest of all Australian songs: Slim Dusty's country dirge, ``The
Pub With No Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time it won't be the dashing ex-US Open champ Patrick
Rafter, everybody's choice _ from wailing teenage girls to their
more subdued parents _ to end the big thirst and set off malten
toasts in every pub across the continent. Rafter's
surgically-carpentered right shoulder will permit him no more
exertion than doubles alongside Wayne Arthurs. That bit ``only as
long as I don't feel it tightening up.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Rafter is mourned, and the female decline deplored,
there is definite hope in the forms of the guys who won the Davis
Cup: the feisty 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt, and a quiet latter-day
Adonis with a Greek bloodline, 6-foot-4-inch thunderbolt hurler
Mark Philippoussis. Philippoussis stirred this town with
anticipation Friday by beating a tourist named Pete Sampras, 7-6,
7-6. It was only an exhibition at Kooyong, former home of the Open,
but it rekindled memories of the last Wimbledon when Philippoussis
seemed on his way to jolting champion Sampras, only to crumble and
surrender in the second set as a knee gave out.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis, frequently clueless, goes in and out with his
public. He thought he could pull a Sampras two years ago by
shunning Davis Cup. In this country that plays about as well as
peddling military secrets or kicking koalas. The national response
was so negative that he knew he'd have to win the Cup in '99 (which
he did, with two singles victories in the 3-2 final over France) to
avoid deportation.
</P>
<P>
   All's forgiven was the ecstatic turnaround reaction _ until the
other day when he said he might pass on the Cup opener next month
against Switzerland. Another firestorm. He quickly ran a reverse,
pleading misquotation, and the blaze went out. But if he goes all
the way through seven rounds to the trophy presentation,
Philippoussis might be a candidate for posthumous taxidermy to
stand beside the fabled Aussie race horse, Phar Lap, in the
Melbourne Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, he's in the minefield, the top half of the draw that
also contains the co-favorites, world Nos. 1 and 3 at the close of
1999, Andre Agassi and Sampras, plus an ex-Wimbledon victor,
Richard Krajicek. That's why the old champ, Davis Cup captain John
Newcombe, likes the chances of unseeded Hewitt at the other end,
where the most formidable name belongs to No. 2, the defending
champion but often indifferent Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago Kafelnikov portrayed himself as the stern
schoolmaster who would ``give a lesson'' to the ``unimpressive''
novice Hewitt _ only to be impressively caned by the kid, clinching
the Davis Cup semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   You may recall Hewitt in Boston last July impersonating a
whirlwind at Longwood. Called ``the fastest man in the game'' by
Davis Cup coach Tony Roche, he made Todd Martin resemble a
Commonwealth Avenue statue in sprinting to the leadoff victory that
virtually settled the quarterfinal decision over the US.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, like Philippoussis, will not be getting an honorary
degree in public relations from Boston University or anybody else
soon. Recently, while winning the ATP Tour tourney in Adelaide, his
hometown no less, he chastised the customers as ``stupid'' for the
sin of also applauding his outgunned foes. It was suggested by many
that his mother wash his mouth out with soap. But he's on a
squeaky-clean 10-0 toot for 2000, having added the Sydney title
Saturday, and thus stands as current No. 1 on the planet according
to the newly installed ATP ranking system. This is based on a
season-long race rather than a cumulative ranking calculated weekly
on results of the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, who specialized in charming crowds, undoubtedly is
offering a PR seminar or two, while delighting in his protege's
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lleyton just goes all out in every direction,'' Newc says. ``I
wouldn't be surprised if he went all the way here. We know the
ceilings of Sampras, Agassi, and the other big guns. But Lleyton
hasn't come close to his yet. It's getting higher all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for another dynamite 18-year-old, Serena Williams,
the US Open champ who has arrived alone. No Venus, whose excuse is
tendinitis of the right wrist. Who knows with those mysterious and
wondrous movers, the Sisters Sledgehammer? Does the master plan of
father Richard Williams call for a Serena solo this time, as Venus
performed at Wimbledon?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the presence of Wimbledon ruler Lindsay Davenport
along with Serena and the triumvirate of Agassi, Sampras, and
Martin give the far-far-from home Americans an excellent shot at a
double, last achieved in 1982 by Chris Evert and freshly
naturalized, South African-born Johan Kriek.
</P>
<P>
   But in this summer of their great content, Aussies are flexing
the muscles of empire, commanding the globe in the international
games that mean the most to them. They won World Cups in cricket
and rugby as well as the Davis Cup. Those were team diversions. Now
in a land the inhabitants call ``Oz'' they're looking for a wizard
with racket to bust their own championship drought, someone to
restore the glory days of Rod Laver, the double Grand Slammer for
whom the principal stadium will be named Sunday. Someone to bring
widest smiles to those green-and-gold faces.

WARNER ARRIVES AT TOP SHELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL MADDEN 
c.2000 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EARTH CITY, Mo. _ Only three times in its history has the Des
Moines Register devoted a special section to a sports figure. One
was for the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, one was for the Cardinals' Mark
McGwire, and this weekend's _ the third _ was for Kurt Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The six pages were well done, but it was the sixth and final
page that was fascinating. A full-page advertisement. An
advertisement for Hy-Vee supermarkets, a chain throughout Iowa and
southern Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Hy-Vee to MVP,'' it read, promoting itself as well as
``Warner's Crunch Time Frosted Flakes'' ($2.99 for a 20-ounce box).
The full name of the athlete is nowhere mentioned in the
advertisement; it doesn't have to be, for Kurt Warner is now Iowa's
favorite son. Bill Bradley, Al Gore, George Bush, and all the other
politicos traipsing around Iowa these days must play second fiddle
until the uplifting saga of Kurt Warner is done. Whenever that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Making of an MVP,'' the ad went on, detailing how Kurt
Warner _ somehow, some way _ got to the top. And then Hy-Vee listed
the itinerary of Warner's trip: ``Cedar Rapids Regis High School,
University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls Hy-Vee, Iowa
Barnstormers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cedar Falls Hy-Vee''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Stocking shelves for $5.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   From there to starting quarterback for the St. Louis Rams, who
face the Minnesota Vikings in the playoffs Sunday. Not to mention
MVP of the NFL, even if he is paid only the NFL's minimum salary,
$254,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But just before that critical stop at Hy-Vee, Kurt Warner had
made a detour to Green Bay. Fresh out of Northern Iowa, where he
was part of a team that lost to Boston University in the NCAA
Division 1-AA playoffs at Nickerson Field in 1993, Warner had
signed a training camp contract with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few clubs were interested in me, but Green Bay said they
were going to bring only three quarterbacks to camp,'' said Warner.
``So I figured that was my best opportunity. Other teams were
bringing in three or four rookie quarterbacks, so I figured this
might be my best opportunity to make a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Three quarterbacks?
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre. Mark Brunell (now with Jacksonville). And Ty
Detmer, who just happened to be a Heisman Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   Warner was too young and innocent to know that the fourth QB in
an NFL camp is little more than fodder, needed only to make sure
the receivers get enough passes to catch during the endless drills.
Coaches don't look at the fourth QB; they're looking at the
receivers to whom the fourth QB is throwing. So it might be trite
to note that former Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren missed a good
one; Holmgren probably wasn't looking. For sure, with Favre and
Brunell around, Holmgren had no reason to look.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, Warner was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit discouraged, more so because I didn't get
an opportunity than I didn't make it in Green Bay,'' said Warner.
``I knew the guys I was competing against were really good and I
was hoping to get an opportunity to play and show people I could
play at that level. But I also gained a lot of confidence that I
could compete against those three guys and really feel I stacked up
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Now what? Middle of the summer. No job. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Back to Iowa. Back to Cedar Falls. And Hy-Vee's. Stocking
shelves. At 2 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew at the time it wasn't going to be a long-term
commitment _ I mean, I wasn't going to be stocking shelves the rest
of my life,'' said Warner. ``I knew I was going to be playing
football. But I knew I had to take care of my family to get through
that situation at that critical time. I was sure I was going to be
playing football somewhere. But I was stocking shelves for $5.50 an
hour.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the fiction business would dare write this tale. Too
preposterous. Even Hollywood would toss out the script.
Unrealistic. Completely. Unbelievable. Totally.
</P>
<P>
   Twist of fate in Arena League
</P>
<P>
   Mike Holmgren is far from the only coach who had overlooked Kurt
Warner. Gaylord Haushildt, the coach at Regis HS in Cedar Rapids,
knew that Warner had a great arm and could see the field. ``But the
NFL?'' Haushildt said. ``You don't know that in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   And Terry Allen, Warner's coach at Northern Iowa and now the
Kansas coach, sat Warner on the bench for four long years becuse he
felt Jay Johnson was a better quarterback. ``I was as responsible
for holding him back as anyone,'' Allen told the Des Moines
newspaper. Warner, a fourth-year junior, was so discouraged that he
wanted to quit after a game at McNeese State in 1992, but his
parents talked him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But for the true fickleness of fate, consider what happened to
Warner when he signed on with the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena
Football League in 1995. Arena Football, for the cable-deprived, is
played indoors on a field 50 yards long and 25 1/2 yards wide, with
end zones 8 yards deep. With the field about half the size of an
NFL field, and with fans leaning over from the front row and
dumping beer on or socking players running by, it is a quite
different game from the NFL. Much quicker, too.
</P>
<P>
   Warner wasn't sure he wanted to play in the Arena League. He had
watched the summer games on ESPN, but only ``because that was the
only thing on television. It was better than `Love Boat' reruns.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was football. And Warner was terrible in his first
exhibition game, against the St. Louis Stampede in St. Louis,
throwing two interceptions in the first half. But John Gregory, the
Barnstormers' coach, stood firmly behind Warner even when Willis
Jacox, Iowa's major offensive threat, complained to the coach that
he had seen better quarterbacks in the Canadian Fotball League.
Jacox would argue that the Barnstormers needed a new QB; Gregory
stood by Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the interceptions piled up _ 11 in Warner's first four
games. Before a game against Memphis, Warner was sure he was going
to be benched or even cut. And after two interceptions in the first
half, Gregory did what Jacox had urged him to do and what Warner
had feared he would do: He benched Warner.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth quarter, with Iowa trailing, 25-20, Warner was
sent back in because he was more familiar with the two-minute
offense. Warner dropped back to pass and threw the ball directly
into the hands of Memphis defender Jerry Pitts (``It was there and
the game was over'') but Pitts dropped the almost-certain
interception.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, with a new chance to win the game _ and, actually, to
save his career _ threw a winning TD pass as time expired. And his
record as a starting quarterback since that day is 50-10.
</P>
<P>
   So all of this may have been possible only because Jerry Pitts
dropped a sure interception, an interception that might have sent
Kurt Warner back to the Hy-Vee supermarket in Cedar Falls. Instead
of St. Louis, where he is second now only to Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Triumph of spirit
</P>
<P>
   Ask Warner about the importance of Sunday's game and his mind
flashes back to what he considers the most important game of his
life, the 1996 Arena Bowl, Iowa against the Tampa Bay Storm, on
Aug. 26, with 11,411 hot and sweaty fans packing Iowa's home
stadium, ``The Barn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was leading, 42-38, when Warner directed the last
drive of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my most memorable game, the first championship game
we played, the second year in the league,'' said Warner. ``And
actually we got to the 1-yard line.''
</P>
<P>
   A pass failed, a run failed, and then two more passes were
stopped. Warner just could not move the ball that final yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of those situations where we felt we had won the
game, and we should have won the game,'' said Warner, ``but we
didn't do it. And it's something that has stuck in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That game, said Warner, is still the most important he's played
``because it's about as close as I've ever gotten to winning a
championship game. We were that close and we felt we should have
won it but we didn't win it. It's something I obviously want to
achieve and that's the closest I've ever come.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Warner knew ``my only chance to get to the NFL was to
go to the World League.'' But he was not burning to get to the NFL
because his salary at Iowa was good (about $60,000 a year) ``and I
was happy where I was. If I stayed there, I wouldn't have minded.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing he has done this season with the Rams _ the 41 TD
passes, the MVP, the sudden glory _ compares with the thrill he got
when he met Billy Graham at a crusade in St. Louis last autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the most thrilling thing that's happened,''
said Warner. ``To be able to share my story, to use this platform,
share what God has allowed me to do. There's nothing better.
Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's personal life seemingly is as inspiring as his
professional life. When he was a senior at Northern Iowa, his
roommate suggested they go out to Wiley Coyote's, a country and
western bar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhwile, Brenda Meoli's mother insisted that her daughter, a
divorced mother of two, also needed a night out. Warner didn't want
to go, and neither did Meoli, a former intelligence officer in the
Marines. Eventually, though, both changed their minds and went to
Wiley Coyote's.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and Meoli met and hit it off. They talked, and Meoli
disclosed that one of her children, Zachary, had been accidentally
dropped when he was four months old, by her former husband. Doctors
told her the infant would die. The mother prayed and prayed.
Zachary lived. But he is blind, and Meoli was told he may never sit
up, walk, or talk.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Warner showed up at Meoli's apartment with a
rose and said he wanted to meet the kids. He and Meoli soon were
married. In addition to the two children, they now have another
son, Kade.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary is now 10 and can do many of the things doctors said he
would never do, although he does them with difficulty. And each
Sunday, wearing a jersey with Warner's No. 13, he presses his nose
against the TV screen in the day care room at the TWA Dome and
watches his father win another game for the Rams. His mother
believes Zachary, though legally blind, can see Warner throwing all
those touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Warner merely says, ``He's our gift from God.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe, then the NFL
</P>
<P>
   Many phone calls were made to get Kurt Warner out of Arena
Football and into a better league. The Chicago Bears wanted to try
him out in 1997 but Warner told them the tryout would have to wait;
he was going on his honeymoon in Jamaica with Brenda.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a tropical critter bit him on that honeymoon
and his right arm swelled so much that he couldn't throw a
football. The workout was canceled; the Bears never called back.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Lugenbill, the coach of NFL Europe's Amsterdam Admirals,
persisted. It is much easier for all concerned if an NFL team signs
a player to a contract before he goes off to play in NFL Europe.
Lugenbill had called 12 teams; his 13th call was to Charlie Armey,
the vice president of personnel for the Rams. Armey, convinced of
Warner's potential, signed the quarterback to a Rams contract and
Warner was off to Amsterdam in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember the most,'' said Armey, the former New England
director of college scouting, ``was I met Kurt with Al in a
restaurant over in Amsterdam. And I can remember this so clearly.
Kurt looked into my eyes and told me, `Just give me a chance and I
won't prove you wrong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Warner remembers the conversation with exactly the same words.
``I knew if I just got the chance, it would be all I needed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the number of calls Lugenbill made for
Warner _ 13 _ is not lost on the quarterback, who wears that number
on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not superstitious,'' he once said. ``I just want to show
the number is not all bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey was impressed with how quickly Warner released the ball
and how accurate his passes were. Both Armey and Warner utter
virtually the same words, that Arena League football, with the game
played at warp speed and virtually every play a pass, can hone a
passer's skills to the finest of edges.
</P>
<P>
   But, once again, Warner would not have had a chance to display
those skills if fate hadn't paid another visit last August. During
the offseason, the Rams had dumped their unhappy quarterback, Tony
Banks, and signed former Redskin Trent Green to a
multimillion-dollar deal with a guarantee that he would be the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Green went down with a season-ending injury in August, and
coach Dick Vermeil and Armey had to decide whether to go the safe
route _ sign a tested veteran such as Jeff Hostetler _ or go with
the untested Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``All credit for what's happened has to go with two people,''
said Armey. ``Kurt Warner, for his persistence in all he's gone
through to get here, and Dick Vermeil, for deciding he had seen
enough in the drills and was confident enough in Kurt to give him
the job. Those two men, and those two alone, deserve all the
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday afternoon, Kurt Warner, anxious, nervous, and
probably sleepless (``I was having trouble sleeping last Monday'')
will take the field for an NFL playoff game that just may be bigger
than that game in ``The Barn'' in 1996 when the Iowa Barnstormers
were stopped at the 1-yard line.

GAUGING THE DIRECTION OF AL EAST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the opening of training camp almost a month away (the
earliest reporting date is Feb. 18; Sox pitchers and catchers
report the following day), here is a look at what has transpired
this winter, division by division, starting with the AL East:
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles
</P>
<P>
   (FR) 1999 finish: 78-84, fourth, 20 games behind.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Additions: Manager Mike Hargrove, LHP Buddy Groom, RHP Mike
Trombley, C Greg Myers, DH Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Subtractions: Manager Ray Miller, GM Frank Wren, LHP Jesse
Orosco, LHP Arthur Rhodes, RHP Scott Kamieniecki, INF Jeff
Reboulet, RHP Mike Fetters, RHP Doug Linton.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Prospects: LHP Matt Riley, 3B Ryan Minor, 1B Calvin
Pickering, C Jayson Werth, RHP Jose Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Runs for/against: 851/815, +36.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Home runs: 203.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Walks/strikeouts: 615/890.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Leadoff on-base percentage: .393.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Stolen bases/caught stealing: 107/46.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Big-spending O's, despite bringing in Albert
Belle and Will Clark, were cooked not long after Patriots Day, a
6-16 start leaving them reeling until the All-Star break, when they
were 15 games under .500. Belle, as he'd done the year before in
Cleveland, finally got cranking after the break, when he hit 27 of
his 37 homers and knocked in 82 runs. O's obviously aren't daunted
at the prospect of reuniting Hargrove with Belle, whom the manager
left alone in Cleveland. O's veterans were openly contemptuous of
the departed Miller, but the O's are old and brittle. After his
first two trips ever to the DL because of back problems, it remains
to be seen what Cal Ripken has left in his 20th season. The Iron
Man turns 40 this year.
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING &QC; 
(FR) Overall ERA: 4.77.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Starters: 61-57, 4.71.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Relievers: 17-27, 4.89, 33/58 saves.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Strikeouts/walks: 982/647.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: They were poised to have Aaron Sele, winner of 37
games the last two seasons, join Mike Mussina and Scott Erickson to
form a Big Three at the top of their rotation, with kids Sidney
Ponson and Jason Johnson filling it out. But owner Peter Angelos
had second thoughts after Sele's medical exam, and the Mariners
quickly pounced on the former Sox curveballer. The O's remain in
the market for another starter, though Mercedes's strong showing in
the Dominican Republic makes him a sleeper candidate. The O's, who
blew 25 saves last season, have stocked their bullpen with former
Twin Trombley and lefty ``Nutty'' Buddy Groom from the A's, with
Mike Timlin retaining a shaky hold on the closer's job for now.
Timlin picked up 18 saves in 19 chances in season's second half. It
will help if Erickson improves on his 1-7 start from last season,
while O's also will be focused on locking up ace Mussina in his
walk year.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Fielding percentage: .986.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Errors: 89.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The numbers are misleading, inasmuch as they hide
the shortcomings of range the O's had at both corners. O's could
use a faster, younger fly-catcher in center field than Brady
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox
</P>
<P>
   (FR) 1999 finish: 94-68, second, wild-card qualifier; defeated
Indians, 3-2, in Division Series; lost to Yankees, 4-1, in ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Additions: OF Carl Everett, LHP Jeff Fassero, SS Manny
Alexander, OF Jermaine Allensworth, LHP Sang-Hoon Lee.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Subtractions: DH Butch Huskey, OF Damon Buford, INF Lou
Merloni, RHP Pat Rapp, DH Reggie Jefferson, LHP Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Prospects: C Steve Lomasney, 1B Dernell Stenson, 3B Wilton
Veras, OF Michael Coleman, RHP Tomo Ohka, RHP Juan Pena.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Runs for/against: 836/718, +118
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Home runs: 176.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Walks/strikeouts: 597/928.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Leadoff on-base percentage: .401.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Stolen bases/caught stealing: 67/39.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: With the addition of Everett _ he'll probably hit
in the No. 4 spot behind Nomar Garciaparra, allowing him more
chances to run _ the lineup matches up nicely against anybody in
the division, one through five, and maybe even deeper. Jose
Offerman, a healthy John Valentin, the AL batting champion (Nomar),
a prime-time player in Everett, and Troy O'Leary, whose postseason
performance took him to the next level, prompts Dan Duquette to
ask, ``Who are they going to pitch around now?'' Brian Daubach's
second half raised some questions, but the Basher/Mike Stanley
combo should settle nicely lower in the order, and C Jason Varitek
shows promise of being an offensive force. Having three switch
hitters in his starting nine (Offerman, Everett, Varitek) gives
Jimy Williams terrific flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING &QC; 
(FR) Overall ERA: 4.00.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Starters: 64-48, 4.04.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Relievers: 30-20, 3.93, 50/72 saves.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Strikeouts/walks: 1,131/469.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: A healthy Ramon Martinez would go a long way in
easing the loss of Bret Saberhagen, an uncertain contributor after
rotator cuff surgery. Tim Wakefield returns to the rotation, and
while Duquette will almost certainly add another recycled
journeyman before spring training, the hope is that one of the kids
(Brian Rose, Ohka, Pena) will step up. Huge key will be Derek Lowe,
who comes into camp as the closer. And then, of course, there's
Pedro. Says Reds GM Jim Bowden: ``There are not many impact players
in our sport. Not many Michael Jordans. Pedro Martinez is the
Michael Jordan of our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Fielding percentage: .979.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Errors: 127.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Offerman, even his critics must admit, was better
than advertised at second base, though his inability to turn the DP
is deadly in close games. Alexander, acquired from the Cubs in a
deal for Buford, will spell late-inning relief, and Williams will
find playing time for swiftie Donnie Sadler. Darren Lewis, so
splendid in center the last two seasons, gives the Sox a terrific
gloveman coming off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees
</P>
<P>
   (FR) 1999 finish: 98-64, first. World Series champions. Defeated
Rangers in Division Series, 3-0; defeated Red Sox in ALCS, 4-1;
defeated Braves in World Series, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Additions: OF Terry Jones, RHP Jake Westbrook.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Subtractions: RHP Hideki Irabu, RHP Dan Naulty, OF Chad
Curtis, DH Chili Davis, C Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Prospects: 1B Nick Johnson, SS Alfonso Soriano, OF Jackson
Melian, LHP Eddie Yarnall, SS D'Angelo Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE &QC;

   (FR) Walks/strikeouts: 718/978.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Leadoff on-base percentage: .387.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Stolen bases/caught stealing: 104/57.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The Yankees exercised the contract options on
lefty sluggers Darryl Strawberry and Paul O'Neill, both 36, and
despite the retirement of Davis, there still isn't much wiggle room
for kids like the slugging Johnson (.345, 14 HRs, 87 RBIs in Double
A) to crack the lineup. Johnson may have to wait until next season,
when Tino Martinez may have moved on as a free agent. Girardi's
departure allows Jorge Posada to become the everyday catcher. Yanks
still waiting on Ricky Ledee to seize the left-field job, with
Jones, picked up from the Dodgers, a candidate for the utlity role
held last season by Curtis. There is no more patient, disciplined
lineup in the game than this one, with Derek Jeter and Bernie
Williams odds-on MVP favorites once more.
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING &QC; 
(FR) Overall ERA: 4.13.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Starters: 71-50, 4.33.

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Strikeouts/walks: 1,111/581.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Yankees will give rookie Yarnall first shot at
winning the fifth spot in the rotation vacated by Irabu, who was
shipped off to Montreal. Bombers gave David Cone a $12 million,
one-year deal, which makes for a very expensive last hurrah, and so
far have made no move to extend the contract of Roger Clemens, who
has his World Series ring but doesn't inspire the same fear he once
did. El Duque (Orlando Hernandez) clearly is the king of this
rotation, and with a deep setup crew to support the peerless
Mariano Rivera, the Yanks will be favored to make it four pennants
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Fielding percentage: .982.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Errors: 111.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: Chuck Knoblauch's 26 errors presumably were an
aberration. His misadventures throwing the ball are the only
blemish on a team that rarely beats itself.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Devil Rays
</P>
<P>
   (FR) 1999 finish: 69-93, fifth, 29 GB.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Stolen bases/caught stealing: 73/49.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The Devil Rays had the biggest dropoff in
attendance in the big leagues last season, so owner Vince Naimoli
went out and increased the team's payroll from $37 million to
around $60 million by importing some big-name veterans. Castilla,
who came from Colorado in a nine-player, four-team trade, and free
agent Vaughn add 78 home runs to a middle of a lineup that got 66
home runs last season from a rejuvenated Fred McGriff and
part-timer Jose Canseco. Williams, who unexpectedly developed into
the Braves' leadoff man last season, will assume the same role for
the D-Rays.

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Strikeouts/walks: 1,055/695.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: LHP Wilson Alvarez's second half suggested he may
be ready to become the No. 1 the D-Rays expected him to be, and if
so, Tampa Bay should have a much better rotation, even though it
lost Arrojo in the Castilla deal. Tampa Bay gave Juan Guzman a
two-year, $13 million deal, and took a flier on Trachsel, who
probably falls somewhere between the 18-game loser he was with the
Cubs last season and the 15-game winner he was in '98. RHP Ryan
Rupe was 8-9 as a rookie, and former Indians swingman Ogea is
another possibility. Roberto Hernandez remains a big-time closer.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Fielding percentage: .978.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Errors: 135.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The league's oldest starting lineup won't be
making too many highlight reels with its glove work. The only way
it gets worse is if Canseco begins wearing leather again.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays
</P>
<P>
   (FR) 1999 finish: 84-78, 14 GB.

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Stolen bases/caught stealing: 119/48.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: The Blue Jays weren't as good as people thought
they'd be last season, and they probably won't be as bad as some
would like to think after they traded budding superstar Green to
the Dodgers. Mondesi still has the raw skills of a 30-30 man and is
the type who could easily become the matinee idol he never was for
the Dodgers in Hollywood. GM Gord Ash made sure that slugging DH
Carlos Delgado can't follow Green out of town until after next
season at the earliest. Rookie Wells comes into camp projected as
the starting center fielder; Wells, 21, was rated the top prospect
in the Florida State League, Southern League, and International
League, and had a four-hit game in his big-league debut. SS Tony
Batista, who had a combined 31 home runs for the Diamondbacks and
Blue Jays, was signed to a four-year deal.

</P>
<P>
   (FR) Strikeouts/walks: 1,009/575.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: RHP Joey Hamilton, who won just eight games
because of shoulder problems last season, threw this week for the
first time since season-ending surgery, and the Jays are cautiously
optimistic for the start of spring training. After dealing former
Cy Young Award winner Hentgen to the Cardinals, they are counting
upon the kids, Roy Halladay and Chris Carpenter, to pick up the
slack. David Wells won 17 games and logged 230-plus innings, but
his back remains a potential source of concern. Billy Koch, a
30-save man as a rookie, could become one of the league's best. If
these kids mature all at once, Toronto could be formidable.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE &QC; 
(FR) Fielding percentage: .983.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Errors: 106.
</P>
<P>
   (FR) Comments: There's lots of speed in the outfield and Alex
Gonzalez, back from shoulder surgery, returns to play short,
allowing Batista to slide over to third in place of the departed
Fernandez.

DOWNSIZING LEAVES LPGA IN GREAT SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   He doesn't have Tiger Woods, the one-man ratings insurance
policy. Sponsors aren't knocking at his door with blank checks. And
major network exposure remains a luxury he can only wish for.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ty Votaw does have is a firm grip on reality, a healthy
dose of perspective, if you will. He is the commissioner of the
Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, which has been an
organized part of the sports landscape for 50 years. That makes it
the longest-running women's sports association in the world, a fact
that it will trumpet in celebratory style throughout 2000. Votaw is
rightfully proud of the LPGA Tour's place in history, but he
deserves credit for assuming a strong leadership at a time when it
is needed most.
</P>
<P>
   Too many people in charge subscribe to the theory that more is
better. Votaw thinks quality, not quantity, is the goal. ``I think
there was much discussion (after he took over for Jim Ritts in the
spring of 1999) _ do we have too many events, do we have too few
events, what's the right number?'' said Votaw during a State of the
LPGA Tour address a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for 2000 is 40, down three events from a year ago.
Some would see that as not a very good indicator, but Votaw isn't
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good that 40 is certainly right there in the
middle of our range,'' said Votaw. ``I am very confident in saying
that the LPGA is in its best position, both financially and
competitively, from an operational point of view, than it's ever
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tournaments were lost (including the one at Pleasant Valley
in Sutton) and some sponsors left (Sara Lee among them). But
tournaments were added (including the Evian Masters in France) and
new sponsors (Electrolux and State Farm most significantly) joined.
The purses aren't the $3 million-$5 million jackpots that the men
play for, but they are nothing to snicker at, unless $550,000 to
$800,000 is pocket change to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the purse amounts of the events that have gone
off our schedule versus the purse amounts that we are adding to the
schedule,'' said Votaw, ``there is no question in our minds that
the LPGA is in a very healthy position.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a tribute not only to the stars of today, but to those
who blazed a difficult trail. Again to his credit, Votaw made sure
the women of yesteryear were honored at the LPGA Tour's 50th
anniversary gala last Monday in Palm Beach, Fla. The night of
champions, which honored present standouts such as Karrie Webb
(Player of the Year), also saluted eight LPGA Tour founders (Alice
Bauer, Patty Berg, Bettye Danoff, Marlene Hagge, Betty Jameson,
Marilynn Smith, Shirley Spork, and Louise Sugg), not to mention
pioneers such as Susie Berning, Peggy Kirk Bell, and Shirley
Englehorn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 people attended the dinner, and while much of the
attention would soon shift to the season-opening tournament _ The
Office Depot _ it was rewarding to see such a significant sports
group pay homage to players from previous eras.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger beat
</P>
<P>
   Woods's streak of consecutive victories is at five, his uncanny
ability to rise to the occasion is unmatched (12 victories the 13
times he has had a 54-hole lead), his thirst for success is
unrelenting, and somehow he seems to be getting better and better.
It's frightening, perhaps, to the lads whose livelihood requires
them to tee it up against him, but it is a delightful time for
those of us who love to follow the PGA Tour. We live in an age in
which we are hardly ever delivered what is advertised, but in Woods
we have the rarity _ someone who has not only lived up to the hype
but far surpassed it. Though just 24, Woods has been ballyhooed for
more than 10 years and he has been securing national championships
annually since 1991. Except for a few public relations hiccups, he
has done it all with an honest work ethic and great character. The
most serious charge against him? That perhaps he displays too much
emotion on the course. Compare that with the behavior of the pro
and collegiate athletes who at times make reading the sports
section a nauseating endeavor and there's no wonder Woods that has
taken over for his pal Michael Jordan as the world's most engaging
sports personality. As Jordan did before him, Woods makes you stop
and watch, regardless of your interest in golf. Critics can nitpick
and say the streak is spread across five months and two different
seasons, or that four of the victories have come in limited-field
events. But isn't it better to enjoy the ride he is giving us? He
has, after all, outplayed some iron (Phil Mickelson, Davis Love,
Ernie Els twice) during this streak, and for perspective on what he
has already accomplished at 24, consider these numbers: In 71 PGA
Tour starts, Woods has 16 wins and two majors; Jack Nicklaus, in
the same number of events, had 14 and three. In other words, if his
goal is to be the best ever, he seems to be right on schedule . . .
Woods has missed just one cut in his PGA Tour career (we do not
count that AT&AMP;T debacle two years ago), and is riding a streak of
44 straight. Chris Perry is next with 27 . . . Speculation is that
Woods will next tee it up at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach (Feb. 3-6),
which would likely start a stretch of four straight events (Buick
Invitational, Nissan Open, and Andersen Consulting World Match
Play). There is, however, the possibility that he could play
Phoenix, then skip the AT&AMP;T, but with the US Open at Pebble Beach
in June, it seems likely he'll put up with a few rounds of
celebrity silliness (perhaps paired with Jordan?) to brush up on a
layout you can always learn something about . . . On the day he
would have turned 43 _ Jan. 30 _ Payne Stewart will be remembered
with a special slate of programs on The Golf Channel. Officials at
The Memorial, meanwhile, have taken the unusual step of announcing
Stewart as the special honoree for 2001. Nicklaus will be honored
this year on the occasion of the event's 25th anniversary . . .
Monday marks the fifth anniversary of The Golf Channel, prompting
many of us to wonder how we survived without it. At the end of
1999, some 30 million homes worldwide had been plugged in to TGC .
. . Casey Martin's debut as a member of the PGA Tour is Wednesday,
in the first round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, but what
should be a moment to embrace is approaching beneath a cloud of
worry. First, Martin's right leg, the one ravaged by
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber Syndrome, is giving him problems. ``It
doesn't feel very good at all right now,'' Martin said via
teleconference the other day. ``I've been struggling.'' There is
also the matter of the PGA Tour's appeal, which was heard by the
9th Circuit Court late in 1999, with a decision possible at any
day. If the PGA Tour were to win the appeal and Martin's right to a
cart were taken away, it would be a huge loss in the court of
public opinion at a time when pro golf is riding a wave of
popularity. Here's hoping that the Tour, if it were to win on
appeal, would do the decent thing and make a special exception for
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Changes ahead
</P>
<P>
   Two recent developments demonstrate that the superstars of golf
certainly have a collective voice that is listened to. First, by
all accounts, the PGA of America has agreed on a plan to distribute
funds to members of future Ryder Cup teams so that they can
determine which charities will benefit. It is something the players
had lobbied for, but it took a messy public controversy a month
before last September's matches at The Country Club to bring it to
a head. Chalk up a victory for the players, as you must regarding
another issue they had raised. Players did not like the fact that
the prestigious Tour Championship had lost its end-of-the-year
status when it was played the week before the inaugural American
Express Championship. David Duval was among those who thought the
trip from Houston (Tour Championship) to Spain (American Express)
was too much, and he skipped the $5 million WGC event to show that
he was serious. Jesper Parnevik also skipped Spain and Love gave
serious thought to doing so, though he eventually played. It is a
dilemma the players will face again this year (Nov. 2-5 for the
Tour Championship in Atlanta; Nov. 9-12 for the American Express in
Spain), but things will change. The PGA Tour announced that in 2001
the Tour Championship will be the season-ender, with the WGC
American Express moved up to September. While that solves one
problem, it creates another interesting scenario, as the Ryder Cup
will also be played in September 2001 at The Belfry in England.
Which probably explains why Tour officials are talking about moving
the WGC American Express to Scotland or Ireland in 2001, a long
iron from The Belfry. Few things make a golfer smile like a short
trip between events . . . Woods's triumph at the Mercedes
Championship had to be a tad unsettling to the folks at Buick who
recently turned over millions to the phenom to carry a golf bag
with the Buick name on it and to play in their tournaments. There
he was, pictured with important sponsors, accepting part of his
prize _ that's right, a Mercedes . . . This week's Office Depot
went off without Annika Sorenstam, who doesn't like to play much
early in the season. Grace Park, a rookie who very well could take
the Tour by storm, also was not in the field . . . Frequent-flier
mileage is piling up for Els. He crossed through 12 time zones to
get from his home in South Africa to Hawaii for the Mercedes and
this week's Sony Open. He goes next to Australia, then races back
to Los Angeles for the Nissan Open Feb. 17-20 . . . Greg Norman was
in a courtroom last week, one of the witnesses against Jack Hasson,
who is charged with selling fake or flawed jewelry to the rich and
famous of Southern Florida. One item in question was a diamond pin
that Norman later discovered had been treated with radiation to
bring out the color. He paid nearly $50,000 for it. Walter (``I
don't want to be a millionare; I just want to live like one'')
Hagen never had such worries. He merely had to find a place in
which to change into his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A mulligan
</P>
<P>
   There was an erroneous report circulating last week that Billy
Andrade and Brad Faxon had canceled the CVS Charity Classic, their
three-day event that made such a splashy debut last summer.
Fortunately for local golf fans, it was a reporter's mistake. All
systems are go for July 9-11 at Rhode Island CC in Barrington . . .
Massachusetts Golf Association officials have secured one of the
most spectacular layouts, Kittansett GC in Marion, to host their
first State Team Net Championship. It's great news for those who
enjoy competition but don't have a low enough handicap to get into
the State Amateur or State Four-ball. It will be a two-player
format, with clubs either choosing their representatives or
conducting a tournament to send the winners to one of perhaps three
statewide qualifying sites in September. The final at Kittansett
will be held Oct. 5 . . . If you squint and focus hard enough, you
can see the US Senior Open on the distant horizon _ the 2001 event
at venerable Salem CC, that is. Volunteers are being sought, and if
you are interested, call 978-927-4350.

IS CELTIC PUZZLE FALLING TO PIECES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no need to be coy, so I'll tell you now that the next
paragraph contains a trick question. It is tricky because it has
2+2 in its eyes and calculus in its soul. I don't think I've ever
seen a question wink and smirk, but if one could, this one would.
Now that you have been warned, here it is:
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with the Boston Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   The first part _ the easy part _ of the answer is that,
statistically, they are the worst defensive team in the NBA. If you
watch the Celtics play on the road, you need subtitles to
understand what they are doing. They have a power forward, Antoine
Walker, who has already taken 135 3-pointers, or 65 more than
necessary, after 35 games. (In fact, one day I'll tell you about my
Walker 3-point Budget Plan. He would be budgeted for 164, or 2 per
game, the entire season. If he exceeded his budget, he would be
penalized with over-the-limit fees and finance charges.)
</P>
<P>
   Those are the simple issues, but the Celtics have more
complicated ones:
</P>
<P>
   --They have Rick Pitino on their masthead as ``president,''
although Pitino believes he needs to clarify that title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a president,'' Pitino said, ``but I'm not a Red
Auerbach-type of president. I'm basically the president of
basketball operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not what Pitino had in mind when he signed
his 10-year contract in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   --They have their Merrimac Street offices buzzing over the
firing of Joe DiLorenzo, a popular executive whose most recent
project was pushing for the team's $32 million training facility
(and subsequent multimillion-dollar naming-rights deal). Because of
the suddenness of the firing (``I found out a half-hour before it
happened,'' Pitino said), several employees are afraid that they
will be next.
</P>
<P>
   --They have a problem selling tickets. Last Monday they had a
head-shaving promotion to lure fans into the FleetCenter. The
promotion made one wonder whether a tripleheader featuring the
76ers and Knicks were next.
</P>
<P>
   --They are simultaneously thrifty and excessive. During the
holidays, some employees were said to have personally delivered
ornaments to businesses because the Celtics didn't want to pay
extra postage. In 1997, the Celtics renovated their Merrimac Street
offices and now have significant space there. But they have chosen
to take on an additional bill so M.L. Carr, who criticized the team
last season, will be away from Merrimac Street and in a Woburn
office.
</P>
<P>
   If you examine each of the previous items, you will probably see
what I see: an organization that is on the verge of turning over.
These are the things that happen in most businesses in transition.
There are ego clashes, broken promises, expense reports examined
with magnifying glasses, and several employees sending out resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Pitino. He is the president of the Celtics.
Consider that the president of the Boston Celtics found out about a
firing 30 minutes before it happened. In other words, the decision
was made without his input.
</P>
<P>
   When Pitino was asked about DiLorenzo, the president-coach was
sitting in one of the training facility's extra rooms. Pitino
realized the importance of that fact. Before DiLorenzo worked to
bring the new building to life, Pitino, his coaches, and his
players didn't have any extra space at Brandeis University. There
was a cramped weight room, a cramped coaches room that was used by
seven men, and the reality that the Celtics were visitors in the
home of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sad to see him go,'' Pitino said. ``He did a wonderful
job for us. Now, if you ask me why he was fired, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   I get the feeling that this is not the first difference of
opinion Pitino has had with Paul Gaston and Richard Pond, the
team's chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Pond
said he could not comment on the specifics of the firing. But when
he was told that some employees had described the firing as cold
(DiLorenzo found out before leaving on a Caribbean vacation), he
said, ``It's clear that (the employees) don't have knowledge of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach DiLorenzo, who was scheduled to return from his
vacation Saturday, were unsuccessful. The irony is that DiLorenzo
once had one of Pond's job titles _ chief financial officer _ and
received the news of his firing from Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to see anybody get fired,'' Pitino said. ``I've
never been fired, but I know it affects your self-esteem. Your
family suffers. It's a very difficult thing for anybody to go
through because there is a perception that you didn't do a good
job, and that wasn't the case with Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   This appears to be the preliminary stage for an offseason
upheaval. If the playoffs began today, the Celtics would be out of
them for the fifth consecutive season. Say Pitino's team finishes
37-45 and out of the playoffs. He reflects in the offseason about
his presidency, and how he doesn't have the control and budget that
he thought he would have. Would he leave, $21 million and bruised
ego in tow?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where would I go?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   To the college game, I replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see if I hadn't been at Kentucky,'' he said. ``But I
was at Kentucky, I came here and I'm going to do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But, I said, you could revive someone else's program.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he wouldn't ``feel comfortable'' leaving Boston
without completing his job.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, everyone is having a hard time doing a good job for
the Celtics. Pond said the business has changed dramatically since
the days the Celtics sold out Boston Garden. He also said that he
is ``absolutely in support'' of Pitino. Next to Gaston, Pond is the
most powerful man in the organization. Pitino didn't acknowledge
it, but perhaps he thought he would have that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   What he has is a bad team that plays before decent crowds. He
probably doesn't have the budget he wants. His Celtics winning
percentage is 42, which is about the same as the last two seasons
of the Chris Ford era. He has seen one very good employee,
DiLorenzo, fired and another one, Mark Lev, leave for a better job.
If his team keeps losing, there will be more problems. There are
always magnified problems on bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   What is wrong with the Boston Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   A lot. And I think things will get worse before they get better.

ODOM TALKING A GOOD GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While awaiting the arrival of ESPN The Suburb and ESPN The
Sanitarium, we will satisfy our craving for the almighty boo-yaw by
ripping through another printing of ESPN The Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This issue is a brutally hip read, and the generous graphics are
almost as easy on the eyes as a Bo Outlaw jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest to those of us who, ahem, jones on the NBA is its
profile of Clippers rookie Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   The title of this piece is ``O-Time,'' which (we checked our
cool conversion chart) ranks as an ironic echo of ``Showtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Boo-yaw.
</P>
<P>
   If asked to deliver the USA Today analysis of the ESPN Odom
story, we'd conclude that - as a Clippers employee - Lamar-velous
is attempting to conduct himself as a true pro while feeling as
miscast as Johnny Mathis in a karaoke bar.
</P>
<P>
   But its observations of the team's Odom risk-management history
are beyond played. Not to mention wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's source for Odom acquisition protocol is Jerry
DeGregorio, the high school coach hired by then-University of Rhode
Island coach Jim Harrick to recruit Odom and his NYC pals.
</P>
<P>
   After Harrick abandoned URI for Georgia, DeGregorio was given
his job as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   After Odom left school and was drafted by the Clippers, team
sources say DeGregorio sought employment as a Clips assistant coach
or personal mentor for the prized rookie.
</P>
<P>
   He shoots, he doesn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps coincidentally (insert wink here), DeGregorio supplied
ESPN The Magazine with quotes that suggest the Clippers did little,
if any, background check on Odom. Coach Chris Ford and Elgin
Baylor, the team's VP of basketball operations, didn't talk to him
about Lamar, Jerry D said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said he did have a chat with DeGregorio, but usually
prefers a more objective witness to a prospect's character. As is
common practice among NBA teams, the Clips hired an investigator to
run a background check on Odom and were satisfied with the report.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jeff Weltman, the Clippers' director of player
personnel, did have several phone conversations with DeGregorio
about Odom. Weltman risked dialing-finger amputation in his attempt
to lure the 6-foot-9 forward to L.A. for a pre-draft mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, that news escaped the ESPN dragnet.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the burden of cashing Clipper paychecks might be more
enjoyable for Odom if he walked more of his talk. To be sure, he's
a terrific kid who hates losing and generally competes like a
budding champion.
</P>
<P>
   But his solemn oaths to become physically stronger and add
considerable muscle to his mid-range jumper will sound hollow until
he begins arriving for practice early and leaving late.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan rules again?
</P>
<P>
   In a move that rivals the hiring of Wolfgang Puck to buy your
groceries, the Washington Wizards are about to give Michael Jordan
the power to make their player personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who admire his portfolio expect MJ to become a huge
front-office success.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're right.
</P>
<P>
   But this task could be far more challenging than winning NBA
titles with Bill Cartwright and Luc Longley in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Jordan name could be a bonanza in the free-agent derby
... if he can juggle the books and find salary cap room.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards currently have the sixth-highest payroll in the
league. Next year, they're on the hook as No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   After this season, they still owe Tracy Murray $10 million over
three seasons. Ike Austin, who lost the starting center gig to
Jahidi White, is due $11 million over two. Rod Strickland will
receive another $20 million over the next two seasons, while Mitch
Richmond is on the books for $30 million over three.
</P>
<P>
   The big ticket is forward Juwan Howard, a one-time Jordan
favorite whose contract is worth $56 million over the next three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, MJ can wait before spying on college prospects the
Wizards don't have a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's first crucial move may be choosing a coach who can help
him motivate the aforementioned millionaires after nobody bites on
a trade offer.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects in this rumor-driven cavalcade will include Kansas
coach Roy Williams (who recruited MJ for North Carolina), Jordan
pal Rod Higgins (a Golden State assistant) and former Georgetown
boss John Thompson, who happens to be a close personal pal of Dean
Smith and agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to beat the drum for Seattle's Gary Payton as
the game's best point guard, we turn your attention to Suns
playmaker Jason Kidd. Kidd frequently is credited with making his
teammates better, but could only make 26 of 88 field-goal attempts
(29 percent) while Phoenix's lost four of its last six games. ...
Although he still seems reluctant to take a big game by the throat,
Maryland forward Terence Morris remains high on everyone's list of
potential early picks in the 2000 draft. But many league watch dogs
report the 6-9 junior is leaning toward staying for his senior
season. ... According to a league source, Clipper guard Derek
Anderson will join Charlotte's Ricky Davis and Denver's Ron Mercer
in dumping the representation of Master P's No Limit Sports.
Anderson, in the last year of his initial three-year contract,
could go with Falk. The former Kentucky star is one of six NBA
players hand-picked by Jordan to wear his ``Jump Man'' shoes and
apparel. ... While posting an NBA-record 72 wins, Phil Jackson's
Chicago Bulls had six opportunities to avenge losses incurred in
the same 1995-'96 season. They won all six by an average of 20
points.

COWBOYS NEED TO FIND A COACH WHO CAN FIND OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' fourth coach in franchise history
couldn't survive the Cowboys' 40th season.
</P>
<P>
   So Chan Gailey is gone and Jerry Jones is power-shopping for a
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But before we start looking ahead, don't you think that this
anniversary season deserves to be remembered in some special way?
</P>
<P>
   A commemorative yellow flag might be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys ended their fourth decade with eight consecutive
road losses, six blown fourth-quarter leads, a league-leading 136
penalties for 1,196 yards, an offense that ranked behind
Cincinnati, Buffalo and Kansas City among others, a second
consecutive first-round loss in the playoffs, and an overall 8-9
record after a 3-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones is looking for Mr. Right to come in and get this team
back to a Super Bowl while Troy Aikman is still the quarterback,
Emmitt Smith is still the running back and the parts are in place,
in Jones' eyes, to make another title run.
</P>
<P>
   For Mr. Right, this means right now.
</P>
<P>
   In order to ``fix this thing'' _ Jones' words _ the Cowboys need
to start with the hiring of a coach who either knows the offense
that Jones has in mind and that Aikman has had success in running
before, or brings in an offensive coordinator who can provide this.
</P>
<P>
   While we aren't sure who will be the next coach of the Cowboys,
we do know what kind of offense the Cowboys will be running in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It's one that Aikman and the surviving core of veterans on this
team used under Jimmy Johnson (Norv Turner) and Barry Switzer
(Ernie Zampese) to win three Super Bowls in four years (1992-95).
That was before Gailey was brought in to replace Switzer and carry
out a campaign to improve the team's image and win championships.
</P>
<P>
   In Gailey's first season, the Cowboys went 10-6 and won the NFC
East. This season, the Cowboys couldn't put together consecutive
victories during the last three months and Gailey's offense went
from the NFL's eighth best in '98 to 16th best in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The new coach will inherit a team that was inconsistent,
self-destructive and undisciplined, and drove Gailey crazy with its
inability to ``play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't looking for somebody who can reinvent the wheel.
Rather, he's looking for somebody who can reconstruct the offense
to better fit the existing personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the Cowboys will require:
</P>
<P>
   Aikman to become comfortable with his receivers and in total
accord with the play calling.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers to stretch the field and complement Raghib
Ismail. Jason Tucker seems to have that capability. Chris Brazzell
still needs to prove himself. James McKnight (August knee surgery)
is a total unknown as a Cowboy. Michael Irvin faces a career
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end David LaFleur, entering his fourth NFL season, needs
to become a focal point of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers need to start running third-down routes ``beyond'' the
first-down marker.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers need to stop dropping balls.
</P>
<P>
   Players need to stop making penalties, especially the pre-snap
variety (false start, motion, illegal formation and delay of game).
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the most difficult aspect of the game today is
finding an offense that is ``really aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But when you find one, you generally win.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that ``offense won games and defense won
championships,'' but that has changed. Each of the NFL's top four
offenses _ St. Louis, Washington, Minnesota and Indianapolis _ are
playing this weekend for a chance to advance to conference
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't one preseason, one minicamp, one game away from,
all of a sudden, this being everything we wanted it to be,'' Jones
said at the news conference to announce Gailey's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that needs more than just a new coach. It's a
team that needs an offense that will get everybody on the same page
again.

JORDAN-WIZARDS: TROUBLING QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington forward Juwan Howard and assistant coach Wayne
``Tree'' Rollins nearly came to blows after a loss last week, so
the Wizards definitely need a distraction from their miserable
existence.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has been going nuts this week with the news Jordan would
try to assume a minority interest in the Wizards and be named
director of the team's basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations became so prolific in D.C., that even President
Clinton was asked for his opinion. ``It will be fun,'' he said.
``That's a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the glee, there are some troubling questions about
Jordan assuming control of a club. For one, there's his
relationship with super - agent David Falk, who has a stable of
superstars including Howard and Wizards point guard Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are prohibited from having management positions with
teams, but it's no stretch to think Falk would play some type of
``unofficial'' role if Jordan is the Wizards' CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point is whether Falk would be able to
represent Jordan as his agent. Under the NBA's player union rules,
agents cannot represent management.
</P>
<P>
   These are potential conflict-of-interest issues the NBA will
have to address.
</P>
<P>
   Falk's already the master of steering clients into certain
cities (see Alonzo Mourning to Miami), and there would probably be
some speculation about whether any his high-profile stars would
suddenly develop an interest in the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that if this deal ever gets finalized, it's
difficult to imagine how hard Jordan will work on the less
glamorous aspects of the job. Is someone who is used to having his
way prepared to haggle with other GM's, or work the phones
tirelessly seeking trades to improve the club?
</P>
<P>
   Will any of this get in the way of his golf game?
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the Wizards need more attention than the next
endorsement?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, no one will probably care, once Jordan joins the
Wizards. The positive P.R. will be too much for the Wizards to
worry about the little things.
</P>
<P>
   Give Jordan credit for one thing: At least he has the sense not
to try and coach -- so far.
</P>
<P>
   Survival story: Former Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley, banned
from the NBA for life in 1995 after substance abuse violations, has
gone to the league's version of Siberia. Literally.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley is playing for a team in Perm, located in Russia's Ural
Mountains, before crowds of 800 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good team, and I want to be part of something
good,'' Ta rpley told the Dallas Morning News. ``They make me
really comfortable and make me want to go out and give 200 percent
on and off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley is so happy to be playing again he isn't even
complaining about the Siberian winters: ``I was born in New York,
and I'm used to the cold. I missed it. I wanted a white
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Not their Master: Denver guard Ron Mercer and Charlotte gua rd
Ricky Davis recently fired rapper Master P as their agent, and
Davis sai d Clippers guard Derek Anderson would also follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, whose real name is Percy Miller, has tried out for
the Horne ts and Raptors the past two seasons. ``It started to fall
apart when he started trying to play basketball and stopped
concentrating on business, '' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored rookies: When the NBA announced who would play in the
rookie game on All-Star weekend, it gave an indication of who isn't
tearing up the league so far.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 overall pick, Charlotte's Baron Davis, No. 5 pick,
Jonathan Bender of Indiana and No. 7 pick, Richard Hamilton of
Washington, were the notable omissions.
</P>
<P>
   The bargain picks invited to the game were Celtics swingman
Adrian Griffin (undrafted), Sixers center Todd MacCulloch (second
round) and Nuggets forward James Posey (No. 18).
</P>
<P>
   A Hughes deal: The Sixers are offering point guard Larry Hughes
to virtually any takers. They asked Orlando for rookie Corey
Maggette, and the Magic are thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know how desperate the Sixers are to get rid of Hughes if
they accept the Warriors' offer of Chris Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talk of the Wizards shipping Ike Austin to Milwaukee
for Robert Traylor won't go away. The Nets are believed to be
interested in Hawks guard Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Popular coach: Vancouver's new coach, Lionel Hollins, continues
to impress his players.
</P>
<P>
   After playing five road games in seven days, the tired Grizzlies
arrived for practice this week. Hollins promptly canceled practice
and arranged a private screening of the Denzel Washington movie,
``The Hurricane,'' at the movie complex next to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins also had players draw teammates' names out of a hat to
exchange Christmas gifts. Shareef Abdur-Rahim drew Doug West's name
and gave the injury-prone guard the game Operation.
</P>
<P>
   West gave veteran power forward Antoine (Big Dawg) Carr a dog
calendar that had every dog's face replaced with Carr's picture.
</P>
<P>
   And finally: There's a lot of talk about whether the Lakers are
interested in Chicago's Toni Kukoc, but it should never be
forgotten that Bulls GM Jerry Krause has absolutely no interest in
helping former coach Phil Jackson.

`SOPRANOS' BACK, AND EVEN BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
 TV-GOODY-AZR  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the hype, the critical acclaim, the unreasonable love you
have for the show. Despite all that, one nagging question haunts
fans of The Sopranos:
</P>
<P>
   Can the second season possibly be as good as the first?
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the first three new episodes, the answer isn't just
``yes.'' The answer is that it might be even better.
</P>
<P>
   Already one of the greatest television series ever made, the HBO
hit about Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mobster with family problems _
of both the nuclear and criminal variety _ begins its second season
tonight, and it hits the ground running.
</P>
<P>
   It would be dirty pool to give too much away, but you will see
plenty of familiar faces. More important, stagnation hasn't set in
_ you'll meet compelling new characters as well. Which means new
headaches for beleaguered Tony, the psychiatrist-seeing capo played
so brilliantly by James Gandolfini.
</P>
<P>
   Gandolfini is, in fact, the not-so-secret ingredient of the
show's greatness. Even without him, The Sopranos would be
fantastic. But whenever he's on screen, it ups the intensity a
notch; you can't look away. NYPD Blue's Dennis Franz beating
Gandolfini for a Best Actor Emmy is a crime worthy of Tony himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good as Tony Soprano, and as born to the role, as
Regis was to host that stupid game show,'' says Bob Thompson,
founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television
at Syracuse University. ``It's one of those matches made in
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone else in the cast is perfect, whether it be Emmy
winner Edie Falco as Tony's wife, Carmela; Dominic Chianese as
Uncle Junior; or Nancy Mar chand, so good as Tony's mother, the
evil Livia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just are all so interest ing, and they all blend
together,'' says Dorothy Swanson, founder of Viewers for Quality
Television. ``You could almost not find fault with it, no matter
which charac ter you examine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cast additions Aida Turturro, as Tony's earth-mother sister,
Janice, and David Proval, as an old-time thug named Richie Aprile
just out of the joint, live up to that standard as well. I'm dying
to tell you how and why, but it wouldn't be fair to ruin it for
you.
</P>
<P>
   But that's how it is with great shows _ you want to run out and
blab about them with your friends. And make no mistake, The
Sopranos is a great show _ maybe even (dramatic pause) the greatest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best dramas ever done,'' Thompson says.
``It is one of the best series after only 13 episodes. Maybe it's
because there's only 13 episodes.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good point. Television traditionally has been a
series-based medium, and a successful series normally lasts at
least 22 episodes. And if a series gets good ratings _ and
therefore makes money for advertisers _ networks want to run it
forever, or at least until the dollars dry up. Quality be damned:
If it's making money, it stays on the air. That's why so many shows
fizzle out (MASH, Happy Days, Seinfeld) and so few have the courage
to end on a high note (The Mary Tyler Moore Show).
</P>
<P>
   ``On TV, Beethoven would have written the Fifth Symphony,''
Thompson says. ``At the end of the Fourth Movement, (the net work)
would say, `Could you add a movement?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet since it's not on a network, The Sopranos isn't bound by a
lengthy schedule. As with the excellent Larry Sanders Show and Oz _
also HBO products _ less can be more. The quality of the
productions is so high, it leaves you hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we've got this hybrid _ the long, extended story that can
take its time in the telling,'' Thompson says. ``But it doesn't
need all this padding. It doesn't have all these dog episodes in
between.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. So far, no Sopranos episode has missed the
mark. Part of the reason is realism. The Fox network, and later CBS
and ABC, famously passed on the series, and David Chase, the show's
creator, wound up looking to cable, wondering if anyone would ever
bother to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But network rejection was Chase's creative salvation. Cable gave
him a freedom he never would have enjoyed at a network. He didn't
have to write a mob series in which gangsters use words like
``dang'' and ``rats.'' And when someone gets shot, they actually
bleed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's HBO, so they can talk like gangsters really talk, which
gives it a sense of reality that we haven't had before,'' Swanson
says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the violence, it is more graphic than what you'll find on
network television. But it's never gratuitous. There are always con
sequences, and for all the talk about bloodshed, there is actually
surprisingly little on screen. Thus, when you do see someone
whacked, it carries that much more impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It advances the story,'' Swan son says of the show's violence.
``It's a part of who they are and what they do. I think the
sophisti cated viewer realizes that to them (mobsters), that's not
vio lence. That's the norm. That's what they do for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   But airing on HBO has its disadvantages. Not everyone sub
scribes to cable. That means two things: Those who don't get HBO
are missing out on a great show, and those who do get HBO are
besieged by requests to tape the show and pass it along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take HBO for The Sopra nos,'' Swanson says. ``Otherwise, I
probably wouldn't. The Sopra nos is really what I sit down to watch
TV for.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what we all should watch TV for. &QL;

POINT GUARD GOTTLIEB LEADS COWBOYS PAST BEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When Oklahoma State needs an assist, it calls on
Doug Gottlieb. This time the request was of a different nature.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th-ranked Cowboys, who have been battling post-holiday
offensive depression, received an unexpected offensive boost from
Gottlieb, their senior point guard. The nation's leader in assists
responded with a team-high 13 points as Oklahoma State overcame
Baylor, 56-41, in a Big 12 Conference game yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb, a 41.9 percent shooter who is averaging 7.2 points per
game, rescued an Oklahoma State team that had made under 40 percent
of its shots in two of its past three games. Against the battling
Bears, the Cowboys (13-1, 2-0) had stretches where they missed 14
of 19 shots in the first half and nine of 12 in the second half.
``We've been working on things in practice where we simulate the
other team backing off me,'' said Gottlieb, who is averaging 9.9
assists per game. ``I've gotten more confident on what shots are
going to be there. I've got to make teams pay for leaving me
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Most defensive strategies used against Oklahoma State involve
forcing Gottlieb to shoot. Yesterday, the Bears (9-5, 0-3) allowed
Gottlieb to sneak inside for five layups. And when he wasn't
scoring, Gottlieb was making Oklahoma State's offense click. As the
Cowboys broke open a close game midway through the first half,
Gottlieb either scored or assisted on 12 of the team's next 17
field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State closed the first half by hitting nine consecutive
shots, taking a 31-20 lead. Baylor pulled to within 35-29 in the
first eight minutes of the second half. But, with the shot clock
fading, Gottlieb _ a 17 percent shooter from 3-point range _ hit a
3-pointer to make restore order. The cold-shooting Bears never
threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 3-pointer he hit was the shot of the game,'' Baylor coach
Dave Bliss said. ``He's a man among boys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gottlieb picked a fine time to lead his team in scoring.
Yesterday was his birthday. So how old are you, Doug?
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty four,'' he said, trying his best to whisper.
``Everybody was calling me grandpa, but I'm not the only old guy on
the team. Two years ago, I played one of the worst games of my
career here. It was good to come down here this time and play
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, which has lost 19 consecutive regular-season conference
games, is averaging 42.3 points in Big 12 play. The bad-news Bears
are shooting 32.6 percent from the field and a woeful 16.3 percent
from 3-point range in three Big 12 games. And five of their 16
field goals yesterday were the result of Oklahoma State turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried hard on defense,'' said Bliss, noting his team took
more shots, had more steals and forced more turnovers than the
Cowboys. ``If we could score ... that's a big if. We're just not a
good shooting team.''

DESPITE ITS POVERTY, SCHOOL DISTRICT RICH IN PATRIOTISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALENA, Kan. _ Before the holiday break last month, the Galena
High School junior class gave plaques to Principal Ray Dykens,
media instructor Terry Grotheer and American history teacher Brad
Krouse. The plaques were a thank-you for a Veterans Day program in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' Dykens thought. ``It's supposed to work the other way.
Teachers award plaques, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dykens relished the role reversal. Galena's students have
turned Nov. 11 into a day when elderly men and women tell stories
about sacrifice, loss, and love; and teen-agers reveal themselves
not to be the hobgoblins often portrayed in the news.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans Day, usually a ho-hum, get-it-over-with day in many
schools, has become a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   It was even bigger last year. Galena kids _ kindergarten through
12th grade _ raised $1,000 for the National World War II Memorial
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the $100 million cost of the memorial, due for its
groundbreaking next fall and its opening in 2002, that's chump
change.
</P>
<P>
   Except: Families of 60 percent of the students here are beneath
the poverty line, and the district is the state's poorest in terms
of assessed valuation. A thousand bucks here is serious money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my brothers is 18, and I can't imagine him having to do
what they did back then,'' said Leslie LaTurner, a junior. ``I
think it (the memorial) will be wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Bob Lewis, education director for the memorial's
campaign, based in Arlington, Va., about $60 million has been
raised, the majority from corporations, foundations, veterans
organizations, the states, and civic and fraternal groups.
Individuals have donated about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the campaign, which is led by former Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, was beginning its school program this winter in conjunction
with cable TV's History Channel. The aim, he said, was to alert
youths to the memorial and teach them why World War II was
important.
</P>
<P>
   Which has been the idea here in Galena for a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember exactly the circumstances, '' said Dykens,
who spent 30 years in the Missouri National Guard and whose father
landed at Omaha Beach on D-Day. ``But you know the drill. You get a
kid in the office who's been acting up, he rolls his eyes and says,
in so many words, that this country owes him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykens said that attitude didn't wash here. Galena, he said, a
``kind of a stiff blue-collar town,'' has for years had a goal in
its curriculum to teach students to ``honor your country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every school district has something like that,'' Dykens
said. ``But things get busy, there's other things to do, and those
words just stay there in the handbook. Nothing happens. Well, we
decided writing it down wasn't enough. Kids needed to know others
had made sacrifices for them. Those words meant something.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea here was simple. On Nov. 11, veterans would be asked to
come to school as guests. Any man or woman veteran _ World War II,
Korea, Cold War, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, even
Bosnia. Plus their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a lunch, music and some visiting between the
students and the veterans. The program would last a hour, maybe
two.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started in a classroom, then it grew bigger and bigger, and
now we're in the auditorium,'' said Grotheer, whose father was with
the Army's 76th Division in Europe in World War II. ``Now it's the
students and the veterans talking nonstop. And now it's all day,
even more with the kids and the vets talking after school.''
</P>
<P>
   Krouse said the anticipation of the students, who organize and
run the program, was amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids get real excited,'' he said. ``Already they are
talking about next year. How we can make it bigger and better. It's
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykens, Krouse and Grotheer agreed that the magic of the day was
the interaction between the students and the veterans and their
spouses. What were called ``interviews'' quickly became
storytelling sessions. Not of blood and guts, hairbreadth escapes
or heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Likely as not the tales were about young men and women, not much
older than the listeners, who rode lonely trains to isolated army
posts; the last sight of a high school buddy who disappeared
forever into the maw of war; or even the shortages and tiny ration
stamps that were needed to buy everything from tires to beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids hear that sugar or coffee was almost impossible to get,
and you can just see their eye get wide,'' said Grotheer. ``What's
amazing is that some of the veterans now show up with mementos,
stuff you just know they've never shown to anybody outside their
family before.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, said junior Kerry Green, the older people get to look
at today's youth up close and personal ``and find out that we're
really interested in them. And that we're not the kids that get all
the publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's grandfather, Terry Ward, a Korean War veteran, went to
the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Dykens said it was not unusual to see tears _ from young and
old.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the National World War II Memorial, the school
bought a 20-foot flagpole and raffled it. A chance was $1. The
winning ticket was sold by a second-grader. That brought in $1,000.
Other money came in later as memorials, bringing the total to
$1,155.
</P>
<P>
   Two schools, one in Tennessee, the other in Oregon, each raised
$10,000, said Lewis. The still-fragmentary records the campaign had
of school giving showed Galena as about average or above, he said.
He added that he was amazed at the giving in light of the school's
assessed valuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' he said of the donation. ``Give me their
number. I want to call them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Emerson, state director for Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas,
who accepted the donation, said the program in Galena was something
to see _ flags, a military helicopter parked out front,
enthusiastic young people and more-than-pleased older ones.

   ``It was something,'' she said. ``I was just blown away.

LaTurner, to the program, said it made her appreciate him all the

 ARIZONA IS GROUND ZERO IN
 AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS. 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Arizona Republic  
 
 this is an introduction to an eight-
 day special report 
 
Every day, guerrilla smugglers invade the state's southern border
with payloads of pot, coke, meth and smack. The drugs are spread
across the country _ to schoolkids in New York, to stockbrokers in
Phoenix, to farm workers in Seattle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has spent billions of tax dollars on border
checkpoints, undercover agents, air patrols and money-laundering
probes. We've crisscrossed the globe with agents, developed an
arsenal of technologi cal goodies to ferret out narcotics, even
aimed spy satellites at Colom bia to count the coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   From Agua Prieta to Yuma, dope smugglers and impoverished
illegals dodge a gantlet of interdiction forces. Government agents,
most of them dedicated and downtrodden, hunt down the dumb and
unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   The result: As a new millennium dawns, agents along the
Southwest ern border are seizing more drugs than ever. Yet they've
barely made a dent.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona alone, more than 150,000 people were arrested for
drug of fenses during the 1990s. Nationwide, prisons teem with a
quarter-million dope offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many are locked up, new drug runners and users
take their places, spawning an epidemic of crime, cost and social
calamity.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is inescapable: The fight against narcotics, which
costs Ameri cans nearly $18 billion a year, is the nation's most
failed police action since Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   During a seven-month investigation, Arizona Republic reporters
spoke to dozens of drug officers, smugglers, drug counselors and
residents on la frontera, the 350-mile border sepa rating Arizona
from Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   They reviewed law enforcement files, court records,
congressional reports, expert research, drug legalization tracts
and literature from the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every voice, every report, reaches the same conclusion:
The drug war isn't being won, and it's not about to be won _ not as
long as the United States is rich and Latin American countries are
poor; not as long as one has drugs and the other wants them.

SPRINT MERGER WILL BRING EXTENSIVE JOB CUTS, ANALYSTS AGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For years Sprint Corp. Chief Executive
William T. Esrey intoned a single mantra: ``We have what it takes
to go it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sprint has agreed to merge with MCI WorldCom Inc.,
however, Esrey has adopted a new theme, this one aimed at quelling
concerns about the merger's effect on more than 18,000 area
employees and the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new WorldCom will have revenues of $50 billion a year,
growing 20 percent a year. Our problem is not how to get rid of
people, but how we get enough qualified individuals to run that
immense engine of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Business plans, however, have a way of changing when it comes to
megamergers. Executives must placate regulators and wring savings
out of the combined companies to meet the demands of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the situation at newly merged Exxon Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger of Exxon and Mobil was announced, executives
estimated that about 9,000 jobs would be eliminated. But a month
after the deal was final, that figure jumped to 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes could be coming as Sprint and MCI WorldCom sort
through a combined 150,000 employees, observers say. Particularly
vulnerable will be those who work in overlapping areas such as
Internet backbone businesses and long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the consensus among two dozen investment analysts,
market researchers and industry consultants interviewed for this
article is that job cuts will be extensive, given the considerable
redundancies in the two companies' operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those observers presume that WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J.
Ebbers will remain true to form and waste little time selling off
businesses and shedding unnecessary employees to please Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is that the overlap is humongous,'' said Frank
Dzubeck, an analyst with Communications Network Architects in
Washington. ``There's a huge amount of redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Weigman, senior vice president of marketing for Sprint,
said it was not accurate to make direct comparisons to other
mergers or MCI WorldCom's past deals. He emphasized, for example,
that the still-recent merger of MCI and WorldCom was almost a
hostile takeover, whereas the Sprint deal was consensual.
</P>
<P>
   Weigman acknowledged that there would be ``changes in the
overall configuration of the company'' after the deal and ``some
degree of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Former employees at MCI Communications and Brooks Fiber
Properties _ both of which merged with WorldCom in the last two
years _ heard employment assurances when their companies were
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Shinogle, a software technician at American Century
Investments in Kansas City, left MCI after his job was outsourced
to another company in the wake of the merger with WorldCom. He
counsels Sprint employees to brace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get it straight,'' Shinogle said. ``They call it a
merger. But WorldCom bought them out _ lock, stock and barrel. They
just use that term to make folks feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four months have passed since announcement of what was at
the time the biggest merger in history.
</P>
<P>
   But the only concrete employment news offered to Sprint workers
so far is that Esrey and Sprint President Ronald LeMay will have
important jobs with the new company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Esrey, that is about all they can say right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition teams won't even be formed and start to operate
until the end of the first quarter, until we get further along in
the Department of Justice review,'' Esrey said in a recent
interview, referring to the process of seeking regulatory approval.
``Until the work begins, we can't begin to have answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term success of the merger, however, depends in large
part on the companies' ability to meet their cost-savings numbers,
and achieving that goal depends on their ability to streamline
operations.
</P>
<P>
   By their own estimates, MCI WorldCom and Sprint expect to
generate operating ``synergies'' of $9.7 billion in the first four
years after the merger is completed. The largest part of those
savings _ $5.5 billion _ is slated to come from sales, general and
administrative expenses, the largest part of which is salaries and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey's preferred term for ``layoffs'' is ``dislocations.'' He
acknowledged that there would be some but said they should not hit
Sprint employees any harder than MCI WorldCom's.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom and MCI said there would be no large layoffs when they
agreed to merge. But in late 1997, just as the deal was announced,
MCI undertook a reorganization and shed 4,500 employees, according
to the company's quarterly reports.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company also announced a layoff in December 1998
that affected perhaps 1,800 employees. Former employees also say
that many thousands of employees' lives have been disrupted, either
through smaller layoffs, undesirable transfers or departures
through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Pierce, an analyst with Giga Information Group, an
independent market research and consulting firm in Cambridge,
Mass., wrote in a recent report that ``5,700 MCI employees were let
go after the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, she thinks Sprint's layoff numbers will look even
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that Sprint has a better data network and
technical staff than MCI WorldCom, it is also likely that
WorldCom's preference for its own people and methods makes the need
for Sprint's obsolete, and therefore its data networks, technicians
and network operations center would be drastically downsized,
phased out or spun off,'' Pierce wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Koppman, an analyst with the San Jose, Calif.-based market
research firm Dataquest, was quite pointed in his analysis of the
likely effects on Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI will waste little time after closing before cutting staff
to justify the deal, which will probably mean discarding a
significant portion of Sprint's long-distance staff, particularly
middle management and overhead functions'' such as human resources,
finance, payroll, strategic planning and audit, Koppman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers noted on the day the merger was announced that WorldCom's
employment numbers had never gone down from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   But the 77,000 employees the company said it had on that day was
3,700 fewer than the total reported by MCI Communications and
WorldCom before their merger.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about the apparent decline in employment, MCI
WorldCom officials revised their head count to 83,263. They said
that, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, employment grew 8.7
percent between September 1998 and September 1999. Beyond that they
declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's long-distance division employs 6,550 in Kansas City and
20,500 across the country. Its corporate, administrative head count
is 5,200, with 4,100 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have said that where redundancies exist, WorldCom
will hire the best from both operations, encouraging employees to
compete for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Koppman acknowledged the sentiment but said he thought voluntary
and involuntary layoffs would be weighted to the Sprint side, with
upper management staffed by Ebbers' close associates and Sprint
management having limited authority and effect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the very reason that MCI WorldCom is a Wall Street
darling is Ebbers' success in digesting past acquisitions and
slashing corporate overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey emphasizes that every merger is different. There are no
plans to sell or shutter any of Sprint's operations. Construction
of the $920 million campus in Overland Park will continue. The new
WorldCom will remain a force in the community.
</P>
<P>
   He also says local employment will actually rise over the long
term. Esrey points to the rapid growth of the Sprint PCS wireless
division in saying that, long-term, area employment will grow after
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers said the same thing to Sen. John Ashcroft, prompting
enthusiastic comments about the deal from the Missouri Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Norris, the former senior vice president of global
engineering at MCI, expects there will be a larger effect on
managers than on anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always too many barn bosses after these deals'' he
said. ``Certainly there will be some fallout after this deal, but
it's really at the VP level and up.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting redundant employees, analysts say, the
new WorldCom is likely to focus on high-growth areas of the
business _ wireless, Internet, international and broadband data _
and sell some of the others.
</P>
<P>
   For MCI WorldCom, the jewel in Sprint's crown is Sprint PCS,
says Mark Zohar of Forrester Research. He sees all or parts of
other divisions being dismantled and sold, partly to mollify
regulators, mostly to focus WorldCom's strategic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can liquidate assets and plow the proceeds back into
your really high-growth businesses, you get better bang for your
buck and streamline your vision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials acknowledge that they will probably have to
sell Sprint's Internet backbone business, the physical
infrastructure that provides connectivity to the Internet, to pass
regulatory muster. It is unclear how many employees would be
affected by that move.
</P>
<P>
   As the pressure mounts on the companies to show that the merger
is not anti-competitive in the long-distance market, they might
consider selling the parts of Sprint's long-distance network that
are redundant with MCI WorldCom's.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are emphatically opposed to any forced
divestitures of long-distance assets. But investment bankers put
the value of Sprint's long-distance division at $30 billion.
Selling redundant assets may make sense, analysts say. Again, the
division employs 6,550 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey insists that the new company will retain Sprint's local
division and that its 8 million local access lines will become an
integral part of the company's strategy to introduce broadband
services to local customers. Last week Ebbers pledged to roll out
those services in rural areas in the year after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think the local assets eventually will be very
valuable. Others think the company will ultimately pare back the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Providing local telephone service is capital-, labor- and
management-intensive, they say. The local telephone businesses that
Sprint owns in 18 states are primarily in more rural areas, where
demand for new services such as high-speed Internet is generally
lower and upgrading equipment to provide them is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very profitable, but they're a distraction,'' said
Pierce, the analyst with Giga Information Group. ``Dealing with all
those state regulators is a real pain in the petunia. They could
take that money and pump it into expanding their global networks or
fixed wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's local telephone division employs 26,000, with almost
5,000 in Kansas City. According to estimates that investment
bankers worked up in the companies' merger negotiations, it could
be worth $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The local division has been cutting costs to bring its revenue
and costs per employee in line with those of the regional Bell
companies but has yet to meet those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see (the local operations) disappearing at some point,''
said Mel Marten, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``Maybe
not right away, but even the Baby Bells have been selling their
more regional properties. They're too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also think Sprint's equipment business, Sprint North
Supply, and its directory publishing unit could be sold to raise
money in the wake of the merger. The two businesses employ 2,583;
the company was unable to break out local employees.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, MCI WorldCom recently sold MCI Systemhouse, a systems
integration business, to Electronic Data Systems of Plano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, MCI WorldCom also outsourced much of its
information technology and software development work to EDS. That
contract rippled through the ranks as 9,200 MCI jobs were
transferred to EDS.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has a business similar to MCI Systemhouse, Sprint
Paranet, that employs 1,728 in Texas. Analysts think WorldCom will
sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint also employs a legion of software engineers. Unlike MCI
WorldCom, it does much of its information technology work in-house
or with long-term contractors. That might change if the new company
adopts MCI WorldCom's model.
</P>
<P>
   ``WorldCom doesn't like software development,'' said Shinogle,
the former software tester, one of the 9,200 employees whose jobs
were transferred to EDS as part of the outsourcing contract.
``They'd rather farm it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the 600 people who worked in Brooks' St.
Louis headquarters have left the company or been let go, according
to several high-ranking former Brooks executives. Again, MCI
WorldCom would not comment on the specifics of their departures.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 20 former MCI and Brooks employees interviewed
for this article are still with the combined company. Some were
laid off. Others voluntarily left _ recognizing the opportunity in
today's job market _ or took severance packages that helped them
set up their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they were saying all the same things: that this is a
good thing, that we're all going to get rich from our stock,
benefits won't change,'' said Shinogle. ``What they say and reality
are two different things.''

QUESTIONS TRUMP ANSWERS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increas ing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how many people they're catching and how
much has gotten through all these years, they aren't slowing
anybody down,'' said David Alvarez, a federal public defender in
Tucson. &QL; 
DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. Blame to go

   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.

   In Juarez, the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso, citizens have
lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this
decade. This winter, U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering
graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped
and killed by the Jua rez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the diving board for drugs, and the United States is
the swimming pool where they land,'' De Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals, they could
not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers, said Adolfo
Garcia Morales, assistant state prosecutor for Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer,'' Garcia Mo
rales said. ``If we attack the causes, it will be much cheaper and
much more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to
their country or culture. But they are not naive about it.
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation's fab ric,
creating a narco-democracy, a country whose institutions are
increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of
dollars in profits per week,'' the U.S. General Accounting Office
reported 18 months ago. ``Profits of such magnitude enable the drug
traffickers to pay enormous bribes, estimated for one organi zation
to be as much as $1 million per week, to Mexican law en forcement
officials at the fed eral, state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials; witness the brib
ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But if America's enforcement machine is flawed, Mexico's is so
compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any
one across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can
troops and federal police are protecting drug loads, not seizing
them. Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was
exposed for aiding traffick ers he'd pledged to exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gately never got the chance to find out. The Clinton administra
tion, voicing diplomatic concerns, halted the operation in 1998.
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting
without its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When there's not diplomacy to consider, there's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, U.S. presidents preserve Mexico's trade status by
certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting ``favored
nation,'' despite ample evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the North American Free Trade Agreement, which knocked down
commerce barriers be tween countries, often pits anti-smuggling
efforts against U.S. business and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and
trade. But law enforcement agencies can't keep pace, and efforts to
tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement
because that's what it's become,'' Gately said. New approaches
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the struggle say they're tired of the way
America is waging its drug war. They say it's time to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for
eign aid to Mexico. Others want undercover investigations that
reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels. Some support sending
special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper
ations.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates, on the other hand, say the only answer is to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in
the drug war, when the problem is right here at home,'' said Gail
Rittenhouse, an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons, where up
to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems. ``What if we spent
at least half of that money on treatment, educa tion and
prevention?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ralls, a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a
Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent, said the
government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions.
So they hire more cops, pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build
more prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education for young kids,'' he said. ``There are
no signature programs for the people who use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence
and anti-crime zeal. Americans demand that drug users be ar rested,
unless it's their kids. They support long prison sentences for
smugglers, then cringe at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like New Mexico's Gov. Gary Johnson, have come to believe
the only solution is the legalization of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control it, tax it, regulate it, get control of a product that
is black-market,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, drug use declined by half while the annual
cost of the fight went from $1 billion to $17 billion. By that
math, Johnson argues, it will take $40 billion and 3.2 million
arrests to cut use by half again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-benefit analysis, this really stinks,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Johnson is a voice in the political wilder
ness. But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug
policies in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in several states, includ ing Arizona, have passed initia
tives approving marijuana for medical use. This year, another
initiative could be on Arizona's ballot to decriminalize the use of
smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug
offenses. Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war
that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically
unpalatable to most Americans. No war at all
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, isn't ready to surren
der the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to change, he said, is the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This metaphor, `war on drugs,' has gotten us into a lot of
problems,'' said McCaffrey, a decorated former Army general who now
heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``I understand
war, and this ain't no war. If it's a war, then we expect to
achieve total victory through violence and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as ``a cancer
affecting our community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk in terms of a cure, but you talk in terms of a
five-year survival rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, he says, federal drug policies have suc
ceeded: Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979, and
cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar would have a tough time, however, convincing
border narco-warriors that things are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado
into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those
standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street
from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, who spent a lifetime rising from
Douglas cop to police chief to judge. In an interview last sum mer,
he told of putting hundreds of drug smugglers and dealers behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years in the drug war, Borane allowed that U.S. inter
diction efforts are as useless as ``kicking sand at the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after that inter view, Borane was indicted on money
laundering charges stem ming from an FBI sting. Accord ing to court
records, an undercover agent coaxed the judge into a deal that
involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for
pot and coke.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-cop and ex-judge now faces trial and, if convicted,
prison time with the very people he once pursued from the other
side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder those left fighting the drug war question how much
good they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win it with law enforcement,'' said Kermit
Miller, a Tucson police narcotics captain and leader in southern
Arizona's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a task force of law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a stopgap. We're holding the line.'' When you think
about how many people they're catching and how much has gotten
through all these years, they aren't slowing anybody down. David
Alvarez Federal public defender in Tucson The way to cut off drugs
is to stop the consumer. If we attack the causes, it will be much
cheaper and much more effective. Adolfo Garcia Morales Assistant
state prosecutor for Sonora

<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increas ing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how many people they're catching and how
much has gotten through all these years, they aren't slowing
anybody down,'' said David Alvarez, a federal public defender in
Tucson. &QL; 
DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. Blame to go
around
</P>
<P>
   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger, then discover a better
high with cocaine and money. Radio stations play corridos, or
ballads, in honor of narco-lords.

QUESTIONS TRUMP ANSWERS IN WAR ON DRUGS

<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increas ing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how many people they're catching and how
much has gotten through all these years, they aren't slowing
anybody down,'' said David Alvarez, a federal public defender in
Tucson. &QL; 
DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. &QL; 
Blame to go around
</P>
<P>
   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger, then discover a better
high with cocaine and money. Radio stations play corridos, or
ballads, in honor of narco-lords.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso, citizens have
lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this
decade. This winter, U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering
graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped
and killed by the Jua rez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the diving board for drugs, and the United States is
the swimming pool where they land,'' De Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals, they could
not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers, said Adolfo
Garcia Morales, assistant state prosecutor for Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer,'' Garcia Mo
rales said. ``If we attack the causes, it will be much cheaper and
much more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to
their country or culture. But they are not naive about it.
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation's fab ric,
creating a narco-democracy, a country whose institutions are
increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of
dollars in profits per week,'' the U.S. General Accounting Office
reported 18 months ago. ``Profits of such magnitude enable the drug
traffickers to pay enormous bribes, estimated for one organi zation
to be as much as $1 million per week, to Mexican law en forcement
officials at the fed eral, state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials; witness the brib
ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But if America's enforcement machine is flawed, Mexico's is so
compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any
one across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can
troops and federal police are protecting drug loads, not seizing
them. Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was
exposed for aiding traffick ers he'd pledged to exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gately never got the chance to find out. The Clinton administra
tion, voicing diplomatic concerns, halted the operation in 1998.
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting
without its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When there's not diplomacy to consider, there's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, U.S. presidents preserve Mexico's trade status by
certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting ``favored
nation,'' despite ample evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the North American Free Trade Agreement, which knocked down
commerce barriers be tween countries, often pits anti-smuggling
efforts against U.S. business and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and
trade. But law enforcement agencies can't keep pace, and efforts to
tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement
because that's what it's become,'' Gately said. &QL; 
New approaches
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the struggle say they're tired of the way
America is waging its drug war. They say it's time to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for
eign aid to Mexico. Others want undercover investigations that
reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels. Some support sending
special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper
ations.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates, on the other hand, say the only answer is to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in
the drug war, when the problem is right here at home,'' said Gail
Rittenhouse, an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons, where up
to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems. ``What if we spent
at least half of that money on treatment, educa tion and
prevention?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ralls, a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a
Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent, said the
government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions.
So they hire more cops, pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build
more prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education for young kids,'' he said. ``There are
no signature programs for the people who use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence
and anti-crime zeal. Americans demand that drug users be ar rested,
unless it's their kids. They support long prison sentences for
smugglers, then cringe at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like New Mexico's Gov. Gary Johnson, have come to believe
the only solution is the legalization of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control it, tax it, regulate it, get control of a product that
is black-market,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, drug use declined by half while the annual
cost of the fight went from $1 billion to $17 billion. By that
math, Johnson argues, it will take $40 billion and 3.2 million
arrests to cut use by half again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-benefit analysis, this really stinks,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Johnson is a voice in the political wilder
ness. But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug
policies in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in several states, includ ing Arizona, have passed initia
tives approving marijuana for medical use. This year, another
initiative could be on Arizona's ballot to decriminalize the use of
smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug
offenses. Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war
that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically
unpalatable to most Americans. &QL; 
No war at all
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, isn't ready to surren
der the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to change, he said, is the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This metaphor, `war on drugs,' has gotten us into a lot of
problems,'' said McCaffrey, a decorated former Army general who now
heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``I understand
war, and this ain't no war. If it's a war, then we expect to
achieve total victory through violence and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as ``a cancer
affecting our community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk in terms of a cure, but you talk in terms of a
five-year survival rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, he says, federal drug policies have suc
ceeded: Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979, and
cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar would have a tough time, however, convincing
border narco-warriors that things are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado
into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those
standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street
from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the
cancer.
</P>

</P>

involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for

   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. Blame to go
around
</P>
<P>
   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger, then discover a better
high with cocaine and money. Radio stations play corridos, or
ballads, in honor of narco-lords.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso, citizens have
lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this
decade. This winter, U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering
graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped
and killed by the Jua rez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the diving board for drugs, and the United States is
the swimming pool where they land,'' De Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals, they could
not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers, said Adolfo
Garcia Morales, assistant state prosecutor for Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer,'' Garcia Mo
rales said. ``If we attack the causes, it will be much cheaper and
much more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to
their country or culture. But they are not naive about it.
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation's fab ric,
creating a narco-democracy, a country whose institutions are
increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of
dollars in profits per week,'' the U.S. General Accounting Office
reported 18 months ago. ``Profits of such magnitude enable the drug
traffickers to pay enormous bribes, estimated for one organi zation
to be as much as $1 million per week, to Mexican law en forcement
officials at the fed eral, state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials; witness the brib
ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But if America's enforcement machine is flawed, Mexico's is so
compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any
one across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can
troops and federal police are protecting drug loads, not seizing
them. Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was
exposed for aiding traffick ers he'd pledged to exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gately never got the chance to find out. The Clinton administra
tion, voicing diplomatic concerns, halted the operation in 1998.
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting
without its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When there's not diplomacy to consider, there's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, U.S. presidents preserve Mexico's trade status by
certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting ``favored
nation,'' despite ample evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the North American Free Trade Agreement, which knocked down
commerce barriers be tween countries, often pits anti-smuggling
efforts against U.S. business and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and
trade. But law enforcement agencies can't keep pace, and efforts to
tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement
because that's what it's become,'' Gately said. New approaches
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the struggle say they're tired of the way
America is waging its drug war. They say it's time to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for
eign aid to Mexico. Others want undercover investigations that
reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels. Some support sending
special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper
ations.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates, on the other hand, say the only answer is to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in
the drug war, when the problem is right here at home,'' said Gail
Rittenhouse, an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons, where up
to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems. ``What if we spent
at least half of that money on treatment, educa tion and
prevention?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ralls, a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a
Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent, said the
government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions.
So they hire more cops, pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build
more prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education for young kids,'' he said. ``There are
no signature programs for the people who use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence
and anti-crime zeal. Americans demand that drug users be ar rested,
unless it's their kids. They support long prison sentences for
smugglers, then cringe at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like New Mexico's Gov. Gary Johnson, have come to believe
the only solution is the legalization of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control it, tax it, regulate it, get control of a product that
is black-market,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, drug use declined by half while the annual
cost of the fight went from $1 billion to $17 billion. By that
math, Johnson argues, it will take $40 billion and 3.2 million
arrests to cut use by half again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-benefit analysis, this really stinks,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Johnson is a voice in the political wilder
ness. But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug
policies in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in several states, includ ing Arizona, have passed initia
tives approving marijuana for medical use. This year, another
initiative could be on Arizona's ballot to decriminalize the use of
smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug
offenses. Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war
that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically
unpalatable to most Americans. No war at all
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, isn't ready to surren
der the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to change, he said, is the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This metaphor, `war on drugs,' has gotten us into a lot of
problems,'' said McCaffrey, a decorated former Army general who now
heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``I understand
war, and this ain't no war. If it's a war, then we expect to
achieve total victory through violence and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as ``a cancer
affecting our community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk in terms of a cure, but you talk in terms of a
five-year survival rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, he says, federal drug policies have suc
ceeded: Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979, and
cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar would have a tough time, however, convincing
border narco-warriors that things are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado
into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those
standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street
from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, who spent a lifetime rising from
Douglas cop to police chief to judge. In an interview last sum mer,
he told of putting hundreds of drug smugglers and dealers behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years in the drug war, Borane allowed that U.S. inter
diction efforts are as useless as ``kicking sand at the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after that inter view, Borane was indicted on money
laundering charges stem ming from an FBI sting. Accord ing to court
records, an undercover agent coaxed the judge into a deal that
involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for
pot and coke.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-cop and ex-judge now faces trial and, if convicted,
prison time with the very people he once pursued from the other
side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder those left fighting the drug war question how much
good they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win it with law enforcement,'' said Kermit
Miller, a Tucson police narcotics captain and leader in southern
Arizona's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a task force of law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a stopgap. We're holding the line.'' When you think
about how many people they're catching and how much has gotten
through all these years, they aren't slowing anybody down. David
Alvarez Federal public defender in Tucson The way to cut off drugs
is to stop the consumer. If we attack the causes, it will be much
cheaper and much more effective. Adolfo Garcia Morales Assistant
state prosecutor for Sonora

Gottlieb lifts Oklahoma State over Baylor
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ Doug Gottlieb celebrated his 24th birthday Saturday by
helping the 14th-ranked Oklahoma State Cowboys to a 56-41 Big 12
Conference victory over the struggling Baylor Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``About as pretty as a train wreck'' is the way the Cowboys'
senior guard described the rugged afternoon at the Ferrell Center
as Baylor fell short of the 43 points it had scored against both
Oklahoma and Texas in losing its first two conference games of the
year by a combined 61 points.
</P>
<P>
   This time, against their third consecutive nationally ranked
opponent, the Bears (9-5, 0-3 Big 12) remained in contention past
the midway point of the second half before losing their 21st
consecutive Big 12 game.
</P>
<P>
   But Gottlieb (13 points, seven assists, two steals) wasn't about
to let the Cowboys (13-1, 2-0) fold in their first conference road
game of the season. At one stage, from late in the first half until
eight minutes remained, he scored or assisted on 11 of Oklahoma
State's 14 field goals during that span.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb, who led the Cowboys in scoring for the first time this
season, reached double figures for only the fourth time in a
conference game.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's only 3-pointer of the day (after shooting only 18
percent from the arc coming into the game) was a shot that Oklahoma
State coach Eddie Sutton and Baylor coach Dave Bliss called the
game's key basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure when I shot it, guys on the bench were saying `No'
before it went in,'' said Gottlieb, whose previous career high was
15 last season against Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Launched from just in front of the Cowboys' bench with the shot
clock winding down and 12:09 left to play, Gottlieb's 3-pointer
ended a four-minute Oklahoma State scoring drought during which
Baylor trimmed a 13-point deficit to 35-29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were staggering a little at the time,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bliss: ``That was the big shot of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After Gottlieb followed Joe Adkins' outside shot with a steal
and short jumper to make it 42-31 with 7:53 to go, the Cowboys'
lead fell below double digits only once more. Glendon Alexander's
3-pointer then put the Cowboys back up 47-35. After that, the Bears
scored only one more field goal and six points in the closing 6:42.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were without starting center Alex Webber, who will
undergo further examination Monday for his ailing back and might
need disk injury. Fredrik Jonzen, a 6-10 sophomore, replaced Webber
and had eight points, eight rebounds and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor started freshman Wendell Greenleaf of North Shore in
place of Tevis Stukes, whom Bliss disciplined for a curfew
violation. Greenleaf scored five points, while Stukes, the Bears'
leading scorer, had five points in 18 minutes.

Marino's agonizing day becomes longer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ When the final second ticked off the clock in
the most embarrassing game of his 17-year career, Miami Dolphins
quarterback Dan Marino walked across the field toward the tunnel
that led to the visitors' dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville safety Carnell Lake, who played against Marino with
the Steelers until this season, hugged the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just congratulated Dan on a great career,'' Lake said after
the Jaguars won the AFC divisional playoff game 62-7. ``After 17
years, Dan's got nothing left to prove if he wants to retire. The
only reason he'd come back would be to get another crack at a Super
Bowl, but I don't think anybody will look down on him if he chooses
to not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember ever playing against a player of his
magnitude and it possibly being his last game.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's interview room, Marino snapped at anyone who asked
about it being his last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me that question now,'' he said the first time.
</P>
<P>
   After he heard the retirement question again from a friendly
face from the South Florida media, Marino said: ``I've answered
this question so many times. Look, I'm going to wait and see what
circumstances develop, and I'll decide later on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation coach Jimmy Johnson will retire, which
might prompt Marino to play another season if the new coach will
have him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I can still win games in this league,'' said
Marino, 38, who is signed through the 2001 season. ``I've proven
that and will continue to prove that. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino was so tired of the retirement questions he almost begged
for some about the worst game in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played horrible,'' he said. ``We never even challenged.
I've never experienced anything like it, even when I was a kid. I
actually felt good about our chances going in, but nothing went
right early, and it snowballed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Johnson took the blame for working the players too
hard after the long trip to Seattle for the first-round victory,
Marino said, ``I'm not sure, but if he says so, I guess it is.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Johnson wanted to remove Marino because Miami
trailed 41-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``At halftime, he told me he would maybe put Damon (Huard) in
because of the circumstances of the game,'' Marino said. ``I asked
him if I could have another shot, but it didn't go well.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dolphins' first series of the third quarter, Marino
left with Miami behind 48-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about it,'' Huard said of replacing Marino.
``You have to be ready when it's your turn and give it your best
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Players in both dressing rooms have been aware of the
speculation about Marino's possible retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never felt sorry for him at any point in the game,''
said Jaguars defensive end Tony Brackens, who sacked Marino and
returned the fumble for a first-quarter touchdown. ``Down the road,
if this does turn out to be his last game, I might feel
differently. But I hope he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   So do many of Brackens' teammates who helped make Marino's
afternoon miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan's a great quarterback, and if this was his last game, it's
hard to see him go out like this,'' Jacksonville receiver Keenan
McCardell said. ``I hope he comes back. He's great for the game.
I'd hate to see him leave.''
</P>
<P>
   If Marino retires, let the record show Oronde Gadsden caught his
last TD pass, a 20-yarder with three seconds left in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about that,'' Gadsden said. ``I don't
really want to think about it. That's all in Dan's hands. I guess
he'll sit down with his family, reflect and come up with a
decision.''

QUESTIONS TRUMP ANSWERS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increas ing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how many people they're catching and how
much has gotten through all these years, they aren't slowing
anybody down,'' said David Alvarez, a federal public defender in
Tucson. &QL; 
DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. &QL; 
Blame to go around
</P>
<P>
   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger, then discover a better
high with cocaine and money. Radio stations play corridos, or
ballads, in honor of narco-lords.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso, citizens have
lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this
decade. This winter, U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering
graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped
and killed by the Jua rez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the diving board for drugs, and the United States is
the swimming pool where they land,'' De Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals, they could
not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers, said Adolfo
Garcia Morales, assistant state prosecutor for Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer,'' Garcia Mo
rales said. ``If we attack the causes, it will be much cheaper and
much more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to
their country or culture. But they are not naive about it.
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation's fab ric,
creating a narco-democracy, a country whose institutions are
increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of
dollars in profits per week,'' the U.S. General Accounting Office
reported 18 months ago. ``Profits of such magnitude enable the drug
traffickers to pay enormous bribes, estimated for one organi zation
to be as much as $1 million per week, to Mexican law en forcement
officials at the fed eral, state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials; witness the brib
ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But if America's enforcement machine is flawed, Mexico's is so
compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any
one across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can
troops and federal police are protecting drug loads, not seizing
them. Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was
exposed for aiding traffick ers he'd pledged to exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gately never got the chance to find out. The Clinton administra
tion, voicing diplomatic concerns, halted the operation in 1998.
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting
without its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When there's not diplomacy to consider, there's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, U.S. presidents preserve Mexico's trade status by
certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting ``favored
nation,'' despite ample evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the North American Free Trade Agreement, which knocked down
commerce barriers be tween countries, often pits anti-smuggling
efforts against U.S. business and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and
trade. But law enforcement agencies can't keep pace, and efforts to
tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement
because that's what it's become,'' Gately said. &QL; 
New approaches
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the struggle say they're tired of the way
America is waging its drug war. They say it's time to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for
eign aid to Mexico. Others want undercover investigations that
reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels. Some support sending
special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper
ations.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates, on the other hand, say the only answer is to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in
the drug war, when the problem is right here at home,'' said Gail
Rittenhouse, an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons, where up
to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems. ``What if we spent
at least half of that money on treatment, educa tion and
prevention?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ralls, a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a
Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent, said the
government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions.
So they hire more cops, pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build
more prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education for young kids,'' he said. ``There are
no signature programs for the people who use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence
and anti-crime zeal. Americans demand that drug users be ar rested,
unless it's their kids. They support long prison sentences for
smugglers, then cringe at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like New Mexico's Gov. Gary Johnson, have come to believe
the only solution is the legalization of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control it, tax it, regulate it, get control of a product that
is black-market,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, drug use declined by half while the annual
cost of the fight went from $1 billion to $17 billion. By that
math, Johnson argues, it will take $40 billion and 3.2 million
arrests to cut use by half again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-benefit analysis, this really stinks,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Johnson is a voice in the political wilder
ness. But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug
policies in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in several states, includ ing Arizona, have passed initia
tives approving marijuana for medical use. This year, another
initiative could be on Arizona's ballot to decriminalize the use of
smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug
offenses. Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war
that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically
unpalatable to most Americans. &QL; 
No war at all
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, isn't ready to surren
der the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to change, he said, is the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This metaphor, `war on drugs,' has gotten us into a lot of
problems,'' said McCaffrey, a decorated former Army general who now
heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``I understand
war, and this ain't no war. If it's a war, then we expect to
achieve total victory through violence and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as ``a cancer
affecting our community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk in terms of a cure, but you talk in terms of a
five-year survival rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, he says, federal drug policies have suc
ceeded: Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979, and
cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar would have a tough time, however, convincing
border narco-warriors that things are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado
into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those
standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street
from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, who spent a lifetime rising from
Douglas cop to police chief to judge. In an interview last sum mer,
he told of putting hundreds of drug smugglers and dealers behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years in the drug war, Borane allowed that U.S. inter
diction efforts are as useless as ``kicking sand at the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after that inter view, Borane was indicted on money
laundering charges stem ming from an FBI sting. Accord ing to court
records, an undercover agent coaxed the judge into a deal that
involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for
pot and coke.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-cop and ex-judge now faces trial and, if convicted,
prison time with the very people he once pursued from the other
side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder those left fighting the drug war question how much
good they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win it with law enforcement,'' said Kermit
Miller, a Tucson police narcotics captain and leader in southern
Arizona's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a task force of law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a stopgap. We're holding the line.'' &QL;

<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increasing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.

   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   Gately never got the chance to find out. The Clinton administra
tion, voicing diplomatic concerns, halted the operation in 1998.
President Clinton apologized to Mexico for conducting the sting
without its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When there's not diplomacy to consider, there's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, U.S. presidents preserve Mexico's trade status by
certifying the southern neigh bor as a drug-fighting ``favored
nation,'' despite ample evidence to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the North American Free Trade Agreement, which knocked down
commerce barriers be tween countries, often pits anti-smuggling
efforts against U.S. business and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old open-border compact brought a flood of travel and
trade. But law enforcement agencies can't keep pace, and efforts to
tightly screen free trade are condemned by business leaders and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA means the North American Free Trafficking Agreement
because that's what it's become,'' Gately said. &QL; 
New approaches
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the struggle say they're tired of the way
America is waging its drug war. They say it's time to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocate militarizing the U.S. border and cutting off for
eign aid to Mexico. Others want undercover investigations that
reach deeply into Mexico and its cartels. Some support sending
special forces into Latin America to destroy crops and cartel oper
ations.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates, on the other hand, say the only answer is to
combat drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend so much money building walls and arresting peo ple in
the drug war, when the problem is right here at home,'' said Gail
Rittenhouse, an admin istrator for Arizona state prisons, where up
to 85 percent of the inmates have drug problems. ``What if we spent
at least half of that money on treatment, educa tion and
prevention?''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ralls, a Tucson de fense lawyer who once worked as a
Douglas narcotics detective and later as a DEA agent, said the
government and the public are obsessed with get-tough solu tions.
So they hire more cops, pass mandatory-sentencing laws and build
more prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no education for young kids,'' he said. ``There are
no signature programs for the people who use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politicians are caught in a vise between public ambivalence
and anti-crime zeal. Americans demand that drug users be ar rested,
unless it's their kids. They support long prison sentences for
smugglers, then cringe at the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like New Mexico's Gov. Gary Johnson, have come to believe
the only solution is the legalization of some drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control it, tax it, regulate it, get control of a product that
is black-market,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, drug use declined by half while the annual
cost of the fight went from $1 billion to $17 billion. By that
math, Johnson argues, it will take $40 billion and 3.2 million
arrests to cut use by half again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a cost-benefit analysis, this really stinks,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Johnson is a voice in the political wilder
ness. But sentiment seems slowly to be steering American drug
policies in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in several states, includ ing Arizona, have passed initia
tives approving marijuana for medical use. This year, another
initiative could be on Arizona's ballot to decriminalize the use of
smaller amounts of pot and ease punishment for non-violent drug
offenses. Supporters call it a halfway point between a drug war
that is failing and a legaliza tion scheme that is politically
unpalatable to most Americans. &QL; 
No war at all
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Clinton's drug czar, isn't ready to surren
der the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to change, he said, is the terminology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This metaphor, `war on drugs,' has gotten us into a lot of
problems,'' said McCaffrey, a decorated former Army general who now
heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``I understand
war, and this ain't no war. If it's a war, then we expect to
achieve total victory through violence and deception.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey prefers to describe the drug problem as ``a cancer
affecting our community life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't talk in terms of a cure, but you talk in terms of a
five-year survival rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, he says, federal drug policies have suc
ceeded: Overall abuse rates have more than halved since 1979, and
cocaine use has been sliced by 70 percent in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The drug czar would have a tough time, however, convincing
border narco-warriors that things are getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dope have turned tiny towns like San Luis Rio Colorado
into drug meccas where cartel smugglers unload Uzis at those
standing in their way.
</P>
<P>
   Drug distribution rings have set up operations across the street
from Carl Hayden High School in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And corruption has infected those who are supposed to cure the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ronald ``Joe'' Borane, who spent a lifetime rising from
Douglas cop to police chief to judge. In an interview last sum mer,
he told of putting hundreds of drug smugglers and dealers behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years in the drug war, Borane allowed that U.S. inter
diction efforts are as useless as ``kicking sand at the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after that inter view, Borane was indicted on money
laundering charges stem ming from an FBI sting. Accord ing to court
records, an undercover agent coaxed the judge into a deal that
involved sending military surplus gear to Guatemala in exchange for
pot and coke.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-cop and ex-judge now faces trial and, if convicted,
prison time with the very people he once pursued from the other
side of the law.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder those left fighting the drug war question how much
good they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to win it with law enforcement,'' said Kermit
Miller, a Tucson police narcotics captain and leader in southern
Arizona's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, a task force of law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a stopgap. We're holding the line.'' &QL;

QUESTIONS TRUMP ANSWERS IN WAR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER AND PAT FLANNERY  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If America's drug war is not already lost, it is clearly un
winnable.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Border Patrol and Customs agents who chase pot runners
through catclaw canyons west of Naco.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the inspectors pounding pavement at Nogales' ports of entry,
using everything from sniffer dogs to gamma rays to check for
cocaine and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Mexican newspaper reporter dodging death threats in San
Luis Rio Colorado, the smug gler doing time in a federal
penitentiary, the undercover narc making buys in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a half-century of escalating efforts to stop
illegal drug smuggling, the casualty count is a litany of lives
wasted, tax dollars lost, corruption, vio lence and public
cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   Even a gung-ho crimebuster like Maricopa County Sheriff Joe
Arpaio acknowledges the failure as he thinks back on a 42-year
career of drug busting.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio hunted heroin smug glers in Turkey, oversaw Drug
Enforcement Administration op erations in Latin America and headed
federal drug enforcement in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is today,'' he says, shaking his head, ``and there's
not much difference in drug trafficking . . . except there's more
of it.'' &QL; 
WHAT WENT WRONG?
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, faced with an explosion in casual
drug use and drug-related crimes in the 1960s, launched the first
big offensive in the nation's drug war.
</P>
<P>
   He merged two federal anti-drug agencies to create the Bu reau
of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in 1968, hoping that a powerful
new federal effort could eliminate the scourge. But the drug trade
and related crime only flourished.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, President Nixon shifted the focus from
enforcement to treatment. Fed eral spending on drug treatment,
rehabilitation and education out stripped spending on enforce ment
during Nixon's first term.
</P>
<P>
   But interest waned after Nix on's 1972 re-election, and tough
new anti-drug laws passed by Congress consolidated federal
enforcement powers. Spending on law enforcement began a slow upward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, some saw the writ ing on the wall. A Ford Founda tion
study in &UR; the early 1970s concluded that ``the criminal-law approach
appears to have had little impact on the growth of the problem, as
is demonstrated by the fact that illegal drug use, by everyone's
calculation, is increas ing and shows no sign of leveling off.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades later, Henry Hinton, assistant comp
troller general for national secu rity and international affairs in
the General Accounting Office, offered a nearly identical assess
ment to Congress: ``Despite long-standing efforts and expendi tures
of billions of dollars, illegal drugs still flood the United
States.'' &QL; 
THE ARIZONA BULGE
</P>
<P>
   America's enforcement tactics are frequently compared with the
squeezing of a balloon. Fif teen years ago, anti-smuggling
operations pressed in on southern Florida, pushing smugglers to
ward America's 2,000-mile South western border.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1990s, authorities targeted San Diego and Texas.
This time, the smuggling bulge popped up along Arizona's southern
edge. For three years, at least, it has been one of the world's
busiest dope corridors.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling how much drugs pour into the Grand Can yon
State every year. There's not even a composite tally of all the
smuggled drugs that are caught. But, certainly, it's more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal 1999 was a record year for marijuana seizures by federal
law enforcement agencies in the state. &UR; The DEA, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Border Patrol reported nabbing nearly 350 tons of
pot in Arizona last year, twice the amount reported by the same
agencies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 23,000 pounds of cocaine seized by those agen cies
last year, although not a record, was up slightly from the year
before. Heroin seizures were at their lowest point in four years at
53 pounds. But a record 693 pounds of methamphetamine was snared in
1999 by the DEA, the agency with the most focus on meth trafficking
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year alone, drug smuggling tunnels were un earthed
in Naco and Nogales, $891,000 of cash was seized at the Douglas
port, and 1,886 pounds of coke was pulled out of a boat at
Lukeville.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how large the busts or how many, only an estimated
one-tenth to one-quar ter of all drug shipments into the United
States are caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about how many people they're catching and how
much has gotten through all these years, they aren't slowing
anybody down,'' said David Alvarez, a federal public defender in
Tucson. &QL; 
DEMAND FOR DRUGS
</P>
<P>
   The drug war cost the United States $17.7 billion this year, up
from $1.5 billion in 1981 and $102 million in 1970. One-third goes
for treatment, education and prevention, compared with nearly 60
percent in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But billions of tax dollars have not put an appreciable dent in
the black market. Instead, the cost of catching a pound of dope
just keeps going up. A decade ago, the U.S. government spent less
than $3,500 for every pound of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and
hashish seized. By last year, the average was up over $5,000 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   The dope that gets through finds a steady market on this side of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the mid-1990s esti mated that Americans were spending
nearly $50 billion on their illegal drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 13.6
million Americans, or 6.2 percent of those 12 or older, were using
illicit drugs, down from a high of 25 million in 1979 but virtually
unchanged from 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Kids are considered a barome ter of abuse, and the trend among
those ages 12 to 17 is troubling. About one in 10 has been using
drugs regularly dur ing the past several years, up from one in 17
or 18 during the early part of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in Arizona, where teenag ers
have a higher abuse rate, 14.4 percent, than the national average
of 9.9. percent.  &QL; 
EASY MONEY?
</P>
<P>
   Bring a kilo of coke into Phoenix and you can sell it for
$14,500 to $20,000. Get a pound of cannabis to Tucson and you can
pick up $400 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony P. Maingot, a sociolo gist who researched the world wide
drug economy, estimates that annual narcotics proceeds total more
than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The futility of enforcement efforts is hardly a surprise when
such enormous amounts of money are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Billy Martin: The one-time Douglas schoolkid, the son
of middle-class parents, is accused by federal prosecutors of
cozying up to major cartels in Sonora and running a trafficking
ring that raked in more than $19 million over five years. Mar tin
fled to Mexico a step ahead of the law in the mid-1990s, but last
year was sent back to the United States to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sworn statements from Mar tin's confederates offer glimpses of
the insane profitability of their ventures. The affidavits speak of
a courier, code-named Slim, who regularly met a New York City drug
buyer to ferry thousands of dollars back to Tucson or Califor nia.
The buyer ``delivered money to Slim at hotels in the New York/New
Jersey area 15 or 20 times between March and May 1994, never less
than $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Slim, who earned $5,000 per trip, ``sometimes traveled with an
exotic looking female . . . strik ingly beautiful,'' letting her
carry the cash in a hand-held travel bag. Sometimes, couriers flew
west in the opulent comfort of now-defunct MGM Grand Air.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who reputedly worked for Martin told federal agents that
Martin's home in Mexico was ``like a palace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Mexican feder ales all over the place with machine
guns,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of fast American cash is nearly irresistible in a
country where much of the workforce is unemployed and laborers earn
only about $25 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even those at the bottom of the chain, the human mules who risk
their own hides to deliver loads into the United States earn wages
they couldn't hope to match in Mexico's legal economy. &QL; 
Blame to go around
</P>
<P>
   Lionel De Gunther, a student and teacher at the University of So
nora in Hermosillo, said U.S. officials see only one side of the
tragedy: &UR; their own. But while drugs go north, decadence and crime,
he said, flow south.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo, a state capital 350 miles from Phoenix, has been
transformed from a religious city to a haven for contraband, green
backs, guns and gangs from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sniff paint as a sedative to hunger, then discover a better
high with cocaine and money. Radio stations play corridos, or
ballads, in honor of narco-lords.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, the Chihuahuan city south of El Paso, citizens have
lived in the shadow of violent cartel rivalries for most of this
decade. This winter, U.S. and Mexican authorities began un covering
graves thought to con tain some of the dozens of people kidnapped
and killed by the Jua rez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the diving board for drugs, and the United States is
the swimming pool where they land,'' De Gunther said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much blame is cast on Latino criminals, they could
not thrive without U.S. collaborators and buyers, said Adolfo
Garcia Morales, assistant state prosecutor for Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to cut off drugs is to stop the consumer,'' Garcia Mo
rales said. ``If we attack the causes, it will be much cheaper and
much more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans also resent the no tion that corruption is unique to
their country or culture. But they are not naive about it.
</P>
<P>
   Many concede that cartels have subverted the nation's fab ric,
creating a narco-democracy, a country whose institutions are
increasingly controlled by power ful drug alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such Mexican organiza tion generates tens of millions of
dollars in profits per week,'' the U.S. General Accounting Office
reported 18 months ago. ``Profits of such magnitude enable the drug
traffickers to pay enormous bribes, estimated for one organi zation
to be as much as $1 million per week, to Mexican law en forcement
officials at the fed eral, state and local levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money also goes to U.S. officials; witness the brib
ery convictions of several Ari zona immigration inspectors last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But if America's enforcement machine is flawed, Mexico's is so
compromised that U.S. narcotics investigators refuse to trust any
one across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Customs and Border Patrol agents simply assume that Mexi can
troops and federal police are protecting drug loads, not seizing
them. Those same assumptions apply higher up the government ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was
exposed for aiding traffick ers he'd pledged to exterminate.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Operation Casa blanca, a three-year undercover
money laundering probe, proved ``enlightening . . . as to the depth
of deception and corruption in the Mexican system,'' said for mer
Customs Agent William F. Gately, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Among 142 people arrested in the operation were top officials of
three major Mexican banks. Gately insists the operation might
eventually have snared a top Mexican Cabinet minister who was
reputed by members of the Juarez drug cartel to be interested in
laundering $1 billion in drug profits.
</P>

``fresh sign'' at about 9 a.m., following footprints into the Pe

   They aren't sure who they're after, but they know they aren't
far behind. Humping up the steep slopes northbound toward Ari zona
80, they find themselves on a trail 100 yards below the crest of
the peaks. Their quarry is moving fast, especially for such radical
climbs, and Madrid and Banks can't see anyone.
</P>
<P>
   An hour turns into five as, eyes to the ground, they push north
to Saddle Gap, where the tracks scatter. Madrid and Banks figure
they've been seen, but they de cide to check out the area before
heading back. Good thing.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., they're flying off the mountain in a U.S. Customs
Black Hawk chopper with 350 pounds of marijuana in eight
canvas-covered bales.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 U.S. Border Patrol agents are posted along Arizona's
southern flank.
</P>
<P>
   They hide in desert brush along the San Pedro River. They spring
commando-style am bushes along mule trails in the Pajarito
Mountains west of No gales. They walk the Colorado River bottom
near San Luis. They sit on mountainsides all over Cochise County
with night-vision and infrared gear, straining to see the bodies
moving like ants across a border that might as well not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission hasn't changed in the 75 years of the Border
Patrol's existence. Though trucks replaced horses years ago, agents
still bounce through Arizona's backcountry and cruise the streets
of its border towns trying to keep illegal immigrants and
contraband from coming into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there are new problems. Drug smuggling in the United States
is being squeezed into an ever-smaller corridor, now cen tered in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants are flooding into the state through the same
corridor, and the smugglers have learned to use the crowded condi
tions to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They bank on the agents' being too busy to notice &UR; them. They
keep track of &UR; how many agents are on each shift, what areas they
work regularly, when shift changes occur.
</P>
<P>
   They watch the agents watch ing the border.
</P>
<P>
   They have their own sophisti cated night-vision gear and radio
equipment. They put spotters on surrounding mountains. They in
tercept radio communications on unsecure channels. They send armed
scouts ahead of loads to case the routes. They relay in structions
via encrypted radio transmissions or cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their countersurveillance is very, very good,'' said Kevin
Oaks, a longtime Border Patrol agent in southern Arizona. ``It's a
cocktail for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Augie Clarkson hunkers down behind a creosote bush, the
chicken scratch of his boots breaking the silence. In the
pitch-black night of the southern San Pedro River Valley, he can
hardly see the railroad tracks in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows there are people up there because a night-scope
operator several miles away is describing the infrared images to
him over a police radio.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks are a popular route into the heart of the valley,
particularly for couriers back packing drugs to a nearby road way.
From there, the dope is whisked to safe houses in Tucson, Phoenix
and points beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson kneels impatiently, straining to see and hear. At 23,
he's the youngest agent in Naco, with a face too fresh and friendly
to be in this business. But he knows the ropes _ he's the son of a
Yuma Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   As Clarkson fidgets, he hears the faint crunch of gravel. It
gets louder, clearer, until the feet are nearly upon him. Clarkson
waits for five shadowy figures to pass, then follows quietly
behind.
</P>
<P>
   He jumps with the sudden white beam of a flashlight. ``Stay
where you are! Put your hands where I can see them!'' he yells in
Spanish. Several dimly lit figures drop to the ground, while others
scatter, then stop in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   They have packs, but no dope _ only extra clothes and water.
They are peasants from central Mexico, heading to Chandler for
work. One gives thanks that it's la migra. He thought they'd been
waylaid by bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson surprised 43 illegals that night. The station's 24-hour
count: 134. Nobody caught any dope, but it doesn't matter much to
Clarkson. It doesn't even mat ter that he'd arrested one group in
nearly the same spot the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fun job,'' Clarkson says. ``I get to hunt humans for
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents still track people the old way, ``cutting
sign'' left along a trail. But they also have an array of
electronic gizmos, from mobile infrared optical scopes to low-light
cam eras and ground sensors that help them find their quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the job today is more difficult _ and dangerous _ than
ever because there are so many crossings.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1999, immigrant apprehensions increased fivefold in
the Tucson sector, which stretches from New Mexico nearly to Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   And although catching drugs is secondary to catching people, the
Border Patrol's marijuana sei zures in the sector more than doubled
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is due in no small part to President Clinton's
border strategy. Since 1993, he has dou bled the number of Border
Patrol agents to more than 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, there were 287 in the Tucson sector. Now there are
nearly 1,300, including many more stationed there temporarily as
part of Operation Safeguard. There are more patrol agents along
Arizona's border than there are local police in all of Arizona's
border towns combined.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new muscle is stationed in Nogales. Border Pa trol
officials hoped to cut smug gling by driving it from city streets
into the open desert east and west of town.
</P>
<P>
   Night searchlights went up along the fence that marks the
border. Agents were posted a few hundred yards apart. Roving drug
interdiction teams took to the hills outside town.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Illegals appre hended in Nogales jumped by 62
percent from 1997 to 1998. Mari juana seizures increased 12 per
cent. Cocaine seizures jumped from 13 pounds to 1,718 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, smugglers of ille gals and drug traffickers _
``coyotes'' and ``narcos'' in smug gling parlance _ have begun to
move their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys can change the direction of a shipment instanta
neously,'' said Jim Molesa of the Drug Enforcement Administra tion.
``The government takes years.''
</P>
<P>
   A bright red Dodge Laser turns north from the border road in
Naco and cruises down the main drag. Suddenly, the driver spooks,
makes a U-turn and heads south.
</P>
<P>
   A green and white Ford Expe dition with ``Border Patrol''
splashed across its ribs takes off in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Just short of the border port station, the Laser peels east onto
a dirt track. With agents closing in from all sides, the Laser
veers south into the thigh-high border fence, an impromptu barrier
made from welded railroad steel. It crashes to a halt in a choking
cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, agents draw beads on what looked like a suspect
slumped over the dash. It isn't. They find only an air bag. The
driver is gone, having scram bled to freedom over a rise in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is backslapping all around for what's left behind:
10 bundles of smelly weed weighing in at 142 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a pickup truck suspected of being in ca
hoots with the smuggler cruises the Mexican side of the line with
police cars following.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably protecting it,'' Agent Ray Cosme grouses.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rule book on smug gling, but drug fighters swear it
was once an unspoken code: Neither side would try to hurt the
other. Running was fine, but no guns. They abided by a maxim,
``Live to play the game another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in June 1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was
killed during what should have been a routine marijuana stop on the
outskirts of Nogales. A smuggler shot Kirpnick in the head, making
him the sector's first agent since 1926 to be fatally shot in the
line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Although murder remains rare, violence has escalated since the
mid-'90s. Agents dodge rocks, bricks and invectives. Random gunfire
is constant. Many Border Patrol agents are equipped with helmets
and body armor. And where a drug load was once abandoned at the
first sign of the law, smugglers may now defend the stuff with
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Butch Gamboa, 36, was sniped at while driving a lonely
road near the San Pedro River, a favorite haunt for runners. He was
also pinned down once at the Western Corrals, a grassy out back
near the border south of Palominas.
</P>
<P>
   Drug task force agents had set a trap for a load of marijuana.
The snare was sprung in the dead of night when four vehicles came
through. As agents closed in through the tall grass, smugglers laid
down a hail of gunfire. Gamboa and other agents were kept at bay
until a helicopter arrived with searchlights. The smugglers
retreated to Mexico, leaving some of the dope behind.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between Douglas and Naco, Agent Joe Garcia, 27, tunes
his scanner to a frequency used by the dopers. Two voices speak
Spanish, one giving instructions to the other. It's clear the two
have just crossed the border, but Garcia can't figure out where. He
does know this much: The smug glers want la migra to see a big
group of illegal immigrants cross ing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common tactic. The agents go after the immigrants while
drug smugglers sneak in behind. If agents are lucky, they'll catch
both. A week earlier, Gar cia was called to a shed in Naco where
illegals were thought to be holed up. Inside were 14 people and 400
pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The voices on the scanner are breathless now, and Garcia guesses
they're backpacking dope in high country, so he focuses his
binoculars on nearby mountains. He sees nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As night falls, Border Patrol spotters farther west see two cars
and a truck stop along Arizona 92 to load something. Garcia takes
after them, burying his speedom eter to catch a black Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls the car to the shoul der. A half-dozen illegals and a
driver are squeezed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no other agents to help, Garcia takes the
Beretta's keys, tells the illegals to stay put, then takes off
after the second car. Several miles later, he arrests eight more
illegals.
</P>
<P>
   But the first group is gone. They had a spare key.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is philosophical about it. There are too many people and
drugs coming across to catch them all. He does what he can.
</P>
<P>
   `All we're doing, really,'' he says, ``is just slowing them
down.'' &QL;

   DOUGLAS _ Agents Tom Ma drid and Dana Banks start track ing
``fresh sign'' at about 9 a.m., following footprints into the Pe

UCLA UPSETS NORTH CAROLINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ It won't make the record book, but UCLA's
game against North Carolina was the longest in school history.
</P>
<P>
   It began Wednesday night, after the embarrassing loss to USC,
and ended Saturday afternoon with a 71-68 victory over the Tar
Heels that was, quite simply, UCLA's most significant win in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In passion, purpose and predicament, the Bruins recreated their
stunning 1998 NCAA Tournament second-round victory over Michigan.
Back then, they regrouped from a lethargic performance against
Miami to defeat the heavily favored, higher-seeded Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, before 21,572 in the Smith Center, the Bruins (10-4)
played with unprecedented urgency, snapped a four-game losing
streak to North Carolina and and took a major step toward
qualifying for March Madness. (In their quest for 18 victories,
Saturday's win makes up for the loss at Washington.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have given up on our season after that USC game,''
Bruins guard Earl Watson said. ``If we had lost this, then with
Arizona coming in, it would have been rough.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had myriad heroes. Big men Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric
combined for 29 points and 21 rebounds and outplayed their UNC
counterparts. Watson had a solid floor game with six assists and
two turnovers. Forward Jason Kapono scored 14 points in 22
foul-plagued minutes, and reserve Ryan Bailey made the
game-clinching free throws with 14.9 seconds remaining. He banked
home the first, drawing groans from the fans and giggles from the
UCLA bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never banked a free throw in my life,'' Bailey said.
``The main thing I was thinking was that if I missed them, my dad
was going to kick my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, this victory was about Bruins coach Steve Lavin, who
has always done his best work in crisis situations _ whether it's
replacing Jim Harrick, recovering from a 48-point loss at Stanford
or keeping his players confident after 12-point losses to USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lavin did a great job keeping it in perspective for
us,'' Kapono said. ``He told us not to worry about what people were
saying. No one was feeling any pressure. He kept us loose, and he
had us ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's preparation began with a long postgame speech in the
Sports Arena catacombs. He implored the Bruins to learn from the
loss (ie: play with passion) and, at the same time, to forget it.
If they fretted about the Trojans, Lavin warned, they'd crumble
against the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavin learned something that night, as well. Watching the
Trojans rip UCLA's pressure defense for 91 points, he realized the
Bruins play best when using a compact, half-court defense that
keeps Moiso and Gadzuric close to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt responsible for not putting the players in a position
to beat USC,'' Lavin said. ``The thinking was sound: Our 10 could
beat their five. (The Trojans aren't very deep.) But we're just not
effective when we extend our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   During a crisp, two-hour practice Friday in the Smith Center,
Lavin was more vocal than usual as he installed a compact 3-2 zone.
If the Tar Heels could win the game from 3-point range, fine; they
weren't going to beat the Bruins underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same defense we played against Michigan (in
1998),'' he said. ``We treated (North Carolina center) Brendan
Haywood the same way we treated (Michigan's) Tractor Traylor. It
was the same concept we used against Oklahoma State and Mississippi
State and Arkansas (in the 1995 NCAA title run). Make teams beat
you from outside, but protect the paint.''
</P>
<P>
   The zone worked perfectly. Haywood took six shots and scored
seven points. UNC power forward Kris Lang had seven shots and nine
points. UCLA outrebounded the Tar Heels 38-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their zone was very good, very active,'' Tar Heels coach Bill
Guthridge said. ``They accomplished what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The final piece to UCLA's preparation puzzle came Friday night,
when the players gorged on a home-cooked meal of fried chicken,
beef ribs, cabbage, collared greens and sweet potato pie with Rico
Hines' family. (He's from nearby Greenville, N.C.)
</P>
<P>
   A fabulous meal by all accounts, it actually did more for their
spirits than their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to get to a family atmosphere,'' Hines said.
``Everybody felt at home. My family was hugging and kissing the
guys. It put everything back in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   When the discussion turned to the Tar Heels, who, like UCLA,
have not played to expectations, Lavin spoke up. He told the Bruins
that UNC fans have been critical of the players and of Guthridge,
and they'd start booing (like UCLA fans) if the Tar Heels fell
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get ahead,'' Lavin told his team, ``the pressure will be
on them. They're supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, the Bruins jumped to a 10-2 lead and never
trailed.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Lavin celebrated with a brief, upward thrust
of his arms. Nor did he let loose in the locker room. Instead, he
walked to the greaseboard and made two lists: UCLA's losses this
season (Gonzaga, Colorado State, Washington and USC), and its best
wins (DePaul, South Florida, Purdue and North Carolina).
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys we were capable of being (a good team) if we
grew and learned, but we were also capable of being (a bad team) if
we didn't,'' he said. ``Then I gave the guys a hug because of what
they went through after USC.''

THE PLACE WHERE THE SKY IS FALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(Phoenix) - This is where 14-year-old Shannon Smith stood on the
night of June 14, 1999.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the small back yard of a red brick home in central Phoe
nix. Shannon walked out the door of the family room and onto the
grass, not far from a rose-colored block wall, next to a hammock.
She was speaking to a friend on a portable tele phone. She'd gone
outside be cause she heard something that sounded like a car crash.
She was an inquisitive girl, as girls should be.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, on the pi ano, are two large photographs of
Shannon, smiling, as if she sees the prospect of a glorious life
before her.
</P>
<P>
   That night in June, she was on the telephone when a bullet that
had been fired randomly into the air fell and fell and fell, and
struck her on the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I found her,'' says Otis Smith, Shannon's fa
ther, pointing to where his daughter's head came to rest. Nearby,
his wife, Lory, watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew she was shot until they did the X-ray at the
hospital,'' Lory says.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Otis believed his daughter had fallen asleep on the
lawn while looking up at the stars. When he saw she wasn't
breathing, he performed CPR until an ambulance arrived. He didn't
notice the blood on his hands until much later.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since their child's death, Otis and Lory have
pushed for a change in the law they say will make it easier to
prosecute those who fire weapons into the air. The legis lators
sponsoring the bill call it ``Shannon's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to create some kind of legacy for our daugh
ter,'' Otis says. ``That kind of thinking only denigrates her
memory. We only want a law that might keep what happened to our
child from happening to someone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with that?
</P>
<P>
   The way I see it, anyone who believes Shannon's Law is un
necessary, either because it won't change people's behavior, or
because it won't be strin gently enforced, or because the crime is
covered under existing laws, should come to this back yard and
stand next to Shan non's parents in the spot where she died.
</P>
<P>
   So, that's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   Otis invited me. I've said any one firing a weapon into the air
could be charged with a felony under endangerment and disor derly
conduct laws. He wanted to convince me otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County prosecutor Rick Romley supports Shan non's Law.
He told me it would make prosecution easier by eliminating the need
to prove ``intent.'' Then he added, ``There's still a problem
getting witnesses, or having them tes tify. It'll still be very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Otis Smith says, ``So what? Let's assume that's true.
Let's assume the laws overlap. What does it hurt? If it helps even
a little, wouldn't that be worth it?''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's Law will inhibit random gunfire only if it's backed by
enforcement. Police and prosecutors could have done that already,
but haven't. Maybe they're overworked or maybe they believe it's
not worth it, but there's never been a serious crackdown here.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe Shannon's Law would embarrass them into doing
something, at least for a while. And it might provide some comfort,
at least for a while, to a grieving couple. Ev ery parent who loses
a child de serves that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it hurt?'' Otis Smith asks again.
</P>
<P>
   And he's right.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths aren't crusaders. They have no hidden agenda. They
aren't zealots or pawns or political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't a couple of wild-eyed Chicken Littles tell ing us
the sky is falling. They're the people it fell on. &QL;

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS _ Agents Tom Ma drid and Dana Banks start track ing
``fresh sign'' at about 9 a.m., following footprints into the Pe
rilla Mountains just above the U.S.-Mexican border east of town.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't sure who they're after, but they know they aren't
far behind. Humping up the steep slopes northbound toward Ari zona
80, they find themselves on a trail 100 yards below the crest of
the peaks. Their quarry is moving fast, especially for such radical
climbs, and Madrid and Banks can't see anyone.
</P>
<P>
   An hour turns into five as, eyes to the ground, they push north
to Saddle Gap, where the tracks scatter. Madrid and Banks figure
they've been seen, but they de cide to check out the area before
heading back. Good thing.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., they're flying off the mountain in a U.S. Customs
Black Hawk chopper with 350 pounds of marijuana in eight
canvas-covered bales.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 U.S. Border Patrol agents are posted along Arizona's
southern flank.
</P>
<P>
   They hide in desert brush along the San Pedro River. They spring
commando-style am bushes along mule trails in the Pajarito
Mountains west of No gales. They walk the Colorado River bottom
near San Luis. They sit on mountainsides all over Cochise County
with night-vision and infrared gear, straining to see the bodies
moving like ants across a border that might as well not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission hasn't changed in the 75 years of the Border
Patrol's existence. Though trucks replaced horses years ago, agents
still bounce through Arizona's backcountry and cruise the streets
of its border towns trying to keep illegal immigrants and
contraband from coming into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But there are new problems. Drug smuggling in the United States
is being squeezed into an ever-smaller corridor, now cen tered in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants are flooding into the state through the same
corridor, and the smugglers have learned to use the crowded condi
tions to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They bank on the agents' being too busy to notice &UR; them. They
keep track of &UR; how many agents are on each shift, what areas they
work regularly, when shift changes occur.
</P>
<P>
   They watch the agents watch ing the border.
</P>
<P>
   They have their own sophisti cated night-vision gear and radio
equipment. They put spotters on surrounding mountains. They in
tercept radio communications on unsecure channels. They send armed
scouts ahead of loads to case the routes. They relay in structions
via encrypted radio transmissions or cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their countersurveillance is very, very good,'' said Kevin
Oaks, a longtime Border Patrol agent in southern Arizona. ``It's a
cocktail for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Augie Clarkson hunkers down behind a creosote bush, the
chicken scratch of his boots breaking the silence. In the
pitch-black night of the southern San Pedro River Valley, he can
hardly see the railroad tracks in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows there are people up there because a night-scope
operator several miles away is describing the infrared images to
him over a police radio.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks are a popular route into the heart of the valley,
particularly for couriers back packing drugs to a nearby road way.
From there, the dope is whisked to safe houses in Tucson, Phoenix
and points beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson kneels impatiently, straining to see and hear. At 23,
he's the youngest agent in Naco, with a face too fresh and friendly
to be in this business. But he knows the ropes _ he's the son of a
Yuma Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   As Clarkson fidgets, he hears the faint crunch of gravel. It
gets louder, clearer, until the feet are nearly upon him. Clarkson
waits for five shadowy figures to pass, then follows quietly
behind.
</P>
<P>
   He jumps with the sudden white beam of a flashlight. ``Stay
where you are! Put your hands where I can see them!'' he yells in
Spanish. Several dimly lit figures drop to the ground, while others
scatter, then stop in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   They have packs, but no dope _ only extra clothes and water.
They are peasants from central Mexico, heading to Chandler for
work. One gives thanks that it's la migra. He thought they'd been
waylaid by bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson surprised 43 illegals that night. The station's 24-hour
count: 134. Nobody caught any dope, but it doesn't matter much to
Clarkson. It doesn't even mat ter that he'd arrested one group in
nearly the same spot the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fun job,'' Clarkson says. ``I get to hunt humans for
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents still track people the old way, ``cutting
sign'' left along a trail. But they also have an array of
electronic gizmos, from mobile infrared optical scopes to low-light
cam eras and ground sensors that help them find their quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the job today is more difficult _ and dangerous _ than
ever because there are so many crossings.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1999, immigrant apprehensions increased fivefold in
the Tucson sector, which stretches from New Mexico nearly to Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   And although catching drugs is secondary to catching people, the
Border Patrol's marijuana sei zures in the sector more than doubled
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is due in no small part to President Clinton's
border strategy. Since 1993, he has dou bled the number of Border
Patrol agents to more than 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, there were 287 in the Tucson sector. Now there are
nearly 1,300, including many more stationed there temporarily as
part of Operation Safeguard. There are more patrol agents along
Arizona's border than there are local police in all of Arizona's
border towns combined.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new muscle is stationed in Nogales. Border Pa trol
officials hoped to cut smug gling by driving it from city streets
into the open desert east and west of town.
</P>
<P>
   Night searchlights went up along the fence that marks the
border. Agents were posted a few hundred yards apart. Roving drug
interdiction teams took to the hills outside town.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Illegals appre hended in Nogales jumped by 62
percent from 1997 to 1998. Mari juana seizures increased 12 per
cent. Cocaine seizures jumped from 13 pounds to 1,718 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, smugglers of ille gals and drug traffickers _
``coyotes'' and ``narcos'' in smug gling parlance _ have begun to
move their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys can change the direction of a shipment instanta
neously,'' said Jim Molesa of the Drug Enforcement Administra tion.
``The government takes years.''
</P>
<P>
   A bright red Dodge Laser turns north from the border road in
Naco and cruises down the main drag. Suddenly, the driver spooks,
makes a U-turn and heads south.
</P>
<P>
   A green and white Ford Expe dition with ``Border Patrol''
splashed across its ribs takes off in hot pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Just short of the border port station, the Laser peels east onto
a dirt track. With agents closing in from all sides, the Laser
veers south into the thigh-high border fence, an impromptu barrier
made from welded railroad steel. It crashes to a halt in a choking
cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, agents draw beads on what looked like a suspect
slumped over the dash. It isn't. They find only an air bag. The
driver is gone, having scram bled to freedom over a rise in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is backslapping all around for what's left behind:
10 bundles of smelly weed weighing in at 142 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, a pickup truck suspected of being in ca
hoots with the smuggler cruises the Mexican side of the line with
police cars following.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably protecting it,'' Agent Ray Cosme grouses.
</P>
<P>
   There's no rule book on smug gling, but drug fighters swear it
was once an unspoken code: Neither side would try to hurt the
other. Running was fine, but no guns. They abided by a maxim,
``Live to play the game another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in June 1998, Border Patrol Agent Alexander Kirpnick was
killed during what should have been a routine marijuana stop on the
outskirts of Nogales. A smuggler shot Kirpnick in the head, making
him the sector's first agent since 1926 to be fatally shot in the
line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Although murder remains rare, violence has escalated since the
mid-'90s. Agents dodge rocks, bricks and invectives. Random gunfire
is constant. Many Border Patrol agents are equipped with helmets
and body armor. And where a drug load was once abandoned at the
first sign of the law, smugglers may now defend the stuff with
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Butch Gamboa, 36, was sniped at while driving a lonely
road near the San Pedro River, a favorite haunt for runners. He was
also pinned down once at the Western Corrals, a grassy out back
near the border south of Palominas.
</P>
<P>
   Drug task force agents had set a trap for a load of marijuana.
The snare was sprung in the dead of night when four vehicles came
through. As agents closed in through the tall grass, smugglers laid
down a hail of gunfire. Gamboa and other agents were kept at bay
until a helicopter arrived with searchlights. The smugglers
retreated to Mexico, leaving some of the dope behind.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between Douglas and Naco, Agent Joe Garcia, 27, tunes
his scanner to a frequency used by the dopers. Two voices speak
Spanish, one giving instructions to the other. It's clear the two
have just crossed the border, but Garcia can't figure out where. He
does know this much: The smug glers want la migra to see a big
group of illegal immigrants cross ing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common tactic. The agents go after the immigrants while
drug smugglers sneak in behind. If agents are lucky, they'll catch
both. A week earlier, Gar cia was called to a shed in Naco where
illegals were thought to be holed up. Inside were 14 people and 400
pounds of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The voices on the scanner are breathless now, and Garcia guesses
they're backpacking dope in high country, so he focuses his
binoculars on nearby mountains. He sees nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As night falls, Border Patrol spotters farther west see two cars
and a truck stop along Arizona 92 to load something. Garcia takes
after them, burying his speedom eter to catch a black Beretta.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls the car to the shoul der. A half-dozen illegals and a
driver are squeezed inside.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no other agents to help, Garcia takes the
Beretta's keys, tells the illegals to stay put, then takes off
after the second car. Several miles later, he arrests eight more
illegals.
</P>
<P>
   But the first group is gone. They had a spare key.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is philosophical about it. There are too many people and
drugs coming across to catch them all. He does what he can.
</P>
<P>
   `All we're doing, really,'' he says, ``is just slowing them
down.'' &QL;

 ARIZONA IS GROUND ZERO IN
 AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS. 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 c. 1999 The Arizona Republic  
 
 this is an introduction to an eight-
 day special report 
 
Every day, guerrilla smugglers invade the state's southern border
with payloads of pot, coke, meth and smack. The drugs are spread
across the country _ to schoolkids in New York, to stockbrokers in
Phoenix, to farm workers in Seattle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has spent billions of tax dollars on border
checkpoints, undercover agents, air patrols and money-laundering
probes. We've crisscrossed the globe with agents, developed an
arsenal of technologi cal goodies to ferret out narcotics, even
aimed spy satellites at Colom bia to count the coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   From Agua Prieta to Yuma, dope smugglers and impoverished
illegals dodge a gantlet of interdiction forces. Government agents,
most of them dedicated and downtrodden, hunt down the dumb and
unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   The result: As a new millennium dawns, agents along the
Southwest ern border are seizing more drugs than ever. Yet they've
barely made a dent.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona alone, more than 150,000 people were arrested for
drug of fenses during the 1990s. Nationwide, prisons teem with a
quarter-million dope offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many are locked up, new drug runners and users
take their places, spawning an epidemic of crime, cost and social
calamity.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is inescapable: The fight against narcotics, which
costs Ameri cans nearly $18 billion a year, is the nation's most
failed police action since Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   During a seven-month investigation, Arizona Republic reporters
spoke to dozens of drug officers, smugglers, drug counselors and
residents on la frontera, the 350-mile border sepa rating Arizona
from Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   They reviewed law enforcement files, court records,
congressional reports, expert research, drug legalization tracts
and literature from the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every voice, every report, reaches the same conclusion:
The drug war isn't being won, and it's not about to be won _ not as
long as the United States is rich and Latin American countries are
poor; not as long as one has drugs and the other wants them.

   MALIBU _ The real test lies ahead for Pepperdine. Over the next
three weeks the Waves take two trips north, where they'll play West
Coast Conference power Gonzaga, surprising San Francisco and always
tough Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   The next five games will reveal everything, tell all.
</P>
<P>
   By then Pepperdine (12-5, 2-0) will know what to make of its
terrific start under first-year coach Jan van Breda Kolff, whether
it's the precursor to something big or just something to enjoy
while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the Waves take satisfaction from what
they've accomplished _ and they should.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 76-68 WCC victory over the University of San
Diego before 1,783 at Firestone Fieldhouse, they've earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Record-wise we feel great, two straight wins in conference, we
feel good,'' said Pepperdine's Tezale Archie, who scored 10 points.
``We're definitely not playing our best ball, but we like the way
we're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's second straight conference win didn't come against
a mediocre St. Mary's team, as was the case Friday night. San Diego
(10-5, 1-1) came in red hot after destroying Loyola Marymount 82-38
the night before. The Toreros had won three straight, and six of
their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   This win had some merit, giving the Waves two straight wins to
begin conference play for the first time since 1992-93. It also
provides much needed momentum heading into the next five games.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong scored 20 points to lead the way, Kelvin Gibbs
added 13 and Nick Sheppard had 12. Andre Laws had 15 to lead San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Waves head north. It's a challenge Archie looks forward
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me personally, this is my senior year, I've been playing
against those guys for years and this is the best team I've played
on since I've been here,'' Archie said. ``I definitely want to get
tested and see where we stand with the big dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine took control early in the second half, building a
48-30 lead four minutes in. The Waves used a familiar method to
break it open, blanketing the Toreros with a full-court press,
forcing turnovers and getting points in transition.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there _ that's how Pepperdine does things this year
under van Breda Kolff, whose uptempo philosophy is a hit with his
players and even seems to be catching on with the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The success so far) all starts with the coaching staff and
their style of play,'' Archie said. ``The trapping and all that. We
haven't done that since I've been here. Having it uptempo and using
the athletes we have, I think it starts with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves survived a mini-scare down the stretch, committing
some silly fouls and taking some questionable shots to help San
Diego climb to within four points with a little more than a minute
to play. Aside from that stretch, van Breda Kolff was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the way we came out aggressive in the second
half and built the lead up,'' van Breda Kolff said. ``We executed
well, and got a couple of five-second calls on them. Overall I'm
pleased with the whole weekend.''!dlim! &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

Jacksonville plays Miami's swan song with all its might
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ If Miami's AFC divisional playoff loss to
Jacksonville turns out to be the last for quarterback Dan Marino
and coach Jimmy Johnson, Dolphins fans will try hard to forget
their putrid performances that contributed to one of the strangest
games in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   In Jacksonville's astonishing 62-7 victory that was the
second-most decisive in NFL playoff history, the Dolphins were as
awful as the Jaguars were awesome during a bright and beautiful
Saturday afternoon that turned so dark and ugly for Miami that
seeing was almost disbelieving.
</P>
<P>
   Before an Alltell Stadium-record crowd of 75,173, the Jaguars
led 24-0 in the first quarter and 41-0 in the second before
Marino's 20-yard touchdown pass to Oronde Gadsden with three
seconds left in the half produced Miami's only score.
</P>
<P>
   In securing the AFC Championship Game at home against
Indianapolis or Tennessee, Jacksonville's domination was so
convincing it was almost cruel, especially for Marino, who
completed 11 of 25 passes for 95 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was intercepted twice and mercifully removed for Damon
Huard after one series of the third quarter with the Dolphins
behind 48-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars forced seven turnovers and generated 520 yards to
Miami's 131.
</P>
<P>
   Many who follow the Dolphins closely and know Marino and Johnson
well believe the crushing defeat will be the last of their
illustrious careers, although neither would admit it afterward. The
feeling is Johnson will retire shortly but that Marino may wait a
few weeks, which means he could change his mind, depending on what
happens with the coaching situation.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a chance the decisiveness of Saturday's defeat may
have cost assistant head coach Dave Wannstedt a chance to replace
Johnson because owner Wayne Huizenga will be so embarrassed he may
want to erase all evidence of the debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the blame for this one,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't give
them a chance, and that's what we've got to live with. I tried to
prepare them (players) too much. I should have pulled back after
the long trip to Seattle (for a 20-17 wild-card win). It was
obvious from the start that we were dead-legged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had great practices, but, unfortunately, we left
it on the practice field. That was poor judgment on my part. We
were dominated in all three phases. I should have tried to keep
them fresh for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville was so magnificent that it probably wouldn't have
made any difference what Johnson did to prepare. Coach Tom Coughlin
played everyone but the cheerleaders during the game, but the
Jaguars still could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Jaguars defensive tackle Gary Walker, who
had two sacks. ``To score this many points and win like this is
just unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was a case of Marino having a bad day. It
was a case of us putting a lot of pressure on him by playing great
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw a terrible pass on Miami's first series that was
intercepted by cornerback Aaron Beasley to set up a field goal for
a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure (pass rush) got to him, and he had to get rid of
the ball,'' said Beasley, who will see on film that there was no
pressure on Marino on the play. ``Dan's the kind of quarterback who
won't take a lot of sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels pressure, he's going to throw it. I just turned
around, and the ball was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were great in every area. They have taken a lot of
heat for not beating a team with a winning record, but critics
can't use it against them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we proved today is that we won and that it's
going to be tough to win here,'' said receiver Keenan McCardell,
who caught four passes for 52 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in this situation in 1996 when we played in the AFC
Championship Game (a loss at New England). We won't prove anything
until we reach our goal (Super Bowl XXXIV).''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Mark Brunell proved he is healthy. Playing for the
first time since suffering a sprained knee Dec. 26, he hardly broke
a sweat before departing for good early in the second quarter. He
completed five of nine passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Jay Fiedler hit seven of 11 for 172 yards and
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who also rushed for 257 yards, had a yardage
advantage of 197 to minus-one when they led 24-0.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Fred Taylor put on an incredible exhibition with
135 yards rushing on 18 carries. He caught a 39-yard touchdown pass
and, in a series of unusual plays, scored on a 90-yard run, the
longest in NFL playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a hell of a lot faster than I thought he could,'' Miami
safety Calvin Jackson said. ``He's just so explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong was even more
complimentary of Taylor, who missed much of the season with a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the hole quicker than any back I've seen,'' Armstrong
said. ``He runs outside and inside and breaks tackles and makes
guys miss. He's just tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's 90-yard touchdown wasn't the only thing unusual about
this game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Jaguars end Tony Brackens sacked Marino,
forced a fumble, recovered the fumble and, with the Dolphins either
standing around looking at him or trying to play two-hand touch,
let his teammates push him into the end zone for a 16-yard
touchdown return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy to get the sack and recover the fumble,''
Brackens said. ``I thought I was down, until one of our guys pushed
me in the back and said to run. I felt a bunch of guys on top of
me, but they said it was our guys. I didn't know I was in the end
zone until the official signaled touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And the weirdest of the weird, the sprinkler system came on in
the south end zone in the third quarter, but the Dolphins, who have
been outscored 100-10 in divisional games the past two years, were
already washed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in at halftime, we knew the game wasn't over,''
said Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith, who caught five passes for 136
yards and a touchdown. ``But once Dan went out in the third
quarter, we felt they were out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game got so out of hand that Chris Howard, a third-string
running back, scored on a five-yard run. Alvis Whitted, a
third-string receiver, caught a 38-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play our best game now,'' said McCardell, who
really thinks the Jaguars can play better. ``We've still got a lot
of work to do. No matter who we play, we've got to bring our `A'
game.''

Bucs rely on defense, bit of luck
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TAMPA, Fla. _ Great defense, timely offense and a little luck is
what it took to end a two-decade wait and send the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers back to the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs came from behind to beat the Washington Redskins 14-13
on Saturday at Raymond James Stadium after trailing 13-0 late in
the third quarter of the NFC divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Washington watched the final opportunity at victory end in
disaster. Brett Conway lined up to try a 52-yard field goal on
fourth-and-four with 1:17 left in the fourth quarter. But the snap
from Dan Turk rolled to holder Brad Johnson, Washington's starting
quarterback. Johnson got up and looked for a receiver, but was
tackled by cornerback Floyd Young as he threw incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conway's a good kicker and he probably would have made it,''
said Tampa Bay cornerback Ronde Barber. ``You can say we got lucky,
but to me, luck is preparation meeting opportunity, and that's what
we did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay will meet the winner of today's game between Minnesota
and St. Louis. A victory by the Vikings will give Tampa Bay the
home field for the second NFC Championship Game in franchise
history and the first since the 1979 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rooting for my buddies in Minnesota,'' said Tampa Bay
coach Tony Dungy, a former defensive coordinator at Minnesota. ``We
would love to play those guys next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay defense did not allow a touchdown Saturday, but a
100-yard kickoff return by Brian Mitchell to start the third
quarter and two field goals by Conway gave Washington a 13-0 lead
before the Tampa Bay defense forced two key turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't looking real good, but we just needed to make one
big play and (strong safety) John Lynch got it for us,'' Dungy
said. ``That got the crowd back in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Things began to change for the Bucs after an interception by
Lynch. Johnson tried to throw to Albert Connell on a deep turn-in,
but Lynch stepped in front of the pass at Tampa Bay's 31 with 5:06
to go in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we knew we needed to make something happen
offensively and make the most of how well our defense was
playing,'' said Bucs receiver Jacquez Green. ``We started executing
on the plays we were missing earlier in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs drove to the Washington 42, when quarterback Shaun King
threw a deep sideline pass for Warrick Dunn. Safety Leomont Evans
was flagged for interference when he knocked down Dunn before the
ball arrived, giving the Bucs a first down at the Washington 11.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Mike Alstott did the rest, first on a catch-and-run to
the two, then an amazing second-effort touchdown run. Alstott was
grabbed in the backfield before being hit head-on by three Redskins
at the four, but he backed up, reversed field and ran in to make it
13-7 with 2:03 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play symbolizes the whole day,'' Dungy said. ``We just
weren't going to be denied. Our guys don't give up. They hung in
there and overcame some adversity. We saw some great individual
efforts when we needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example came when Tampa Bay's defense made a big play
early in the fourth quarter to set up the game-winning touchdown.
Johnson fumbled when he was blind-sided by defensive end Steve
White. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp dove on the loose ball, giving
the Bucs possession at Washington's 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa's big plays on defense made the difference,'' said
Washington coach Norv Turner. ``We competed as hard as we could,
but we were not able to handle every circumstance that we needed
to.''
</P>
<P>
   A lucky break enabled Tampa Bay to keep alive the second scoring
drive when Dunn scooped up a fumble and gave the Bucs a first down
at Washington's 17. On a third-and-three at the Washington 25, King
scrambled and dropped the ball at the 30 when he was hit from
behind, but Dunn picked it up and got the first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got that one I kind of thought it might be our day,''
Dungy said. ``I kind of felt it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs had a third-and-goal at the one when King threw a TD
pass to tight end John Davis. King ran a bootleg right and threw
the ball as he was clobbered by Ndukwe Kalu. It gave the Bucs their
first lead with 7:29 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play great today, but I didn't lose the game,
either,'' said King, 22, a rookie. ``Our defense is the strength of
our team and all we needed was two scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington maximized its last possession, going from its 38 to
the Tampa Bay 34 before lining up for a field goal that wasn't
kicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad never had a chance,'' Turner said. ``One guy didn't get
the job done, not the whole unit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in franchise history Washington lost a
playoff game when it led after three quarters. The Redskins were
20-0 in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough to lose a game that was going our way for so
long,'' said Washington receiver Michael Westbrook. ``We didn't
finish them off when we had a chance.''

SAINT'S HONOR SCORES UPSET

<P>
   ARCADIA _ Cat Thief won the fight over General Challenge.
Saint's Honor won the San Fernando Stakes over both.
</P>
<P>
   While Cat Thief, the Breeders' Cup Classic winner, and General
Challenge, the Santa Anita Derby winner, exchanged bumps midway
through the 1 1/16-mile race Saturday, Saint's Honor and jockey
Kent Desormeaux stayed clear of the warring favorites on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   That bit of strategy _ or luck _ helped the 24-1 shot go on to
win the $300,000 race for 4-year-olds before a Laffit Pincay Day
crowd of 19,875 at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I was the only one who didn't get banged
around,'' said Desormeaux, who picked up the mount after Corey
Nakatani, brother-in-law of winning trainer Craig Dollase, chose to
ride fifth-place finisher Cliquot.
</P>
<P>
   Saint's Honor ($50.60) won by 1 1/2 lengths over Cat Thief and
Pat Day, who held on for second by a head over Mr. Broad Blade and
Pat Valenzuela. General Challenge and Chris McCarron wound up fifth
after getting the worst of the bumping.
</P>
<P>
   On the far turn, Cat Thief was moving up inside pacesetter
Straight Man and General Challenge was advancing quickly between
Cat Thief and the rail. The next thing the naked eye saw was
McCarron pulling General Challenge out of the tight squeeze _ and
virtually out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards watched the videotape for nine minutes before
deciding not to disqualify Cat Thief, ruling it was Straight Man,
ridden by David Flores, who started the chain reaction. Straight
Man faded to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Day blamed himself for getting Cat Thief in trouble in the D.
Wayne Lukas-trained colt's second consecutive defeat since his 19-1
upset in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse ran a game, game race,'' Day said. ``I just didn't
ride a very good race.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron said he simply ``ran out of room.... That's not a good
place to be moving backward in a race.'' Trainer Bob Baffert had
replaced Flores with McCarron before General Challenge's Native
Diver Handicap victory last month.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay didn't ride in the San Fernando but rewarded his fans
with a $10.80 payoff on his 8,852nd career winner,
Continentalsuccess in the second race.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-minute ceremony following the fifth, Pincay was honored
for breaking Bill Shoemaker's record with No.8,834 on Dec. 10 at
Hollywood Park. Pincay received a medal signifying Panama's highest
civilian honor, and President Clinton praised him via videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that his mother, Virginia Kelley, was a horseplayer,
Clinton called it ``a particular pleasure'' to honor Pincay. ``You
gave us a great thrill with one of the last great sporting
achievements of the 20th century,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: In early season 3-year-old races, Hal's Hope ($82.40)
scored his first stakes victory in the $100,000 Holy Bull at
Gulfstream Park, and Golden Eagle Farm's New Advantage won the
$150,000 Golden Gate Derby on a rain-soaked track. Greenwood Lake
was a punchless sixth in the Florida race.... Irish Nip finished
last in his first start since becoming Laffit Pincay's
record-breaking winner. Brice Blanc, the colt's original jockey,
was back aboard.... Budroyale is a 7-5 morning-line favorite for
the San Pasqual Handicap today.... The pick-six carryover today is
nearly $193,000.

LAKERS GET BACK TO BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS -- Failure was an almost foreign feeling to the
Lakers by the time their 16-game winning streak came to a halt
Friday night in Indianapolis, but coach Phil Jackson said it didn't
take long for them to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pouted like 3-year-old kids,'' Jackson said Saturday,
``but they got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the end result was still a winning streak that tied
for seco nd best in franchise history and eighth best in NBA
history.
</P>
<P>
   So there wasn't much for Jackson to say to his team afterward,
other than to analyze the mistakes that led to their 111-102 loss
to the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said a lot of things, but nothing of great importance,''
Jackson said. ``We played a team with a little experience, they
pulled some rinky- dink stuff that they like to do. Then you learn
that stuff. When you're prepared for them, you know what they're
going to do, and these things d on't come up.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant things like Reggie Miller flaring out a leg on his
jumpshot to draw a foul, but also silly Laker errors like fouling
on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Jackson has said all along that a team needs to lose
to learn . So maybe this wasn't such a bad thing to have happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't coach unless there's a loss, you mean? ... There is
some truth to that. A lot of truth,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq-daddy: Shaquille O'Neal quietly became a father again last
week, when his girlfriend gave birth to a baby boy, Shareef Rashaun
O'Neal, on Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am a proud father of a little baby boy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was up late the night of Shareef's birth, before the
Lakers embarked on their three-game road trip, but he said that
wasn't the source of his recent fatigue, and some subpar shooting
the last few games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just tired, kind of beat up,'' he said. ``I'm going to
take the day off (Sunday), then I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot-button issue: Jackson is doing his best to plug former
Knicks teammate and presidential candidate Bill Bradley,
occasionally wearing a campaign button on his lapel. But he's
failed in one respect --he hasn't yet been ordered by the NBA not
to wear the button on TV, thus creating a story, and some
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's stuck their head in the sand, they kind of didn't
want to mention it,'' he said, sounding disappointed. ``I haven't
heard anything . I was hoping to get some kind of declaration on
it, so I can at least make a statement and eveybody would pick up
on it and bring some focus.' '

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES CRITICIZE BUSH TAX PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding)  (ko)

<P>
   JOHNSTON, Iowa _ Seeking to undermine Gov. George W. Bush in the
last Republican debate only nine days before the caucuses here, his
rivals Saturday questioned his credentials as a tax cutter and
ridiculed his centerpiece plan to reduce taxes by $483 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were led by Sen. John McCain, who warned that Bush's
plan favored the wealthy at the expense of lower and middle income
taxpayers. His own proposal, he said, would address a more pressing
matter of paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's plan has not one penny for Social Security,
not one penny for Medicare and not one penny for paying down the
national debt,'' McCain said. ``And when you run ads saying you're
going to take care of Social Security, my friend, that's all hat
and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, ``That's cute, but it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' McCain said, ``they're always cutest when they're
true.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush defended his proposal, saying, ``I've got 2 trillion
set aside to Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush provoked the quarrel when, posing a question to McCain, he
accused the Arizona senator of backing a loophole that would
essentially amount to a $40 billion tax increase for working
Americans through worker-related benefits.
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeatedly tried to turn the attention back to Bush's
plan, at one point tossing off a another quip by suggesting that he
was dancing a ``Texas two-step'' in trying to justify a plan the
would not benefit working-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring between Bush and McCain made for the most stirring
moments of a 90-minute forum _ the seventh debate with all six
candidates _ at the Iowa Public Television studios here that
otherwise was striking for the lack of hard-edged exchanges this
close to the first actual voting.
</P>
<P>
   While the event was billed by its sponsor, The Des Moines
Register, as a debate, the candidates did not take much of an
opportunity to challenge each other; instead they mostly restated
their stands on matters like health care and helping family farmers
to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the event four years ago, when the combatants at this
event ganged up on Steve Forbes and ridiculed his flat-tax plan,
which had been gaining steam, this time they were far more
cautious. Polls show that Bush is well ahead of the pack of the
Republican candidates campaigning here, with Forbes a far distant
second. McCain, who is neck and neck with Bush in polls in New
Hampshire, is not actively campaigning in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several candidates, led by McCain, did raise questions
about Bush's tax plan. Forbes questioned the governor's record on
taxes as governor of Texas. ``Most Texans have never seen those tax
cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah repeatedly said he was the only
contender who could steer a sweeping tax cut through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to have somebody who knows how to get a
tax plan through congress,'' Hatch said. But he also aimed his fire
at McCain, saying, ``I think we could have gotten President Clinton
to give us a bigger tax cut than John McCain's.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the 90-minute event, Bush appeared somewhat
rattled, and sought to defend his credentials as a tax cutter by
declaring, in a response to a question by Forbes, ``Well you know
something Steve, nearly 69 percent of Texans said overwhelmingly in
1998, `You're the man. We appreciate your tax cuts.''' He added,
``It's really real for a lot of folks who live in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   During the exchanges, the candidates differed chiefly on
questions of taxes, ethanol subsidies and China policy, but spent
much of their time taking turns railing against the ethics of the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the country, I'm worried about whether we
are going to have a continuation of the current leadership,'' Sen.
Hatch said at the debate's opening. ``I want to see the
Clinton-Gore team go.''
</P>
<P>
   The main point of disagreement in foreign policy came when Gary
Bauer, long a critic of the Clinton administration's China policy,
declared that he would revoke China's trading status with the
United States, at a moment when the Clinton administration is
trying to make China's ``normal trade status'' permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That policy has failed,'' Bauer said, adding that China was
``in a mass build-up'' of its military forces. ``We need a Reagan
policy,'' said Bauer, who worked in the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, China has been granted what was previously known as
``most favored nation'' status every year since 1980, including
every year of Reagan's presidency, on Reagan's initiative and with
the approval of Congress. But none of the Republican candidates who
agree with the Clinton administration and favor the extension of
normal trade relations with China made that point. Alan Keyes, a
former ambassador, asked Bush about the town of El Cenizo in Texas,
which he said had passed rules to conduct all its business in
Spanish. Bush quickly responded in Spanish that ``it's not the
truth.'' Keyes shot back, also in Spanish, ``It is the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that he had consulted with the attorney general
of Texas and that all of the town's meeting are now ``conducted in
English under the laws of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for English-plus,'' said Bush, describing his approach,
chiefly for the schools, that English must be the main language of
instruction, but that other languages also be used in school
environments.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates talked about aggressively opening up foreign
markets for farm goods, from Iowa and elsewhere. But none referred
to the series of trade agreements struck by the Clinton
administration in recent years to do just that, and only Keyes
described a general strategy for forcing Europe to open its markets
to American-made agricultural products.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But much of the session was devoted to taxes. The candidates
used a question posed by Bernard Hayes of Cedar Rapids on the
marriage penalty to defend their own tax plans and attack those of
the others.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued, once again, that the government budget surplus
should be used primarily to pay down the nation's debt and support
the Social Security program. ``I do want to give middle and lower
income people a much needed tax break,'' he said. ``But we have to
take care of other obligations over the years. We are staggering
under a $5.6 trillion debt and cannot lay that on future
generations. And the Social Security fund is a ticking time bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bauer assailed Bush's plan of ``rearranging the deck chairs
on the Titanic,'' Bush visible bristled and said: ``I'm the one
person who has fought for and signed tax cuts. I've laid out a plan
to make sure the economy continues to grow and to make the tax code
more fair. My plan hears the call of people who live on the
outskirts of poverty. I believe it is important to have to have tax
programs that keep money away from Washington where people will
spend on more and bigger programs. The best way to reduce the fat
is to send money back to the people who pay that taxes and that's
what I intended to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain used the opportunity to pick up on his centerpiece attack
on corporate influences in Congress. ``Last fall Congress passed
one of the most obscene pieces of legislation, a pork-laden bill
that would have spent the entire budget surplus. I fought against
it and I railed against it. The president should force Congress to
spend less money.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the strongest language on taxes, Keyes, who wants the
income tax eliminated, said: ``The simple logic of the income tax
is that it is a slave tax and we are a tax and slave people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes, who first raised the issue of tax cuts with his
calls for a 17 percent flat income tax criticized McCain and Bush
as ``timid tax cutters'' and said Bush's tax cuts in Texas were
``more apparent than real.'' Currently, Forbes is running attack
television ads saying Bush broke an anti-tax pledge while governor
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   To this, Bush responded by pointing to an advertisement run in
Saturday's Des Moines Register by Bob Dole, whom Forbes attacked in
a negative television campaign in the 1996 Iowa primaries, that was
a thinly veiled criticism of Forbes' attack ads in this campaign.
``Bob Dole wrote a pretty interesting advertisement today,'' Bush
said. ``He said if you talk about the record talk about the whole
record. I cut taxes. If not, our budget would have grown by $3
billion. Ask the elderly person whose homestead exemption was
raised by $10,000. That's real. It may not be real to those who
live in million dollar houses. But it is real for the people who
live in my state.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to a question about religion in schools, the
candidates were asked whether they would support the posting of the
Ten Commandments. . Forbes favored it and Bush said, ``It seems
like to me that thou shalt not kill is pretty universal and I think
our districts ought to be allowed to post the Ten Commandments.
These are inherent values that make our society better for
everybody. Our schools ought to expand character educations. We
have to have character education that teaches our children right
from wrong, good from bad.''

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   &UR; THE ORCHID THIEF &LR;  By Susan Orlean. Ballantine, $14. The
author's first book-length narrative is a journalistic account of a
thief caught pilfering 200 rare orchids and plants in Florida, but
its true subject is the monomania of collectors and growers, who
can wait seven years just to see a new plant bloom. This peculiar
mania is revealed as ``a small thing of grandeur, a passion with a
pedigree,'' Ted Conover wrote in The New York Times Book Review
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HOURS &LR;  By Michael Cunningham. Picador USA, $13. The theme
of this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is the haunting of present
lives by memories and books, and it evolves in three connected
narratives _ those of a New York woman whose life echoes events in
Virginia Woolf's ``Mrs. Dalloway''; a housewife in 1940s Los
Angeles who reads the book; and Woolf herself in 1923, living near
London and writing her novel. ``The overall impression is that of a
delicate, triumphant glance, an acknowledgment of Woolf that takes
her into Cunningham's own territory, a place of late-century danger
but also of treasurable hours,'' Michael Wood wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROCKET BOYS: A Memoir &LR;  By Homer H. Hickam Jr. Delta, $12.95.
This nostalgic coming-of-age story is set during the Sputnik era in
dreary West Virginia coal country, where the author (a future NASA
engineer) and five pals undertook an audacious series of rocket
launchings that captured the imagination of a dying region. ``He is
a very adept storyteller,'' James R. Gaines wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BAD CHEMISTRY &LR;  By Gary Krist. Berkley, $7.50. A headless body,
a combustible dog and ``The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' are among the
plot elements in this taut mystery about an ex-policewoman trying
to track down her missing husband. ``Fascination with the power of
secrets ... holds the book together,'' David Willis McCullough
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INVENTING WYATT EARP: His Life and Many Legends &LR;  By Allen
Barra. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $15.95. In 1881, a 30-second gunfight helped
create an American hero and a stirring myth of frontier justice. It
turns out that accounts of Earp's career and the shootout were full
of ironies, confusion and outright falsehoods. This ``refreshingly
pugnacious book'' aims to set the record straight, Richard E.
Nicholls wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEGY FOR IRIS &LR;  By John Bayley. Picador USA, $13. The British
literary critic chronicles his long, rich relationship with his
wife, the novelist Iris Murdoch, and her descent into Alzheimer's
disease. ``In its evocation of the lyrical, the comic and the
tragic, this splendid book enlarges our imagination of the range
and possibilities of love,'' Mary Gordon wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THERE ONCE WAS A WORLD: A Nine-Hundred-Year Chronicle of the
Shtetl of Eishyshok &LR;  By Yaffa Eliach. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $25.
A historian recreates in intensely rendered detail the daily
rhythms of life in her family's shtetl, a town in what is now
Lithuania whose 3,500 Jews were nearly all murdered. Her account
contains numerous photographs and interviews with survivors. In
1998 the reviewer Stephen J. Dubner called this ``an exhaustive and
kaleidoscopic history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE REST OF US: The Rise of America's Eastern European Jews &LR; ,
by Stephen Birmingham (Syracuse University, $22.95), is the final
installment in the author's trilogy on Jewish immigrants in
America. It is a broad canvas filled with portraits of colorful
characters like Irving Berlin, Meyer Lansky and Ralph Lauren.
``Trenchant observations permeate this book,'' Sydney Zion wrote in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FACE-TIME &LR;  By Erik Tarloff. Pocket Books, $12.95. A rising
White House speechwriter is horrified when the president takes a
shine to his girlfriend. She's flattered, of course, and tempted by
the prospect of ultimate insider access. The result is a novel
``about sex and power in Washington that goes behind the headlines
to a darker place,'' Patricia O'Brien wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FALLING SLOWLY &LR;  By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
This novel focuses on two willfully hermitic sisters torn between a
desire for connection with the larger world and a greedy
complacency about their carefully sheltered existence. Brookner is
``the unrivaled mistress of the stifled life,'' Claire Messud wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOREIGN BODIES &LR;  By Hwee Hwee Tan. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $12.95. This first novel is about a young lawyer in
Singapore who has nine days to prove that her English boyfriend is
not the mastermind of an international gambling ring. ``Tan spins
out a gripping story,'' Anderson Tepper wrote in The New York Times
Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WINTER COUNT &LR;  By Barry Lopez. Vintage, $11. Many of these
stories focus on obscure figures and incidents in the Plains and
Rockies, and are informed by American Indian culture and mystical
wisdom. Each tale ``is as economical in design, as painstakingly
crafted and as resonant as a good classical guitar,'' David Quammen
wrote in 1981.
