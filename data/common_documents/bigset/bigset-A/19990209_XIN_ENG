<HEADLINE> British Foreign Secretary To Return to Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook will return to France on Tuesday to make his new efforts on
the peace talks about the Serbian province of Kosovo, which is
currently held near Paris.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office Spokesman told Xinhua on Monday that
Cook would try to encourage the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians to
make some progress on their way aimed at signing a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
But he said Cook's decision to go back to Paris did not mean
that the talks had hit problems.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Cook is jointly chairing the negotiations with French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine. It is his duty to see the
progress on the talks," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary had said earlier that he would return at
least once during the first week, noted the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But he would put extra pressure on the region's Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to sign a peace treaty, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the warring groups in Kosovo made almost
no progress during their peace talks in the first days.

<HEADLINE> Serbs, Albanian Go into Details in Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Serb and ethnic
Albanian delegates representing the two conflicting sides of
Kosovo went into details on Monday in their talks on seeking an
end to the violence in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources close to the talks said that the foreign
ministers of the six-nation Contact Group are likely to meet
before the end of this week in Rambouillet to evaluate the results
of the talks achieved.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met with the three
international mediators on Monday in Rambouillet to make the point
of the situation of the talks, said French foreign ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine did not meet with either the Serb or Albanian
delegation, and only talked with American mediator Christopher
Hill and his Russian and Austrian colleagues, Boris Mayorski and
Wolfgang Petritsch, who represents Moscow and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks are too complicated for him to be
optimistic about a positive outcome, but he said that they are
going ahead.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard, but the negotiations have now begun. They are
working and everybody is on the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albanian sources said that the Albanian delegation has
presented three demands to the international mediators: a clear
definition of the status of Kosovo, the holding of a referendum at
the expiration of a three-year interim period, and participation
by the NATO in the signing of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegation has also expressed hope that an
international force will be deployed in Kosovo, a demand which is
categorically rejected by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The peace proposal presented by the Contact Group does not
specify what is the next step to take after a three-year interim
period.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian armed separatist group the UCK (Kosovo Liberation
Army) wants to obtain independence for the province from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the Contact Group has insisted on obtaining substantial
autonomy for Kosovo without changing the frontier of the Yugoslav
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that the Albanian proposals
have been ill-received by the mediators, who prefer to see the
negotiations going on within the framework of the 10-point peace
plan presented by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
French sources said that France and some other European
countries are embarrassed by the Albanian insistence on a NATO
participation in the peace plan, as it would bring back the U.S.
influence to Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Speaks on NATO's Eeast-expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Absorbing NATO's three incoming
members will take time and it is unclear when a second wave of
east european states will be admitted to the alliance, United
States Secretary of Defense William Cohen said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The door to NATO membership must always remain open but... that
door is at the top of a very steep set of stairs," said Cohen after
talks with German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping.
</P>
<P>
NATO "is not a social club. This is a military alliance and those
countries who seek membership must be willing and able to contribute
to members' security and not just be consumers", said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for NATO had to first prove they measured up to Alliance
standards and could contribute to collective defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it would take time for NATO to absorb the new members
but he did not name any timetable for admitting a possible second wave
of member states.
</P>
<P>
"There should be no exclusion of a country - no country is excluded
based on geography," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO is due to admit the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland in its first post-Cold War expansion this Spring.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Won't Meddle in Zimbabwe's Affairs: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are not about to lecture to them on how they (Zimbabweans)
must manage their own affairs," Nzo said at a news briefing in
Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"But of course the fact of the matter (is), some of the things
that are happening there, will not happen in South Africa," South
African Press Association quoted Nzo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe at the weekend reportedly
demanded resignation of Zimbabwean judges who denounced security
police's contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was commenting on last month's illegal detention and
alleged torture by the security police of two journalists.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists had reported on the government's
suppression of army unrest over Zimbabwe's involvement in the war
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also claimed that Zimbabwe had been infiltrated by
"British agents" seeking to foment an army coup.
</P>
<P>
Nzo dismissed reports that the relationship between Zimbabwe
and South Africa was strained, saying, "in reality it remains
quite good."
</P>
<P>
But Nzo emphasized that human rights remained a fundamental
principle of South Africa's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On Angola, Nzo said the situation in that country was of grave
concern. He repeated President Nelson Mandela's view that there
should be a reassessment of the international community's handling
of the deadlock there.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan last month
recommended the pullout of U.N. peace keepers in Angola because of
renewed fighting in the country. But the U.N. Security Council
wants him to find out whether the Angolan government would agree
to a small U.N. presence.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the South African government was not supplying arms to
the rebels in Angola, but it was investigating whether South
African nationals were involved.
</P>
<P>
South Africa did not want to disassociate itself from a
resolution by the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
which labeled UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi a war criminal, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Charged with Helping Iraq to produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The German prosecutor general
levelled charges on Monday against suspected atomic spy Karl-Heinz
Schaab for allegedly passing technical information to Iraq for the
production of weapons-grade uranium.
</P>
<P>
Schaab, 64, is charged with treason and violation of foreign
trade laws by allegedly giving Iraq in 1989 and in 1990 technical
details for a high-powered centrifuge, according to a report of
the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
He is accused of having sold drawings to Iraqi scientists in
1989 which would have enabled Baghdad to develop a gas
ultra-centrifuge.
</P>
<P>
Schaab surendered last September 24 to authorities at Frankfurt
airport on returning from to Germany from Brazil. He had been
detained in Rio de Janeiro and then released after Brazil decided
not to extradite him to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Schaab decided to return on his own account to Germany in order
to see his terminally ill 96-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor General Kay Nehm lodged the latest charges with a
German Bavarian high court in Munich. Schaab comes from Bavaria.

<HEADLINE> 5 Israeli Allied Militiamen Wounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Monday in south
Lebanon during attacks launched by Muslim guerrillas, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Of them two were slightly hurt in a Lebanese guerrillas'
artillery and heavy-machine gun attack on a SLA post in Soujoud, a
hill on the verge of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The other three were wounded later by a roadside bomb when a
SLA patrol was on the way to Soujoud, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for both attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a Hezbollah roadside bomb killed a SLA officer
and wounded another, prompting a SLA retaliatory shelling on
villages inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 Lebanese civilians and two United Nations
peacekeepers serving in the south were wounded during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its allies.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Israel, Palestinians to Follow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday urged Israel and the Palestinians to
follow the late Jordanian King Hussein's lead and push ahead with
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that the peace process goes on. We are
working very hard to get the parties back together," Albright
said in an interview with NBC Television upon the death of King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
She praised the monarch's role in the Middle East peace
process, calling him a man of peace.
</P>
<P>
"His whole role in the Middle East as a force for peace in
the last years is unmatched," said Albright, referring to his
role in bringing together Israel and the Palestinians at peace
talks at Wye Plantation in Maryland last October.
</P>
<P>
She appealed to the Israelis and the Palestinians to comply
with the Wye agreement. "The Israelis and the Palestinians have
to fulfil their obligations under the Wye Memorandum. We are
determined to make it work. Without the peace process there can
only be chaos," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said both sides needed to come together to
re-establish some of the communications built up during the
first phase of the implementation of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase, the Palestinians had fulfilled some
of their obligations but the Israelis had not. "We cannot wait
indefinitely for these various obligations that are mutually
reinforced to be carried out. The Middle East needs the peace
process," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state did not attend King Hussein's funeral
in Amman on Monday in respect of the Muslim tradition of
all-male funerals.

<HEADLINE> India PM Expected to Visit Pakistan On Feb. 20: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- India has proposed February
20 for Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's planned visit to
Pakistan, official sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"India's External Affairs Ministry on Monday sent a fax message
to Pakistan's Foreign Office, suggesting February 20 for the
visit," said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side is desired that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
receive his Indian counterpart at Wagah border, about 25
kilometers from Lahore, capital of Punjab province, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic bid to boost relations between the two countries,
the Indian External Affairs Ministry announced last week that
Prime Minister Vajpayee will travel to Pakistan on the inaugural
Delhi-Lahore bus service.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from India's Foreign Ministry said in a press
briefing this week the path-breaking exercise "will be one more
manifestation of India's abiding desire to build peaceful,
friendly and cooperative relations with Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The decision comes in the wake of a proposal by Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif that Vajpayee go to Lahore by the inaugural
bus and the two leaders then travel together on the return
journey.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz has welcomed Vajpayee's announcement to
visit Pakistan by bus, saying that Islamabad would warmly receive
the Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz has also welcomed the planned
visit and hoped that it will provide opportunities to the two
prime ministers to review progress of the bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh last
Wednesday, Vajpayee said India and Pakistan are talking at several
levels and he would not be averse to taking a bus ride to Lahore
if that could help boost relations.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I would like to take a bus ride to Lahore," he
added when a reporter asked if he would travel on the bus.
</P>
<P>
The try runs of the service by transport authorities of both
countries were successfully completed last month.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's decision to travel to Pakistan comes close on the
heels of his steadfast position that the Pakistani cricket team's
current tour of India would go through in spite of the threats
from right-wing Hindu groups.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, in an interview with the Indian Express, promised a
reception and hospitality that Vajpayee will remember for a long
time. "Of course I will be happy to go back with him (on the
return journey to Delhi). Actually we will resolve half the
problems while driving back," Sharif told the daily's
Editor-in-Chief, Shekhar Gupta, in the interview given at his
Labore residence.
</P>
<P>
"Let us now begin working at a level where things will work
out," Sharif said and suggested that the negotiations begin
"tomorrow, if possible."
</P>
<P>
New Delhi and Islamabad have been engaged in foreign
secretary-level talks, a new round of which is due to resume in
New Delhi later this month.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held their previous round of foreign
secretary-level talks in Islamabad in October last year. However,
the talks failed to produce any tangible progress.

KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has sent a message of condolence to His Majesty King
Abdullah of Jordan on the death of his father King Hussein over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the new king, Museveni expressed deep sorrow
over the death of the 63-year-old king, a press release issued by
the President's Office said Monday evening.
</P>

Museveni referred to the late king as "a courageous and

government and people of Uganda to King Abdullah, the entire
family of the late king and all the people of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan died of cancer complications Sunday
after ruling the strategically located kingdom for as long as 46
years.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Continues to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's business
confidence slipped further in both December 1998 and January 1999,
South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's business confidence index fell 0.2 percentage
points in January to 82.5 after declining 2.1 percentage points in
December.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the negative impact of the Brazilian crisis on
financial and currency markets in the past two months, the index
has also been negatively affected by further evidence of a
slowdown in key sectors of the economy, Sacob said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
Positive factors may emerge later in the year to strengthen
business confidence, it said.
</P>
<P>
Sacob believes that while recent interest rate cuts will help
to abate the slowdown in economic activity, further cuts will be
needed in order to give a significant boost to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Although markets in Europe and North America continue to show
signs of reasonably robust growth, there is still no evidence of
any structural improvement in South Africa's exports. As a result,
South Africa's balance of payments position offers monetary
policy-makers little scope to accelerate the pace of interest rate
reductions - without the risk of further sharp currency
depreciation.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, it is important that other elements
of macro- economic policy assist in easing present economic
constraints as much as possible," Sacob said.

dollars of machine tools in the year, down from an estimated 8.6
billion dollars in 1997, the first time in five years orders have
fallen and a signal that economic weakness in certain regions of
the world is pinching capital-spending plans, the Survey said.
</P>
<P>
This showed the impact of the world economy on the output of
manufactured goods. As demand for U.S. exports has fallen in Latin
America and Southeast Asia, Fewer U.S. manufacturers are expanding
their factories or buying big pieces of machinery, said a
spokesman of the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association.
</P>
<P>
Sales of machine tools -- such as stamping presses and metal
cutters -- are used to measure manufacturers' long-term confidence
in the economy. Because of their size, price and long delivery
lead times, companies generally order machine tools only when they
foresee a need to boost factory capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Survey is a monthly report issued by the American Machine
Tool Distributors' Association and the Association for
Manufacturing Technology.

<HEADLINE> UK's Polluting Factories to Be "Named And Shamed" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The environmental group Friends
of the Earth has published a list of what it claims are Britain's
most polluting factories.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Factory Watch and published on the
Internet, includes a league table of 97 top polluting factories in
England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Earth said that it has compiled the list using
official data from the British government's Environment Agency in
an attempt to "name and shame" polluters.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that in 1996, the latest year for which
figures were available, the worst polluters together emitted more
than 13,000 tons of cancer-causing chemicals.
</P>
<P>
UK's top polluter for 1996 is Associated Octel in Ellesmere
Port, Merseyside. During that year, the company released 5,340
tons of carcinogens, including lead, chloroethane and vinyl
bromide.
</P>
<P>
The most polluted part of Britain was the north-west, where
9,918 tons of carcinogens were released, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Earth also listed the factories by postcode, so
that any one can find out which factories in their own region are
emitting potentially dangerous chemicals and what the health
effects are thought to be.

KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has sent a message of condolence to the family of the
late Professor John Sebastian Mugerwa of Makerere University who
died at Mulago hospital here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Monday that
Museveni, who is also the Chancellor of the University, paid
tribute to the late professor for his long and outstanding service
both to the university and to the public in general, and
especially to Uganda's educational institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and
Forestry, the late professor had made significant contribution to
the foundation of the Association for Agricultural Research in
Eastern and Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The professor's commitment to the promotion of education in
Uganda also saw him sitting on boards of directors of various
schools, the president added.
</P>
<P>
The death of Professor Mugerwa had robbed not only Makerere
University but the entire nation of a valuable and dedicated
patriot whose experience and knowledge would not be easily
replaced, the press release said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Process on Cyprus at Early Stage: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. process for settling
Cyprus problem is still at the early stage and there is no sign
the U.S. will undertake a new initiative in 1999, a senior Cypriot
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides told reporters that
U.N. Resident Representative Dame Ann Hercus on Cyprus is still
shuttling between Cypriot government and Turkish Cypriots to seek
a solution.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government will assess the situation as
soon as the shuttle talks, which began mid-1998, ends.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983, which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the statement by U.S. State Department Cyprus
Special Coordinator Thomas Miller, Stylianides said "we consider
that Miller's positions are in the framework of U.N. Security
Council resolutions" and reflect the U.S. position that
confederation is not an option that can be considered as a
solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Miller has said "best and intensive efforts" would be
undertaken towards a Cyprus settlement and pointed out that the
problem the U.S. is facing "is with the Turkish side."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has said in a recent visit
to northern Cyprus that the only solution is a confederation of
two states in Cyprus, a proposal opposed by the U.N. and Cypriot
government.

<HEADLINE> UK To Be In A Technical Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 8 (Xinhua) -- The UK's manufacturing sector
contracted by 0.6 percent in December, and fell by 1.3 percent for
the quarter, according to the latest official figure Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the Office for National Statistics were
worse than expected by analysts, who had forecast a fall only half
as big.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, which includes oil, gas and utilities as
well as manufacturing, fell by an even larger 0.8 percent for the
month. For the whole year, industrial production increased by only
0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing is really up the creek without a paddle
</P>
<P>
... it clearly suffered a sharp fall in the last quarter of
1998," said Caroline Gorman, economist at 4Cast.
</P>
<P>
"The falling output figures are much steeper than
anticipated... and increase the likelihood of another rate cut
near-term," Bank America economist Jeremy Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
The figures suggest that fears that the UK may already
"technically" be in a recession could be justified. Industrial
production makes up about a quarter of GDP, and if the rate of
decline continues, it could push the UK's growth rate into
negative territory this quarter.
</P>
<P>
The government's first estimate showed the GDP in the fourth
quarter grew by just 0.2 percent, but some economists now believe
this will be revised downwards.

WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of American
Airlines passengers were forced to make other travel plans after
the airline canceled more than 200 flights amid a continuing
dispute with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 flights were canceled Monday, increasing the total to
more than 300 since last Friday as pilots continued an apparent
work slowdown believed to be in reaction to sluggish negotiations
on a work agreement over a recently acquired carrier.
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls to the union and company officials were not
returned Monday, but answering services referred to separate
information hot lines with recorded statements.
</P>
<P>
The airline canceled about 10 percent of its scheduled flights
Sunday after a high number of unexpected pilot absences, airline
spokesman Tim Smith said in a statement. The cancellation of about
240 of its 2,250 flights on Sunday followed the loss of 90 flights

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Eritrea, Ethiopia End Fighting at Once </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Monday urged "both Eritrea and Ethiopia to immediately put an end
to the current fighting and recommit themselves to a peaceful
solution to the dispute".
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here on the current situation between
Eritrea and Ethiopia, Salim reiterated his "deep concern over the
current fighting between Ethiopian and Eritrean forces on their
common border".
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "I am particularly saddened by this unfortunate
escalation which has occurred at a time when sustained efforts are
being deployed by our continental organization and many other
concerned parties within the international community aimed at
promoting a peaceful solution to the dispute between these two
countries."
</P>
<P>
He underscored that "the framework agreement submitted to the
parties by the OAU High-Level Delegation, remains a viable and
sound framework for a peaceful solution to the dispute."
</P>
<P>
"This framework agreement was endorsed by the OAU Central Organ
at Summit Level, which called on the two parties to continue to
cooperate with the OAU High-Level Delegation with a view to
creating the necessary conditions for a speedy implementation of
the framework agreement," he said, adding that "the latter was
also widely supported by the international community which
welcomed it and considered the proposals it contained as being
fair and balanced."
</P>
<P>
Salim further reiterated "the disposition of the OAU and its
High-Level Delegation, to continue to engage the parties to the
dispute, on the basis of the framework agreement submitted to the
two parties for a peaceful settlement of the dispute."
</P>
<P>
"In this regard and in order to advance the peace process, the
OAU High- Level Delegation awaits the response which the Eritrean
side undertook to communication to it after receiving the
clarifications sought on elements of the framework agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I wish to appeal to the leaders of both countries to
exercise restraint, to abide by their commitments and to do
everything in their powers to avert a further escalation of the
conflict, which can only cause more suffering, loss of lives and
destruction of property and infrastructure, and further complicate
the present efforts," Salim said in conclusion.

MOSCOW, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to Moscow Monday evening after attending the funeral of
Jordanian King Hussein in Amman.
</P>
<P>
This was the first foreign trip for Yeltsin, who is still
convalescing from gastric ulcer bleeding, since last October, when
he cut short a visit to Central Asia due to illness.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Kremlin denied media reports that
Yeltsin had received medical attention in Amman before flying
home.
</P>
<P>
The reports "are absolutely false," the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted the presidential press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press, quoting Jordanian officials, said Yeltsin
cut short the visit and received unspecified medical aid before
his departure.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin spent only about two hours and a half on the ground
before leaving while a condolence session was still in progress,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old president was released from the Central
Clinical Hospital on January 31, after a 15-day treatment for
acute gastric ulcer bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Monday's surprise trip, made defying doctors' advice against
air travel, was seen as part of Yeltsin's efforts to reassert his
political stature in Russia and Moscow's role in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's poor health has prompted repeated calls for his
resignation and early presidential elections before his term
expires in 2000.

KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has refuted a press
report which said that 121 Ugandan and Rwandan soldiers had been
captured by the Chadian forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo

</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Monday evening, State Minister of
Defense Steven Kavuma clarified that nobody in the Uganda People's
Defense Forces (UPDF) had been captured in DRC as reported by
Monday's Monitor newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that UPDF personnel could not have been
captured from a place or area where the UPDF had no presence.
</P>
<P>
He advised Ugandans to ignore the report as it is unfounded and
clearly untrue.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Monitor paper quoted a Chadian military officer as
saying over the weekend that 121 soldiers from Uganda and Rwanda

Gbadolite was formerly the stronghold of former Zairean leader
Mobutu Sese Seko, ousted in May 1997 by DRC President Laurent

Chad, along with Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, has deployed

BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday expressed hope
that it will open a new chapter in its relations with Lebanon, the
official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry's deputy-undersecretary Aydan Karahan
said at a news conference after his meeting with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud that during the meeting, he delivered a
message to Lahoud from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
another from Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to his Lebanese
counterpart Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
"Our talks focussed on bilateral cooperation in regional
security and anti-terrorism," he said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Karahan had raised his government's call on
Lebanon to join an agreement signed between Turkey and Syria last
October to end alleged Syrian support for the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK), which is seeking independence from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been apprehensive of PKK activities in Lebanon's
western Bekaa Valley, despite repeated Lebanese assurances that
it no longer harbors any PKK rebels or rebel training camps, but
Turkey is not convinced by the Lebanese claims.
</P>

Turkey is now concerned with a possible return of PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan to Lebanon since he was released by Italian police

<HEADLINE> Jailed Sankoh in S. Leone Allowed to Meet with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kabbah announced the decision in a broadcast speech Sunday
night, saying that he would allow Sankoh to have talks with his
top men in the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who is seeking to
overthrow Kabbah, the media here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean president said that any talks with rebels
must be held under the framework of the Abidjan accord on ending
civil war in the west African country signed by the two parties
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rebels must halt all armed attacks on
civilians in the country and present no pre-conditions for talks.
</P>
<P>
The international community has agreed to the terms for the
rebels to sit down in talks, said Kabbah, adding that he would
withdraw the decision if the rebels had preconditions of their
own.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abidjan accord, Kabbah said, "the rebels must
recognize the legitimacy of my government" and that the RUF would
be recognized as a political party.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was sentenced to death last year by the Sierra Leonean
government in connection with the 1997 coup and atrocities blamed
on the military junta, and has been held in custody of the
Nigerian led west African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah offered to free Sankoh when the latest attacks on
capital Freetown started on January 6, but later hardened his
policy toward rebels as ECOMOG troops appeared to retake the
initiative in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Concern about Sierra Leone's immediate future has grown when
Nigeria has made it clear that it wants to withdraw its force of
12,000 men from Sierra Leone before the military government hands
power over to an elected government on May 29.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States embassy
in Tanzania will resume its visa services on February 16, it was
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the United States Information Service
(USIS) here said that the embassy plans to resume full issuance of
visas in Dar es Salaam at it new location at 140 Msese Road,
Kinodoni District.
</P>
<P>
The embassy has been unable to issue visas since the terrorist
bombing at its previous site on Laibon Road on August 7 last year.
The blast killed 11 people, injured more than 70 others and
severely damaged inside structures.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, the embassy managed to handle official
business at a staff's residence located at the Toure Drive along
the Indian Ocean. However, Tanzanians seeking U.S. visas had to go
to other African countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy, after half year's of chaos, has to move again
and managed to settle down at 140 Msese Road, a 6.5-acre complex
behind the Russian embassy. USIS has also moved its office to the

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nine dependants of the
U.N. staff and 21 consultants were relocated on Saturday and
Sunday from Asmara, capital of Eritrea, to Sanna, Yemen, due to
heavy fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Three staff members were also part of the group to accompany
their infant children, the three staff are expected to return to
Asmara after they take their babies to their families in Europe,"
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sahnoun, U.N. special envoy, is en route to New York
after concluding his mission to Eritrea and Ethiopia in a bid to
back the peace process between the two countries, sponsored by the
Organization of African Unity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a press conference that the special envoy
would probably brief U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
U.N. Security Council "in the middle of this week."
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is in the Jordanian capital of Amman to attend the
funeral of late King Hussein, is expected to be back in New York
on Tuesday morning, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian and Eritrean troops clashed in a second day of fierce
fighting on Sunday, with Eritrea reporting that it had repelled an
Ethiopian assault on a key border outpost.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia condemned the attack on what it said was civilian
target, calling it a "desperate measure" by Eritrea to compensate
for its battlefield losses.
</P>
<P>
In dispute between the two Horn of African nations are sections
of the 1,000-kilometers border, a colonial legacy, that have never
been clearly demarcated.
</P>
<P>
The border differences simmered for nearly two decades before
they became a pretext for a fierce round of fighting in May and
June lat year that left up to 1,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
Just hours after the Saturday outbreak of the latest round of
bilateral conflicts, Annan, in a statement issued though his
spokesman, said he "is especially concerned that hostilities on
this scale should have broken out while international peace
efforts, including his own envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, were
continuing."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Ask Senators to Remove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors,
bringing their impeachment case to a close, urged the Senate
Monday to remove President Bill Clinton from office because "the
rule of law should apply to everyone."
</P>
<P>
"If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional
consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing the president
to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come,
prosecutor James Sensenbrenner said in making closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
As the historic trial entered its final week, prosecutors got
one last chance to sway a Senate seemingly on track to acquit the
president on the two articles of impeachment passed by the House
last December -- perjury and obstruction of justice. White House
lawyers will follow with their own arguments before senators began
their deliberations on the charges.
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner asked senators not to be swayed by presidential
lawyers' arguments or by attacks on prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation, and to recognize that Clinton himself was
responsible for bringing the impeachment crisis upon the nation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is charged with the two articles of impeachment,
went on trial in the Senate on January 7. He is the first
president in the U.S. to be subjected to a trial since President
Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote in 1868. A
two-thirds vote is needed to convict Clinton and remove him from
office. No one believes there are enough votes in the Senate to
remove the president.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian defense
forces who engaged in extensive counter-offensives on the
Badme-Sheraro and Tsorona fronts have inflicted heavy damage on
the Eritrean army, capturing two Eritrean strongholds.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Office of Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said Monday evening that "Ethiopian
defense forces captured the two major Eritrean strongholds of
Konin and Konito and their surroundings".
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "Eritrean attempts to recapture these key
military positions only resulted in further loss and defeat for
their side."
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian air force played an instrumental role in
Monday's counter- offensive activities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The renewed fighting at the Ethio-Eritrean border began
Saturday and entered third day Monday. The Ethiopian forces
captured an Eritrean stronghold of Geza gerlase Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An Eritrean Presidential Adviser said earlier that Ethiopian
forces " have opened a new front including Alitena, Zalambessa and
Tsorona, using helicopters and fighter aircraft." He accused
Ethiopia of firing the first shot Saturday.

The United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)

<HEADLINE> Flow of DRC Refugees into Tanzania Speeds up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New arrivals in west Tanzania's Kigoma Region have risen from
200 to 500 daily, apparently showing the gravity of civil strife
in DRC, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) sub-office
in Kigoma said.
</P>
<P>
The head of the office, Jean Francis Durieux, said that the
number of new refugees from DRC has climbed to 33,680 so far.
</P>
<P>
The number is a total of DRC refugees who have arrived in
Kigoma since last August when rebel took up arms against President
Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned because the flow of these Congolese refugees
here is a reflection of the intensity of the raging civil conflict
in that particular country," Durieux was quoted by reports from
Kigoma as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official further said that new arrivals are being
taken to Lugufu Camp in the southwest of Kigoma town on Lake
Tanganyika, as the Nyarugusu Camp is full.
</P>
<P>
Nyarugusu, some 160 kilometers northeast of the town, has a
capacity of hosting 50,000 refugees but is presently accommodating
about 40,000 refugees, including those who arrived since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the region has received some 5,000 Burundian
refugees since August last year due to fightings in the country.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes S.African Envoy's Visit to Libya on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) - Britain on Monday welcomed South
African envoy Jakes Gerwel's scheduled travel to Libya this week.
</P>
<P>
Gerwel is planning a visit to Libya, trying to persuade its
leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to hand over the two men accused of
carrying out the Lockerbie bombing, the British Foreign Office
said in a statement issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"He is not going to negotiate on our behalf," the statement
said. But Britain welcomed his efforts to persuade Libya to hand
over the suspects for trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook held talks with Gerwel in London.
</P>
<P>
Cook and Gerwel focused their talks on the Lockerbie bombing
and the possibility of persuading Gaddafi to hand over the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Cook insisted that there was "no alternative to the two
accused, if convicted following a fair trial in a Scottish court,
serving any sentence imposed in Scotland".
</P>
<P>
"Their rights of consular access, and respect for Islamic
culture would be protected, they would not be manipulated or used
in any way to undermine the Libyan government," the foreign
secretary added.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish court is planned to sit in the Netherlands under a
proposal put to Libya, and to which Cook said he wanted "an early
formal Libyan response".
</P>
<P>
In December of 1988, a Pan Am Flight was bombed over the
Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on baord the
airliner and 11 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain accused two Libyan agents of
planning the bombs. They are trying to get the two suspects be
trialed.
</P>
<P>
Libya had once agreed to handover the two to be trialed in a
third country. But the sides concerned had not yet reached any
agreement on the question of where the two should serve their
sentences if they were found guilty for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has always playing the role of mediator between
Libya and the U.S and Britain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Ask Senators to Remove Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors,
bringing their impeachment case to a close, urged the Senate
Monday to remove President Bill Clinton from office because "the
rule of law should apply to everyone."
</P>
<P>
"If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional
consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing the president
to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come,
prosecutor James Sensenbrenner said in making closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
As the historic trial entered its final week, prosecutors got
one last chance to sway a Senate seemingly on track to acquit the
president on the two articles of impeachment passed by the House
last December -- perjury and obstruction of justice. White House
lawyers will follow with their own arguments before senators began

</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner asked senators not to be swayed by presidential
lawyers' arguments or by attacks on prosecutor Kenneth Starr's
investigation, and to recognize that Clinton himself was
responsible for bringing the impeachment crisis upon the nation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is charged with the two articles of impeachment in
connection with his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, went on trial in the Senate on January 7. He is
the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a trial since
President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
Odds were firmly against the prosecutors that Clinton would be
convicted, and some Democrats suggested that the vote on the
perjury charge might not even attract a majority of senators.
Two-thirds must vote to convict Clinton to remove him for office.
</P>
<P>
Senators were already considering alternate punishments. But
Democratic leader Tom Daschle estimated Monday that a follow-up
resolution to censure Clinton would need support from about 20
Republicans to clear an expected Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
Daschle said of the censure effort that could follow votes on
the articles of impeachment this week, "We're trying to make a
historic statement of record" on Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans are expected to vote for the impeachment
articles, but if those votes fail -- as expected -- many of the
Republican senators feel that a follow-up vote to censure would be
too little punishment and a bad constitutional precedent.
</P>
<P>
Daschle's estimate indicated that at least five of the 45
Democrats want to end the impeachment matter with an acquittal --
and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
Senators from both parties have been working on a censure
statement, but the resolution would be debated only after the
Senate voted -- as early as Thursday -- to acquit or convict
Clinton on the impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
Several Republican senators are so strongly opposed to a
censure that they would be expected to mount a filibuster, which
could be stopped only with 60 votes in the 100-member Senate.
</P>
<P>
After a day of final arguments Monday, the 100 senators move
into deliberations, probably behind closed doors, with the vote on
the two articles expected Thursday or Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu has reshuffled the cabinet, axing several ministries and
creating several new ones, a special story from Rwandan News
Agency (RNA) said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anastase Gasana, has been
replaced by Rwanda's Ambassador to Egypt, Amri Sued in the new
cabinet which is comprised of 21 ministers, and five secretaries
of state.
</P>
<P>
Gasana becomes the Minister in President's Office in charge of
Institutional Relations.
</P>
<P>
Three out of seven Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) Ministers
have been axed, while five new ones have been given posts.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice has been given to a genocide survivor,
Jean de Dieu Mucyo, who was heading the Directorate of Judicial
Police in the same ministry. He replaced Faustin Nteziryayo, who
fled to the U.S. to pursue studies.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Interior is divided into two, one is the
ministry of Local governance, and the other remains the ministry
of Interior.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the Rwandan capital said that after four
years of transition, the general public has grown weary of the
government, and local media had seriously lambasted some ministers
for mismanagement, including corruption, and had called for
drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense, Major
General Paul Kagame had in August 1998 warned corrupt leaders that
they will be ''thrown into the dust bin.''
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Rwandan president Pasteur Bizimungu has
shaken up the cabinet since the RPF seized power in July 1994
during the genocide.

NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Shilling was stable
over the U.S. Dollar in sluggish trade in Monday's early session
but commercial currency dealers saw the Shilling strong against
the Pound and the Euro.
</P>
<P>
They said demand for the Dollar had slackened while Dollar
inflows were slow, sending the market balanced.
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. local time, four banks registered the Shilling at
61.70/85, slightly changed from Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expected the Shilling to fluctuate within the same
range all day in the absence of fresh factors.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank posted the Shilling at an opening mean
indicative rate of 61.7778 to the Dollar from 61.7944 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Shilling gained some ground against both the Pound and the
Euro in early trade. The bank posted a Shilling mean indicative

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM Reiterates No Talks on Ties with U.S </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated Monday that Iran will not hold talks with the
U.S. on bilateral relations unless Washington changes its hostile
policy towards Tehran.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Kharrazi said that "it is meaningless to
hold such talks with the U.S. if it continues its hostile policy
towards Iran."
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, Senior U.S. officials have repeatedly
voiced Washington's readiness to open talks with Iran on resuming
ties with Iran which severed following the Islamic revolution in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The two countries exchanged some goodwill signals after
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for cultural exchanges
between the Iranian and American people in January last year.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that Iran will not set obstacle to those
Americans willing to visit Iran for economic and cultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that their visits should be "transparent" and
the goal behind the visits should be clear.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is the U.S. that has slapped economic
sanctions on Iran and banned the American companies to do business
with Iran."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Iran in 1995 on the
allegation that Tehran is seeking access to weapons of mass
destruction, trying to undermine the Mideast peace process and
supporting international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the attack on American visitors in Iran by some
hardliners last year, Kharrazi said the problem stemmed from lack
of transparency.
</P>
<P>
The Americans arrived here as tourists but they had actually
been involved in other affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
On two U.S. stray missiles landing in Iran, he said Iran will
follow up the issue, demanding U.S. apology and compensation.
</P>
<P>
Iran has provided the required documents, information and
photos, showing the damage caused by a U.S. missile in
Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province, he said.
</P>
<P>
One missile hit the Iranian western city when the U.S. launched
attacks on Iraq in mid-December. The other U.S. stray missile
landed near the Iranian city of Abadan earlier this month.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is expected to get 75
million U.S. Dollars in loan from the World Bank, according to a
report available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials said the loan of 75 million U.S. Dollars,
billed as an "economic recovery credit," would help supplement the
central African country's budget over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Donor funds accounted for about 45 percent of Rwanda's 1999
budget, which was approved in December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
World Bank economist Chukwuma Obidegwu said the loan, to be
deposited directly into the central bank, would also boost
investment in social services.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the justification for giving this money is that in
fact the government will increase expenditures in the social
sectors, in educational and in health," Obidegwu said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's Tutsi-led government, which ended the genocide when it
seized power in June 1994, is implementing a series of economic
reforms, including the privatization of the tea and coffee
industries.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Botswana Finance Minister
Ponatsehgo Kedikilwe Monday announced the abolition of all
remaining exchange controls effective from midnight Monday, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"In view of our stable macro-economic environment, healthy
foreign exchange reserves, as well as a sound banking system, all
the remaining exchange controls regulations will be abolished with
effect from midnight today," Kedikilwe said when presenting the
1999/2000 budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
"This is expected to attract foreign direct investment, boost
efforts to diversify the economy, and create employment. The
abolition of exchange controls will enhance the country's position
as an attractive international financial services center.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of economic liberalization and the maintenance of
macro- economic balance, Botswana is now in a position to
establish itself as an international financial services center.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope the required legislation will be tabled during
the next sitting of parliament," Kedikilwe was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other incentives to promote foreign and domestic investment
included the provision of factory shells and the lowering of tax
rate for brick-making and milling to 15 percent from 25 percent.
Unit trust dividends will now be exempt from income tax.
</P>
<P>
Domestic direct investment is to be further encouraged by a
credit scheme backed by government guarantees to finance big,
small and medium enterprises which are largely shunned by the
banks.
</P>
<P>
Companies operating within the ambit of the proposed
international financial services center will also be taxed at the
preferential 15 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
To encourage domestic savings, the lower limit for taxation of
interest earnings will be raised from 1,000 Pula (220 U.S.
Dollars) to 2,500 Pula (550 Dollars) per annum.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Chief Calls for Sustainable Development In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- the Nairobi-based U.N.
Environment Program (UNEP) Sunday called for a development plan
for Nairobi that will ensure the city develops in a sustainable
manner.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, UNEP Executive Director and Acting Executive
Director of the U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat), said
his organizations stand ready to help relevant Kenyan authorities
to develop an "action plan" for Nairobi that could be "a blueprint
for environmentally sensitive urban development throughout
Africa."
</P>
<P>
Toepfer made the remarks as he visited the city's Mathare area,
one of the largest and poorest slum in Africa.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA),
Toepfer said

such an "action plan", involving all stake-holders, would
identify environmentally-vulnerable areas which require careful
management for the future sustainability of the city.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "Nairobi, along with many other cities in the
world, is urbanizing at a rapid rate. Cities need to develop but
in a sustainable manner."
</P>
<P>
"As the population grows," Toepfer said, " the pressures on
Nairobi are increasing, but for the benefit of all the process of
urbanization must take socio-economic and environmental factors
into consideration."
</P>
<P>
"The thousands of people living in Mathare bear witness to the
urgent need to improve living conditions in Nairobi," Toepfer
said, adding that in this regard, UNEP and Habitat would offer
assistance to the host city.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer was visiting MYSA, past winners of the UNEP Global 500
award, to witness first hand their many innovations in youth
sports, environmental clean-up and community development.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Iran (CBI)
has reached agreements with its trade partners to reschedule 2
billion U.S. dollars of its debts.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the bank Mohsen Nourbakhsh said at a press
conference Monday that the debts, which should be repaid within 12
months, now have a maturity of 33 months.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has received a new credit of 1.3 billion
dollars, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on the country's debt repayment was considerably
eased with the reschedule and new credit, Nourbakhsh said,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The CBI governor put the country's foreign debts at 23 billion
dollars, of which 12 billion dollars have fallen due.
</P>
<P>
Iranian economy, which depends heavily on oil revenues, bore
the brunt in 1998 when oil prices plunged to a 20-year low, with
the deficit reaching 3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predicted that Iran's oil receipts in the current
Iranian year ending on March 20 will not exceed 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rial, Iranian currency, has devalued sharply on black markets.
</P>
<P>
Rial have fallen to 8,700 against the dollar from 7,000 at the
beginning of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Consensus or general
agreement on the reform of the U.N. Security Council should be
arrived at on the basis of full participation of the discussions
by all member states, especially the developing countries, China
stressed here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first meeting of the Working Group on U.N.
Security Council Reform, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun said China is not in favor of setting a
deadline for the reform of the council or focusing the discussions
on matters of concern only to some countries while brushing aside
the opinions of the vast number of member states, those of the
developing countries in particular.
</P>
<P>
Qin hoped that the Working Group will continue to discuss the
various issues and explore the possible plans for the reform of
the council in an open and transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that with a positive and pragmatic attitude, common
ground may be gradually built and expanded, and proposals may be
submitted to the General Assembly through consensus.
</P>
<P>
On some major issues, big differences still exist among the
various parties, said Ambassador Qin.
</P>
<P>
China strongly believes that no matter how complicated and
difficult reform of the council can be, with patience and thorough
negotiations and consultations, a solution acceptable to all sides
will ultimately be found.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has not received a request for the extradition of
Albania's exiled King Leka I, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the 60-year-old king, who appeared in a Johannesburg
court Monday for possession of illegal weapons, would have to face
"the full weight of our law".
</P>
<P>
Leka and his four bodyguards were arrested last Friday in a
raid on his home in a northern suburb of Johannesburg. Police said
they found a huge weapons cache.
</P>
<P>
Leka and his bodyguards would have to spend the next seven days
in prison as their bail application was postponed until February
15.
</P>
<P>
Leka, who has been in South Africa for the past 19 years, was
arrested after his diplomatic immunity was withdrawn last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A Saturday newspaper alleged that Leka's father, King Zog,
helped the South African apartheid regime procure weapons and
equipment banned under U.N. embargoes.

BONN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Freezing weather and heavy snow
have caused chaos and left at least four people dead across Europe
this week.
</P>

<P>
URUMQI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen overseas-funded
enterprises in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region involved
in textiles, furniture, pharmaceuticals, aluminum, foodstuff, and
building materials received commendations today for their
contributions to exports and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yi, the director of the regional trade department, said at
the gathering that foreign trade has grown to 11 percent of
Xinjiang's economy from 1 percent 20 years ago and that overseas-
funded companies have contributed a great deal to this increase.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show imports and exports of overseas-funded
enterprises in Xinjiang growing 36.3 percent to 130 million U.S.
dollars last year, or 8.5 percent of the region's total trade
volume.
</P>
<P>
There are 663 overseas-funded enterprises in Xinjiang. Liu says
that Xinjiang will increase support for these companies and
encourage them to export more.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is one of China's economically underdeveloped areas
and accounts for only 0.46 percent of China's imports and exports.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House Republican prosecutors facing near-certain defeat in
President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial mounted a final defense of
their case on Monday as an unpopular but just cause, while the
White House legal team condemned their efforts as an exercise in
political retribution.
</P>
<P>
-- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott defused efforts to open
jury deliberations on Monday in President Clinton's impeachment
trial, virtually ensuring that senators would conduct their
final debate on Clinton's guilt or innocence in secret.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- United in loss and grief, an extraordinary array of
presidents, prime ministers and princes gathered on Monday in Amman,

</P>
<P>
-- Computer experts, told to avert computer crashing when the
year 2000 arrives, are also tackling glitches involving nine

end of a program.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parties Still Disagree on Election Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The all-party meeting
convened by the Election Commission of Nepal failed to reach a
consensus on the election schedule, a source at the commission
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that after two-day discussions, representatives
of political parties represented in the dissolved House of
Representatives still disagreed Tuesday over whether to conduct
the election to the house phase-wise or in a single day.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra dissolved the house on January 15 and announced
general elections on May 3.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Congress, the major ruling party, favors phase-wise
polls while the other parties, including the Nepali Congress's
ruling partner the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), prefers polls in one single day.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Bishnu Pratap Shaha has said that
the commission will make a final decision respecting the views of
the political parties. But he stressed that no one could dictate
the commission on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Radio Nepal said that at the all-party meeting, representatives
suggested the mobilization of the army and the employment of
former police and army personnel to man the polling booths.
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry has 40,000-strong police force at its
disposal, but 70,000-90,000 police personnel will be required if
the polls are conducted in one single day, press reports said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Supports Cutting off Finance Aid to Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) Tuesday voiced its full support for the Zambian
government in its action to cut off all financial assistance to
the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) following the
misapplication of funds given to the association.
</P>
<P>
Renato Matusse, SADC coordinator for culture, sports and
information, told the press here that the action should be
supported.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world soccer governing body FIFA and the
Confederation of African Football (CAF) to understand and support
the decision taken by the Zambian government, saying this will
prevent the occurrence of similar misapplication of funds in the
future and that public funds should be protected.
</P>
<P>
Matusse said the SADC has been following closely the dispute
between FAZ and the government and described the misapplication as
regrettable.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the dispute will soon be resolved so
that sport can be developed without any hindrance.
</P>
<P>
The on-going dispute will only hinder the development of sport
in Zambia if not resolved quickly.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended financial assistance to FAZ last year
after the association failed to account for over 789 million
Kwacha (about 320,000 U. S. Dollars at current exchange rate)
purported to have been used at the Burkina Faso Africa cup
tournament one year ago.

DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- One young man was killed and at
least 30 others, including several members of law-enforcing
agencies, were injured in Bangladesh on Tuesday during the first
day of the opposition-sponsored 48-hour hartal, the official BSS
news agency reported.
</P>

One man received bullet wound in his chest near Dhaka City
College while he was passing the area, and died later in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 people were arrested in the capital on charges of
violence, the BSS said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jammat-e-Islami and others, called the countrywide hartal to press
home their four-point demand, including replacement of the chief
election commissioner, for joining the country's municipal
elections scheduled to be held later this month.
</P>
<P>
This is the second hartal since the start of the year. The
opposition staged a dawn-to-midnight hartal on January 26, the day
for submitting nomination papers for the municipal elections, to
protest against the government's rejection of the demand.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, at least 30 people were injured and a number of
vehicles were damaged in the capital city and in northwest Natore
district during clashes between pro- and anti-hartal activists,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Grants Former Nazi House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An Italian military court granted
on Monday house arrest to convicted Nazi war criminal Erich
Priebke for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The former SS captain was sentenced to life imprisonment for
his role in the Ardeatine Caves massacre in 1944 and was serving
his sentence at a military prison in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The court accepted the house arrest motion presented by the
prosecution, while Priebke's lawyers had asked that his sentence
be suspended because of his age, 84.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Supreme Court on November 16 confirmed life sentences
handed down against Priebke and ex-Major Karl Hass for the
massacre of 335 Italian men in Rome in 1944.
</P>
<P>
The massacre happened on March 24, 1944, when German troops
rounded up 335 men, took them to the Ardeatine caves on the
outskirts of the city and shot them in retaliation for the
killings of 33 German soldiers one day earlier in a partisan
bombing in the center of the city.
</P>
<P>
The German commandant in Rome, Major Herbert Kappler, ordered
the execution of ten Italians for every German soldier who had
been killed. The five additional Italian civilian victims were
claimed because of an error made by Priebke.
</P>
<P>
Priebke was extradited to Italy from Argentina in November,
1995, and appeared for his first hearing in Rome on December 7,
1995.

<P>
The Department of Defense, together with the Department of
Trade and Industry and the Department of Finance, were hard at
work finalizing details of the program, South African Press
Association quoted Modise as saying in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a hurry to resolve the issue... more because our
equipment is very old, especially in the Navy," Modise said.
</P>
<P>
Some vessels were so old that he was not sure they could safely
return to harbor at the end of their patrol duties.
</P>
<P>
"I fear some would actually have to be towed back," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Navy's jets could patrol only the country's coastline
because they were not built for ocean-going duties.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet okayed the 30-billion-Rand (five-billion-U.S.
Dollar) deal in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The purchase included corvettes, submarines, helicopters,
fighter jets and trainer jets. Companies from Germany, Britain,
Italy and Sweden were named preferred suppliers of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the procurement package agreement would mean a new
lease of life for both the South African National Defense Force
and the country's economy. It would create 65,000 jobs, revive
research in modern defense technology, and create opportunities
for expansion.
</P>
<P>
The procurement plan was opposed by opposition parties, which
argued that the money could have been used to address more basic
needs. But the government claimed that the promised "industrial
participation" of suppliers would boost the economy and created
much needed jobs.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China today suspended its
diplomatic ties with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang and Chinese
Ambassador to Macedonia Xu Yuehe today made solemn representations
in Beijing and Macedonian capital Skoplie, respectively, with the
Macedonian government on the formation of the so-called "
diplomatic relations" between Macedonia and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They said the move violates the principles of the Joint
Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Ties Between China
and Macedonia, and Macedonia's serious commitment that "the People'
s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China and
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China."
</P>
<P>
It also damages the foundation of bilateral friendship and
cooperation, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government lodged the strongest protest to the
Macedonian government, and decided to suspend diplomatic ties with
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Along with it, China halted implementation of all the
agreements between the two governments.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 9 ((Xinhua) -- The fourth Asia-Europe

due to be held here from February 11 to 13 to review the progress
within the framework of ASEM economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Toronto Olympic Bid Enlists Watchdog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commissioner is Charles Dubin, a former chief justice of
Canada's Ontario province and author of a 1998 report on doping in
sport that followed his federal inquiry into the problem.
</P>
<P>
The proposed code would prohibit anyone involved in the bid
from doing something done in Toronto's last quest for the Games:
lending money to a member of the International Olympic Committee
in hope of swaying their vote in the city's favor.
</P>
<P>
Former Toronto mayor David Crombie, head of the 2008 effort,
unveiled the draft ethics code at a meeting of the bid's board of
directors Monday night. A final wording of the code is to be
approved later.
</P>
<P>
The document calls on bid officials and volunteers "to exercise
their duties with honesty, integrity and diligence" and forbids
them to "agree to give or offer a loan, reward, advantage or
benefit of any kind" in an attempt to influence an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Toronto's bid for the 1996 Olympics complained
that some IOC members milked them for up to 800,000 Canadian
dollars (520,000 U.S. dollars) through schemes such as demanding
money to cover first-class air fare to and from their home
countries and then finding cheaper ways to get to Toronto, if they
came at all. The organizers dined making actual payoffs to anyone,
however.
</P>
<P>
The new emphasis on ethics comes in the aftermath of a global
Olympic vote-buying scandal that has led some potential corporate
sponsors to hesitate to link their names to the Games.
</P>
<P>
The new group issued a preliminary budget calling for it to
raise and spend 29 million Canadian dollars (19.14 million U.S.
dollars) in seeking the Games. Of that, 9 million Canadian dollars
would represent donated goods and services, such as free ads in
local newspapers. The earlier bid cost 16.8 million Canadian
dollars, including about 5 million Canadian dollars in donated
goods and services.

<HEADLINE> China's Stock Trading Suspended Until March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Trading at China's two stock
exchanges will be suspended from tomorrow to February 28,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
With China's traditional Spring Festival, the country's most
important festival, approaching, the two exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen will use the time to test their computer systems for Y2-K
problems.
</P>
<P>
Major indexes on the Shanghai Stock Exchange have been
declining steadily since the start of the year. The benchmark
Composite Stock Index ended at 1,090.09 points today, down 54
points from the first trading session this year.
</P>
<P>
The fact that many investors have chosen to put their money in
cash rather than stocks as the new Chinese year arrives is a major
reason for the continued drop, analysts say. And, annual reports
of listed companies that have been published so far have failed to
meet expectations, leaving investors to take a wait-and-see
attitude toward stocks, they say.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that shares on the Shanghai bourse
were worth 294.7 billion yuan by the end of 1998, with market
capitalization of 1.06 trillion yuan. Total turnover at the
Shanghai market was 3.5 trillion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 800 Chinese companies listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, with the number of Chinese
investors exceeding 38 million.

WUHAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China signed a
contract with the Philips China Co. today for a 150-million-yuan
loan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jingzhao, a company official, said that the loan will be
used to finance the Philips Automotive Lighting (Hubei) Co. Ltd.
in China's Hubei Province. The 40-million-U.S-dollar automotive

given financial help to 40 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
Philips has put 1.2 billion U.S. dollars into China since it

<HEADLINE> USAID Assists Ghana's Health Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (XInhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) has granted Ghana eight
million Dollars for its Improved Family Health Program.
</P>
<P>
The grant forms part of a 20 million-Dollar assistance to cover
the program for the next three years. USAID's total commitment
for the program will amount to 15.2 million Dollars with a local
component of 5.06 million Dollars by the Ghanaian government,
according to a report by Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was singed Monday by Kwame Peprah,
Minister of Finance, and Kathryn Dee Robinson, U.S. Ambassador to
Ghana, who initialled for USAID.
</P>
<P>
The Improved Family Health Program dubbed "Strategic Objective
Number Three", aims at increasing the use of reproductive health
services, including population and family planning, safe
motherhood and prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs).
</P>
<P>
Key players in the program are the Ministry of Health, National
 Population Council (NPC) Secretariat, Ghana Statistical Service
(GSS) and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Health Minister Samuel Nuamah Donkor said the program
will specifically support the training of health workers,
provision of quality service, expanding community-level service
delivery, raising public awareness and increasing the involvement
of the private sector in the promotion of maternal and child
health services.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate beneficiaries of activities to be funded under the
program will be children under the age of five and men and women
of reproductive age.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at reducing child and maternal deaths, the spread
of HIV/ AIDS and total fertility due to improved awareness of
access to quality health services.
</P>
<P>
Nuamah Donkor said the program will consolidate the gains under
 previous programs and augment those already in place by improving
 awareness and providing easy access to family planning and health
services.
</P>
<P>
Robinson noted that the grant addresses an essential element of
Ghana's development program, that is, the health of Ghanaian
families.
</P>
<P>
She said the health of Ghanaians directly impacts on the
development of the economy because resources required to build a
strong economy are diverted to care for the ill.
</P>
<P>
"Poor health also limits productivity of individuals and
families" because few families can work productively and invest
in the future when the survival of their children is in doubt,
said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Under the new agreement, she said, "we will continue to
promote and develop effective strategies for Family Planning and
HIV/AIDS prevention".

<HEADLINE> China Pushing Poverty Relief For Handicapped People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- There needs to be a greater
effort in reducing poverty and unemployment among China's
handicapped people, according to State Councilor Ismail Amat.
</P>
<P>
Amat told a committee working on issues related to handicapped
persons that reducing poverty is a nationwide problem and the
number of handicapped persons living in poverty is growing every
year.
</P>
<P>
More than seven million impoverished handicapped people have no
basic living standard guarantees, he added.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies and other departments need to co-operate
more closely in taking steps to eliminate poverty among the
handicapped, Amat said, and employment is a basic need and an
important means to get them to participate socially.
</P>
<P>
Employing handicapped people fits the socialist market economy
overall, he said, and tax offices and other government departments
should work together to develop measures to help the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
He said that there needs to be an effort to avoid displacing
handicapped people from jobs they have and handicapped persons who
have been laid off the job need to be given jobs and social
security to the maximum possible extent.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Host International Workshops on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (XInhua) -- Ghana will host two
international workshops on agro-meteorology next week to create
increased awareness on how matters of the weather and climate
affect day-to-day activities, especially food production.
</P>
<P>
John Mahama, Minister of Communications, made the announcement
at a news conference Monday in Accra, capital of Ghana, according
to Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mahama noted that even though meteorology plays a vital role in
 agriculture which is the backbone of the economy, it does not
receive the required attention.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that the government decided to host
these important events to benefit from the information and
knowledge that will come out of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the first country in Africa to host the conference
which is held every four years. The three-day workshop jointly
organized with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will be
attended by senior experts from the international community.
</P>
<P>
WMO, which has 185 member states, is the supreme body that
determines the general policy for weather, climate, operational
hydrology and related sciences.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, with the theme "Agro-meteorology in the 21st
Century," will assess future application needs of the subject and
make recommendations for future action and state-of-the-art
techniques and methods of agro-meteorological data.
</P>
<P>
It will also address the use of seasonal and inter-annual
climate forecasts for sustainable development and determine future
needs in education and training.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, another workshop, the nine-day 12th
Session of the Commission for Agro-meteorology will draw 200
delegates from 150 countries.
</P>
<P>
The session on the theme: "Weather, Climate and Agriculture"
will draw a program for the Commission for 1999 to 2002. It will
also discuss issues such as farming practices, forestry, livestock
management and land use.
</P>
<P>
Economic impacts of flooding, surges resulting in inundation,
especially of coastal locations, and methods of assessing these
will be adequately deliberated on.

<HEADLINE> hke020858 - News Analysis: Malaysia's Banking Sector Consolidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's banking sector
has consolidated with reforms undertaken especially since the
regional financial crisis, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The assumption of control of two finance companies -- MBf
Finance and Kewangan Bersatu Bhd -- early January this year by
Bank Negara Malaysia, the country's central bank, was part of the
government's on-going efforts to strengthen the banking system,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The merger deal announced Monday between the country's second
largest Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd (BBMB) and Commerce Asset-
Holding Bhd (CAHB) to form Bumiputra Commerce Bank marked a new
level of affirmative action and progress in restructuring and
consolidating the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The merger expected to be completed within this year will lead
to new Bumiputra Commerce Bank to become the country's second
largest commercial bank, with assets worth 65 billion ringgit
(about 17.105 billion U.S. dollars), after Malayan Banking BHD
which has 114.51 billion ringgit (about 30.134 billion U.S.
dollars) in assets.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the exercise, the government, through Minister
of Finance Incorporated and Khazanah Nasional, will hold 30
percent share in Bumiputra Commerce Bank.
</P>
<P>
The entire banking sector in Malaysia was told to consolidate
by way of mergers and acquisitions in the wake of the financial
crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has repeatedly spoke
of the need for local banks and finance companies to become
powerful in order to have a chance of competing with the
international giants.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the impact of the crisis on some banks, the
authorities set up Danaharta (National Asset Management
Corporation) and Danamodal (National Capital Fund Corporation) to
help the banking sector clean off non-performing loans and to
recapitalize banks where necessary.
</P>
<P>
The latest move is in tandem with the country's efforts to
rationalize the domestic banking sector to only eight or nine
major financially strong banks at the end of a series of merger
exercises among more than 30 banks in the country as targeted by
the central bank in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The success of the CAHB-BBMB merger has been seen instructive
to the remaining banks yet to amalgamate.
</P>
<P>
Besides the CAHB-BBMB merger, there are also on-going exercises
of the taking-over of the "technical management" of the troubled
Sime Bank by RHB Bank, and the expected merger between Bank
Simpanan National Bhd and Perwira Affin Bank Bhd.
</P>
<P>
These six banks involved so far have an estimated 32 percent
combined market share.
</P>
<P>
Mergers between banks are anything but new in Malaysia, but of
late, it has been identified as an issue that needs to be
expedited in the wake of the new challenges -- globalization and
liberalization that face the sector.
</P>
<P>
A significant factor underlying the official drive towards
greater consolidation of the sector is the imperative of
preparing the financial services industry for the challenges of
global liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim provisions of the General Agreement on Trade
in Services, Malaysia is committed to allowing foreign access to
the sector by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The latest merger, a step taken in the strengthening of the
country's financial system, will further heighten the confidence
level in the banking sector of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation process of the banking sector has sped up as
the government also holds that it could maximize the country's
efforts for economic recovery.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government still
supports efforts aimed at peacefully resolving the six-month old
conflict tearing apart the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Emmanuel Gasana, political and diplomatic advisor to Rwandan
Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, affirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda has never walked out of the peace process," Gasana, who
headed the Rwandan delegation told the Rwanda News Agency. He was
reacting to media reports that Rwanda and Uganda walked out of the
Lusaka peace talks which ended last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We still believe in the peace process, but there is a
misunderstanding on who should be involved in that peace process,"
he underscored.
</P>
<P>
According to Gasana, the Congolese rebels should be involved in
the negotiations aimed at brokering a ceasefire between the
belligerents.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Rwanda is concerned, when one talks of belligerents,
it definitely includes the rebellion in the Congo, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said what happened in Lusaka was that Rwanda and Uganda
insisted on involving RCD in the talks, which the countries
backing President Laurent Desire Kabila did not want.
</P>
<P>
"It was therefore not a question of walking out, but the
insistence on first of all agreeing on fundamental issues on how
to carry the peace process forward," Gasana explained.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka meeting, chaired by Zambia, involved technical
experts from the ministries of defense and foreign affairs from
DRC, Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and
representatives of the United Nations, the Organization of African
Unity, and the Southern African Development Community.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that the hiring of five new lawyers by the
Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) will boost the
government's two-pronged approach in recovering the wealth of the
Marcos.
</P>
<P>
The five lawyers will help PCGG Chairman Magdangal Elma review
the pending cases, so the government can pursue forfeiture
proceedings against the Marcoses should the government and the
Marcos heirs fail to seal a compromise settlement, Estrada told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no settlement, we have to pursue these cases. We
have to work always for the interest of the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that Elma had requested the five additional
lawyers to help him review all pending cases.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, for his part, said the
government remains hopeful that it could start negotiations with
the Marcoses soon to speed up the recovery of the alleged
ill-gotten wealth of the late president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations could start as soon as the Marcoses appoint
one representative to deal with the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada wants to speed up recovery of the alleged
ill-gotten fortune of the Marcoses and use the money to fund his
pro-poor projects.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Talks With NDF Should Be in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that peace negotiations between the
government and the National Democratic Front (NDF) should take
place on the Philippine soil.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada said that the peace process with
the NDF is an internal matter, and it should not involve any third
party outside the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reported condition set by NDF founding
chairman Jose Sison, Estrada said: "This is our internal problem,
so we should not go outside the Philippines. We should solve it
here among ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora also said that the
government is ready to stand by its guarantee of security and
immunity to NDF negotiators should they come to the Philippines
for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Estrada already replied affirmatively to Sison's letter, in
which the NDF had expressed readiness to resume peace negotiations
within this month, Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has also furnished the NDF's
representative in Manila with a copy of Estrada's letter to Sison,
along with a proposed joint statement on the resumption of the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The NDF is one of two anti-government groups presently holding
peace talks with the government. The other is the secessionist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier vowed to conclude the peace process with the
two groups by the year 2000 in line with his commitment to
bringing genuine and lasting peace in the country.

<HEADLINE> Three Former French Ministers on Trial for Blood Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Three former French ministers
under the late President Francois Mitterrand were put on trial on
Tuesday for "involuntary manslaughter" in the 1985 contamination
of blood stocks by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Fabius, former prime minister and now president of the
French National Assembly, Georgina Dufoix and Edmond Herve, who
were ministers in the Fabius government, are being tried at the
Court of Justice of the Republic, which was established in 1993
for judicially pursuing government ministers accused of committing
crimes.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since its founding the court has put on
trial government ministers.
</P>
<P>
The families of seven victims in the 1985 blood contamination
case said the government had failed to prevent blood stocks from
being contaminated by AIDS, which was spreading in Europe at that
time.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers could be sentenced to three years in jail
plus a fine of 300,000 francs (54,000 U.S. dollars) for
involuntary manslaughter and involuntarily harming of the
integrity of other people if convicted.
</P>
<P>
They could be sentenced to five years in jail plus 500,000
francs (90,000 U.S. dollars) in fines if the court finds they
tried to cover up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last for three weeks.

<HEADLINE> More Multinational Companies Move Regional Headquarters to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- More multinational companies
have moved their regional headquarters to China, mainly to Beijing
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
By June, 1998, over 80 multinational giants had set up regional
headquarters in Beijing, making it the biggest haven for
multinationals in the country. Involved in a wide range of fields
including electronics, medicine, motor vehicles, communications,
and foodstuffs, these companies have directly invested a total of
4.6 billion US dollars in the Chinese capital, according to today'
s Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
Chevron, one of the world's ten largest petroleum companies,
was the latest example of such settlement. During the New Year
holidays, Chevron's Overseas Petroleum Inc. moved its Asia
Business Unit from California to Beijing. Chevron's opening
function drew such Chinese celebrities as Sheng Huaren, minister
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Business Unit is very important to Chevron, since
nearly half of its overseas operations come from Asia, sources
said. The oil giant has already invested 400 million US dollars in
China since 1979, and, despite the Asian financial crisis, it
plans to inject 60 million US dollars more in the country this
year.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, another big China player, hit newspaper headlines in
June last year by buying a 18-story office block to set up its
north Asia center in Beijing. It is one of the rare instances of a
multinational company from north America and Europe purchases real
estate outside its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1993, Citibank moved its China Area headquarters
from Hong Kong to Shanghai, heralding the inflow of multinational
regional offices to China's largest industrial and commercial
center. At present, the Pudong New Area alone has attracted
regional offices of 11 multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese market analysts attributed the enhanced multinational
presence to the good performance and prospect of China's economy.

<HEADLINE> Shell to Invest $8.5Bln in Nigeria's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Corporation
has announced an ambitious five-year plan to invest 8.5 billion
U.S. Dollars in Nigeria's oil industry to boost the country's oil
production.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the investment plan have reached the advance
stage between the government of Nigeria and the multi-national
companies like Elf Aquitaine of France and Agip of Italy, The Post
Express reported Tuesday,
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, agreements for the take-off of the
plan were said to have been sealed last week in separate meetings
between the Shell management and representatives of ELF, Agip and
the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG).
</P>
<P>
The investment plan includes building of the third production
line at the west African country's 3.8-billion-Dollar Liquefied
National Gas Plant in Bonny Island of Rivers State and the
development of four big off-shore oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Shell's Managing Director, Ronald Van den Berg, disclosed that
70 percent of the investment cost will be provided by the
multi-national companies while the Nigerian government will
provide the rest.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the plan is expected to increase the
country's oil output of over two million barrels per day by at
least 30 percent and to generate about 20 billion Dollars for the
most populous African country over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan will be focused primarily on the possibility
of harnessing the country's vast endowment in gas resources
through the expansion of the existing Bonny Gas Plant which will
be commissioned in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, ranked as the 10th largest producer of associated gas
in the world, produces about 2.5 billion Standard Cubic Feet (SCF)
of natural gas per day, and has a proven reserve of at least 120
trillion SCF of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Though Shell has been reappraising its operations in the
country because of the low oil prices at the international
petroleum market and the continuous crisis in the oil producing
area of Niger Delta, it was learnt that the company will still go
ahead with the investment plan.

<HEADLINE> Australia Favors East Timor Autonomy Within Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Prime Minister
John Howard said Tuesday that he favored East Timorese autonomy
within Indonesia, adding that Australia had played a major role in
Indonesia's policy shift on the territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ABC's 7:30 Report, Howard said he was in favor
of seeing an autonomous East Timor within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We played a major role in bringing about a change in
Indonesian policy because we believed that the previous position
was increasingly unsustainable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said Monday that
Indonesia agreed to a U.N.-sponsored ballot on wide-ranging
autonomy for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Gama also reportedly said that if the Timorese voted against
autonomy, the territory would be put on the road to independence
under U.N. supervision with Indonesia agreeing to return the
territory to its 1976 status as a non-governing territory of
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Howard stressed: "It has always been our preference to see East
Timor autonomously part of Indonesia." "This is very important to
Australia."
</P>
<P>
He warned that an independent East Timor would lead to inherent
instability.
</P>
<P>
"There would be an economic and strategic vulnerability, there
would be the potential for ongoing tension between Indonesia and
the independent East Timor of the type that mightn't exist if East
Timor were an autonomous part of Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as hypothetical a question on whether Australia
would contribute to any U.N. security force set up in the area.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see continued diplomatic effort invested, not only
by Australia but by others to try and persuade the Indonesians and
the East Timorese of the virtues of the preference I've
expressed," he said.

On the proposal put forward by the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) of holding high-level political talks between DPRK
and the Republic of Korea, Zhang said that China supports any
action that will lead to peace and stability in the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the repatriation of aircraft hijackers from
Taiwan to the Chinese mainland, she said that the Chinese mainland
hopes that the Taiwan side should repatriate all aircraft
hijackers from the mainland to ensure the safety of air passengers.
</P>
<P>
The mutual repatriation of hijackers between the two sides has
taken place before, and the practice has been proved feasible.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council should be
consulted for the details of the issue, she added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the establishment of diplomatic
relations between Taiwan and Macedonia, she said that China will
make "strong reaction" over Macedonia's so-called "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"The so-called 'diplomatic relations' between Macedonia and
Taiwan has totally violated the principles stipulated in the Sino-
Macedonian joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic
relations and Macedonian Government's serious commitment that the
govenment of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate
government of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang stressed that the Macedonian Government's action has
seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, violated China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and therefore has damaged
the friendly relations of cooperation between China and Macedonia,
and harmed the fundamental interests and wishes of the two peoples.

MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Peace Talks between the

entered their second day Tuesday with an initial agreement on
setting up peace offices in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported Tuesday that during the

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slips Below 65 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar lost its
footing Tuesday, slipping back below the 65 U.S. cents mark as
profit-takers moved into the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's currency strategist Alex Douglas said
falling gold prices during the domestic trading session, along
with a stronger U.S. dollar/yen also impacted negatively on the
local unit.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 64.70 U.S. cents from 65.28
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the day it fell to a low of 64.67 and reached a high of
65.01.
</P>
<P>
"First off this morning we had a bit of a rebound in U.S.
dollar/yen - the U.S. dollar has been a bit stronger and that was
weighing on the Aussie," Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
"We also had some profit-taking after recent gains and we've
had gold falling quite a bit during our trading session."
</P>
<P>
At 5:00 p.m. (Australia east Standard time) the spot price of
gold was at 287.85 U.S. dollars per fine ounce, down 1.45 from
Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
Douglas said gold fell largely because of comments by German
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine confirmed that Bonn would no longer oppose a partial
sale of International Monetary Fund gold to help raise funds to
cut poor countries' debt.
</P>
<P>
At the close the local currency was buying 0.5715 euro from
0.5808, while trading the Japanese yen at 74.14 from 73.85.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Blocks Zambia's Entry to Customs Union: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is stalling the coming
into force of the Zambia-Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU)
trade agreement, demanding Zambia make an upward review of its
export quota of beer so that Namibia can get more by levying
import duty, a Zambian trade association has said.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail weekly newspaper Tuesday quoted the Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) as saying
that unless the issue is quickly resolved, Zambia stands to lose
its export drive aimed at penetrating the SACU market.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI said late last year that the ratification of the
Zambia-SACU agreement reached last October was progressing well
with almost all members having ratified it except Namibia, which
demands that Zambia increase its export quota of beer.
</P>
<P>
While South Africa and other SACU member countries freely
export to the Zambian market, Zambia's exports to SACU market
still attract high SACU tariffs, making the exports uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
Zambia expects that the signing of the agreement will open the
markets for the country's exports into SACU market but Namibia's
delayed ratification is making this impossible.
</P>
<P>
SACU members are Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and
Swaziland.

<HEADLINE> S. African-Saudi Arms Deal on Hold: Says S.African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's massive
arms deal with Saudi Arabia will be put on hold for two years due
to financial problems in Saudi Arabia, South African Defense
Minister Joe Modise said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis have a serious problem... They have not as yet
recovered from the expenses of Operation Desert Storm," Modise was
quoted by South African Press Association as saying in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"They owe some countries about seven billion U.S. dollars, and
those owed the money are pressing for payment," said the defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki visited Saudi Arabia and held talks in Riyadh with Saudi
crown prince Abdallah Bin Abdel Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said at the time that the talks included negotiations
over an 1.5-billion-U.S. Dollar arms deal for the sale to Saudi
Arabia of G-6 cannon and anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's trip came one year after a visit to Saudi Arabia by
President Nelson Mandela and the signing of a letter of intent to
develop cooperation between the two countries' oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
Modise said Tuesday that some G-6 cannon had been sent to Saudi
Arabia for testing by Saudi Experts, who had said they were happy
with the weapon's performance.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the visit to South Africa by U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen, who arrived in the country earlier Tuesday,
Modise said that planned talks would deal with world conflict
spots, including Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We will also discuss military cooperation between our two
countries," he said.

</P>
<P>
Touching upon an ongoing Sino-EU dialogue on human rights,

rights issues between China and Western countries, including the
European Union, should be maintained on the basis of equality and
mutual respect.

the two sides will immediately stop the hostilities and conflicts,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
China also called on the two countries, for the integrity of
Africa, to peacefully solve the territory disputes by taking a
flexible, positive and pragmatic attitude, she added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Probe Liability for Freetown Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military authorities
has set up a Board of Inquiry to ascertain the culpability of
Nigerian officers and men in the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG in last month's infiltration into capital Freetown by
Sierra leone's rebels.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the board will focus on the role of the
93rd Mechanized Battalion of Nigerian army located at the Kissy
Safecon Terminal of Sierra Leone in the rebel infiltration, The
Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following its investigation, the board will ascertain whether
any order was issued or ignored by the battalion facilitating the
rebel incursion into capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone
passed through the area of responsibility of the battalion before
entering the populated east side of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the commanding officer of the 93rd
Mechanized Battalion, a Lieutenant Colonel, is under custody in
connection with the inquiry and the investigation is a preliminary
probe leading to General Court Martial.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Chief of Defense Staff Maxwell Khobe who visited
Nigeria last week described the rebel infiltration into and the
destruction in Freetown as "a very big disgrace."
</P>
<P>
He told the paper in an exclusive interview at the weekend that
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar and other
Nigerian military chiefs were embarrassed by the incident.
</P>
<P>
Khobe, a Nigerian, blamed the battalion commanding officer for
the rebel infiltration into Freetown, saying that "definitely, the
commanding officer failed in his job."
</P>
<P>
In another development, Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff
Al-Amin Daggash Monday called on the international community to
assist the people and government of Sierra Leone to amicably
resolve the conflicts in the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the international community comes to the aid of Sierra
Leone, that country may not know peace when the ECOMOG troops are
withdrawn," said Daggash when he received Pakistan Higher
Commissioner Zafars Hilaly in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria may not continue to shoulder the
responsibility of maintaining peace in Sierra Leone after the
hand-over of power to a democratic government in May.

<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Tuesday that his administration has to consult with
the congress before making decisions on the proposed referendum
for an independent Muslim state in the main southern island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Estrada said he cannot decide on the
matter on his own, adding that on matters as important as the
territorial integrity of the country, the opinion of the congress
should be sought.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) proposed that
a referendum be called to enable the Muslims to decide whether
they want to be independent, hinting that this is the only way to
put an end to hostilities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
MILF chairman Hashim Salamat was quoted as saying that none of
the solutions offered by the Aquino and the Ramos administrations
were able to appease the Muslim rebels who have been fighting for
an independent Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the move by the Aquino administration to
provide for the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM),
granting the Muslims the autonomy to run their government affairs
at the local level, but still with some level of control by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration, on the other hand, offered the
Muslims the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development
(SPCPD), which was aimed at ensuring economic development in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his stand on the MILF proposal for a referendum,
Estrada said: "I cannot decide it alone. We have to consult
Congress."
</P>
<P>
He said the Senate, the House of Representatives and his
administration should put their heads together in deciding "what's
best for the country," as far as the Mindanao issue is concerned.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Accepts Resignation of Intelligence Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has accepted the resignation of the conservative
Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, the president's
office announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami asked Najafabadi to stay in charge of the ministry
until he nominate a new minister to the Majlis for approval, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Najafabadi's resignation came after his ministry's admission
that a number of its own agents were involved in serial political
killings of several Iranian dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Iran Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his
wife were stabbed to death and at least three dissident writers
were found dead after their mysterious missing late last year.
</P>
<P>
Following the admission of the intelligence ministry, the
pro-Khatami moderate groups put strong pressures on Najafabadi
by calling for his resignation and a fundamental change in the
country's intelligence and security systems.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives also launched counterattacks by
claiming that some of Khatami's sworn supporters were behind the
political murders.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation, Najafabadi blamed the "unkindness" shown
to him by certain individuals and circles.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had spared no efforts in keeping the ministry
to tread on its right course and keep away from minor secondary
issues.
</P>
<P>
So far Khatami has not officially announced the new minister to
 replace Najafabadi. However, local dailies reported on Tuesday
that Ali Yunesi would be introduced to the Majlis to take the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The pro-conservative daily Tehran Times on Tuesday quoted an
informed source as saying that Khatami appointed Yunesi as
Najafabadi's successor soon after receiving Najafabadi's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi was one of the three members of special committee
appointed by President Khatami to probe into the political
killings.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1955, Yunesi once served in the Palestinian and
Lebanese guerrilla camps before the Islamic revolution in
1979. After the revolution, he served as head of Tehran
revolutionary court and army revolutionary court and was one of
the founders of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts to Boost Fishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam hopes to boost the
fishing industry in 1999, planning to catch 1.8 million tons of
aquatic products and attain an export turnover of 950 million U.S.
dollars, according to a report of Vietnam news agency (VNA).
</P>
<P>
To achieve the target, the sector will expand its aquaculture
acreage to 630,000 hectares, asks for a preferential loan of 400
billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (30 million U.S. dollars) from the
government for building and repairing fishing vessels, and
continue developing off-shore fishing.
</P>
<P>
It will also maintain traditional markets including Japan,
China's Taiwan Province and Singapore, and expand markets to the
United States, China, Russia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East,
Laos and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai told a meeting in Ho Chi
Minh City last Saturday that the fishing industry was one of
Vietnam's key economic branches, helping create many jobs and
providing hard currencies for the country.
</P>
<P>
Khai asked Vietnam's fishery sector to effectively protect and
tap sea products resources by setting up stable export materials
zones with high-quality breeds for sustainable development. He
also urged the sector to apply advanced technology in catching and
processing sea produce, expand markets and develop off-shore
fishing.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam caught nearly 1.67 million tons of aquatic products and
earned an export value of 858.6 million U.S. dollars in 1998,
increases of 5 percent and 10.5 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Inaugurates Power Hand-over Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian federal government
has set up a special committee on the hand-over of power from the
military to a democratically-elected government on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over date of May 29 this year is irreversible, Chief
of General Staff, Vice Admiral Mike Akhigbe, said in capital Abuja
Monday when inaugurating the 16-member committee.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe said that the successful conduct of the local
government, state assemblies and gubernatorial elections points to
the sincerity of the Abdulsalam Abubkar government on the terminal
date, press reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that to ensure a smooth take-off of the next civilian
government, the present administration had taken various measures,
including the establishment of an enabling environment for the
enthronement of fundamental human rights and freedom of the
people.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held in Abuja Monday with chairmen of the
three registered political parties, some presidential aspirants
and members of political parties, Akhigbe expressed government's
concern over threats of boycott by some parties.
</P>
<P>
In spite of objections of the alliance between the Alliance for
 Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party (APP) by the
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the two parties
Monday continued to go ahead with their alliance.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have issued notices of withdrawal from the
transition program should the INEC reject or approve the political
alliance between AD and APP.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, Akhigbe said, "Recent trends arising
from the primaries and the resultant threats of boycotts are
giving government some concern."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the recent developments are left unchecked,
"they have the capability to plunge the country into chaos and
confusion."

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Down But Resource Stocks Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Falling telecommunications
stocks dragged the Australian stockmarket lower Tuesday but it was
saved from an even greater fall by a rally in the leading resource
stocks, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index ended below 2,900 for the
first time in a week, sliding 9.3 points to 2,890.7, close to its
intra-day low of 2,887.4 points.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a bit of rotation going on into the resource
sector from sectors that got a bit overheated," said Henderson
Charlton Jones adviser Stuart Smith.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse received no positive cue from the Dow Jones
Industrial Average index in New York which slipped 13.1 points to
9,291.1 Monday night after weakness among technology shares and
futures-related selling programs quickly eroded an early rally.
</P>
<P>
On Australian equities markets, the all industrials index
tumbled 28.6 points to 5,222.3, while the all resources index
stacked on 9.7 points or one percent to 976.5.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Nevitts client adviser Rob Johnston said a sell-off
in the telecommunications sector put the industrial sector under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
"If we'd seen the same pressure in the resource sector, we
would have seen the all ordinaries down 20 points," he said. "Rio
and BHP kept the market up."
</P>
<P>
Sector heavyweight BHP climbed 21 cents, while Rio jumped 35.2
cents.
</P>
<P>
In the telco sector, Telstra tumbled 19 cents on turnover of
12.8 million shares, Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus shed 14 on a volume of
17 million shares and AAPT fell nine cents.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, the Commonwealth Bank surged 20.6 cents
higher ahead of the release of its interim results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The other "big four" banks were all weaker, helping to drag the
industry sub index 19.6 points lower to 6,567.1.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank slipped 5.9 cents, ANZ shed 11.9 and
Westpac eased nine cents.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the resources sector, the gold index eased nine
points to 1,063.2.
</P>
<P>
The spot price of gold bullion in Sydney Tuesday afternoon was
287.85 U.S. dollars an ounce, compared to Monday's close of
289.30.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 383.61 million shares traded for 966.23
million Australian dollars (621.28 million U.S. dollars) with
falling stocks outnumbering rising stocks 680 to 564 and 459
stocks remaining steady.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China has succeeded in the experimental growth of rice imported
from Brazil in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The imported strains were gifts given to former Chinese Premier
Li Peng when he attended the world environment and development
conference held in Brazil in 1994. They were first tried in east
China's Jiangxi Province and achieved initial success there.
</P>
<P>
Hearing of this, a young farmer in Shaanxi named Ling Hui
decided to learn this new cultivation technique, and in 1997, he
was able to grow the Brazilian rice strains on his contracted
plots, and expanded the growing area to 205 plots with a total
area of 11 hectares last year in Ankang Prefecture, a mountainous
area bordering Shaanxi and Hubei provinces. Last autumn, he
harvested 38,000 kilograms of rice with a per hectare yield of
more than 3,000 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to grow these imported strains
on large tracts of land in Shaanxi this year.

<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China strengthened its
international cooperation on electronic financial services by
giving approval to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunications (SWIFT) to open an office in Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
SWIFT is a collective owned by more than 3,000 banks around the
world. It provides secure messaging services and interface
software to more than 6,000 financial institutions in 178
countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
SWIFT's global computer network carried over 900 million
messages in 1998. The average daily value of payment messages on
the network was estimated at two billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
SWIFT message traffic in China has been growing fast in the
past few years, with 3.6 million messages sent in 1998. China has
become the fastest-growing market for SWIFT in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing office of SWIFT will advise and assist local banks

<HEADLINE> EDS-HK-Technology-Center Hong Kong Can Prosper through Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A renowned Chinese-American
scientist says that Hong Kong should depend not only on real
estate, finance and trade for its prosperity, but should also seek
support from science and technology.
</P>
<P>
An economy without scientific and technological support is not
sufficient for the healthy development of Hong Kong, said Chang-
Lin Tien, chairman of the Chief Executive's Commission on
Innovation and Technology, in an exclusive interview with the
Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The commission, set up early last year, is a high-level group
of academics and business people appointed by the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
to advise on measures necessary for making Hong Kong a regional
center of innovation.
</P>
<P>
After the commission presented its first report on scientific
innovation last September, many established international
enterprises have shown interest in investing in the region, said
Tien, adding that Hong Kong will benefit from this with greater
investment and more employment opportunities within a short period
of time.
</P>
<P>
"But in the long run, Hong Kong has to bring scientific
innovation to both new and traditional industries such as
telecommunications, information and software, and Chinese
traditional medicine, clothing and textiles," Tien said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999, which is full of opportunities and challenges,
will be a key year for Hong Kong, Tien pointed out, and the region
should make every effort to introduce more investment from foreign
companies which are planning to invest in Asia on a large scale.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriots said Tuesday
that they will not give up any of the equal rights over the buffer
zone in Cyprus, according to a statement faxed to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Turkish Cypriots regime in northern
Cyprus, which was recognized only by Turkey, said that the buffer
zone between the north and south of Cyprus are under the control
and supervision of the United Nations peace-keeping forces that
have been on the island for years.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots have claimed in recent days that the buffer
zone belongs to and is under the sovereignty of the Greek
Cypriot-controlled Republic of Cyprus, which has won international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Greek Cypriot claim is "devoid of
any basis and is under no circumstances acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side "possesses equal rights over the
buffer zone and under no circumstances will give up any of them or
permit their erosion," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 35,000 Turkish troops stationed
in the north to back the Turkish Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> China to Extend Fishing Ban This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China will extend the ban on
offshore fishing this summer in a bid to preserve marine resources,
the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
This year, the moratorium period in the Yellow Sea northward
from 35 degrees north latitude will be extended another half a
month and will end on September 15, the same as for the East China
Sea, according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China excluded trawlers and net fishing from
sailboats from midnight on June 15 to midnight on September 15,
from an area extending from 26 degrees to 35 degrees north
latitude. In the area north to 35 degrees of north latitude, the
no-fishing season is extended from July 1 to August 31.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, director of the ministry's fishery department, noted
that the move will be conducive to supervising the ban.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he added, the fishery department found it difficult
to supervise the ban at the end of the no-fishing season, when the
ban ended in the northern part of the sea but was still in effect
in the south.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the South China Sea will adopt a similar fishing
ban this year, Yang said, adding that details and time frames
remain to be set.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it may be a little difficult to adopt such a
policy in the South China Sea this year because it will be the
first year of the new stipulations.
</P>
<P>
China adopted an absolute fishing ban in 1995 in the East and
Yellow seas, and after that year output in these seas increased
annually as a result of the moratorium.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Border-Mine Sweeping No Casualties in Record Mine Clearing Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A 500-strong Chinese anti-mine
squad cleared huge tracts of the Sino-Vietnamese border of land
mines without a single casualty last year.
</P>
<P>
Working in southwest China's Yunnan Province, they removed over
280,000 mines and 55,000 other explosives from 66 square
kilometers in 1998, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
In Pianma Prefecture of Laoshan close to the Sino-Vietnamese
border, officers and soldiers of the squad walked back and forth
together over the cleared area to show local people that it was no
longer dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Now the local people are able to farm 2,000 hectares of land
which previously was hazardous.
</P>
<P>
The mine clearing task was organized by the Central Military
Commission (CMC) of the Communist Party of China a year ago and is
to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and CMC have ordered the removal of mines and
explosives on 109.67 square kilometers of land, where about 800,
000 mines made by the United States and former Soviet Union had
been strewn.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhilun, the squad's commanding officer, decided to apply
high technology and advanced mine sweeping methods to fulfill the
mission along the 1,280-kilometer-long border in southern China.
</P>
<P>
The specialist platoons received 52 days training, including
watching video tapes of mine sweeping and being given advice by
others who have removed mines.
</P>
<P>
The casualty free actions of the squad is reckoned to be
something of a record in world military history. They cleared some
600 square meters of land daily, with each man removing over 900
mines and other explosives.
</P>
<P>
And the scientific and systematic training transformed soldiers
who have never before seen a mine into what their colleagues
hailed as "the kings of mine sweeping."
</P>
<P>
For example, 24-year-old Ma Yongxin, who was previously an army
automobile repair mechanic, cleared more than 1,900 mines and 3,
000 other explosives in just one year after he was recruited to
the squad.

BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese festival-goers will
find ample and colorful markets with stable prices during the
traditional Chinese Spring Festival which falls on February 16
this year.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the sharp rise in the demand for meat, the
State Administration of Internal Trade has ordered 28,000 tons of
pork from state reserves to supply the holiday markets. It is
estimated that the seven large cities of Beijing, Tianjin,
Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Qingdao and Dalian will market over 20,
000 tons of pork during the seven-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Administration has also helped allocate 60 million
kilograms of vegetables to satisfy the major cities as well as
areas hit by last year's summer flooding. Guangzhou, for example,
expects to sell more than 2.5 million kilograms of vegetables in
over 60 varieties daily during the festival.
</P>
<P>
The Administration is also exhorting restaurants across the
country to render good service to millions of families expected to
eat a traditional grand supper on Lunar New Year's Eve. The
restaurateurs are also being encouraged to increase delivery
service for grand suppers at family reunions.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Should Take Back Sold Commercial Bank: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government should
cancel the management contract with Westmont, a Malaysian company
which bought the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB), the New Vision
newspaper Tuesday quoted a inspector-general report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was contained in a report of the Inspector
General of Government on the controversial sale of the UCB, which
was released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 100-page report also said that former state minister for
privatization, Matthew Rukikaire and former enterprise development
project executive director, Leonard Muganwa should both take the
responsibility for the failures which occurred in privatizing the
UCB.
</P>
<P>
Under Westmont's management, UCB gave out unsecured loans and
money placements worth 40 billion shillings (40 million U.S.
Dollars) to companies related to Greenland Investments Limited.
Westmont breached the contract so many times, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report accused Rukikaire and Muganwa of ignoring advice on
Westmont from consultants and the media, not continually checking
on Westmont's status after the southeast Asia economic crisis and
under-selling the UCB.
</P>
<P>
Westmont bought 49 percent shares in the UCB in October 1997
and secretly sold the shares to Salim Saleh, Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni' s younger brother, against the management
contract it had signed with the government.
</P>
<P>
Salim Saleh admitted his buying shares of the UCB through
illegal means at the end of last year and Rukikaire resigned his
ministerial post shortly after that.
</P>
<P>
The UCB scandal provoked public anger at the irregularities
found in the country's privatization process and deeply dented
government's image among the general public.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Likud Selects Candidates for Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ruling Likud Party
on Tuesday announced its candidate list for the next Knesset
(parliament) that will be elected in the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,376 members of the Likud central committee, 89 percent
of those eligible, took part in the voting to shape the party's
Knesset list on Monday. The results of the voting were announced
in the early morning of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who already received the
Likud party's nomination for premier in May 17 elections,
remained as number one in the list.
</P>
<P>
The number two slot went to current Science Minister Silvan
Shalom, whose parents immigrated to Israel from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
And the fact that several Sephardic candidates took top places
in the list will likely help Netanyahu muster more support from
Sephardic Jews in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Third, fifth and sixth slots also went to Sephardic candidates.
</P>
<P>
Sephardic Jews, those with Middle Eastern or North African
roots, make up 50 percent of Israel's Jewish population and have
been traditional Likud party supporters.
</P>
<P>
However, since former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who
is popular in Sephardic Jews, left the Likud and launched a new
centrist party last month, the Likud had feared they could loose
the support of Sephardic Jews to the centrist party.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Makes Progress in Removing Weed in Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has made
progress in controlling the rampant growth of water weed hyacinth
in Lake Victoria which greatly suffocated fish and affected
movement of vessels.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office,
Bakari Mbonde, told the National Assembly (parliament) in central
city of Dodoma Monday that Tanzania has adopted biological and
physical means in curbing the obnoxious weed in the largest lake
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Tuesday quoted Mbonde as saying that the
introduction of weevils into the region has started to "show good
results." The insects, bred in several riparian regions like
Mwanza, Kagera and islands in the lake, are used to eat up the
weed.
</P>
<P>
Mbonde also said that the east African country has mobilized
people to uproot hyacinth in most parts of the Musoma town on the
southeast shore of the lake.
</P>
<P>
"The methods have proved to be effective and environmentally
effective," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The state minister said that assistance has come from the
International Development Association (IDA), Global Environment
Facility (GEF), and a non- governmental organization Lake Nyanza
Environmental Sanitation Organization (LANESO).
</P>
<P>
He said about 15,000 hectares of the lake, jointly owned by
Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, have been covered by hyacinth, and
2,000 hectares of the affected area are in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> EDS-New Energy-Development China Gives Priority to Developing New Energy Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
worked out a series of favorable policies to support the
development of various new and renewable energy sources focusing
on hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal sources.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country's annual utilization rate of new and
renewable energy has reached 300 million tons of standard coal,
accounting for a quarter of the total national consumption of
primary energy and over 47 percent of energy consumption in rural
areas, according to a senior official with the State Development
and Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Remote areas of the country have made great progress in using
wind energy for electricity generation, said the official. So far,
160,000 sets of household mini and small wind generators have been
introduced in remote pastoral and mountainous areas and islands.
</P>
<P>
China has imported medium-sized and large wind generators from
Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United States to equip 15 wind
power plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, more than 7,000 small hydropower
stations have been set up with a total installed capacity of 20
million kw, generating more than 50 billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of rural households in China have installed
fuel-saving stoves, with annual biogas production topping 1.5
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
China is also rich in tidal energy, 90 percent of which is
located in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces in the east coast.
</P>
<P>
So far, a dozen tidal power stations have been set up
nationwide with total installed capacity of 20,000 kw, said the
official, who is responsible for work in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
He held that proper exploitation of various new and renewable
energy sources will help improve the country's energy consumption,
and boost the sustainable development of the energy sector, the
environment and the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Intelligence Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Intelligence
Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi has resigned after the
revelation of involvement of his ministry agents in political
killings of Iranian dissidents, a local daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told the pro-conservative daily Tehran
Times that Najafabadi submitted his resignation on Monday to
President Mohammad Khatami and his resignation was accepted.
</P>
<P>
Najafabadi came under strong pressure from pro-Khatami moderate
groups after his ministry announced that some of its own agents
were involved in the political killings of an opposition leader,
his wife and several dissident writers late last year.
</P>
<P>
The admittance of the Intelligence Ministry shocked the
Iranian society and the moderates urged Najafabadi to resign and
called on the government to make a fundamental change in the
conservative-controlled intelligence and security systems.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives launched counterattacks by claiming that
Khatami's supporters were behind the political killings and urged
Najafabadi to stay on his post.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Najafabadi had once considered resigning
after the revelation early last month.
</P>
<P>
But he changed minds after supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei,
joining conservative chorus, accused "foreign agents" or an exiled
opposition group of carrying out the murders and accredited
Najafabadi and his ministry with the "courage" of the revelation.
</P>
<P>
The source said on condition of anonymity that President
Khatami appointed Ali Yunesi to replace Najafabadi and he would
introduce Yunesi to the Majlis (parliament) for its approval.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi was one of the three members of special committee
appointed by Khatami to probe into the political killings.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1955, Yunesi once served in the Palestinian and
Lebanese guerrilla camps before the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
After the revolution which brought to power the
cleric-controlled Islamic republic of Iran, he served as head of
Tehran revolutionary court and army revolutionary court and was
one of the founders of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Office Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Sates has
established a trade office in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, to
coordinate its business activities in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. Assistant Commercial Secretary, Awilda
Marquez said here Monday that the move is part of the U.S.
Congress' initiative to increase American investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to give information and hope to see investments
flow in," because currently ignorance about opportunities in
Africa on the part of American companies has been the major
drawback to investments, the U.S. official told local press.
</P>
<P>
Marquez said the new office would actualize the intended desire
of increasing the trade volume between the U.S. and east Africa
and increasing her country's investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the office was delayed by last year's terrorist
attack at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ms. Marquez, the trade office in Nairobi will
coordinate U. S. activities with Uganda, Tanzania, Eritrea,
Ethiopia and Rwanda, among others. Regional business matters will
be conducted by the commercial councillor at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Two more commercial offices will be established in the region
this year to make information available to both sides, she added..
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official came to Kenya after her tour to South Africa
where she opened another office to cater for southern African
business affairs with the U.S., Kenyan media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She will also visit Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, to open a regional
office there, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Intel Cuts Prices On Celeron Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest chip maker, Monday cut prices on its Celeron
Microprocessors as much as 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Santa Clara, California company said the price
of 400 megahertz Celeron chip was cut 16 percent to 133 U.S.
dollars from 158 dollars; the price of 366 megahertz Celeron chip
was cut 24 percent to 93 dollars from 123 dollars, the price of
333 megahertz Celeron chip was reduced 19 percent to 73 dollars
from 90 dollars; and that of 300A megahertz Celeron chip was cut
11 percent to 63 dollars from 71 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say the moves by Intel are aiming at winning
back market share in the low-end of the PC market.
</P>
<P>
Intel was previously expected to cut prices on its Celeron
family for low-cost PCs and other chips on February 28. But Intel
has stepped up its price cuts and announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Intel was a late-comer to the low-end PC market but it has
recently come on strong with its latest versions of the Celeron
processor designed for PCs costing 1,200 dollars and below, after
its first version was not a success. Advanced Micro Devices were
able to capitalize on Intel's sluggish start in the low-cost PC
sector and gained share in that market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the latest moves by Intel will bring more pressure
on its rival Advanced Micro Devices, which said last week it would
probably report a first-quarter operating loss, due principally to
aggressive Intel price cuts.

<HEADLINE> British Aircraft Carrier in Dubai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The British aircraft carrier
HMS Invincible with 1,200 personnel on board will stay in Dubai
until Thursday morning, the Gulf News daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the 20,000-tonne Invincible, which arrived at
Port Rashid in Dubai on Sunday, in the Gulf has doubled the troop
strength of the United States' main ally at a time of persistent
confrontations with Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Among the British navy's biggest warships, the Invincible set
off from Portsmouth in the south of England on January 9 when
tensions in the Middle East prompted British Prime Minister Tony
Blair to inform Iraq that "pressure would be brought to bear upon
Saddam Hussein."
</P>
<P>
Since launching a series of strikes against Baghdad targets in
mid-December, the U.S. has engaged in sporadic bombing raids in
southern Iraq and skirmishes during enforcement of the no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
The Invincible, a tangible reminder from the allied forces of
their naval and air strength, arrived in Dubai from Bahrain where
it took part in training exercises with other allied forces.
</P>
<P>
The Invincible carries six Royal Air Force attack jets, eight
bombers and other types of planes as well as 11 Sea King
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Among the personnel aboard the carrier are 59 officers, 173
senior ratings, 450 junior ratings and 15 civilians. About 10
percent of the ship's population is women.
</P>
<P>
With a top speed of 30 knots, the ship is protected by the Sea
Dart missile defense system and the Goalkeeper close-in weapons
system which fires an astonishing 4,500 rounds per minute.
</P>
<P>
It also houses 20mm cannons and rocket launchers designed to
intercept enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy refused to comment on any aspect of the
warship's visit to Dubai, the report said.

JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With King Hussein's death, Jordan is likely to cool off its
relations with Israel out of deference to public disillusionment
with the peace treaty he signed with Israel in 1994, Jordanian
analysts predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of discontent with the treaty is the lack of any
progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, for which
Jordanians blamed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, they said.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordanian King Abdullah pledged to the Israelis present at
his father's funeral Monday that he was committed to
peace. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's
office, Netanyahu said Israel is mourning like Jordan, and
Abdullah said he hoped the two would meet again soon.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In the Likud primary held Monday in which the party's
Knesset (parliament) list was chosen, Likud whip Meir Shetrit,
former deputy security chief Gidion Ezra and head of women's
forum in the Knesset Naomi Blumenthal were the big winners,
ranking 5th, 6th and 7th on the list. Defense Minister Moshe Arens
came in only 26th.

<HEADLINE> High-Yielding Variety Crops Invented in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Experts at the Bangladesh
Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) claim that they have
invented four high-yielding variety (HYV) crops by using the
technology of atomic energy, The Daily Star newspaper reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newly invented crops include three HYV paddy --Binadhan-4,
Binadhan-5 and Binadhan-6 and one HYV pulse -- Binamug-5.
</P>
<P>
The paddy variety of Binadhan-4 can be cultivated during the
rainy season and its life cycle is 130-135 days. The average yield
is 4 to 4.5 tons per hectare, according to the investor of HYV
paddy, Dr. Ali Azam.
</P>
<P>
Both Binadhan-5 and Binadhan-6 are cultivable during the dry
season. The life cycle of Binaddhan-5 is 155-160 days and the
average production is 5-6 tons per hectare while the life cycle of
Binadhan-6 is 160-165 days and the average output is 5.5-6.5 tons.
</P>
<P>
Through proper nursing, Binadhan-6 could yield more than eight
tons per hectare, the ever highest production of any HYV paddy
invented in the country, Azam claimed.
</P>
<P>
Ziauddin Ahmed, inventor of Binamug-5, said the pulse is
cultivable in dry season and will have the highest production
capacity among the existing pulses with an average output of 1,480
kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural scientists at the BINA will continue their
efforts to invent more new HYV crop varieties, BINA's Director Dr.
S.M. Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. M. Idris Ali, BINA's director-general and a renowned
nuclear agricultural scientist, hoped that the new inventions
would play a supplementary role in mitigating the country's food
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has a food shortage of about two million tons every
year. The crop-yielding is comparatively low in the country.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants Deferment of VFA Ratification Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Estrada administration said
Tuesday that it is willing to discuss the conditions set by a
senator for the passage of the Philippine-U.S. Visiting Forces
Agreement (VFA), but only after the senate decides the fate of the
accord.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said that President Joseph Estrada merely sought deferment of the
conditions, and he did not reject them outright.
</P>
<P>
"The president merely said he wanted the VFA issue finished
before we tackle the three conditions. After all, the conditions
are not related to the VFA ratification," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
The three conditions set by the senator last week are: the
return of the Balangiga bells which American soldiers took from a
church in Northern Smar as a war trophy, the historical correction
regarding the Philippine-American War, and the passage of the
veterans' equity bill in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, that condition about changing the historical
viewpoint of the Americans on the Philippine-American war should
not be part of the VFA deliberations. It should not be discussed
now just to delay the ratification process," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the return of the Balangiga bells, Zamora said the issue has
been under discussion for quite some time by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is now a proposal from Washington to keep
one of the bells and provide the Philippines a duplicate so each
country would have one historical artifact.
</P>
<P>
As for the equity bill for Philippine war veterans, Zamora said
the measure has been pending before the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"In short, these are not conditions that should be a
prerequisite to considering the VFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zamora said, the government is not rejecting the three
conditions but merely asking that they be deferred until after the
senate decides on the fate of the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Manila and Washington reached the VFA a year ago, but the
Philippine senate is still debating the agreement because of
strong opposition in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will resume large-scale
joint military exercises. But many Filipinos fear U.S. forces may
bring nuclear weapons into the Philippines when they enter the
country's territory.

WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The retirement of Michael
Jordan and the lockout labor dispute showed little effect on
American fans since NBC's Sunday afternoon doubleheader displayed
an averaged 5.8 overnight rating -- up 2 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The netowrk's opener last season, a doubleheader on Christmas
Day, posted a 5.7 overnight rating. Each ratings point represents
994,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good start, but everybody here and in the NBA knows
that it's just a start," said NBC spokesman Ed Markey. "We know we
still have a lot of work to do to regain the fans and keep the
interest."
</P>
<P>
NBC's opener, which started after the 6 1/2-month lockout, was
a regional telecast in which 41 of the 44 overnight markets saw
the Miami-New York game. It marked a 4.6 rating while the Indiana-
Detroit game recorded a 9.5 mark.
</P>
<P>
"There were probably a lot of factors that contributed to our
strong ratings," Markey added. "Fans were itching to see the NBA,
they had a curiosity to see different players on new teams, and
there are more teams whose fans feel they have a legitimate shot
at a championship."

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Practise Family Planning for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian government
minister has called on the Tanzanians to practise family planning
so as to curb the heavy deaths of children.
</P>
<P>
Some 150,000 children die of malnutrition, diarrhoea and
cholera in the east African country per annum while more than one
million others are suffering from malnutrition, Minister of
Community Development, Women Affairs and Children, Mary Nagu, told
the National Assembly in the central city of Dodoma Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Tuesday quoted Nagu as saying that the
government put in place a national policy on security and life as
well as child development in 1993, and another policy in 1996 for
child development, both of which stressed that parents should be
responsible for their children's rights at household level.
</P>
<P>
She said that her ministry is preparing a program on the
implementation of the two policies, and a program to boost
community development.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to people not to give births to so many
children otherwise they will be unable to meet children's basic
needs of schooling and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's population growth rate stands at 2.8 percent
annually, compared with 3.5 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
At a national population and development forum last month,
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said that Tanzania, with
a population of 30 million, faces demographic challenges in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Sally Fegan-Wyles, resident coordinator of U.N. System in
Tanzania, said that the population growth must decline to give the
country a chance to improve the quality of services for people.
</P>
<P>
A Planning Commission official stressed that women should be
given more education so that they grow aware of the importance of
family planning.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Reborn Amidst The Ruins of Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Soon after the roaring sound came, water poured in." the 37
year old woman recalls of that horrible night, memories, which are
still vivid, of the wildly flowing flood engulfing 63 of her
friends and leaving thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
She was saved by soldiers drafted in as emergency rescue squads
who spotted her hanging desperately onto a tree trunk, which was
in four meters of water, where she had been for nine desperate
hours.
</P>
<P>
Now joining workers in front of a new two-story house covered
in white tiles, Wang exclaimed, "My new house is nearly ready,
once the doors and windows are fitted."
</P>
<P>
The house with two bedrooms and 160 sq.m. of floor space has
put her family 20,000 yuan in debt to their relatives, but they
consider it worthwhile because it is larger and safer than the
single-story house which was swept away.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed that the central and local government have given
a subsidy of 1,000 yuan and provided 16,000 red bricks and
prefabricate planks worth 1,000 yuan to each household.
</P>
<P>
Life is still hard here but obviously back on track. After the
water retreated Wang replanted flowers, spinach and radish in her
contracted field, where she had expected to harvest rice.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough clothes and quilts that were donated from all
around the country and the government has guaranteed us a per-
capita supply of 500 grams of rice every day." Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Her two boys both in primary school have now returned to school,
about one km away from their new home. Their tuition and book fees
are free of charge. Since the flood their diet has been mainly
rice and salted vegetables but their mother has assured them they
will have something more appetizing on the dinner table during the
Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"If we work as hard as before, the debt is not a problem," said
the diligent woman, who was pained to see some 20,000 yuan of
anticipated profit from farming, fish breeding and animal
husbandry washed away by the flood.
</P>
<P>
It is still winter in Paizhouwan but the green fields are
suggesting spring is in the air. Some 5,000 hectares of affected
farmland have been replanted with vegetables and wheat. Meanwhile,
the fields still covered by thick river mud left by the flood are
to be transformed into orchards or fish ponds.
</P>
<P>
So, after the destruction wrought by nature the determination
of people to overcome such odds has been rewarded as the structure
of a booming commercial town gradually takes shape alongside the
wreckage of their old homes.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Hold Referendum on MP Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will hold a
referendum on slashing MP numbers from the current 120 to 99
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Organized by a Wellington woman, Margaret Robertson, a petition
 seeking a reduction in the House of Representatives from 120 to
99 members has been signed by more than 347,000 voters in New
Zealand, a country with a population of less than 3.8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The checking procedure has authenticated 292,000 of the
signatures, well in excess of the 250,000 (10 percent of the
electorate) required to earn a referendum.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley
said Tuesday that she was personally pleased that Margaret
Robertson's petition on the size of Parliament had gathered
enough numbers to prompt a citizen initiated referendum.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the petition is presented to the House, officials
would work on the logistics of setting in place the referendum
required by the legislation," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
She said she expects the referendum to be held this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Citizen Initiated Referenda Act of New Zealand, a
referendum is required to be held within 12 months of the
petition's presentation to the House.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Opposition Stages 48-Hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
started a 48-hour countrywide hartal (strike) Tuesday morning to
press home their four-point demand for joining the country's
municipal elections scheduled for later this month.
</P>
<P>
The demand included replacement of the chief election
commissioner, restructuring of the commission, distribution of
voters' identity cards before the polls, and stopping harassing
opposition workers and leaders.
</P>
<P>
This is the second hartal of the year. On January 26, the day
of submitting nomination papers for the municipal elections, the
opposition alliance staged a dawn-to-midnight hartal, in which
three people were killed and at least 300 others were injured, to
protest against the government's rejection of the demand.
</P>
<P>
The central and city liaison committees of the opposition
alliance, comprising the major opposition the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the Jammat-e-Islami and
others, held a series of meetings Monday, and brought out
separate torch processions here and elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
Monday, at least five people were injured and a number of
vehicles were damaged in the capital city during campaign for and
against hartal, and some 25 others, including a pedestrian and a
rickshaw puller, were injured in northwest Natore district in a
gun-battle between pro- and anti-hartal activists, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, which has asked their local leaders to boycott
the polls, earlier threatened to call a 96-hour shutdown from
February 22 to 26, to resist the February 23-25 polls in 140
cities.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders warned that they would go for a one-point
demand of dislodging the government if it resorted to repression
during the hartal and failed to accept the demand.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Awami League, on the other hand, has called upon
people to resist the "conspiracy" of some opposition parities to
foil the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 police and para-military Bangladesh Rifles
personnel have been deployed in the capital to maintain law and
order during the two-day strike.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Grants New Licenses to 5 Foreign Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Five foreign insurance
companies were granted new licenses Tuesday in relation to the
domestication of their foreign branches in Malaysia in compliance
with the requirement of the country's Insurance Act 1996, Bank
Negara (state bank) announced.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman presented the
licenses at a ceremony here Tuesday to the chief executive
officers of the five companies -- The Great Eastern Life Assurance
Company Ltd., The Overseas Corporation Ltd., The Asia Life
Assurance Society Ltd., The Asia Insurance Co. Ltd. and The Wing
On Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance Company Ltd., it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The five foreign insurance companies had earlier obtained the
approval of the central bank and the High Court to transfer all
existing assets, liabilities and insurance business of the foreign
branches to a locally incorporated entity.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor, who is also director-general of
insurance, commended the five foreign branches for their fine
effort in ensuring the completion of the domestication exercise,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"With the completion of the domestication exercise, we look
forward to the newly incorporated entities to progress into the
next phase of the equity restructuring exercise with equity
participation by Malaysian in line with Malaysia's national
aspiration," Ali was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the coming into force of the Insurances Act 1996, a
total of 44 foreign-incorporated insurers restructured their
operations in Malaysia into 34 Malaysian-incorporated insurers,
according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the combined premium income for the life and general
insurance industry in Malaysia accounted for only 4.3 percent of
the Gross National Product (GNP) and the insurance penetration
rate for life business was only 27 percent which was low compared
with other advanced markets.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Woes May Cut Thai Chicken's Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Being aware of the impact of
Brazil's currency devaluation on the chicken market, Charoen
Pokphand (CP) Group, Thailand's largest conglomerate, has urged
local exporters to monitor cheap competitors closely and warned
against production expansion, a CP executive said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local exporters will probably feel the impact in the second
quarter of this year as importers shift to cheaper suppliers, the
executive, who is from CP's agro-business group, said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand's export prices to Japan were 1,850 U.S.
dollars and to the European Union 2,300 dollars, while Brazil's
prices were 200 dollars lower than Thailand's.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's currency devaluation is also expected to affect
Thailand's other export markets, including Hong Kong, Singapore
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Thai exporters will not only lose its
two major markets, Japan and Europe, but will also face increasing
competition when buyers start placing orders for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Brazil consumes four million tons of chicken meat annually. The
country's current economic situation will lead to lower purchasing
power. A 10 percent drop of domestic consumption in Brazil will
immediately hit Thai exports.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the world's cheapest chicken producer followed by the
United States, Thailand and China.
</P>
<P>
As an exporting country, Brazil was the world's second largest
with exports totaling 570,000 tons last year, following the United
States with 2.17 million tons. Thailand ranks fifth by exporting
280,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Brazil's chicken exports will reach 600,000
tons this year.

BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The drought in Thailand has
driven more than 2,000 hungry monkeys to wreak havoc in a village
in the northeastern province of Si Sa Ket in search for food, the
Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>

Some 10 people from the province said that they had been

</P>

Villagers say the monkeys steal what ever they can find,
including eggs from hen houses, fermented fish and sticky rice.
</P>
<P>
A man, who lives just 10 meters from the monkey's habitat, said
there are monkey raids every dry season when their regular sources
of food dry up.
</P>

A restaurant owner said the monkeys broke one of his shop
windows while fighting for chicken meat during a raid on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Meet in March on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama,
have agreed to meet again on March 10 to discuss the future of
East Timor, said U.N. mediator Jamsheed Marker.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed two days of discussions between the
three on a document based on week-long technical discussions
between senior officials of the two countries in New York.
</P>
<P>
Marker told a press conference that the ministers have removed
most of the differences, but there are "very few but important
issues" which require consultations between the governments.
</P>
<P>
Marker, a personal representative of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, said a draft agreement is under consideration, which
sets out the views of both sides and expresses a desire to reach
an agreement based particularly on the principles of autonomy for
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official declined to disclose the content of the
current agreement and the existing "important issues," except to
say that he has been keeping East Timorese leaders informed of the
talks between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Describing their meetings as substantive, both ministers said
they have made progress in the talks. But their differences can be
traced from their remarks.
</P>
<P>
Alatas reiterated that the Indonesian-proposed wide-ranging
autonomy for East Timor remains "the best solution" to the problem.
</P>
<P>
If the majority of the East Timorese reject it, then the
Indonesian government will request the People's Consultative
Assembly consider a formula for "parting ways" with East Timor,
without a referendum in the territory.
</P>
<P>
A referendum may re-open conflicts, even a civil war there,
Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
However, Gama said Portugal would favor "the way of democracy
and the way of a voting process" in solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony for over three centuries
until Portugal pulled out in 1975.

SAO PAULO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The stock markets in Sao

gains Monday due to low share prices.
</P>
<P>
In Sao Paulo, the Bovespa Index closed up 4.6 percent, after
stagnating all day at a level of 2 percent. The increase was due
to a last-hour rush of low-priced shares-buying.

ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An automobile was stolen in Italy
in nearly every two minutes last year and Rome is the hardest-hit
city for car thefts, said a report issued here Monday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Foreigners Learning Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- There has been a 20 percent
increase in the number of foreigners taking the special HSK
Chinese language test according to the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Last year over 41,000 foreigners took the test, also known as
Chinese TOEFL.
</P>
<P>
The HSK test has eleven grades and has been held annually
since 1990. Zhao Guochen, director of the division for teaching
Chinese to foreigners under the Ministry of Education, said that
if a foreigner passes grade three it is possible for them to be
admitted to pursue further studies in science and engineering
majors in average-level Chinese colleges without taking a special
Chinese language test.
</P>
<P>
But some key universities, like Beijing University and Qinghua
University, are insisting that foreigners must pass grade six
before acceptance.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has established special supervisory
groups for teaching Chinese to foreigners, headed by Chen Zhili,
Minister of Education. The country now has over twenty HSK test
centers, and also set up overseas test centers in over ten foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some universities, like Beijing Languages and Culture
University and East China Normal University, have started to train
teachers for teaching Chinese to foreigners by establishing
special departments. China has also set up over 3,000 schools
overseas to teach Chinese to local people.

<HEADLINE> EU Changes Timetable on Converting to Use of Metric System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced here Monday that it has proposed extending the
transitional period for conversion to the metric system for
labeling various items in varying units of measurement.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it has decided to add 10 years to the
period of transition. The new timetable will begin on January 1,
2000, until December 31, 2009.
</P>
<P>
According to the executive branch of the European Union (EU), a
EU directive ruled that member states must use the metric system
only, except for a few specific areas such as air and sea
transport, distances, and draught beer in Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, during the present transitional period, which will end
December 31, 1999, other units of measurement, such as American
pounds and inches, can be indicated in addition to the metric
units of measurement.
</P>
<P>
As a result, both European and American companies now fear that
after the end of the transitional period, they will have to
provide different labels and accompanying notices, among other
things, if they want to market goods in both the European and
American markets.
</P>
<P>
Since the current situation could entail additional costs and
problems, the commission extended the transitional period by 10
years, the third of its kind since the related directive was
adopted in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Currently, provisions in the United States allow the
simultaneous use of standard American units of measurement and the
international system. The EU said it hopes that by the end of 2009,
the U.S. will have followed the other industrialized countries and
have adopted the international metric system for all major units
of measurement.

BANGKOK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart will head a delegation of Thai governors in talks
with their Laotian counterparts in a bid to boost economic and
security ties along the border.
</P>
<P>
Vientiane will host the three-day talks starting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was agreed at the Thai-Laotian Joint Cooperation

</P>
<P>
The first Thai-Laotian governors meeting took place in Bangkok

</P>
<P>
The meeting would deal with border trade issues as both sides
realized that economic prosperity would promote border security,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Archery Coach Upset With Postponed Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian archery team's head
coach Lee Jae-hyun said he did not expect his trainees to win
berths at the Olympic Games after the Indonesian Archery
Association decided to postpone the centralized training session
for one month to March.
</P>
<P>
The centralized training program was originally scheduled to
start early this month.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean coach said his archers would now have just
four and a half months to prepare themselves for the World
Championships, which also serve as a qualifying tournament for the
Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that they will reach their top form in time for
the World Championships. I cannot guarantee that they can qualify
for the Olympics," Lee was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lee was in charge of the national team for the Asian Games in
Bangkok last December. Indonesia, fielding eight women's and men's
archers, came home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointing outcome in Bangkok, the national
archery body has extended Lee's contract until at least the world
meet which will take place in Riom, France. He will have his term
extended if Indonesian archers qualify for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The contract costs the association 2,500 U.S. dollars per month
for Lee's salary.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will send its women's team to the world meet in Riom,
France from July 22 to 26. It then will don national colors at the
Asian Championships in Beijing from September 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the archery body Hayono Isman said he has decided
to delay training on account of nontechnical matters.
</P>
<P>
"There are still some problems we haven't settled. I just want
to make sure that the training program will run untroubled,"
Hayono said.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem was probably the absence of leave permits
from the archers' respective offices, according to Hayono.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has always qualified for the Olympics since taking a
silver in the Summer Games, its first medal in the world's biggest
sports festival.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Allows Foreign Travelers to Enter by Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Hoping to boost the arrival of
visitors from neighboring countries, the Indonesian government has
issued a new ruling that allows foreign travelers to enter the
country by private vehicle, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"As a way to extend the length of stay of visitors from our
neighboring countries and to introduce more tourist destinations,
they are allowed to drive their cars here," the Jakarta Post daily
Tuesday quoted Director General of Tourism at the Ministry of
Tourism, Arts and Culture I Gde Ardhika as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the new rule was aimed at encouraging tourists from the
bordering countries of Malaysia, as well as from Singapore and
Thailand, to drive their cars into Indonesia, instead of having to
come by airplane or ship.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 5 percent of the total visitors to Indonesia
arrive through the Malaysia-Indonesia border in the western part
of Borneo island, Ardhika said.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the remaining visitors come to the country
by airplane, while 25 percent of them arrive by ship, boat or
ferry through sea borders, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this rule, the government will also allow
foreign senior citizens looking for retirement sites to live in
Indonesia for up to six years, he said.
</P>
<P>
They will be allowed to buy houses in the country and be
entitled to use public facilities provided for local citizens.
</P>
<P>
"This new policy is meant to enhance tourism, we want tourism
to become a major foreign exchange earner and a labor-intensive
sector," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ardhika said about 6.6 million people worked in tourism in
1997, and the sector contributed 9.1 percent of Indonesia's Gross
Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
The severe economic crisis hitting the region and social unrest
across the country have caused foreign tourist arrivals to fall 20
percent to about 3.8 million visitors last year from 5.04 million
in 1997, well below the government's target of 4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange receipts from the tourism industry in 1997
were 6.62 billion U.S. dollars, about one billion U.S. dollars
below the original target.
</P>
<P>
This year the government expects tourist arrivals to reach from
3.8 million to four million, depending on the outcome of the
country's turbulent political scene.
</P>
<P>
Many fear political tension in the run-up to the June general
election will spark more unrest and further harm the tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Ardhika said that as part of a travel promotion this year, the
tourism industry would launch at the end of this month an
integrated package for foreign visitors which gives incentives on
airlines, hotel and accommodation, travel agents, restaurants and
shopping venues.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Lawyers Haven't Decided to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson's lawyers are
still considering whether to let him serve his one-year sentence
or appeal to risk even more jail time Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who spent his third full day in protective custody in
the jail in Montgomery County, Maryland, was sentenced Friday for
assaulting two men after a traffic accident in August.
</P>
<P>
The former heavyweight champion remained in a private cell "for
his own protection" and cannot ask for a bond hearing unless an
appeal is filed, said prosecutor Douglas Gansler.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's lawyers must decide within 30 days of the sentencing
whether he makes an appeal. A Circuit Court judge could then
decide not to accept the no-contest plea and order a trial by jury.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, Tyson would not only have another conviction
on his record but would again be subject to Maryland sentening
guidelines that call for a jail term of three to seven years.
</P>
<P>
Indiana authorities should decide whether Tyson voilate his
probation of a 1992 rape conviction, and Nevada boxing authorities
could revoke Tyson's boxing license for the second time in two
years.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's lawyers were discussing the risk of an appeal today.
</P>
<P>
Gansler, who led the call for a jail time for Tyson, said the
boxer could be fighting again in 1999 under his sentence if he
bahaves well.
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong argument to be made that he's better off not
appealing," Gansler said. "If he were treated like any ordinary
prisoner, like he has been, he would be in the jail about two to
three months."
</P>
<P>
After that, Tyson could be transferred to a pre-release center,
a sort of halfway house where he could leave during the day to go
to work and return at night.
</P>
<P>
"He would be in the system about nine months," Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, Judge Patricia Gifford is awaiting paperwork from
Maryland before ruling on whether he violated probation.
</P>
<P>
Judy Glaze, secretary for Gifford, said the papers are expected
in a few days, and until then no action can be taken.

<HEADLINE> Aerospace Technologies to Stimulate China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The transfer of some aerospace
technologies to civilian uses is expected to add a new and
powerful growth dimension to China's national economy, said today'
s China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Xia Guohong, deputy director of China Aerospace Industrial Corp
(CASC), was quoted as saying that the aerospace sector plans to
lend more support to the country's infrastructure construction, an
area highlighted by the State and favored in the government's
budget.
</P>
<P>
"We will use technological advantages of the aerospace industry
to address urgent needs and erase difficulties in the course of
national economic growth," Xia said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the aerospace industry has developed
more than 5,000 civilian products, and turnover of civilian
products in 1998 increased by 28 percent to eight billion yuan (
963 million U.S. dollars), nearly two-thirds of the aerospace
sector's total output value, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Expertise in satellite mobile communications, automation
controls, micro-electronics, radar and special materials can all
be "geared to generation of tremendous economic and social
benefits," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, CASC displayed in Beijing more than 30 key
achievements involving civilian uses of space technology including
a subsurface detection radar system for probing and examining the
quality of highway, railway, airport, water conservancy and
apartment construction materials without causing damage to them.
</P>
<P>
Wang Meiyu, an official with CASC, was quoted as saying that
the Rainbow Bridge collapse in Qijiang County of southwest China's
Chongqing Municipality on January 4 might have been averted by the
use of such equipment.
</P>
<P>
CASC has also applied its technology to aerospace crop-breeding,
electronic and alternative fuel system for vehicles, intelligent
cards, and computer systems for the battle against fake value-
added tax notes and fraud in customs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Six more civilians were killed
Monday in the troubled Yugoslav province of Kosovo, bringing to 20
the death toll from increasing violent incidents in the past week,
a report reaching here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The six victims were shot dead and their bodies were found
separately by the local police in the villages of Kacanik,
Liplianand and Djiakovica from Monday afternoon to Tuesday morning,
said the report from Pristina, capital of the mainly ethnic
Albanian-populated province.
</P>
<P>
According to the local police, a total of 13 civilians and one
policeman were killed in Kosovo from February 1-6 in a surge of
violence as the Yugoslav government and the Albanian separatists
were pressed by the international Contact Group to start their
peace talks in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of killings in Kosovo is seen as a move by certain
political forces to derail the Kosovo peace talks which opened
Saturday afternoon in a suburb of Paris under the auspices of the
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group is made up of the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Russia and Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 2,050 grams of heroin
and 29,083 ecstasy pills, confiscated between August and November
last year from three suspects, were destroyed by fire at the
National Police Headquarters in South Jakarta Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We must destroy the confiscated narcotics in line with legal
procedures and Law No. 22/1992 on psychotropic drugs," chief of
the National Police's narcotics detective unit Col. Wilhelmus
Laturette was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The public has frequently questioned the whereabouts of
confiscated goods, particularly drugs. Many suspect crooked
officers return the drug hauls to the market.
</P>
<P>
Laturette said it was the first time this year that the
national police burned seized narcotics and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a periodical event because we will burn the
evidence if we think it is harmful and tempting if we keep it too
long in our office," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added other items seized as evidence, including cars and
other valuable goods, would be auctioned after the suspects were
tried.

<HEADLINE> Real's Fall Promotes Brazil's Mercosur Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of
Brazil's currency, the real, has increased its exports to other
members of the Mercosur trade bloc by 10 to 15 percent, a Mercosur
business representative said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, also known as the South American Common Market, is
the largest commercial bloc in the region grouping Brazil,
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Companies Association head Michel Alaby said that
farming and industrial imports from Brazil's partners in the bloc
were also expected to decline due to the real's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Alaby expects Brazil to reverse this year its 1.28 billion U.S.
dollars trade deficit with Argentina and reach a surplus of
between 600 and 935 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brazil could also register trade surpluses of 123 million
dollars with Uruguay and over 1.1 billion dollars with Paraguay,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Buenos Aires said the real's current 30 percent
drop against the dollar had triggered a 54 percent hike in imports
from Brazil in January.

<HEADLINE> Romania Suspends Preferential Policies for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian parliament
Monday decided to suspend preferential policies for foreign
investments and exports, which were approved last year to
encourage new investments and exports.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Decebal Traian Remes said the move to suspend
has been taken as a result of extreme difficulties the country is
now facing.
</P>
<P>
If no emergency measures are taken, the country's budget
deficit could reach 4.12 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (
GDP), much higher than the two percent precondition for new loan
agreements to be signed between Romania and the International
Monetary Fund, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Romania expects to receive loans from the World Bank and the
European Union after it signs an agreement with the IMF, the
finance minister added.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign debts are expected to reach a record high
of almost 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year the country made an emergency decree to exempt custom
tariffs and value-added taxes to encourage investment. The decree
said the policy would be in place at least five years.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian State Minister for
Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng said he would conduct
a road show in some foreign countries to raise funds for the
privatization program by offering stakes in 10 state firms.
</P>
<P>
"We need to promote actively the stake sales to smooth the
privatization program," Abeng said before members of a House of
Representatives commission here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The road show aimed to reach the target of 13 trillion rupiah
(about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) in revenues from privatization as
has been stated in the 1999/2000 national budget starting April 1,
Abeng was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The road show is scheduled to begin in May, one month before
the general election scheduled on June 7, Abeng said, adding that
he realized that it needed hard work to convince foreign investors

CHANGCHUN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Mo Yonggang, a college
student in Changchun in China's Jilin Province, says that the sky
in the city is much bluer than 4 years ago and it will even be
difficult to say good-bye to the clean and lovely city after
graduation, in several months.
</P>
<P>
Changchun is one of China's old heavy industrial bases and its
air has been a problem for quite some time. Newly fallen snow
would turn grey or black within a few hours only a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
But the high chimneys have gone and now there are only patches
of grass, wide streets, and trees decorating the city.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection departments report that the
amount of suspended particles in the atmosphere is down 0.65
milligrams per cubic meter to 0.316 now, which is Category 2, and
the air this year is the cleanest in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The local government has spent 16 million yuan (2 million U.S.
dollars) over the past two decades changing 103 boilers, building
an additional 1.35 million square meters of central heating, and
installing gas pipes in 210,000 households.
</P>

They have also torn down company walls on both sides of many
roads and have planted grass and built plazas and have also
accepted the participation of the common people by printing a

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Monday a loan of 82 million U.S. dollars
for Tanzania to support the East African country's economic reform
program this year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement the loan was the third annual
credit provided under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF), which helps eligible members that are undertaking economic
reform programs to strengthen their balance of payments and
improve their growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
ESAF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year and are
repayable over 10 years with a five and a half year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said that Tanzania's economic reform and stabilization
efforts regained momentum in 1996 following the election of a new
government and its economic performance has improved substantially
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government's medium-term development strategy
aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability, reduce inflation, and
attain sustainable high economic growth that will reduce poverty
and raise the overall living standards of the population.

MADRID, February 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO is prepared to send
peacekeeping troops to Kosovo if the Serb-Kosovo peace conference
in France reaches an agreement, the organization's political chief
Javier Solana said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Solana, the Spanish diplomat who is secretary general of the

Speaking to reporters following a meeting with Spanish Prime

solution.
</P>
<P>
When the peace deal is reached, NATO's troops will be in Kosovo
to see that it works, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said European members of NATO should make a
greater commitment to the peacekeeping arrangements in Kosovo than
the U.S., which has already dispatched 40,000 troops to the area.

<HEADLINE> Center Set up to Guarantee Fish Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture and
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision on Monday
set up a national fisheries product quality certification center.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the country is paying more efforts to
guarantee quality of fisheries products to protect consumers'
interests, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries products concerned include both wild-caught and
farm-raised species.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the center, which is based on international
practices, will help the country's aquatic processing enterprises
improve their quality management and reputations and expand their
international market shares, the Beijing-based newspaper noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China produced 38 million tons of aquatic products,
according to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of the country's aquatic products fell to
meet the market demand, partly because of slack quality management
in some regions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, public health officials in Beijing warned
local citizens to be aware of a possible acute intestinal
infectious disease associated with fresh aquatic products
including bullfrogs, carp and trout being sold in the city.
</P>
<P>
China exported 1.51 million tons of aquatic products during the
first three quarters of last year, a decrease of 21 percent from
the same period in 1997, statistics show.

provincial-level museum in China, was finished recently, the Tibet
Bureau of Cultural Relics reported today.
</P>
<P>
This gives China a museum system at the provincial level
everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The museum has more than 10,000 relics and shows Tibetan
architectural styles. The Central Government allocated 96 million
yuan (11.6 million U.S. dollars) for the project, which was one of
62 aid-for-Tibet projects decided on in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It consists of exhibition halls, a folk village, a culture
square, and a culture gallery on a 54,000-sq.m. area. It will open
to visitors on October 1, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The head of the museum says that it will present Tibetan
culture and history and contribute to relic studies and foreign
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has over 2,000 places of historical
interests, and tens of thousands of rare relics. The Potala Palace
alone has over 60,000 category I or II relics.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said on Monday that encouraging signals were coming from the
Kosovo peace talks in France, where Yugoslav Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo are examining the autonomy plan drawn up for
the region by the six-nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the leaders of Italian central Region of
Tuscany in Florence, Dini said that "It would appear that both
sides in Kosovo have approached these negotiations with an
attitude which was much more positive and constructive than would
have been imagined."
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that the issue of independence for Kosovo was
not on the agenda and that "No nation thinks that Kosovo should be
made independent," he added.
</P>
<P>
European and U.S. mediators began last Saturday an intense two-
week negotiating session with Serb and ethnic Albanian
representatives in Rambouillet, outskirts of Paris, on the future

The Sydney Morning Herald:

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Poll Shows Strong Support for Decommissioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A majority in Northern Ireland
want the guerrilla groups to disarm themselves immediately and
not wait for the deadline of May 2000, an opinion poll showed on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey on 1,100 people, 93 percent of the
Protestant population and 68 percent of Catholics believed the
rival armed groups should decommissioning as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The decommissioning has become the heart of a deadlock in
implementing last April's Northern Ireland peace agreement.
Protestant leader David Trimble insists Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing, cannot take its seats in an
executive until the IRA hands in at least some of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
The poll, carried out for the Belfast Telegraph evening
newspaper, showed that even among Sinn Fein voters, 58 percent of
participants wanted disarmament to begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
The poll in the province's biggest daily, which is read by the
pro-British and pro-Irish communities, was bound to increase
pressure on Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has the largest arsenal among the paramilitary
groups, has repeatedly said it would not hand in any weapons but
Sinn Fein has never ruled out the possibility of giving up arms.

LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Charlton Athletic defeated
Wimbledon 2-0 in a premier league clash on Monday to record their

Charlton's dismal run had seen them fail to win in their last

light snow.

Swede Martin Pringle, on loan from Benfica, ran 50 meters and
through three tackles to put them ahead after 37 minutes and the
game was settled by a bizarre own goal by Dean Blackwell in the 69
th.
</P>
<P>
The defender had allowed a harmless pass to run through to
goalkeeper Neil Sullivan but the two men collided and as Blackwell
stumbled backwards he backheeled the loose ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Charlton to climb one place to 18th, above
Southampton on goal difference. Wimbledon remain eighth.

<HEADLINE> Wilkinson Sends for Arsenal Veteran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Howard Wilkinson gave veteran
full-back Lee Dixon an early birthday present on Monday night by
calling him into the England squad for Wednesday's friendly
against France.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal defender, who will be 35 next month, last played
for England in the 7-1 win over San Marino in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
But he was given another opportunity when Wilkinson decided to
reinforce his squad for the friendly with France, after no less
than seven players were forced to sit out his first training
session as caretaker coach.
</P>
<P>
Blackburn winger Jason Wilcox was the first player to earn an
international call-up from the new boss, after Aston Villa's Paul
Merson was forced to pull out with a back injury.
</P>
<P>
And there may be more changes to come as Wilkinson counts the
cost of the weekend's Premiership campaign, on a squad that was
selected last week by out-going coach Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
The biggest concerns for Wilkinson are at the back. Another
Villa star, defender Gareth Southgate, has virtually ruled himself
out of contention for Wednesday's friendly with a hip injury.
</P>
<P>
Two other centre-backs are rated doubtful for the Wembley clash,
Tottenham's Sol Campbell, who has been confined to bed with a
stomach virus, and Gary Neville of Manchester United, who has an
ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
A further four players missed training at England's Bisham
Abbey headquarters -- Darren Anderton, Graeme Le Saux, Dion Dublin
and even the new arrival Wilcox, who has a heel injury -- but
Wilkinson is more confident of their chances of being fit by
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Novelist Iris Murdoch Dies at Age of 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- British novelists Dame Iris
Murdoch died on Monday at the age of 79, BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch died in central England city of Oxford at a special
nursing home for suffering of Alzheimer's disease. Her husband
John Bayley was at her side.
</P>
<P>
Murdoch was regarded as one of the greatest novelists of 20th
century in Britain. She has wrote 27 novels, such as "A Severed
Head", "An Accidental Man" and "The Sea, the Sea."
</P>
<P>
In a memoir of their 43-year marriage, Bayley said: "She is not
sailing into the dark: the voyage is over, and under the dark
escort of Alzheimer's she seems to have arrived somewhere. So have
I."
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, who was one of the most acclaimed and honoured of
Britain's contemporary authors, said her books were works of art
with "a beginning, a middle and an end".
</P>
<P>
She had been a compulsive writer since the age of nine, but
only published her first novel, "Under the Net", at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
She was awarded the Whitbread Prize for "The Sacred and Profane
Love Machine" in 1974 and the Booker Prize for "The Sea, the Sea"
four years later.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Meet to Solve Budget Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Finance Ministers of the 15
European Union (EU) member states gathered here on Monday to
discuss the bloc's urgent issue of future budget expenditure, but
finally did not reach a unanimous agreement on the financial
reforms designed to prepare the EU for accepting new members from
central and eastern Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
German finance minister Oskar Lafontaine told reporters after
the meeting that the most of the ministers believe the financial
reforms required by the EU's Agenda 2000 strategy "should be
stabilization oriented, in another words the expenditure in the EU
should not grow faster than expenditure in national budgets."
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a perfectly comprehensible and defensible
position. Several member states thought it would be possible to
take agricultural expenditure in the year 1999 as a basis for the
years ahead that would be increases in the initial period to be
offset by decreases in the subsequent part of the six-year
(2000-2006) period," said the German minister, who is the
president of the meeting of the EU Council.
</P>
<P>
He also implied that the ministers divided on EU's structural
operations. It means that the EU member states still need arduous
talks to reach an agreement on reforms to agricultural and
regional aid policies. Structural fund is amount of money that EU
member states have agreed to allocate to reduce Europe's regional
imbalances. Currently, about half of the population of the EU is
covered by the structural funds, which the EU terms as its regional
policy funding tools.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine told reporters that the ministers discussed
"different roles in structural fund and cohesion fund." For
Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain, they can get grants from
Cohesion Fund for member states whose GNP is under 90 percent of
the EU total.The fund is designed to make easier for those
countries to take part in economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of own resources and budgetary imbalances, the 15
ministers had common ground on certain general principles. They
believe that the EU resources system has to be equitable,
transparent, cost-effective and simple.
</P>
<P>
They also principally agreed that a number of elements could
play a role in order to achieve the desired outcome on the
expenditure side, although they have so far had no consensus on
such issues as ceiling of 1.27 percent of EU GDP, stabilization of
overall expenditure for the 15-member bloc, and a specific effort
for agricultural budget.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the EU budget reforms will have great impact on the
organization's future enlargement because current budget policy
would not be suit for more members, possibally over 20, in the
early period of next century. Germany as current EU leader has
determined to tackle the issue in a short period of time, setting
the timetable in this regard in its rotating presidency term
expiring at the end of June, and the end-March deadline of final
agreement on budget among member states.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Kosovo Peace Talks "Progressing" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Talks in France on Kosovo's
peace between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians were making
progress at a "constructive" pace, the U.S. State Department said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The work at Rambouillet is progressing. It's going at a
constructive and businesslike pace," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters. "We thought the fact they expressed
their regret and indignation over the bombing in Prisina was an
encouraging sign."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks opened at the Chateau of Rambouillet near Paris
on Saturday under the auspices of the Contact Group, which
includes France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that Ambassador Christopher Hill, the head of the
U.S. delegation at the talks, had briefed Secretary of State
madeleine Albright on Monday morning of the progress the two sides
had made.
</P>
<P>
He also said Washington disagreed to Russia's view that it was
premature to deploy peacekeeping force in the troubled province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Some peace implementation force will be necessary if we are
going to get this agreement to stick and create a secure
environment in which the institutions of the Kosovar Albanians can
take root and their level fo self-government increast," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright last week invited Russia to take part in a
peacekeeping force in the province. But a spokesman with the
Russian Foreign Ministry said on Friday: "Talks about distributing
forces in the region probably is a little premature."
</P>
<P>
But U.S. President Bill Clinton said last week that it was
serious considering deploying troops in Kosovo as part of a mainly
European force, but only if both sides accept their presence.

<HEADLINE> Group of Ten Clarifies Mandate of Committee on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The governors of the central
banks of the Group of Ten countries decided on Monday to clarify
the mandate of te Euro-Currency Standing Committee (ECSC) in order
to strengthen the effectiveness of the overall process in
promoting monetary and financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The governors, at a meeting at the headquarters of the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) based in the Swiss city of Basle,
also decided to change the name of the ECSC to the Committee on
the Global Financial System (CGFS).
</P>
<P>
Under its new mandate, the CGFS will act as a central bank
forum for the monitoring and examination of broad issues relating
to financial markets and systems with a view to elaborating
appropriate policy recommendations to support the central banks in
the fulfilment of their responsibilities for monetary and
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The tasks performed by the CGFS will fall into three
categories: systematic short-term monitoring of global financial
system conditions, so as to identify potential sources of stress;
in-depth longer-term analysis of the functioning and promoting
stability.
</P>
<P>
The mandate recognizes that the causes of financial instability
can arise from both the behavior of markets and the complex
interrelationships that exist between institutions, markets,
infrastructures and macroeconomic policy.
</P>
<P>
The ECSC first came into being in 1960s as an informal forum
for the regular exchange of views on international monetary and
financial issues among senior central bank officials. It first
received a formal mandate from the governors in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Hussein`s Funeral a Solemn Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- This day, February 8, is bound to
be remembered for its solemnness as Hussein Ibn Talal, the king
who reigned Jordan for nearly half a decade was buried in a
majestic funeral.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, prayers from mosques were echoing across
the capital of Amman, and clouds were hanging over the city,
filling the air with sadness and grief.
</P>
<P>
Residents, deeply concerned over Hussein`s health for days,
flocked to the streets to pay their last respect to their beloved
king, when the motorcade carrying his casket proceeded by their
houses.
</P>
<P>
Men and women, wearing red and white kufia over their heads and
dressed up in black garments, were carried away by grief. Some of
them wiped tears, others praying in silence, or raising high the
portraits of the late king in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Black flags and ribbons were festooned in the facade of
buildings, car roofs, rears or windows. Countless posters of
Hussein are being peddled at stalls surrounded by crowds of the
late king's admirers.
</P>
<P>
At around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT), the funeral motorcade slowly
entered the royal palace of Raghdan where world leaders,
high-ranking officials join royal family members in mourning and
devotion.
</P>
<P>
The procession set off with the national anthem, played by the
Royal Guards of Honor. Immediately following the Honor Guards was
another group of Royal Guards, dressed in olive green uniforms and
white and red kufia, marching in a square and with rifles tightly
under their arms.
</P>
<P>
A green vehicle trailing a flatbed carrying the king's coffin
draped with the red-green-white-black-colored national flag of the
desert kingdom was flanked by the Royal Guards.
</P>
<P>
Green leafs and white flowers were attached to the sides and
rear of the vehicle and the flatbed where several guards are
standing side by side with the casket.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of world leaders and dignitaries, senior officials
and royal members were walking behind, every one of them with
looked solemn, in a clear-cut expression of their affections for
their lost friend.
</P>
<P>
Among the world leaders were U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, U.S. President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony came to an end when the mourners proceeded to
Hamza Mosque inside Raghdan, where devotions presided over by
the new King Abdullah Bin Hussein was held at a later time.
</P>
<P>
After the devotions, eight soldiers carried the body of
Hussein to the Royal Cemetery, where King Hussein's father and
grandfather were buried.
</P>
<P>
Security was beefed up in the day with armed soldiers and
security men patrolling in front of key government buildings and
intersections of the main streets.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 8 (Xinhua) - Opening falls on Wall Street and
bearish trend in bonds Monday weighed on European stock markets.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 index shed 0.35 percent of its value,
or 20.4 points, to 5834.9, ending lower for its fourth straight
session. At one point, the blue chip index slipped below 5800 for
the first time since Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
The decline came amid the release of economic data showing a
0.8 percent drop in British industrial output in December that
sparked fresh fears about the UK's vulnerability to a recession
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Bank of England surprised economists by cutting
interest rates half a percentage point to help stem a downturn in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the cut might have jolted some investors to
take notice of the economy's potential plight.
</P>
<P>
"People look at it in a negative way," said James Cornish, an
equity strategist with BT Alex. Brown here, referring to the
larger-than-expected rate cut. "It shows things were worse than we
thought they were."
</P>
<P>
German share prices fell back in a lackluster session, but
positive corporate news bolstered some gains. The leading Xetra
Dax index closed down 45 points at 5052.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the downward sentiment turned volatile on
movements in US, as Wall Street fell back.
</P>
<P>
French shares bucked European trends to move into positive
territory as investors arbitraged between different industries.
The leading Cac 40 index finished up 6 points at 4154.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the U.S.
Northwestern University say they have found a way to turn a common
laboratory tool into the world's finest writing instrument,
capable of drawing lines just a few molecules wide and one
molecule thick.
</P>
<P>
The instrument is an atomic force microscope (AFM), commonly
used to transfer molecules onto surfaces with extremely high
precision. However, AFMs have a problem: its tip tends to attract
moisture from the air and form a tiny drop between the tip and the
substrate or surface to be drawn on.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Washington Post, the scientists said that
they managed to harness the flow of water molecules between tip
and substrate to pass the chemical "ink" through a super-tiny
capillary channel to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Their research could have practical implications for
nanotechnology, both in testing nanotech concepts and in creating
linkages between the nano-sized objects and more conventional
microscopic equipment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. White House Lawyer Accuses Prosecutors of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.S. White House
Counsel Charles Ruff Monday accused House prosecutors of hurting
the nation by "wanting to win too much."
</P>
<P>
"We know the pain the president has caused" America with his
effort to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky, Ruff said in
his final presentations in the Senate impeachment trial against
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
But he urged senators to set aside politics and conclude that
Clinton's transgressions don't rise to the level of impeachable
offenses as the House charged.
</P>
<P>
"You have heard the managers' vision.... But I believe their
vision to be too dark, a vision too little attuned to the needs of
the people, too little sensitive to the needs of our democracy,"
Ruff said in his most direct attack on the 13 Republican House
lawmakers who have prosecuted Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The presidential lawyer said the House impeachment case was
"more focused on retribution, more designed to achieve partisan
ends" than on the high standards the Founding Fathers had set for
removing a president from office. He said the House prosecutors
suffered from "wanting to win too much."
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors argued in their closing arguments that the
evidence supported the charges of obstruction of justice and
perjury lodged against Clinton and that failure to remove him from
office would harm the institution of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional
consequences of his actions, the impact of allowing the president
to stand above the law will be felt for generations to come,"
prosecutor James Sensenbrenner argued.
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner said Clinton alone was responsible for
instigating only the second presidential impeachment in American
history. He said that while Clinton had apologized for his affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, his apologies had been "carefully crafted for
the president to continue to evade and, yes, avoid responsibility
for his deceiving the courts."
</P>
<P>
"The truth is still the truth and a lie is still a lie, and the
rule of law should apply to everyone," Sensenbrenner argued.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 11 or 12. A two-thirds
vote is needed to convict Clinton and remove him from office. No
one believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove the
president.

WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Senator William Roth, a
proponent of NATO enlargement, on Monday urged NATO to accept
Slovenia as a new member of the only military and security group

</P>
<P>
"Slovenia is a stable and economically vibrant democracy that
is already contributing to NATO operations," said Roth, a Delaware

"To ignore such a qualified candidate could be an historic
mistake that would undermine progress toward a united Europe,"
said the former president of the North Atlantic Assembly which is
NATO's parliamentary body.
</P>
<P>
Roth's comments came just two days after German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said NATO, having just absorbed Hungary, Poland
and the Czech Republic, needed a period of consolidation before
accepting new members.
</P>
<P>
roth's office also released a statement which said Lithuania
and Slovakia merited serious consideration as NATO new members.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- About 10 percent of traffic
lights in Britain may break down when the new millennium begins, a
traffic control organization has warned.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Traffic Controls, which maintains more than 50 percent
of Britain's traffic lights, estimates that equipment at 1,300
intersections could fail because of the date-change computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
Affected lights will not stop working completely but will go
out of phase, with red signals likely to stay on for longer than
normal, according to traffic engineers.
</P>
<P>
As many traffic controls are programmed to run in different
sequences at different times to smooth vehicles flows in varying
traffic conditions, it is feared that disruptions to sequences
could threaten huge traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug may lead to heavy build-ups of traffic,
particularly in town centers, which could take hours to clear,
traffic experts said.
