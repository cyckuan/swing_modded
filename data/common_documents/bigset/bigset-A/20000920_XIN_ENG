<HEADLINE> ADB Funds Sri Lanka's Water Management Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (
ADB) has approved a 19.7 million U.S. dollar loan to fund a water
resources management project in Sri Lanka, the bank said in a
statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost 28.2 million dollars, is scheduled
to be completed by December 2005, the statement said, adding that
the project is expected to benefit nearly 2 million people in the
Sri Lankan capital of Colombo and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
"While Sri Lanka does not face a water management crisis, there
are signs of increasing stress on water resources and competition
between users," said the bank statement.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Sri Lankan government launched the project to
strengthen its capacity to manage water resources in a sustainable,
participatory and transparent manner and construct critically
needed infrastructure for control and measurement of water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be sourced through the bank's special
developmental aid fund. It carries a repayment period of 32 years,
including a grace period of eight years. An interest rate of 1
percent a year will be charged during the grace period and 1.5
percent a year thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The bank provided nearly 2.36 billion dollars in soft loans to
Sri Lanka from 1968 through 1999. The bank's total loan allocation
for Sri Lanka for 2000 has been set at 150 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Civic Groups Criticizes Moves to Falsify History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Several Japanese civic groups
issued a joint statement Tuesday, criticizing moves by Japan's
rightwing forces to falsify history while preparing new history
textbooks to be used in the country's junior high schools from
April 2002.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by five civic groups including Committee
for Truth and Freedom in Textbooks, urged the Japanese government
to respect historical facts while conducting screening of the new
history textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Japan's modern history, many draft editions of the
textbooks produced by the Japan Society for History Textbook
Reform and several other publishing houses have regressed, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, references to "Comfort Women," "Nanjing Massacre,
" "Three-All Policy," and Japan's past aggressive war against its
neighboring countries have disappeared from many textbooks or have
been reduced greatly, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the setback in history textbooks
mainly to pressure from some Japanese politicians and government
officials, and stressed that the moves to gradually delete
historical facts from history textbooks should not be tolerated.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Heroine Smuggling Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Officers of the Xiamen customs
said today they have seized as much as 4,185.2 grams of heroin
found in the position of a Taiwanese person Monday.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest drug smuggling case they have ever cracked.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, surnamed Lee, was found to have 12 small packages
of heroin attached to his abdomen, back and thighs with adhesive
tapes, the customs officers said.
</P>
<P>
Lee was caught during a safety check when he was going to take
flight No. MF 895 from Xiamen to Macao, and from there he planned
to fly to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth drug smuggling case the Xiamen customs has
cracked this year. Another Taiwanese man was caught with 730 grams
of heroin attached to his body on March 30.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Contacts Resume After Mini-Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli negotiator Gilad
Sher resumed talks with his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat
Wednesday afternoon after a mini-crisis over Israel's intention to
suspend the contacts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which had become the major channel between the two
sides for reviving peace talks in the past few weeks, concluded a
short while ago. The two negotiators discussed several issues
related to the permanent settlement and decided to continue meeting
in the next few days, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a reliable source in Israeli Prime Minister's Office
confirmed that Israel had halted the talks and taken a time-out for
internal consultation.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was obviously under the
pressure of the United States, later backtracked and said the
meeting will continue on Wednesday. Furthermore, his spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky explained that reports about the suspension of the
negotiations were totally misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the farce was only a negotiation trick of
Barak to put pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whom
Israel urged to show more flexibility and openness.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer said
Wednesday that Tuesday's crisis was only a warning to the
Palestinians, urging them not to play games and waste time.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians outsmarted the Israel side by announcing
Wednesday morning that they will not return to the negotiation
table until Israel make an explanation for Tuesday's humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the two sides came back to the talks in the afternoon
to keep momentum of the peace process, which had been in deadlock
after last July's Camp David summit between Barak, Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The major unresolved issues are the fate of Jerusalem,
especially the sovereignty over the Temple Mount in the stone-
walled Old City which hosts various Jewish and Muslim holy sites,
and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters after a parliamentary Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee meeting, Barak said Wednesday that he was
confident that the talks will continue.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the bridging proposals, which were being
prepared by the U.S. and will be presented to the two sides in the
next few days, are crucial for peace.
</P>
<P>
"I expect and believe that in the coming weeks we will know
whether Chairman Arafat is prepared to see President Clinton's
proposals -- presented at Camp David and afterwards -- as a basis
for discussion," said Barak.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed Wednesday that
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has spoken twice by
telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the
last 24 hours, obviously discussing the package proposals.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resume Domestic Flights in Defiance of Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 20 (Xinhua) -- In another bold move to
counter the air embargo, Iraq has decided to resume domestic
flights after a 10-year halt.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction of the Mosul airport, 440 kilometers north of
the capital, has been finished and is now ready to receive local
flights, Hisham Ali, director of the Mosul airport, was quoted by
local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
The daily flights between Baghdad and Mosul have been stopped
ever since the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq for its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
This move has been seen by analysts as a dubious decision, as
Mosul, the capital of Neiveva province, is under the actual control
of the United States and Britain which enforce the northern no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes have been patrolling the no-fly
zone they set up in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim to protect the Kurds there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to shoot down any Iraqi plane flying
over the air exclusion zone, which covers the three northern
provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil.
</P>
<P>
A similar zone was also set up in southern Iraq to keep the
Shiite Muslims from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops as
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the two zones for their lack of
explicit authorization from the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Neither has Baghdad recognized that the U.N. sanctions include
an air embargo. Iraq holds that no U.N. resolution bans civil
flights and the air embargo has been unilaterally imposed by the U.
S. and its allies.
</P>
<P>
To make preparations for the resumption of both domestic and
international flights, Iraq opened the Saddam International Airport
in the western suburb of Baghdad on August 17 and has announced to
buy 20 Airbus passenger planes from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a staunch ally of Iraq, has declared to resume civil
flights to Iraq next month.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Rises by 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The overall budget deficit in
the first eight months of the year rose to 51 percent of spending,
or 2.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures in the same period of 1999 were 41.8 percent of
spending, or 1.4 billion dollars, the National News Agency (NNA)
quoted a Finance Ministry statement as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total spending, including debt servicing, in the first eight
months jumped to 3.3 billion from 2.8 billion in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Debt-servicing payments until the end of August reached 1.7
billion, an increase of 14.5 percent compared to last year. It will
rise to 2.6 billion dollars at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, total revenues from direct and
indirect taxes rose fractionally in the first eight months to 1.8
billion dollars from 1.79 billion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The figures give another indication that the government is not
yet able to raise enough revenues and reduce expenditures
substantially.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister George Corm said last week that the total
deficit would be below 50 percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the budget, government revenues were projected at
little more than 3 billion dollars and spending at 5.5 billion at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry repeatedly blamed in the statement that the deficit
of Electricite du Leban (EDL) was making it more difficult for the
Treasury to fix the country's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has to pay for fuel oil whose price has risen on
world markets. It has paid 232 million dollars to cover EDL's
shortfall and another 60 million for municipalities so far this
year.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Stresses Long-term Efforts to Solve Afghan Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata stressed here
Wednesday that Iran and the U.N. must enhance cooperation and make
long-term efforts to solve the issue of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR and the Iranian government must cooperate to enlarge
their achievements and finally completely solve the issue of Afghan
refugees that has become a heavy burden for the country, Ogata told
a press conference at the end of three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that she had made a proposal to Iran's
Interior Minister Seyed Mousavi Lari to extend a joint program for
repatriation of Afghan refugees for another three months, with
positive response.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the "voluntary repatriation program" on April
8, more than 100,000 Afghan refugees have returned home from
different parts of Iran. According to a previous agreement between
the UNHCR and Iran, the program is to expire on October 11.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner pointed out, however, it is impossible to
solve the refugee problem in a short period of three months, since
there are at least 1.4 million Afghans residing in the country.
</P>
<P>
So Iran and the UNHCR will continue their cooperation and
efforts after the three months so that the refugee issue could be
completely solved, Ogata said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, who had also visited Pakistan and Afghanistan
beforehand, said the aim of her visits was to consult concerned
authorities to find new solutions to the Afghan refugee issue,
which has haunted regional countries and the international
community for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
As the immediate neighbors of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan are
the two countries that host the largest number of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries have become more and more frustrated and
disappointed because of the lingering of the issue, which has
contributed to both economic and social problems.
</P>
<P>
Ogata met Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh on Wednesday. During the three-day visit,
she also inspected some Afghan refugee camps.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Meet in October on Regular Arab Summits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers will meet
next month to discuss the issue of holding Arab summit each year,
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Ahmad Lokman, Yemeni
permanent delegate to the League, Abdel-Meguid did not specify the
date of the extraordinary foreign ministers meeting, saying that it
will be decided through coordination between the League's General
Secretariat and the Egyptian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But League sources reportedly said the meeting will be convened
on October 21 and 22 at the Cairo headquarters of the pan-Arab
forum to prepare for the first regular Arab summit next March.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting early this month, Arab foreign ministers
approved a proposal submitted by a committee grouping the foreign
ministers of Egypt, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen and the League
chief calling for a summit in March each year.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Lokman said that Arab parties are exchanging views on the
best means to ensure the holding of regular summits. "All are
counting on Egypt and President Hosni Mubarak's wisdom to secure
the success of the coming summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The last Arab summit was held in Cairo in 1996, but Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was excluded to avoid possible conflicts
with Gulf states. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have been at odds with
Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The controversial project of Ilisu Hydroelectric Dam
in southeast Turkey, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars, is in danger, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who bowed to the reactions
of the Kurdish and Arab lobbies, failed to give green light to a
200 million sterling exportation loan, the British partner had to
withdraw from the consortium which has bid for the construction of
the huge project.
</P>
<P>
Ilisu Dam is the most comprehensive hydroelectric dam that is
foreseen to be constructed on the Tigris River.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi government decided designing and carrying
out
the project of expanding the King Abdel-Aziz International Airport
in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah, according to a statement by
Saudi Civil Aviation Authority's Chairman Ali Al-Khalaf.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Saudi News Agency on Wednesday as saying that
the expansion was designed to update the facility and ensure smooth
operation and higher-level service at airport.
</P>
<P>
The company to be assigned with the project would upgrade the
travel terminals to serve about 21 million passengers over the
coming 20 years under the mounting demand on travelling and
allowing round-the-year Umra (Islamic lesser pilgrimage) flights
and to encourage incoming tourism, the Saudi official said.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey, which is facing a severe energy shortage
reportedly because of a lack of planning, plans to purchase more
electricity from the Russian Federation, reported the Anatolia News
Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A protocol on an electricity deal is expected to be signed
during the scheduled visit by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov to Turkey on October 23-25.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Russian Ambassador Aleksander Lebedev
Tuesday, Turkish Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Cumhur
Ersumer reportedly informed the Russian envoy of Turkey's intention

of purchasing more electricity from Russia over the winter.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey and Georgia will discuss a plan to accelerate
the Kars-Tbilisi Railway Project at a joint transportation
commission meeting scheduled to take place on September 28,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two neighbors in the field of
transportation will also be discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the project which will cost
approximately 600 million U.S. dollars, the Caucasus and Central
Asian railway traffic will pass through Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The railway is the shortest corridor linking Turkey's eastern
provincial city of Kars to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. It
is also expected to contribute to the improvement of trade with the
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish section of the railway line will cost 400 million
dollars while the section in Georgia will cost 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish and American tourist operators are planning to
arrange "jitney" flights for the next tourism season in an
attempt to expand tourism, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kursat Baskirt, Chairman of the Antalya Branch of the Turkish-
American Businessmen's Association, said on Wednesday that tens of
thousands of small planes are used in transportation in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"These planes usually carry six to 40 passengers. We think of
utilizing these planes in tourism. The tourists who come to Antalya
by these planes can fly to Cappadocia and Izmir (of the Aegean
region) on the same day," he said, adding, "I believe tourism will
revive as transportation becomes easier."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Not to Veto Any Premiership Candidate: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri said Wednesday that President Emile Lahoud will not "
veto" any
premiership candidate in the government forming process.
</P>
<P>
Berri said in a parliament session in the wake of a meeting with
Lahoud that the new government should be a "patriotic and united
one," National News Agency (NNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese prime minister must be approved by president and get a
permission of 85 lawmakers in the 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Local media revealed that Transport and Public Works Minister
Najib Mikati, a main competitor for premiership, announced, "He
has no interest in that post."
</P>
<P>
According to a parliamentary source, Mikati told former prime
minister Rafik Hariri during a meeting at Hariri's home that he did
not intend to run for the premiership, which would leave Hariri
with no major competitor for the post.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who scored a sweeping victory in the recent
parliamentary elections, emerged as a Sunni leader. Hariri's
supporters
and allies occupy about 60 seats in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Lahoud has been long at odds with Hariri, who resigned
when Lahoud was elected as the president in 1998. Before the
parliamentary elections at the end of August, it was widely
reported
that Lahoud will not accept Hariri as the leader of the government.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, the main power broker of Lebanon with 35,000 troops
there, has announced that it will not intervene in the issue of
government formation.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese constitution stipulates that the premiership is left
for Sunni Muslims while the posts of president and speaker are for
Maronite Christians and Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will be dismissed and a new one be established on
October 17. The current government has to resign on the same day
and a new one will emerge after another one month of negotiations
and bargaining among the factions in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> IPG Intends to Continue Supplying Zimbabwe with Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait-based Independent
Petroleum Group (IPG) Limited said Wednesday it would like to work
out plans on how the company could continue supplying fuel to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"In order to maintain continuity, we need to have an extension
of supply," IPG's Marketing Director Jasem Musallam said during a
meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IPG at the moment had a one-year contract with Zimbabwe which
would expire next March.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue supplying fuel to the country, but we are
stressing that there should be sustainable payment," Musallam said.
At present Zimbabwe owes IPG about 80 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Mines and Energy Minister Sydney Sekeramayi, who
attended the meeting, said a schedule had been made between the
Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) and IPG to ensure that payment
would be done.
</P>
<P>
CBZ is the financial advisor of the country's fuel procurement
agency National Oil Company of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Sekeramayi said, "We want to ensure that there is no stoppage
in securing supply by honoring payment."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed rumors of another fuel price increase before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe had been facing problems in procuring fuel due to
foreign exchange shortages.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Party Denies Possessing Arms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition party
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Wednesday denied a police
charge that the party had stored fire arms and launched a bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
MDC President Morgan Tsvangirayi said his party had neither the
capacity nor motive to launch an attack upon its own property by
using grenades.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Home Affairs Minister John Nkomo Tuesday said in the
parliament that bombing of the MDC headquarters in Harare last
week was an inside job.
</P>
<P>
He said police had found grenades, pistols, rifles among other
weapons during last week's searches of the party's offices. The
MDC has denied the findings.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear is that the ruling party created a pretext to
obtain all the information on the MDC's finance, membership
details, party policies and strategies for future presidential
elections,' said Tsvangirayi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said, "their strategy is to destroy the MDC ahead of the
2002 presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
He added that given the prevailing anarchy in the country, his
party reserves the right to call for mass actions when necessary.

HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The alarming growth rate of
the HIV/AIDS has worsened poverty situation in Sub-Sahara African
continent, Representative of the United Nations Children's Fund to
Zimbabwe Justin Maeda said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The region was increasingly viewed as a high risk place, and as
a result, many investors were frightened away, said Maeda, at
launching the UN's 1999 Zimbabwe Human Development Report in the
southeastern city of Bulawayo.

<P>
"The number of poor people has been increasing in absolute
terms, rising from 271 million in 1993 to 290 million in 1998 in
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In many instances, particularly for the countries in the
Southern African Development Community region, HIV/AIDS has given
an added impetus to the decline of the service access and quality,
" he warned.
</P>
<P>
"The reality of sub-Saharan Africa is grim and calls for a
revisit of our thinking about development," said the UN official.

<HEADLINE> African Development Bank to Loan Zambia 5 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (
ADB) is to provide Zambia with a soft loan of five million U.S.
dollars for the village-based natural resources management project,
ADB senior economist for operations, Jan Helsen, said Wednesday in
central Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement when he paid a courtesy call on
Central province Permanent Secretary, Fanwell Nduna, in Kabwe,

Helsen, who is leading a five-man delegation from ADB African
regional head office in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, said the loan
would be paid in 40 years after a grace period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit is an appraisal of the village-based woodland
management project launched in 1998. It is a final stage of
getting the project together before it is funded sometimes in June
or July next year.
</P>
<P>
"We have received very positive reaction from the Zambian
government and also from other stakeholders. About five million U.
S. dollars soft loan will be given to Zambia on earnest conditions
to carry out the project aimed at benefiting local communities in
forestry areas," Helsen said.
</P>
<P>
In his welcome remarks, the permanent secretary said the

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official Visits Mozambique Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among other areas where the UNDP is cooperating with Mozambique
are the police and judicial systems and governance. Janneh said he
had met with the Deputy Minister of State Administration, Aiuba
Cuereneia, and was "impressed with what he wants to do with civil
service reform".
</P>
<P>
 Janneh said that the UNDP is also involved, through the
Justice Ministry, in setting up an independent centre to train
legal and para legal staff.
</P>
<P>
 He added that, in an hour long meeting with president
Chissano this week, the president was enthusiastic about the UNDP
moving beyond its traditional areas, and into areas such as the
legal system not usually directly associated with development.
</P>
<P>
"I see the UNDP office in Maputo transforming itself into an
agency involved with governance, as well as a development partner",
said Janneh.
</P>
<P>
This is Janneh's first visit to view a UNDP country
programme since he was appointed to his current post in June. Of
all the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique has the
largest UNDP programme, budgeted at 220 million dollars for the
period 1997/2000.
</P>
<P>
Janneh said he regarded the Mozambique program as "going
very well". He described it as "a transition from the post-war,
emergency period to helping Mozambique adapt to a development
phase".

"I see the UNDP office here developing into a very trusted
partner of the government", he added.

<HEADLINE> Fair School Enrollments May Help Achieve Gender Balance: Tanzanian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) --Fair distribution and
gender balance in Tanzania could be realized by ensuring fair
enrollments in schools, a senior government official said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Disparities in education in Tanzania are clearly reflected in
employment where men are shown to be privileged, said Nassoro
Malocho, the Minister of State in the President's office, when
launching the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 2000 State of
World Population Report.
</P>
<P>
The minister said education is supposed to prepare people for
future life where they could apply the acquired skills for a
better living.
</P>
<P>
However,"the figure of enrolment in Tanzanian schools show
that women are actually disadvantaged when compared to their male
counterparts," said Malocho.
</P>
<P>
He cited the enrolment in Tanzania's three major universities
in the 1995-1996 academic year as an example, pointing out that
the female to male ratios in the University of Dar es Salaam, the
Sokoine University of Agriculture and the Open University of
Tanzania are 15 to 85, 25 to 75 and 10 to 90 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, men occupy 79.8 percent and women only 20.2
percent of professional positions in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
But the government has fully realized the existing pitfalls in
the society and it is taking necessary measures to redress the
situation, added the official.
</P>
<P>
In the U.N. report, governments are urged to play a key role in
creating conditions for gender equality by removing legal barriers
and changing laws, policies and programs.
</P>
<P>
Inequality between men and women limits the potential of
individuals, families, communities and nations, read the report.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia Sees Adequate Mandate, Resources as Crucial for Effective U.N. Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Slovakian Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan
took the floor at the general debate of the 55th General Assembly
session, which is scheduled to conclude here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The need for peacekeeping has never been greater," he said. "
However, such an international assistance can be effective only if
it is based on well suited peacekeeping operation to be able to
deal with all problems and needs in a situation it is deployed to,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Good intentions of deploying peacekeeping operation must be
supported with clearly defined and achievable mandate," he said. "
Only an adequate mandate and appropriate resources, both human and
financial, can bring success to and strengthen the credibility of
the United Nations in its peacekeeping efforts and not to cause
more problems."
</P>
<P>
"It requires an appropriate and responsible approach of key
players, including the Security Council, member states and the U.N.
Secretariat, to act promptly on their own as well as to enter into
effective mutual cooperation to give a rapid and decisive response
to the conflict situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The disgraceful failure of the U.N. peacekeeping operations in
Somalia and Rwanda has touched off cries in the international
community for a meaningful reform of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations in a bid to prevent the image of the world body from
being tarnished. Such appeals were further strengthened after the
U.N. peacekeepers were killed, abducted or surrounded by rebels in
Sierra Leone in early May.
</P>
<P>
Though all U.N. soldiers were released thanks to the
international pressure, the Security Council has delayed a vote on
increasing the peacekeepers in the West African country because
not enough countries have offered troops for the turbulent nation,
diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
"Peacekeeping operations should be, from the very beginning,
provided with adequate financial resources to support the wide
array of mandates," the foreign minister said. "It is therefore
equally important to ensure that the financial system providing
the funding for the United Nations peacekeeping is stable,
equitable and transparent."
</P>
<P>
It is also important to ensure "that there is a flexible
mechanism in place with the ability to stabilize the finances for
current and future peacekeeping operations," he said. "The
revision of the United Nations peacekeeping scale of assessment
over the next few months will provide a genuine opportunity for
the U.N. General Assembly to take a critical look at the current
method of assessment and with emerging consensus of the member
states to take important steps to find a viable solution to this
pressing issue."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping operations have been, to a certain extent,
affected by the U.S. reluctance to pay its back dues in full, on
time and without any condition, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
surged to a record 31.9 billion U.S. dollars in July as oil prices
climbed to a 10-year high, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The July deficit was 6.9 percent higher than a revised 29.8-
billion-dollar imbalance in June. It surpassed the old record of
30.4 billion dollars set in March.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of goods and services dropped 1.5 percent to 89.7
billion dollars in July, reflecting a falloff in sales of
commercial aircraft and computers, while imports rose to an all-
time high of 121.6 billion dollars, led by a surge in crude oil
shipments.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The projected increase from 525 million users today to 742
million in the year 2015 is based on increased demand for
contraception, UNFPA said in its annual world population report.
</P>
<P>
The agency said providing family planning to everyone who wants
it is a significant challenge. Today about one third of all
pregnancies, some 80 million a year, are believed to be unwanted
or mistimed.
</P>
<P>
If women could have only the number of children they wanted,
the total fertility rate in many countries would fall by nearly
one child per women, UNFPA believed.

With the world's population at more than six billion, the
challenge ahead is to ensure that people, especially women, are
able to make informed decisions about the size of their families,
according to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

<P>
The appeal came as Eldar Kouliev, acting chairman of
Azerbaijan's delegation to the 55th General Assembly session, took
the floor at the two-week general debate, which is expected to end
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is the main feature of the modern stage in the
development of the world economy," he said. "It is a complex and
objective process. Countries are concerned about the perspectives
of this phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
"While opening up new possibilities for developing their
economies, for ensuring their sustainable development and
improving the welfare of their peoples, the globalization could
also has tangible negative consequences of the globalization and
of the increasing interdependency of states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is called upon to continue to play its key

cooperation and advising the states on all major issues of the
global development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Azerbaijan is making its contribution to the development of
the process of globalization," he said.

Located at the junction of Europe and Asia, and with a
diversified economy and rich natural resources, Azerbaijan serves
as an effective link in the development of the East-West and North-
South cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reiterates Support for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday repeated its
firm support in helping resolve the protracted Cyprus problem,
saying that a solution to the Cyprus issue must be given
exclusively and only on the basis of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Greece firmly backed a federal solution on the basis of the U.
N. resolutions and decisions, and would reject, along with Cyprus,
any solution that would not be based on such a solution, said
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou after a meeting with
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Greece would continue to coordinate its action
with the Cypriot leadership and all the Cypriot political parties,
the foreign minister said Greece hoped the other side would
realize that it must come to the negotiating table for substantive
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
Wednesday also stated that Greece and Cyprus would not allow the
Turkish-Cypriot pseudo-state to be recognized, nor the island
republic to be divided.
</P>
<P>
He noted that progress in the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks
between Cyprus' two communities was fraught with difficulties, but
this demanded that everyone show extreme responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
eastern Mediterranean island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus have insisted that the island must be
reunited in a federation formula in line with the U.N. resolutions,
but Turkey and northern Cyprus, led by Rauf Denktash, demand that
a confederation formed by two sovereign states be set up on the
island.
</P>
<P>
For years, the talks between Cyprus's two communities have
been deadlocked primarily over the refusal of Denktash to meet
directly with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides or to discuss
substantive issues unless northern Cyprus is recognized.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the fourth round of such talks between Clerides and
Denktash almost collapsed following the statement made by the U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in which Annan said that the equal
status of the parties must and should be recognized clearly in the
comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Sees Implementing Millennium Declaration as Global Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The declaration
adopted at the U.N. Millennium Summit set a version for the future
and implementing it is indeed the challenge facing the United
Nations and the global community, Namibia said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Theo-Ben Gurirab, minister for foreign
affairs of Namibia, said the citizens of the world paid witness to
the sober promises of the summit and they wait in earnest for
member states to make good on the pledges made in the declaration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"For out part, we must find the collective political will to
mobilize the necessary resources to implement the commitments. We
must also reconnect with the passion that drove the leaders of the
world to found the United Nations, determined to spare humanity
from the devastation of war and deprivation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Member states must forge a new global partnership between the
wealthy and powerful nations and those whose present circumstances
leave them mired in the seemingly intractable maze of a merry-go-
round tape of development," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The North must be gracious and generous and give enough of
what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and
weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable
and irreversible social and economic growth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, the South must not only take sober stock of our
present challenge, but also devote energy and creativity to
genuinely engage all our countries in a common effort at social
development and human security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration in itself will not put bread on the tables,
stop wars and erase poverty. We can therefore not afford to go
home and continue business as usual," the Namibian foreign
minister added.

<P>
Following his meeting with Rakhmonov in the Tajik capital of
Dushanbe, Nikolayenko told the press that Tajikistan, bordering
Afghanistan, "plays a key role in the Collective Security Treaty
among the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)."
</P>
<P>
"In line with this treaty, we are creating laws and are giving
material content to a system that will be comprised of regional
collective-security forces," Nikolayenko said, cited by Russian
news agencies.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Belarus are in charge of the Eastern European
segment of the treaty, Russia and Armenia for the Caucasian aspect.
We are now creating regional security forces in Central Asia --
collective rapid-deployment forces that will be able to respond to
the situation at hand, provide for our states' security and fight
against international terrorism," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nikolayenko said Rakhmonov and himself have agreed that these
issues will be put on the agenda for the upcoming summit of
signatories to the Collective Security Treaty, scheduled for
October 11 in Bishkek.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Uzbekistan's withdrawal from the treaty does
not mean that Uzbekistan has cut itself off from tackling security
problems in Central Asia.

UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday hailed the U.S. Senate's passage of a bill
on permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, saying "
this is an important step towards China's ultimate membership of
the World Trade Organization (WTO)."

In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said it
was also an important step "towards a fuller integration of

Stressing the importance of greater universality of the

<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Maria Aznar will pay a visit to France from September 26 to 28,
the French Foreign Ministry announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit follows a successful cooperation between France and
Spain in a sweeping operation against the Basque separatist group
ETA, during which French security forces arrested last week the
number one of ETA, Ignacio Miguel Gracia Arregui, and 16 other
leading members of the group in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
ETA, which means the Party of Freedom and Fatherland in the
Basque language, used the French part of the Basque country as a
logistics support base to launch terrorist attacks in Spain.
</P>
<P>
ETA has been fighting over the past 32 years for an independent
Basque state in the Basque country in northern Spain and southern
France.
</P>
<P>
The French-Spanish operation over the past two weeks
practically dismantled the political and logistics networks of ETA,
according to the Spanish government.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Rolls Over U.N. Force in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mandate of the U.N. mission, called UNAMSIL, is to expire
at midnight, and the 15-nation council decided unanimously to roll
it over until December 31.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked the council last month
for authorizing the deployment of an extra 7,500 peacekeepers to
UNAMSIL, taking the force to a ceiling of 20,500.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL was authorized by the Security Council in October 1999
as a 6,000-member force. It was successively increased to a
strength of 13,000, making it the biggest U.N. field operation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the council agreed to a U.N. request and put
off a vote until Annan consulted with more potential troop
contributors.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in an August report to the council on Sierra Leone, said
there had been "a serious lack of cohesion within the mission as
well as a number of other shortcomings."
</P>
<P>
Annan said an important cause of these shortcomings was the "
fast growth of the mission from a small team of military observers
to a large multidisciplinary peacekeeping operation" with complex
organizational and logistical requirements.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission is expected to review all aspects of the
Sierra Leonean operation, a court to be set up to try rebel
leaders, a ban on illegal diamond sales that have fueled the
conflict, and the effectiveness of the peacekeeping venture.

<HEADLINE> Greece Plans to Cut Special Fuel Tax for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece will cut its fuel tax
for the country's farmers in a bid to help them reduce the impact
of soaring fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis said Wednesday that a new
tax draft bill by the government would envisage the equalizing of
diesel and heating oil prices along with a larger cut in a special
oil tax paid by farmers, according to the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Greece is vulnerable to both the currency and fuel crisis. The
appreciation of the dollar by some 20 percent since the beginning
of this year is reportedly estimated to have added some 500-800
billion drachmas (about 128 million to 2 billion U.S. dollars) to
government debt, and the continuing oil crisis has sparked off
predictions of 3.5 percent inflation by year-end as oil prices
filter through to the Greek economy. In August, Greece's annual
inflation rose to 3.0 percent from 2.7 percent in July mainly due
to the recent oil price hikes.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged fuel crisis coupled with the growing strength of
the dollar sparked off a series of price increases, especially in
transportation and utility costs, but the Greek government has
insisted in recent days that the situation is under control
because the country has a strong economy that had nothing to do
with the situation in the previous two oil crises in 1970s.
</P>
<P>
However, as a preventive measure, the Greek government
announced last week a six-day freeze on the fuel retail prices
following a gentlemen's agreement which was reached between the
government and representatives of the country's petrol companies,
refineries and petrol stations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prosecutor Clears Clintons of Wrongdoing in Whitewater Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray, who issued a six-page statement here, said there was "
insufficient" or "inconclusive" evidence to warrant charges for
any of the allegations against President Bill Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to
prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either President
Clinton or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal
conduct," Ray said.
</P>
<P>
Ray will send a final report on Whitewater to a panel of the
three federal judges that appointed him as independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
The Clintons were investigated for allegations ranging from
obstruction of justice to false testimony concerning their
Arkansas business dealings, including the Whitewater real estate
venture.
</P>
<P>
The allegations prompted the most expensive independent counsel
inquiry in U.S. history which cost a total of 52 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Starr, Ray's predecessor started the investigation in
1994 on the dealings involving the Clintons in the 1980s when he
was the state's governor and she was a partner in a law firm in
Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 people were convicted in the case, including
former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and former Justice
Department official Webster Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
Ray's statement was cheered by the White House. "Robert Ray is
now the latest investigator to complete an examination of the
transactions related to Whitewater Development Co. and conclude
that there are no grounds for legal action," said White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
It was also a relief to the first lady, who is a Democratic
candidate fighting for the Senate seat in New York in a close race
with her Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
The independent counsel is yet to decide whether to bring
criminal charges against President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal after the president leaves office in January.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Calls for New International Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Calls for a new
international economic order have fallen on deaf ears which is the
direct consequence of the resistance on the part of certain
developed countries to admit the necessity of changing the
functioning of the world economy, Singapore said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, S. Jayakumar, minister for foreign
affairs of Singapore, said the resistance can be easier to
overcome and the urgent remedial action that is needed may be
easier to take if there is a mindset shift by both developing and
developed countries, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The candid debate at the recent interactive roundtables at the
U.N. Millennium Summit saw a common acknowledgment that both the
North and South must find collective solutions to the problems of
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was agreement that developing countries must be given
help to build up capacity to benefit from forces of globalization,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the developed economies also face some problems that
can be attributed to the pressures of globalization, there can be
no doubt that the problems of the South are of a far greater
magnitude and deserve far more attention, the foreign minister
noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, it is commonly accepted that no country,
whatever its development status, can afford to opt out of the
global economy or go it alone.
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in one part of the globe washes up on the
shores of other parts of the world, the foreign minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wu Bangguo said
State-owned enterprises (SOE) should speed up reform and
development to further upgrade technology, exploit the market and
increase competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark during an investigative trip,
September 16-19, into the relocation of the Three Gorges residents
in the east China's Zhejiang Province. During his stay, Wu visited
some major local SOEs and talked with local officials and managers.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said with the fast development of a non State-
owned economy, the State-owned economy in Zhejiang has also
experienced a prosperous era after carrying out restructuring and
reform.
</P>
<P>
The State-owned assets volume have doubled, increasing the
control of the State-owned economy in the province's economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the scale of the State-owned economy in the national
economy will decrease, the control, effect and drive of the State-
owned economy on the national economy will largely increase.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged the SOEs to fully make use of their own advantages in
the field of technology. They must set up key high-tech research
and development projects to restructure traditional industries and
adapt these enterprises to the market.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged SOEs to conduct more technological exchanges and
cooperation with domestic and overseas high-tech counterparts. The
cooperation will help SOEs obtain many advanced technological
results with independent intellectual property rights for SOEs'
future development.
</P>
<P>
With efforts of SOEs officials and employees, Wu pointed out,
these enterprises have achieved a lot in the development of
management reform and economic profits.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, the country's SOEs
reported total profits of 113.2 billion yuan (13.6 billion US
dollars), up 190 percent over the same period last year. Some 31
of 35 industrial sectors in China, especially petrochemicals,
textiles, metallurgy, reported large-margin profit increase.
</P>
<P>
The goal of lifting State-owned enterprises (SOE) out of the
red during the central government's three-year campaign will be
realized for sure, the official concluded.

<HEADLINE> New Ethnic College Opens in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Two schools in this capital of
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region today merged into a
new college -- Inner Mongolian Ethnic College.
</P>
<P>
Some 98 percent of the college's staff are Mongolians, said a
local educational official. The predecessors of the two schools
were the Mongolian ethnic language school and an ethnic teachers'
school.
</P>
<P>
Established in the early 1950s, the two schools had educated
about 20,000 Mongolian professionals, who are playing important
roles in social and economic development in Inner Mongolia and a
number of provinces across China, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning,
Hebei, Qinghai and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The new college is made up of 10 departments and 32 specialties
such as economic management, politics and law, foreign languages,
fine arts and computer science. It also has eight teaching and
research centers on Mongolian religion and other subjects.
</P>
<P>
The number of students in the college is expected to increase
from 2,496 this year to 4,000 in five years.

<HEADLINE> Solar Thermal Energy Center Opened in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIT SHEMESH (Israel), September 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Solel
Solar System Ltd. opened its Solar Thermal Energy Center at an
industrial site near Beit Shemesh, about 50 kilometers west of
Jerusalem, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first solar thermal energy system was launched by the
company at the opening ceremony, which is designed to produce
environmentally clean energy that could be supplied safely,
efficiently and at an economically viable price to the users.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed and built by the company's own engineers
in four months, can produce heat for electricity and steam
generations, as well as for air conditioning that can be used by
institutions such as hospitals, hotels, schools and industrial
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The whole system mainly consists of solar collectors, heat
exchanger, steam turbine, electricity generator, absorption machine
and cooling tower designed specially to produce cool water for air
conditioning in hot places.
</P>
<P>
Avi Brenmiller, the president and chief executive, said that the
system uses sunlight as its primary energy source to power a
conventional steam turbine electric generator and the solar field
is composed of parabolic trough solar collectors which individually
track the sun using sun sensors and microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
The collectors focus sunlight on to specially coated steel pipes
mounted inside vacuum-insulated glass tubes, and the pipes contain
a heat transfer fluid which is heated by solar to about 390 degrees
centigrade, he said.
</P>
<P>
The heated fluid is pumped through a series of conventional heat
exchanges to generate superheated steam, which powers a turbine-
generator to produce electricity to be delivered to the utility's
electric grid, he added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure uninterrupted power during peak demand periods, an
auxiliary boiler or heater fueled by natural gas is available as a
supplemental source of power, he said, adding that a central
computer facility monitors and controls each of the hundreds of
individual solar collectors in the field as well as all the power
block equipment and systems.
</P>
<P>
The system can be big and small and the company also has the
technology to produce vacuum solar collectors specially for use at
the places which do not have too much sunlight, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company is an Israeli corporation founded in 1992 financed
by European investors, and the center has 80 staff, half of them
engineers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Ready to Deal With Iraq Threats: U.S. Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. military
official said here Wednesday that the U.S. forces stationed in the
Gulf region are ready to face any Iraqi threats.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Paul Mikolashek, Commander of the Third U.S.
Army and U.S. Armed Forces Central Command, told a press conference
that all necessary military precautions have been taken to foil any
new Iraqi adventure against security of Kuwait and the region.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, we have a continuous presence of a heavy task
force that trains and cooperates with the Kuwaitis throughout the
year as part of our efforts to deter and be ready for anything that
might come our way," said Mikolashek.
</P>
<P>
He indicated the deployment of some 3,000 heavily-equipped
ground troops in northern Kuwait, near the southern border of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has a total of 4,500 troops in Kuwait in addition to
heavy weapons and two batteries of anti-missile Patriot missiles.
</P>
<P>
It has warplanes deployed in and around Kuwait, warships in the
Gulf, pre-positioned heavy military hardware in Qatar and a
floating heavy weapons store ready for immediate deployment in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commander has come to Kuwait after Iraq launched a new
round of rhetoric campaign against the small Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid accused
Kuwait of stealing Iraqi crude in the border area and said that
Baghdad would take unspecified measures to protect its oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait strongly rejected the allegations and has invited a
neutral body to probe operations in the alleged area.
</P>
<P>
Mikolashek said, "we always pay attention to what goes on up
north (Iraq). I think there has been a lot of rhetoric. What is
important to us in the military is what actions are being done, and
right now we just see a lot of war of words."

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Philippine Military Operation Against Abu Sayyaf Bears Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The military operation
launched by Philippine government troops against the extremist Abu
Sayyaf group bore concrete fruits Wednesday with the rescue of two
French journalists who were abducted by the group more than two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
French television journalists Jean Jacques Legarrec and Roland
Madura were rescued by military forces at around 6:30 a.m. in
Patikul,Jolo, and were later taken directly from Jolo to Manila by
plane.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the presidential palace, the two
journalists said they took advantage of deep darkness Tuesday
evening to escape from the Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"We hid for some minutes and after that we ran on the road. We
spent the night hiding in the jungle in case they would be looking
around for us," said Legarrec.
</P>
<P>
At dawn Wednesday, Legarrec added, they flagged down a military
truck and were taken to a military camp.
</P>
<P>
Legarrec who was presented at the press conference along with
Madura, said he was thankful that the Philippine government had
taken the military option that forced the Abu Sayyaf to flee.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on July 9
when they came to interview other hostages taken by the extremist
group from Malaysia in April.
</P>
<P>
According to Legarrec, the rescue operation staged by the
military"gave us the opportunity of escaping."
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the two journalists came after five days of heavy
fighting in Jolo which resulted in the death of four civilians and
six Abu Sayyaf rebels. The military has also overrun three major
Abu Sayyaf camps and some smaller hideouts.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the two journalists has got very positive
reaction from the French government.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada said his French counterpart, President
Jacques Chirac, has personally expressed his country's gratitude
to the Philippine government for the rescue of Legarrec and Madura.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he personally called up Chirac on Wednesday
morning to inform him that the last two French nationals held
hostage by the Abu Sayyaf are already safe and are now in the
custody of the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
"In response, President Chirac congratulated our military and
expressed his deepest gratitude to our generals and the government
on the success of our efforts to free the two journalists," he
said.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said Chirac also appealed for understanding
for France's earlier expression of concern on his decision to
undertake rescue-and-offensive operations to free the hostages
held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo, Sulu Province.
</P>
<P>
"He asked for understanding," Estrada said, noting that the
French president has explained that the French people were merely
concerned about the safety of Legarrec and Madura.
</P>
<P>
On the economic aspect, share prices in the Philippine Stock
Exchange also ended higher Wednesday, boosted by the rescue of the
two French journalists.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, rose 10.54
points to close at 1,434.77. The broader all-shares index also
inched up 6.87 points to 681.13.
</P>
<P>
"The uptrend we saw in the market today is a reaction to the
rescue of the two hostages held for more than two months by the
Abu Sayyaf in Jolo," said Warren Chua, an analyst at Mercantile
Securities.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the first-step success, President Estrada said he
has ordered the armed forces to further intensify military
operations in Jolo to secure the safe release of the remaining 17
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The rebels still hold an American, three Malaysians and a
Filipino kidnapped from Malaysia in April and 12 Filipino
Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
"I have made a difficult decision to order rescue and offensive
operations with my full faith in the capabilities of our soldiers.
We cannot stop here. There are 17 more hostages to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the safety of the remaining hostages is not his
only concern, stressing that the Abu Sayyaf must also be quashed
to send a strong message that kidnap-for-ransom groups in the
country will not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group abducted 21 mostly foreign hostages from
Malaysia on April 23 and brought them to Jolo. Of the 21 hostages,
20 have been released after millions of U.S. dollars had
reportedly been paid to the group.
</P>
<P>
"We not only have to rescue the remaining hostages. We should
also crush the Abu Sayyaf and turn them into ashes to put an end
to their terrorism, so no one would dare follow their footsteps,"
Estrada stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Oil Workers End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's oil workers agreed to
end their week-long strike and to go back to work Tuesday
following an agreement on payment was reached with oil companies.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff
Association of Nigeria (PENGASSON) and National Union of Petroleum
and National Gas (NUPENG), and eight major oil marketing companies
resolved their differences over payment at a meeting held in Lagos
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued at the end of the negotiation,
both parties directed all their members to resume work on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretary of NUPENG, Joseph Akinlaja, was quoted as
saying that the unions accepted a compromise 20 percent increase
for all permanent employees with effect from May 1, 2000. The
workers earlier demanded a 45 percent increase but the oil
companies agreed to a 15 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
"The workers have been offered a satisfactory percentage
increase in their salaries. It is on this basis that the strike
has been called off, said Akinlaja.
</P>
<P>
The strike caused a very serious fuel scarcity across the
country, crippling business in the commercial capital Lagos and
other major cities.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo appealed to the oil
workers and oil companies on Tuesday to immediately resolve their
pay dispute and go back to work or risk government intervention.
</P>
<P>
""The president is very concerned about the great hardships
which the strike is causing ordinary Nigerians and its disruptive
impact on the economy," said a statement released by presidential
spokesman Doyin Okupe.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Backs Angola's Efforts to Restore Administration Along Common Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Lt. Gen. Musengule who arrived in Luanda on
Tuesday, as soon as the state administration reaches the towns
along the common border, Zambia will give all the necessary
support, and the cooperation will grow increasingly picturesque.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the general stressed that the territorial integrity
of his country should be firmly defended. According to General
Musengule, the military situation at the common border is not yet
stable, which stems from the war in Angola since Zambia has its
border "very well" watched.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Angolan refugees in Zambia, the general
said that it is difficult to identify which individuals are coming
from rebels or government controlled places. They have come just
as refugees and are sent to refugee camps where they get all
supplies with the assistance of non-governmental organizations.
All those who come without guns are given as much protection as
possible, and are identified as war victims and cared according to
the human rights principles, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of the Chief of Staff of the Angolan Armed
Forces, Joao de Matos, the Zambian general will stay in Angola for
a three-day official visit, during which he is expected to visit
the Angolan central provinces of Bie and Benguela.

<HEADLINE> Three Tutsi Parties Sign Burundi Peace Accord in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Three small Tutsi parties
Wednesday signed the Burundi peace pact at a summit meeting held
at the State House in Kenya's capital Nairobi, witnessed by five
regional heads of state and mediator Nelson Mandela, former South
African President.
</P>
<P>
The three Tutsi groups, which refused to signed the Arusha
Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi in Tanzania on
August 28, put their signatures to the agreement aimed at ending
the seven-year civil war in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The three new signatories are the Independent Workers' Party,
the Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development, and
the National Alliance for Law and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
Attending the Nairobi summit were Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa, Rwanda President Paul Kagame, Burundi President
Pierre Buyoya as well as representatives from Zambian and
Ethiopian governments.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued after the meeting said that the summit
received a report by the mediator on the progress made on the
issue of ceasing hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The report observed that the Burundi army and two main armed
groups, the National Liberation Forces and the Forces for the
Defense of Democracy, had been engaged in negotiations on
cessation of hostilities, but no progress had been made to
conclude a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The regional heads of state called upon the parties to resolve
the matter and sign a cease-fire agreement within 30 days, and
urged that the issue of the leadership of the transition should be
resolved as soon as possible to pave way for the implementation of
the Arusha Agreement in earnest, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The communique added that in this regard, the summit urged all
the parties concerned to resolve the issue at the forthcoming
meeting of the signatories to the Arusha Peace Agreement to be
held in Arusha on September 25.
</P>
<P>
President Moi addressed the summit, noting the conflict in
Burundi has caused untold suffering to innocent people and the
seven-year-old civil war has claimed over 200,000 lives and driven
many more people in exile.
</P>
<P>
"A return to peace, stability and security for all would bring
an end to their suffering, making it possible for them to focus on
the reconstruction and development of their country," Moi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Wuhu
Yangtze River Bridge in east China's Anhui Province was completed
and will open at the end of this month, said the Ministry of
Railway today.
</P>
<P>
The bridge is China's first stayed-cable bridge for both
railway and highway, and it is also the last bridge built over the
Yangtze River in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in March 1997, construction of the bridge was
completed six months ahead of the four-year schedule.
</P>
<P>
As a State key project for the 1996-2000 period, the
construction cost was 300 million yuan (36 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Located in Wuhu, a major city in the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River, the new bridge will serve as a hub for the Yangtze
River railway and highway networks in east China and will improve
the shipping conditions over the Yangtze River, said officials
with Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
To date, 24 giant bridges have been built and are being built
across the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, with a total length of 6,300 kilometers,
flows through nine Chinese provinces and autonomous regions.
Nearly 400 million people live in the river valley, which covers
an area of up to 1.8 million square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> More Efficient Bus Operation Proposed for Better Environment in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- More efficient bus
operation such as reducing the number of bus trips and stopping
activities in the busy areas can alleviate traffic congestion and
reduce vehicle emission, a Hong Kong official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a better air quality workshop, Assistant
Commissioner for Transport S. M. Li said the air pollution problem
at street level in Hong Kong is largely caused by vehicle emission.
</P>
<P>
Traffic and transport professionals could play an active role
in combating roadside air pollution through transport planning and
traffic management measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Enhancing the efficiency of bus operation is one of the traffic
management measures, Li said, referring to measures such as
controlling the deployment of buses in busy areas; promotion of
bus-bus and bus-rail interchanges, adjustments to bus routings and
frequency and bus stop rationalization.
</P>
<P>
Regarding rationalization of bus routes and stops, Li pointed
out that since late 1998, the number of operating trips passing
through Central District has been reduced through various measures.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reduction in bus trips in Central, the routings
of 24 bus routes, involving about 160 bus trips per peak hour,
were diverted to avoid the congested traffic spots in Central and
Causeway Bay, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance bus efficiency, bus stops located on major
traffic corridors were rationalized to reduce stopping and weaving
movements of buses, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Department would review the operation of bus stops
on major corridors regularly and initiate measures to improve the
situation whenever necessary, Li said.

<HEADLINE> China to Breed More Better Grass in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Yusheng, a researcher with China Aerospace Science and
Technology Corporation, revealed the plan today at the annual
meeting of the China Association of Sciences and Technology in Xi'
an, capital of Shaanxi Province, west China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China, the first country in the world to have bred
crop seeds in space, plans to use improved varieties of grass,
shrubs, and trees and breed them in space to benefit the country
and make it more green.
</P>
<P>
Seeds sent into space in recoverable space vehicles or high-
altitude balloons would mutate under such space conditions as
micro-gravity and cosmic radiation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts will use the mutated seeds to cultivate plants with
desired features, such as taller grass for higher yields.
</P>
<P>
The mutated seeds could also be bred to cultivate shorter grass,
grass that does not grow very fast, which will reduce the time
needed to mow the lawn, or individual grass plants that will
increase land coverage.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that space-bred grass is not hazardous to human
because its genes undergo a mutation without involving any gene
from other species.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to select locally improved grass seeds very soon
for space breeding" and cultivate quality varieties of grass that
will suit different ecological conditions."
</P>
<P>
"A large experimental grass planting center will also be set up,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
China has imported 21 varieties of grass from Hungary,
including those for animal husbandry, lawns and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
He said 15 varieties of grass seeds will be used to cultivate
grass capable of resisting droughts, frosts and diseases following
experiments on 50 hectares of land in Shandong, Hebei province and
Beijing, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Grassland accounts for 40 percent of the country's land mass,
ranking second in the world. But its per-capital area is only less
than half of the world's average level.
</P>
<P>
"We need to breed more grass which can resist droughts, saline,
desertification and cold," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
China has already bred more than 800 varieties of crop seeds in
space, including rice, cotton, oil, vegetables and fruit since
1987.
</P>
<P>
From the varieties, China has cultivated a large number of
crops that can resist disease, mature earlier and produce high
yields.
</P>
<P>
But grass seeds account for only one percent of all seeds sent
into space in past experiments.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Increase Loan to Nepal's Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) will increase its loan for Nepal's Melamchi Water Supply
Project from its earlier commitment of 100 million U.S. dollars to
120 million dollars, according to an ADB official.
</P>
<P>
"It is very probable the loan amount will be increased to 120
million dollars," said Arthur Mcntosh, leader of a visiting
appraisal team of the bank, during the appraisal meeting Wednesday.
"The bank's management has supported the idea of the increase in
the loan for the Melamchi project."
</P>
<P>
The Melamchi project, scheduled to start in 2001 and finish by
2006, is designed to pipe in from the Melamchi River 540 million
liters of water a day to the Kathmandu valley, which is hit by
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The additional 20 million dollars will be used for waste-water
improvement component of the project, said Mcntosh.
</P>
<P>
The visiting ADB team is expected to appraise the project by
the first week of October before it submits its report to the bank
's headquarters in the Philippine capital of Manila. The bank's
board will approve the loan on December 21 this year.
</P>
<P>
ADB's final decision to sanction the loan will be a go-ahead
signal to other donors of the multi-million project. Norad (Norway
's official development agency) and Japanese Bank of International
Cooperation, among other donors, want ADB's loan to be approved
first before they release their share of fund for the much-talked
drinking water project in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Kathmandu presently demands more than 180 million liters of
water a day, but only half of the quantity can be met.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Army Commanding General Visits Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Malaysian
Defense Forces Gen. Mohamed Zahidi Zainuddin Wednesday held talks
with visiting Philippine Army Commanding General Lt. Gen. Voltaire
Gazmin,Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Philippine general informed his host that
25 members of the Muslim separatist Abu Sayyaf group have been
captured up till the fifth day of a military offensive to free the
19 hostages still held by the group, Bernama said, quoting Zahidi.
</P>
<P>
He said Gazmin told him that the Philippine military had not
been able yet to locate rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
"Gazmin also told me the current military offensive would go on
indefinitely. Their objective is to search and destroy the Abu
Sayyaf group," Zahidi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed joint exercises and bilateral training
programs.
</P>
<P>
Gazmin, who arrived here Tuesday, also met Malaysian Army Chief
Gen. Md Hashim Hussein earlier Wednesday. He leaves for Singapore
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the Malaysian Defense Forces also said soldiers
have already been stationed on seven previously unguarded
Malaysian islands off Sabah, East Malaysia, as the military beefed
up security there following two intrusions by members of the Abu
Sayyaf group in the past five months.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers will also monitor other islands requiring physical
military presence in the long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
Three Malaysians were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf group from the
Pandanan Semporna Island Resort off Sabah on September 10 and are
being held hostage in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, on April 23, nine Malaysians and 12 foreigners were
kidnapped by the same group from a resort in Sipadan Island, also
off Sabah,and were taken to Jolo in the southern Philippines.
However the kidnappers have since freed 20 of them in batches.
</P>
<P>
Following this month's abduction, the Malaysian government
ordered the stationing of soldiers and policemen on all islands
off Sabah's northeastern coast and to counter attempts by armed
Filipino groups to intrude into Malaysian territory.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Zahidi said the air force and navy had also upgraded their
surveillance capability and strike-readiness against intruders.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Looking for Potential Oil Explorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is looking for
investors to explore its potential oil and gas reserves, local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Energy and Minerals Abdallah Kigoda
revealed that indicators show there are many oil and gas deposits
in different parts of Tanzania, especially the offshore deep sea
areas.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda made the remarks in London while meeting with
representatives of British oil companies including Total and
British Petroleum following a similar visit to the United States
last week.
</P>
<P>
In Houston, Texas, the minister said at a meeting with US oil
exploration companies that Tanzania's policy on oil exploration is
better than any other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The government has taken a number of steps to ensure that
there is no delay in acquiring licenses for oil exploration and
their processing will be done in a more transparent manner," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Tanzanian officials said that foreign
prospectors has invested over 242 million U.S. dollars in the
search for oil in Tanzania over the past 20 years but to no avail.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Create Necessary Environment for Investors: vice-president </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- African countries must create
necessary environment to enable investors to recoup their
investment, Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has said.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti made the remarks Tuesday when he opened a World Bank
workshop on Aid, Conditionalities and Reform in Africa in the
capital Nairobi, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that private sectors always seek high profits and
lower risk, therefore African countries must establish an
environment which will attract necessary resources from abroad
either as private foreign investment or as donor assistance.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it is important to invest heavily in
physical infrastructure and information technology so as to reduce
the costs investors now face.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the country's ongoing economic reforms
were unlikely to succeed due to harsh conditionalities imposed on
Kenya by donors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is important that the donors and
recipients mutually agree on the conditionalities so as to make
them acceptable at all levels.
</P>
<P>
While a country has already committed to appropriate
transformations, it is quite reasonable that the donor should
support the reform efforts for greater success, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Ruling Party Warns Multipartyists Against Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Secretariat of the ruling
Ugandan National Resistance Movement has warned multipartyists and
other politicians to stop inciting the public into disorder on the
pretext of exercising their democratic freedom.
</P>
<P>
"The Movement Secretariat has noticed that some politicians are
increasingly engaged in agitation for public disorder under the
cover of exercising their democratic freedoms," said a press
release from the Secretariat available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This is to clarify that the democracy which these politicians
take for granted as their birthright was a product of strenuous
struggle by the Movement," said the release, stressing that its
enjoyment must therefore be orderly, in accordance with stipulated
procedures, if democracy is to be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes a day after the press reported that
Democratic Party (DP) leaders urged Ugandans to be prepared for
violent election campaigns if the government continued to disrupt
their activities.
</P>
<P>
DP Secretary General Drametu Marino was quoted as having said
that the party would be forced to resort to violence if the
government continues to harass the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Hints at Direct 0ceania Place for 2006 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Oceania should gain direct
entry to the 2006 World Cup Finals in Germany, FIFA president Sepp
Blatter said in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter told Justin Madden, the state of Victoria's minister of
sport, that Australia had a chance of hosting three international
tournaments in 2003 -- the Confederations Cup, the World Club
Championship and the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed Oceania, the smallest of FIFA's six
confederations with only 11 member countries, had a chance of
gaining direct entry to the World Cup in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Blatter noted that "I'm convinced that for the 2006 World Cup,
FIFA's Executive Committee will follow this idea and I will
personally work with them to get Oceania direct entry."
</P>
<P>
In the lead-up to the 2002 competition, the winners of the
Oceania qualifying competition will meet the fifth placed South
American team late next year with the winner going through to the
finals in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand, the only countries in with a
realistic chance of qualifying from Oceania, have had to play off
against teams from other continents.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said: "The FIFA Executive Committee has agreed on the
principle of rotating the World Cup around the six federations.
Oceania must be part of this," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You must hold the World Cup finals in a country where football
has a strong presence," he added.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Welcomes PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong on Wednesday welcomed the U.S. Senate's
decision to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status
to China.
</P>
<P>
"PNTR for China is one of the most significant pieces of
foreign policy legislation to come before the U.S. Congress in
recent years, " said Richard Kahler, chairman of AmCham.
</P>
<P>
"Today's strong bipartisan Senate vote, 83 to 15, and the
earlier House vote, 237 to 197, will enable the United States and
China to develop a more stable, long-term economic and political
relation," Kahler said.
</P>
<P>
"As a major trading partner, Hong Kong stands to benefit by the
expansion of U.S.-China trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kahler noted that PNTR status is the normal basis for conducting
trade between trading partners. Ending the annual review process
will finally breathe life to the landmark bilateral trade
agreement reached between the United States and China in November
1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the uncertainty of annual reviews on China's trading
status removed and the anticipated completion in Geneva of China's
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession protocol by the end of
the year, AmCham moves to a new phase of its work," Kahler said.
</P>
<P>
Member companies of AmCham will be devoting their energies to
exploring the unprecedented market-opening opportunities that
China's integration into the world economy can bring, he said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Airport Granted Authoritative Top Credit Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The international credit
rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's has assigned an "A+" corporate
credit rating and an "A" foreign currency rating to the Airport
Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), the operator of Hong Kong
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The ratings are the same as the sovereign ratings of the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
said Victor Fung Kwok-king, chairman of the AAHK, when announcing
the matter here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is the first airport
in Asia to receive an international credit rating while the AAHK
is one of the few institutions in Hong Kong that enjoy the same
ratings as the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
In affirming AAHK's credit ratings, Standard &AMP; Poor (S&AMP;P)'s
cited a robust service area, a diversified carrier base, a strong
financial position, a new facility with capacity for expansion,
and support and ownership by the HKSAR government, the sole owner
of the AAHK.
</P>
<P>
S&AMP;P described the outlook on the ratings as "stable," said Fung.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the HKIA ranks first in international cargo
throughout, and fifth in international passenger throughput. The
facility handled 32 million passengers and 2.2 million tons of
cargo in the past 12 months with a diversified carrier base of 65
airlines serving 130 destinations.
</P>
<P>
"The airport's location as gateway of China and its proximity
to the Pearl River Delta, one of the most dynamic centers of
growth in China, is also a benefit," said the S&AMP;P report.
</P>
<P>
Fung said the ratings will help improve the profile of AAHK in
the global investment market and develop more sources of raising
funds.
</P>
<P>
As aviation is an important component of Hong Kong's economy,
the ratings will strengthen Hong Kong's economy and its position
as an international business and financial center, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fung told the press that AAHK is moving toward the target of
listing but does not have a plan of listing or issuing bonds at
present.
</P>
<P>
"The ratings make a good preparation for the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Quakes in Western China Signal Disasters in Eastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guo listed several violent earthquakes that took place from
1842 to 1983 in western China, along with corresponding natural
disasters that occurred shortly in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
In January 1937, an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter
Scale shook part of Qinghai at 35 degrees latitude north. Seven
months later, two earthquakes measuring 7 and 6.7 on the Richter
Scale hit Heze in east China's Shandong Province at the same
latitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, he said a quake measuring 6 on the Richter
Scale took place in Qinghai at the same latitude on November 6,
1983. The very next day, Heze was hit by an earthquake measuring 5.
9 on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that once earthquakes measuring above 7.0 on
the Richter Scale occurred at the border of Mongolia, the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and Gansu Province, the middle reaches of
the Yellow River are prone to big flooding," Guo said.
</P>
<P>
For example, in June, 1842, a quake measuring 7.0 on the
Richter Scale occurred in Xinjiang, northwest China, the middle
reaches of the Yellow River suffered devastating flooding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Catastrophic flooding appeared on the middle reaches of the
Yellow River several months after an earthquake hit Gansu,
Xinjiang and the border between southwestern Mongolia and Xinjiang
in 1932, 1957 and 1974, respectively.
</P>
<P>
He also found that floods in the Yangtze valleys always
followed major quakes in south China's Yunnan or neighboring
Myanmar, such as the big floods in 1931, 1954 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said western China should be taken into account when
considering disaster prevention in eastern China.

<HEADLINE> Carved Stone Treasure on Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Museum of
Chinese History (NMCH) opened Wednesday to show its most
impressive treasure from its huge reserves to the public for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest museum displayed a colorfully painted
stone relief, which dates back to more than 1,000 years ago and
was donated back to China in June by a U.S. antique collector.
</P>
<P>
Relics experts said that the precious exhibit, created during
the late Tang Dynasty (618-907) and the Five Dynasties (907-960),
features the highest artistic level of carving techniques from
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, some grave-robbers stole two carved stone tablets from
a high-ranking official's tomb in north China's Hebei Province and
smuggled them to Hong Kong to be sold in the underground antique
market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese relics authorities found that the global auction house,
Christie's, was going to sell one of the two stone tablets.
Chinese authorities wanted to retrieve the treasure.
</P>
<P>
After mediation between China's State Administration of
Cultural Heritage (SACH) and concerned U.S. official organizations,
the U.S. antique collector said that he would donate the other
stone tablet, which he had kept for six years, back to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Besides the stone tablet, the other 62 exhibits include
porcelain, stoneware, bronzeware, painting albums and others.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the exhibition would arouse the awareness of
people worldwide to return looted or smuggled relics to their
original owners," said Zhu Fenghan, curator of the museum.
</P>
<P>
During the exhibition, from September 20 to October 13,
Internet surfers can take a tour of the exhibition on-line at the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the
State Council recently issued a circular demanding the country's
western areas to give priority to the protection of cultural
heritage while carrying out development of the vast region.
</P>
<P>
The western region is a major source of Chinese civilization,
as different local ethnic groups have jointly created splendid
ancient culture, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The general office urged the protection of local cultural
relics, which are historical evidence of the development of the
region by local people, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and departments concerned are obliged to
protect relics and should work out plans on the issue, it said.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged people to find a balance between the
protection of cultural heritage in the region and the development
of the local economy. Local government departments in charge of
cultural heritage need to accelerate the investigation on local
cultural heritage and the drawing of maps on local relics, it said.
</P>
<P>
The protection of cultural heritage should be combined with
current efforts to improve the local environment by returning
farmland to forests and grassland, it said.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the building of museums in an effort to educate
the public on cultural heritage and to use local relics for the
development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Cultural relics in religious or ancient sites and buildings
should be protected, the circular said. It stressed the importance
of fostering more professionals for the protection of cultural
heritage and cracking down on illegal excavation, stealing,
illegal trading and smuggling of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Issues Facing Giant Pandas Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Many problems facing the
endangered giant pandas are yet to be solved despite the
remarkable progress China has made in protecting the animal, an
audience at a seminar was told today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yucun, director of the Fuzhou Giant Panda Research Center
in the capital of Fujian Province, said that during the past five
decades much emphasis has been placed on breeding and insufficient
attention has been paid to research on feeding of the animal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meeting of the China Association of
Sciences and Technology in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, Chen said 280
giant pandas have been bred through artificial breeding, of which
only 59 survived three years after birth.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the following questions have been answered
satisfactorily in giant panda breeding: advanced and reliable
ovulation monitoring method, the best temperature for giant panda'
s semen, and pregnancy diagnosis technique.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who was involved in the protection of relocated giant
pandas in south China, has discovered the ingredients of the
animal's milk.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been very successful in terms of breeding baby
giant pandas due to a lack of in-depth research on nutrition and
antibodies for the animal."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no single completely artificially bred giant panda
has survived two years after their birth, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to set up a blood bank for giant pandas and
develop bacteria for the animal."
</P>
<P>
He said a national committee should be set up to coordinate
national efforts to protect the giant panda, and more efforts
should be made to solve the problems facing the animal.
</P>
<P>
More funding support and researchers are needed to maintain
China's position in giant pandas' protection and research.
</P>
<P>
China is home to about 1,000 wild giant pandas.

BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Public
Security announced today that beginning October 1, the police will
replace their current uniforms, which were first worn in 1989,
with new ones.
</P>
<P>
The new police uniforms, dubbed "Style-99", will first be used
by police officers in big cities across the country, according to
a news conference held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese police have changed their uniforms seven times over
the past five decades and the "Style-99" uniforms are said to have
changed a lot in color, pattern, function and other aspects.
</P>
<P>
The deep-blue color of the latest police uniforms is the
mainstream color for police in most countries, which is quite
different from army uniforms.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, police units in different parts of
the country will wear uniforms made from different materials in
accordance with local financial conditions.

<HEADLINE> Iran Owes Improved Defense Capabilities to War-Time Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran owes the improvements in
its defense capabilities to the experience it gained during the
1980-1988 war against Iraq, according to a statement issued by the
Defense Ministry on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Honorable and interesting achievements in Iran's defense
industry are the results of its war-time experience," said the
statement, which was issued to mark the 20th anniversary of the
start of the bloody war.
</P>
<P>
The bitter eight-year war left some 1 million people dead and
caused severe economic damage to both countries, but it also made
Iran decide to implement a drive for self-sufficiency in weapons
manufacture, Iranian military officers have also said recently.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, Iran's military will launch a
series of activities in the next few days to mark the war against
neighboring Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The navy announced on Monday that it was about to launch a mini
vessel which will function both as a rocket-launcher and a
destroyer. More than 70 percent of the body of the vessel was built
by Iranian experts.
</P>
<P>
It has also announced it will hold five days of maneuvers in the
Persian Gulf starting Sunday, the Islamic Republic News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The Basij voluntary forces have also announced to hold maneuvers
on Thursday in a province bordering Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's armed forces will stage a military parade in
Tehran on Thursday to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years have passed since the end of the war, but many
differences are still blocking the two countries from normalizing
their relations.
</P>
<P>
The fate of prisoners of war and the alleged support for each
other's opposition groups are the two thorniest issues between the
two neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Asia Remains OPEC's Crucial Market: Secretary General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Rilwanu
Lukman considered here Wednesday that the Asian region remains a
crucial market for the OPEC, accounting for around a quarter of
world oil consumption.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Asia demand for oil has now risen again due
to the rapid economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
"With the Asian recovery in place, it is worth nothing that the
longer-term prospects for Asian energy demand look good,
considering that the region's per capita energy consumption is
well below that of the industrialized countries," Lukman said when
addressing the Second Annual International Business Forum for the
Asia Pacific and Indonesian Oil, Gas and Energy Sectors in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The four-day international forum started Tuesday and is being
attended by participants from OPEC member countries and several
non-OPEC countries in Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for a rapid increase in energy demand, therefore,
remains high," Lukman added.
</P>
<P>
This is reinforced by OPEC figures that show that the Asia-
Pacific region is expected to achieve gross domestic product (GDP)
growth of 5.2 percent this year, Lukman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with investment, Lukman said that OPEC
members in particular those from the Middle East have demonstrated
an increased willingness to invest further in Asia. "Substantial
opportunities do exist in the development of the oil and gas
potential within the Asian region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that OPEC's commitment to the Asian region has
become more focused with an awareness that the regional economies
remain an integral part of world markets and will continue to
absorb a large proportion of incremental energy demand in the
testing years ahead.
</P>
<P>
"The organization's (OPEC) member countries will continue to
have a high profile in the region and will strive to bring about a
level of oil price that will allow the countries of the region to
fuel their expansion plans, without harming their economies,"
Lukman said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Crisis Speeds up Natural Resource Degradation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's State Minister of
Environment A. Sonny Keraf said here Wednesday that the financial
and economic crisis in the country have caused acceleration of
natural resource depletion and degradation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Second Annual International Business Forum for
the Asia Pacific and Indonesian Oil, Gas and Energy Sectors, Keraf
said that "Indonesia has been experiencing its most severe
economic and financial crisis since middle of 1997. The rate of
poverty increased from 11 percent in 1996 to 14-20 percent in 1998
and the percentage is still increasing up to now."
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has resulted in increasing unemployment, inflation,
loss of purchasing power, and aggravated social instability. This
macroeconomic instability has led to undesirable environment
consequences such as encroachment into protected areas, illegal
logging, illegal mining, land tenure disputes etc," he said,
adding that "these activities have caused acceleration of natural
resource depletion and degradation."
</P>
<P>
Keraf said that local community participation is one of the
main principles for achieving successful environmental management
and sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that oil and gas energy industries in the country
could become pioneers in implementing the concept of sustainable
development, "so that the company contributes not only to economic
but also to social welfare, and environmental protection."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Myanmar Increases Sharply in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
totaled 74.125 million U.S. dollars in the first six months of
this year, increasing by 526.9 percent from the same period of
1999 when it registered at 11.823 million dollars, according to
the latest figures issued by the country's Central Statistical
Organization (CSO).
</P>
<P>
The sharp jump of the investment attributed to South Korea's
major engagement in a single project alone in last June with 26.1
million dollars. Total investment made by South Korea during the
half-year period stood the leading position with 31.71 million
dollars in four projects.
</P>
<P>
These were followed by five other countries and regions with
Canada injecting in 21.45 million dollars, Malaysia 9.832 million
dollars, China's Hong Kong 5.271 million dollars, Cyprus 5.25
million dollars and the United Kingdom 612,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The investment covered three sectors with 52.8 million dollars
in oil and gas, the largest investment by sector, followed by 20.
713 million dollars in manufacturing and 612,000 dollars in mining.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in foreign investment in Myanmar came at a
time when the investment was picking up since last year following
the past two consecutive years' fall in the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in 1999, Myanmar absorbed a
total of 50.118 million dollars' foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar opened to such investment in late 1988, the
country had drawn from 25 countries and regions a total of 7.174
billion dollars as of the end of June this year.

<HEADLINE> Fioravanti Doubles up Gold for Italy in Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Domenico Fioravanti of Italy
became the first man in Olympic history to win both men's
breaststroke events at the same Games when he won the 200m
breaststroke Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
After earning Italy's first-ever swimming Olympic gold on
Sunday in the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1:00.
46, Fioravanti captured the other breaststroke title, winning the
200m distance in a personal best of 2:10.87. He now owns both of
Italy's Olympic swimming gold medals.
</P>
<P>
South African national champion Terence Parkin took the silver
medal in a new national record time of 2:12.50 with Italian Davide
Rummolo winning bronze in a personal best time of 2:12.73.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure I was 100 percent, but instead it went well,"
said the Italian champion after the medal-awarding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It was good," said Parkin, "I felt very comfortable. The last
turn I looked down the water and the last 50m I really went for it.
I had to swim hard. It's good for the team."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the first 50m, the field remained tight with only
0.4 separating them, but Fioravanti stamped his mark on the race
from there as he slowly began to pull away from the rest of the
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
At the half way mark, Ryan Mitchell of Australia trailed
Fioravanti by just 0.07 second, but faded as Fioravanti, taking
only 15 strokes per length, continued to move further ahead.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the third lap, Fioravanti was over a half body
length ahead of the field. He continued to pull away in the final
lap and touched the wall ahead of Parkin by 1.63 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Rummolo said on his bronze medal that "I didn't feel I had any
limits, and It's okay (for bronze) as I was a little bit tired
before the race. You know I did 2x200m races (200m breaststroke
heat and semifinal) before and to be in the final was unimaginable
for me."
</P>
<P>
Regan Harrison of Australia finished fourth, saying "I have
done my best. I did my personal best by one second, which is
exactly what I wanted, I couldn't have asked for more than that."

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Dutch wonder boy Pieter van
den Hoogenband dethroned Alexander Popov as Olympic 100m freestyle
king on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Michael Klim took the early lead at the turn but the
Dutchman overtook him with 15 meters to go and touched the pad in
48.30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Two-time defending champion Popov took the silver in 48.69,
while American Gary Hall, who finished second to Popov over both
50m and 100m at the Atlanta Olympics, landed the bronze in 48.73.
</P>
<P>
Klim faded in the last meters to finish fourth.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband, who broke Australian Ian Thorpe's 200m
freestyle world record on Sunday and leveled it in winning the
title on Monday, erased the 100m freestyle world record with a
time of 47.84 in Tuesday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Jenny Thompson anchored the American quartet to the women's 4x
200m freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
It was her seventh Olympic gold medal, the most achieved by a
woman swimmer.
</P>
<P>
American Misty Hyman beat Australian Susan O'Neill in the
women's 200m butterfly final, clocking 2:05.88.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill took the silver in 2:06.58 and Petria Thomas of
Australia the bronze in 2:07.12.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Domenico Fioravanti won his second gold when he came
first in the 200m breaststroke final.
</P>
<P>
Fioravanti, the 100m breaststroke champion on Monday, timed 2:
10.87 seconds to beat South African Terence Parkin, who got the
silver in 2:12.50.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women's Soccer Team Crashed out of Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's soccer
team, which has been tipped as one of the favourites to win the
Olympic gold medal, crashed out of the games with a 2-1 loss to
Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An opportunist strike from substitute Margunn Haugenes sealed
the victory for the Norwegians.
</P>
<P>
Haugenes' curling shot into the top corner of Gao Hong's goal
in the 78th minute clinched the win for Norway, who now advance to
the semi-finals to face Germany.
</P>
<P>
Excellent work by goalkeepers Bente Nordby of Norway and Gao
Hong kept both sides from scoring until the 55th minute when a
cross by Hege Riise allowed Marianne Pettersen to neatly head the
ball into the net for Norway.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team was revitalized then, and sped up their
attacks. 20 minutes later, a handball by Norway's captain Goeril
Kringen provided CHina with a penalty kick from which Sun Wen
netted to level the score.
</P>
<P>
Norway's key striker Dagny Mellgren was replaced by midfielder
Haugenes in the second half and the substitution paid off with
Haugenes scoring the winning goal for Norway with a delicate chip
into the top right hand corner in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
China applied pressure in the last 15 minutes but was unable to
break the Norwegian defence.
</P>
<P>
After the match, Norwegian coach said he had predicted that
they would take the win. "I had a feeling about this match. I
wanted to gain revenge for the loss in the World Cup last year."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Ma Yuan'an said he had nothing to complain. "Both
teams played well. I have no criticisms of my players. Norway was
very strong in the air and had some good luck. That is what made
the difference."
</P>
<P>
He added that he would accept the responsibility for the loss.
</P>
<P>
The United States, led by the inspirational Mia Hamm, had an
easier task and defeated the Africans with goals from Brandi
Chastain on 26 minutes and Kristine Lilly on 35 minutes. Shannon
MacMillan scored the United States third while Mercy Akide bagged
a consolation strike for Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The US women will now play Brazil in the semi-finals.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The American women outpaced
their Australian chief rivals to take the 4x200m freestyle relay
gold medal at the Olympic Games here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet composed of Samantha Arsenault, Diana Munz,
Lindsay Benko and Jenny Thompson, clocked in 7:57.80 to beat their
own Olympic record of 7:59.87 set in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty sweet," said Thompson, who has never won an
Olympic individual gold, "It was pretty nervewracking because it
was neck and neck. I saw her (Petria Thomas), and just put my
head down in the last 25 meters."
</P>
<P>
The Australians of Susie O'Neill, Giaan Rooney, Kirsten Thomson
and Petria Thomas, led three legs before being overtook in the
final by American Thompson, finishing in second in 7:58.52, also
within the original Olympic mark.
</P>
<P>
Australian Thomas said that "it was pretty exciting. It's great
to be competing with these girls. I am very happy as we all put
our best in, and it's great to come in with a silver."
</P>
<P>
O'Neill, who swam the first leg in 1:58.70 for Australia, said
that "You always like to win. We're really stoked, it's the
fastest time Australia has ever done. You can't win everything,
that's what it's about, winning sometimes and not winning always."
</P>
<P>
The bronze medal went to Germany in 7:58.64.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Welcomes Granting China PNTR Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Wednesday that he welcomed the U.S. Senate's decision to
grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
"The granting of PNTR status by the U.S. to China augurs well
for Sino-U.S. relations. Hong Kong will obviously stand to benefit
from a good and stable relationship between our two largest
trading partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that China's WTO membership will benefit Hong Kong,
Asia and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"It will bring both opportunities and challenges to Hong Kong.
We believe that Hong Kong will stand to benefit substantially from
the new business opportunities. We are also confident that Hong
Kong people will be able to overcome the challenges," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the way is now clear for President Clinton to sign
the bill into law. I hope this will happen very soon.
</P>
<P>
"The scene is set for China to complete accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO). I hope the accession process in Geneva
will also be concluded soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Industry Chau Tak Hay also
welcomed the passage by the United States Senate.
</P>
<P>
Chau voiced the hope that the PNTR bill will be signed into law
by the U.S. President as soon as possible, thus removing the
uncertainty which accompanies the annual exercise to renew China's
PNTR status in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"The mainland and the United States are Hong Kong's two largest
trading partners. A stable trading relationship between them is
therefore extremely important to Hong Kong," he said.

<HEADLINE> Anti-drug Education Not Sufficient in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only one respondent had visited the narcotics control education
base in Beijing and none of the respondents had received anti-drug
education during their school days.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that traditional narcotics control
education is not efficient enough for the jobless and self-
employed people, who are easy targets of narcotics simply because
they seldom watch TV, listen to radio or read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, experts in Beijing said narcotics control education
during school should be strengthened, and special education for
jobless and self-employed people should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
China now faces a grim drug situation, with a registered drug
user population of over 680,000 at the end of 1999. Eighty percent
were male addicts, 78 percent between the ages of 17 and 35, and
more than 490,000 took heroin.

BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Anti-drug education in
Beijing, the Chinese capital, is still not sufficient, according
to the latest survey sponsored by the Public Security Bureau of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Of the 200 respondents from a drug rehabilitation center
affiliated to the bureau, 143 began using drugs for the novelty
and 107 respondents did nt know much about the grave consequences
of narcotics before their first drug experience.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that the novelty and ignorance about
narcotics among many respondents shows that the anti-drug
education is still not effective.
</P>
<P>
The 200 respondents were randomly selected among the
rehabilitation center's 800 heroin users.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 44 respondents knew something about
narcotics through watching TV, listening to radio programs, or
reading newspapers, while 28 respondents visited China's first
National Anti-drug Exhibition in 1998.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Crude oil Reserve Expected to Last for About 80 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil reserves of the
OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) now is
standing at around 800 billion barrels and are expected to last
for about 80 years, Secretary General of the organization Rilwanu
Lukman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Compare this, with non-OPEC production and we see that their
reserves could be depleted in less than 20 years. Moreover non-
OPEC oil producers are currently operating at full capacity. They
only hold some 23 percent of the world's proven crude oil reserves,
yet account for 60 percent of global production," Lukman said when
addressing the Second Annual International Business Forum for the
Asia Pacific and Indonesian Oil, Gas and Energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
The four days international forum was opened on Tuesday and
attended by participants from OPEC member countries and several
non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the OPEC holds over 75 percent of the world's
proven crude oil reserves and produces more than 40 percent of
global crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Lukman further said that the world oil demand will rise from
around 73 million barrels per day (bpd) in 1998 to some 76 million
bpd this year. "Over the following decade, the world's thirst for
oil is estimated to rise by a further 14 million bpd to over 90
million bpd and will reach an estimated 103 million bpd in 2020,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"With non-OPEC oil production in the first two decades of the
21st century forecast to most likely remain relatively stable at
around 49 million bpd, OPEC member countries should take the lion'
s share of incremental demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that while oil demand is forecast to continue
to rise in absolute terms throughout this period, its share of
world energy demand is expected to fall from around 41 percent in
2000, to 38 percent in 2020, adding that conversely, gas, which is
also an important export for some OPEC member countries, will see
its share rise from just over 22 percent in 2000, to nearly 27
percent in 2020.
</P>
<P>
Lukman also said that while prospects for continued growth in
non-OPEC supply do exist, especially through the application of
advanced recovery techniques, there is considerable uncertainty as
to the extent of this, and how long it may persist in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
"Growth will be governed largely by the future evolution of oil
and other energy prices, coupled with the level of incentives that
producers will introduce to stimulate exploration and production
activities, and technology," Lukman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with the oil price, Lukman said that
the OPEC suggested the industrialized nations particularly those
in Europe to cut their oil tax to help stabilize current high
prices of fuel oil, citing that high crude oil prices which
currently average more than 30 U.S. dollars per barrel have caused
crisis in a number of industrialized countries in Europe as their
oil tax represents more than 75 percent of the prices.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sailing Competition Gets Way with Wind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic sailing regatta
finally got its way into full action Wednesday as the wind began
to blow hard and several classes were able to begin their
competitions.
</P>
<P>
The first three days of the sailing regatta were plagued by
postponements because of the gentle conditions in and around
Sydney Harbour.
</P>
<P>
Robert Scheidt of Brazil and Ben Ainslie of Britain set the
early pace in the Open Laser event, the biggest fleet with 43
boats.
</P>
<P>
Ainslie recovered from a poor 23rd in the opening race, which
Scheidt won, to take the second leg.
</P>
<P>
The opening races of the women's 470 class were tight affairs
with a large group bunched at the top of the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
United States pair JJ Isler and Pease Glaser finished just
ahead of the Italian, German and Greek crews.
</P>
<P>
The men's 470 was dominated by the Portuguese duo Alvaro
Marinho and Miguel Nunes, who finished more than a minute ahead of
the fleet in race one, and were fourth in the next race won by
Australia, to lead overall.
</P>
<P>
But the big names struggled in the women's Europe category -
1996 gold medallist Margriet Matthysse of the Netherlands
finishing 24th in the second race and the fancied Dane Kristine
Roug placed just 12th overall.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Shirley Robertson leads ahead of Sari Multala from
Finland and Spain's Neus Garriga.
</P>
<P>
After five of the scheduled 16 races in the open 49er regatta,
German pair Marcus Baur and Phillip Barth retained the overall
lead ahead of US brothers Jonathon and Charles McKee and the
Finnish duo Thomas Johanson and Jyrki Jarvi.
</P>
<P>
But positions could be revised as 13 protests to consider.
</P>
<P>
Australian medal hope Lars Kleppich climbed into third on the
leaderboard in the men's Mistral with victory in race six, after
struggling in 17th place earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Christoph Sieber remained overall leader ahead of
Spain's Carlos Espinola by winning race five.
</P>
<P>
In the women's Mistral Amelie Lux of Germany still led
Wednesday though her closest rivals Italy's Alessandra Sensini and
Barbara Kendall of New Zealand won the day's two races.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Lee Lai-shan of Hong Kong, China had her
worst race of the series in heat five finishing 17th.
</P>
<P>
There are 11 sailing events in nine classes in the Olympic
regatta - 49er, 470, Europe, Finn, Laser, Mistral, Soling, Star
and Tornado.
</P>
<P>
Most of these events will be on a fleet base with all boats
competing against each other in a mass field.
</P>
<P>
But Soling the early rounds is reduced to a match-racing series
to determine the medal positions.

<HEADLINE> Van den Hoogenband Beats Popov for Men's 100m Freestyle Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Pieter van den Hoogenband of
the Netherlands continued his gold medal winning form at the
Sydney Olympic Games on Wednesday with a great win in the men's
100m freestyle final, beating the Russian sprint king Alexander
Popov.
</P>
<P>
His winning time of 48.30, however, was below that of the 47.84
he swam when he smashed the world record for the event in his semi-
final effort.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband had a slow start in the final and turned
third at the 50m mark. But he raised a late surge by the 1992 and
1996 Olympic champion Popov to win his second gold medal for the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I am a little bit tired today. I am very happy, and I am
still dreaming, I don't know what I am doing right now. It was a
very tough race, I had to swim very fast to win the medal," said
Hoogenband.
</P>
<P>
Popov, the only swimmer in the race wearing a regular swim suit,
had one of the slowest first 50ms in the field and was back in
sixth place at the halfway point. He edged closer to the Dutchman
with 25m to go, but was unable to get past van den Hoogenband,
finishing 0.39 seconds behind in 48.69.
</P>
<P>
"I am enjoying myself and I compete with a smile on my face,"
said Popov.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Michael Klim, who held the previous world record of
48.18 for just 72 hours, had the lead early in the race but was
unable to hang on to the bronze medal. It went instead to Atlanta
1996 silver medalist Gary Hall of the United States, who touched
the wall one hundredth of a second ahead in 48.73.
</P>
<P>
Popov will have another chance to make history and becomes the
first man to win the same event at three consecutive Olympic Games
in the 50m freestyle, the heats of which begins Thursday.

SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's soccer
team, which has been tipped as one of the favourites to win the
Olympic gold medal, crashed out of the games with a 2-1 loss to
Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An opportunist strike from substitute Margunn Haugenes sealed
the victory for the Norwegians.
</P>
<P>

in the 78th minute clinched the win for Norway, who now advance to
the semi-finals to face Germany.

MacMillan scored the United States third while Mercy Akide bagged
a consolation strike for Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Second-Phase Construction of Tianwan Nuclear Station Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Construction of two nuclear
generators at the Tianwan Nuclear Power Station, the largest
cooperation project between China and Russia, began today in
Lianyungang, a coastal city in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the first two units, the first phase of the
project, with a total cost of approximately 26 billion yuan (over
three billion U.S. dollars), started last October and is scheduled
to finish in 2004. The other two units, the second-phase
construction , which began today, are expected to be put into
operation in 2005.
</P>
<P>
These four pressurized water reactor nuclear power generators,
each with a generating capacity of one million kilowatts, will
help improve China's energy structure and accelerate the national
economic growth. The Tianwan Nuclear Power Station is expected to
become China's key power supply center in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Purchase contracts worth over 300 million U.S. dollars have
been signed between China and companies from Germany, France and
the United States, amongst others. Technicians at the power
station have been sent abroad for training.
</P>
<P>
China now has four nuclear power projects under construction.
The other three are the second and third phases of the Qinshan
Nuclear Power Station in east China's Zhejiang Province and the
Ling'ao Nuclear Power Station in south China's Guangdong Province.

</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, the country's
investment in the real estate sector totaled 241.34 billion yuan (
about 29 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 24.3 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A sales growth has driven up the price level. In the first
eight months of this year, the average price of commodity houses
rose 1.9 percent to 2,072 yuan per square meter.
</P>
<P>
The average price for residential houses were 1,923 yuan per

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Expands Cooperation with Friendship Cities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 20 (Xinhua)-- As part of China's reforms
and opening up drive, many big Chinese cities have established and
strengthened friendship with foreign cities. Taking advantage of
its geographic superiority, Shanghai, a port city and industrial
center in East China, has been outstanding in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Yokohama of Japan became Shanghai's first sister city in 1973.
Up to now, Shanghai has set up friendly ties with 47 provinces,
cities, and states of 39 countries in the world. Over the past 20
years, Shanghai has benefited a lot from the contacts and
exchanges with its sister cities.
</P>
<P>
A number of projects in housing renovation, a tunnel through
the Huangpu River, urban transport infrastructure, flood
prevention facilities, port construction, and the landscape in the
city, are all achievements which more or less resulted from the
cooperation with friendship cities.
</P>
<P>
A successful case has been the cooperation with Rotterdam of
Holland. Experts from Rotterdam started to do research studies for
the reconstruction of two communities in downtown Shanghai in 1985.
Introducing the design and technology from Holland, the
reconstruction has noticeably improved the housing conditions of
the residents in the two areas, and protected the previous style
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
That has left some precious experience for the local
reconstruction departments and companies in housing reconstruction.

<P>
In another case, Shanghai and Montreal of Canada have conducted
successful cooperation in urban facelifting. The two cities have
jointly built a garden of Chinese style in Montreal and a "
Montreal High Technology Exhibition Hall" in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the attractive gains and mutual benefit from the
exchange and cooperation, Shanghai widened the bilateral
cooperation with its foreign counterparts, especially in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The contacts and exchange have also contributed greatly to the
growth of economic and trade relations between Shanghai and its
sister cities.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Hamburg of Germany by the then mayor of Shanghai
Huang Ju in 1994 forcefully pushed forward the economic ties
between Shanghai and Germany. Attending the "Shanghai Technology
Exhibition and Trade Fair" in Hamburg then, Huang made wide
contacts with German entrepreneurs and people from the science and
technology circles.
</P>
<P>
After that, the economic and trade relations between Shanghai
and Germany grew rapidly. Now Germany stands at the fifth among
the overseas investors in Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
In June this year, Shanghai Automobile Industry Corporation,
Volvo Bus Corporation, and Volvo China Limited signed an agreement
to build the China-Sweden Shanghai Sunwin Bus Corporation, with a
total investment of 97 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, a result of the cooperation between Shanghai
and its friendship cities, is expected to produce 2,000 high-
quality buses annually.
</P>
<P>
The local cultural market has also benefited from the exchange
with foreign cities. Residents in Shanghai now have all the more
opportunities to enjoy foreign performances without going abroad.
And local performance groups also have a lot more opportunities to
show their exquisite skills to foreign audiences.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Shanghai International Television Festival
derived from the Shanghai International Friendship Cities
Television Festival in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Rationing to Relax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Power and Lighting
company, the country's sole electricity supplier, has been
directed to draw a new program to reduce the current power
rationing nationwide, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The direction followed a meeting of power sector stakeholders
which concluded that independent power producers and emergency
power generators commissioned recently had improved electricity
supply to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
Due to a prolonged drought and the low water levels of
reservoirs causing poor hydropower generation, Kenya introduced
power rationing last September and intensified the rationing in
June this year, greatly affecting the country's economic
development and the daily livelihood of residents.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held at the Energy Ministry headquarters here,
Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia said one producer, Agreko of
Britain, has already connected to the national grid 45 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
He said Iberafrica, an existing independent power producer
operating in the south of the capital Nairobi, is expected to
supply an extra 12 megawatts by October 12, and the steam turbine
under repairing at a plant will start generating electricity of 30
megawatts on October 30.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, another two World Bank-funded
emergency power generators, operated by Cummins of the United
States and Deutz of Germany respectively, will come on stream by
the second half of October with the capacity of 30 megawatts for
each.
</P>
<P>
Besides, weather experts are forecasting that the country's
main catchment area for hydropower generation would receive good
rains in the next four month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The short rain season in this east African country is expected
to start in the third or fourth week of next month.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs 600 Million U.S. Dollars for Urban Water Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A capital investment of 600
million U.S. dollars is required for the next 15 years to
implement the urban water sector reform in Uganda, the Monitor
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Only 30 percent of the urban population have access to safe
piped water, the newspaper quoted Minister of Water, Lands and
Environment Henry Muganwa Kajura as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Only 12 towns out of 78 in Uganda have piped sewerage systems,
less than 10 percent of the population in these towns are
connected to the sewerage systems and the general sanitation
situation is also very unsatisfactory," Kajura said.
</P>
<P>
He said targets have now been set to provide safe water and
appropriate sanitation facilities to 100 percent of the population
in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a restructured National Water and
Sewerage Corporation has been proposed to form an alliance with
one or two private operators to form a single legal entity called
the Urban Water Alliance to manage all 78 towns.
</P>
<P>
The second alternative proposal is that smaller towns be
managed by the local government and water and sanitation service
authorities.

<HEADLINE> Urrutia Makes Olympic History for Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- It has been 68 years since
Colombian athletes made their debut at the Los Angeles Olympic
Games in 1932, but it is not until the end of the century could
they return home with a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
On September 20, 2000 in Sydney, Maria Isabel Urrutia lifted
the country's first-ever Olympic gold in history in the 75kg
category at the 27th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old veteran, who won a silver medal in the 1989
World Championships, snatched 110kg and jerked 135kg for a total
of 245kg, winning the gold on body-weight.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Ogbeifo of Nigeria and Kuo Yi-Hang both also lifted a
total of 245kg, but finished second and third respectively because
of heavier body weight.
</P>
<P>
Urrutia contributed her gold medal to her mother because she
was praying for her thousands of miles away during the competition.
</P>
<P>
"The first person who came to my mind after the win was my
mother who has always looked out for me," she said. "I called her
just before the competition and she said she would be praying for
my success."
</P>
<P>
Colombia won two silvers from shooting and four bronzes in
their previous 15 Olympic appearances. Urrutia admitted that the
gold medal was right beyond her expectation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be Columbia's first Olympic gold medalist.
It's a huge responsibility to come here to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
"I would have been very happy to finish anywhere in the top
three. I was excited to be given the opportunity to win the gold
medal."
</P>
<P>
But there should have been no surprise for her to win a medal
of other colors because she has been in the top three for quite a
few years and competed in 11 world championships and has held
three world records.
</P>
<P>
"I have worked very hard in preparing for the Olympics," she
said. "I started to prepare several years ago after the sport
became a medal event in the Olympics. I spent four months training
in Bulgaria."
</P>
<P>
Urrutia, who has won nine world gold medals in higher
categories, said in order to compete in the lower category, she
has lost more than 10kg.
</P>
<P>
"I lost 10kg to do compete in the low division. But I have
fulfilled all my dreams. Many people do not think I can win but
others gave me strong support, I thank all the Columbians who gave
support."
</P>
<P>
To shouts of "viva Colombia", she beamed brightly and presented
his gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is just a beginning," she said. "There will more
gold medals in the future."

SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea claimed its first
Olympic fencing gold medal through Kim Young-ho, who defeated Ralf
Bissdorf of Germany 15-14 in men's individual foil final Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Chevchenko of Russia beat France's Jean-Noel Ferrari 15-

three world championships and most world titles since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Golubytsky has not been able to carry that success into the

SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- World's fastest man Maurice
Greene of the United States on Wednesday said that all athletes
should be blood tested ahead of Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Greene, the 100 meters world record-holder who begins his
campaign to add the Olympic title to his world 100m championship
here on Friday, welcomed the introduction of more stringent dope
testing, including new blood tests for the stamina-boosting drug
EPO.
</P>
<P>
"They should have taken every single athlete's blood when they
turned up for the Games," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
Greene said that new drug testing rules were already working.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is making our sport a lot better this year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
EPO use was believed to be widespread among endurance athletes,
especially after discoveries of large quantities of the drug in
possession of cycle teams competing at the 1998 Tour de France.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Bid Farewell to Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua)-- Beijing is planning to rebuild
the Guanting Reservoir into its second largest water source, after
the Miyun Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Guanting Reservoir's storing capacity will reach 4.16 billion
cubic meters when the project is completed.
</P>
<P>
It is one of Beijing's 26 measures to solve the problem of
water shortages this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital will use recycled water and river water to
irrigate crops and trees. Rice field acreage will be reduced to
grow other crops that consume less water.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that these measures will save 38 million cubic
meters of water this year.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government will also deliver 2.5 million water-
saving faucets to local households and close illegal car wash
sites and bathing centers that waste water.
</P>
<P>
The city has set the water consumption limit between five and
eight cubic meters per month for each household, and higher price
will be charged for extra consumption.
</P>
<P>
Beijing used to be rich in water resources, but now with a
population of 12.8 million there is only 300 cubic meters per
person, or about 3 percent of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
Last year, for the first time water reserves in the city's 16
large reservoirs did not meet demand. Underground water levels
also dropped 2.35 meters below the 1998 level, the worst level in
the 1990s, statistics showed.

He said that since 1998, China has issued 360 billion yuan in
treasury bonds. The money was mainly used to build infrastructure
projects in areas of water conservancy, transportation and power;
to support technological advancement in enterprises; to increase
investment in an ambitious national program to develop China's
western areas as well as biological and environmental construction;
and to increase input in education, scientific and technological
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the central bank has lowered deposit and loan
interest rates for seven times, exploited many monetary policy
tools and appropriately increased money supply to motivate social
investment, which gave a powerful drive to the country's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attention was also paid to coordinated expansion of
investment demand, readjustment of income distribution policies
and kick-start of consumption demand, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1999, while continuing to expand investment in fixed assets,
China implemented a series of policy measures including wage
increases, timely compensation for laid-off workers, pensions for
the retirees and increases in farmers' incomes, in order to
readjust income distribution and encourage consumption.
</P>
<P>
"These measures effectively boosted consumption and spending,
resulting in a condition of driving up the economic growth by both
investment and consumption," he said.
</P>
<P>
While expanding domestic demand, China has adopted effective
measures to boost export, including the improvement of export tax
rebate policies, raising export tax rebate rates, expanding the
foreign trade rights of productive enterprises, improving export
credit insurance mechanisms and increasing banks' support to
foreign trade enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that another focus of the macro-economic control
policies is accelerating structural readjustment, which includes
readjusting agricultural planting structure, increasing investment
in infrastructure, guiding enterprises to increase input in
technological upgrading, supporting medium- and small-sized
enterprises and promoting the development of China's western areas.

<P>
Judging from present conditions, most of the macro-economic
control targets in the Ninth Five-Year Plan will be reached, Zeng
said.
</P>
<P>
During the five years, the annual average growth of GDP was
approximately eight percent, with the natural population growth
rate being lower than 10 per thousand. This year, China's per-
capita GDP is expected to exceed 850 U.S. dollars. Total foreign
trade volume will surpass 400 billion U.S. dollars and foreign
exchange reserves will double that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the registered unemployment rate in
urban areas will be lower than four percent, poverty continues to
decrease and the State's poverty-relief plan will be realized by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"From the practices in recent years, we not only have had
successful experiences in controlling inflation, but also found
some effective measures in expanding domestic demand, promoting
economic growth and prohibiting the tendency of deflation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these comprehensive macro-economic control
measures have largely enriched China's macro-economic control
policies, gradually formed a comparatively complete macro-economic
control policy system and provided a guarantee for sustained, fast
and healthy development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts New Deposit Interest Rates for Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China will adopt a new
deposit interest rate system for deposits in major hard currencies
as of tomorrow, Jiang Jianqing, president of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Amounts below 3 million U.S. dollars are accepted for the
interest rate, in mainly the U.S. dollar, British pound, euro,
Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Hong Kong dollar,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The significant move aims to prepare the banking industry for
more challenges after China enters the World Trade Organization
and promote the industry to open wider to the outside world," said
Jiang, who is also chairman of the China Association of Banks (
CAOB).
</P>
<P>
New deposit interest rates for the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen,
euro, Canadian dollar and Swiss Franc will be higher than previous
interest rates, while those for the Hong Kong dollar and British
pound will be slightly lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
Take one-year deposit for example, the interest rate for U.S.
dollar rose from 5 percent to 5.5 percent; euro up from 3 percent
to 3.6875; Japanese yen up from 0.0215 to 0.1465; while the
deposit interest rate for Hong Kong dollar down from 5.5 percent
to 5.3125.
</P>
<P>
Deposit interest rates for major hard currencies will be
designated by the China Association of Banks at a "unified" rate
to be carried out by all financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, the deposit interest rate for a hard currency
equivalent to three million U.S. dollars or over will be decided
through negotiations between financial institutions and their
clients.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the deposit interest rate was designated by the
Bank of China. After the reform, commercial banks are now able to

<HEADLINE> China's Macro-Economic Control Measures Pay Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
said that China's macro-economic control measures during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) have achieved prominent results,
with the national economy maintaining sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister of the State Development Planning
Commission, told Xinhua in an interview that during this period,
China implemented pro-active fiscal policies while firmly
expanding domestic demand. The country also successfully overcame
difficulties resulting from the Asian financial crisis and
accomplished major tasks set in the five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the successful implementation of macro-economic
control measures have created a beneficial environment for
promoting reforms, exploiting existing productive forces, easing
employment problems and protecting social stability.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the control of inflation was
the primary task of macro-economic control and high inflation was
effectively reined in to achieve a "soft landing", he said.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of the five-year period, China implemented
the pro-active fiscal policies, adopted a series of stable
monetary policies and effectively controlled a deflationary trend
by issuing treasury bonds, expanding investment and taking other
measures, thus sustaining the growth momentum of the national
economy.

BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a standing
committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), today met with a delegation
from the Association of the Democratic Party of Japan for Japan-
China in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, extended a warm welcome to the delegation headed by
Yokomichi Takahiro, deputy head of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Wei said China and Japan face each other across the sea and
they have every reason to be friendly with each other. The
statesmen for both countries should make efforts to avoid troubles
and push forward bilateral relations in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Democratic Party, and especially the party's
association for Japan-China in the 21st century, attaches great
importance to relations between the two countries and sticks to
the One-China Policy, Wei noted, expressing appreciation over this.
</P>
<P>
Wei said the three historic documents in bilateral relations,
namely, the China-Japan Joint Statement, China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty, and the China-Japan Joint Declaration have laid
a solid political foundation for bilateral relations.

China and Japan enjoy a long-term history of friendly contact

adding cooperation between governments, parties, parliaments, non-

trade contacts between the two countries are pillars of bilateral
relations.

<P>
A steady and ever growing friendship between China and Japan is
an important factor for safeguarding peace, stability and
prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, he
said.

should look for solutions with a spirit for seeking common ground
while persevering differences through friendly consultation.

Takahiro said Japan-China relations are of great importance to
the peace and development of the 21st century. The association for

stimulating bilateral relations as its major responsibility.

<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) --- The passage of Permanent
Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) by the US Senate will benefit both
the United States and China, said Joseph Prueher, US Ambassador to
China, here today.
</P>
<P>
The PNTR passage, he said, will hopefully ease the passage in
the Geneva process for China's WTO accession, which will give the
US access to the Chinese market. This, in turn, he said, will
accelerate the economic reform in China as well as China's
integration with the world's economic system.
</P>
<P>
Easing the annual discussion of what used to be the Most-
Favored-Nation, the ambassador said, will create a climate in
which China-U.S. economic environment will be more stable. It will
also lead to a more healthy and problem-solving environment where
some of the other issues not necessarily solved by the PNTR
passage can be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Two Rescued French Journalists Arrive in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Two French journalists
rescued Wednesday morning have arrived in the Philippine capital
of Manila from the southern island of Jolo where government troops
are pursuing the Abu Sayyaf group which is still holding 17
hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in the presidential palace, French
journalists Jean-Jacques Legarrec and Roland Madura held for more
than two months by the Abu Sayyaf described how they escaped from
their captors and were rescued by the Philippine military.
</P>
<P>
The two television journalists, appearing in the press
conference together with Philippine President Joseph Estrada, said
they took advantage of deep darkness Tuesday evening to escape
from the Muslim rebel group as it was rushing to cross a road.
</P>
<P>
"We hide for some minutes and after that we ran on the road.
We spent the night hiding in the jungle in case they would be
looking around for us," said Legarrec.
</P>
<P>
At dawn of Wednesday, Legarrec added, they flagged down a
military truck and were taken to a military camp. Later, they were
take from Jolo to Manila by plane.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf on July 9
when they came to interview other hostages taken by the extremist
group from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The rebels still hold an American, three Malaysians, a
Filipino kidnapped from Malaysian in April and 12 Filipino
Christian evangelists.
</P>
<P>
For his part, President Estrada said American hostage Jeffrey
Schilling had been spotted and government troops hoped to rescue
him later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the two journalists came after five days of
heavy fighting in Jolo which resulted in the deaths of four
civilians and six Abu Sayyaf rebels. The military has also
overrun three major Abu Sayyaf camps and some smaller hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said on Tuesday that he will immediately order a
ceasefire if the Abu Sayyaf release all its hostages.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had threatened to attack southern cities and behead
American hostage Schilling to retaliate for the military assault.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, a bomb exploded in a passenger ferry at
Zamboanga city, killing one person and injuring seven others.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members to Implement FTA Separately: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) will implement the
Free Trade Area (FTA) in four categories, the Post newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted COMESA public relations officer Mweusi
Karake as saying here on Tuesday that not all COMESA members
agreeing to participate the FTA will implement the trade policy by
the set date of October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries have applied or stated that they would
delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Karake, Namibia and Swaziland will be in group one
because they still have to complete negotiations with the Southern
Africa Customs Union where the two also hold membership apart from
being members of the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
Burundi and Seychelles, which are in group two, would implement
the FTA next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Burundi has pleaded to implement the FTA in January 2001
whereas Seychelles, a relatively new member (it joined the COMESA
in 1998), has set June 1, 2001 as the date on which it will
implement the FTA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, in group three with Uganda, was reportedly finalizing
compensation from the European Union supported Structural
Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
A COMESA mission led by secretary general Erastus Mwencha is
currently in Uganda where a study on the FTA has been instituted
but the date has not been set yet, Karake said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the failure by these states to implement the
FTA as scheduled would not impact negatively on the trade policy
adoption process because they have already adopted a reciprocal
approach where tariffs among members would be removed by the same
proportion.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA Trade and Customs Committee recently announced that
nine member states had reaffirmed that they would be part of the
founder members of the FTA on October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
All these countries, including Djibouti, Egypt, Kenya, Malawi,
Mauritius, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Zambia, had published
zero tariffs ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to meet again in November to review
progress in the implementation of the FTA, Karake said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Warns Potential Violence in Zanzibar Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) has warned of potential violence in Zanzibar
during and after the general elections to be held in October,
newspapers here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sam Ibok, OAU director for Political Affairs, was quoted as
saying on Tuesday that the language used by political leaders
could incite their followers to take actions that might threaten
peace, stability and security of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ibok, who is leading an OAU pre-assessment mission on Tanzanian
elections, said Tanzania is a heaven of peace with a democratic
government and there is no need to use abusive language that could
lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against campaigning on the basis of religion,
saying OAU experience in different countries in the continent
showed that a mixture of religion and politics usually led to bad
consequences, citing Somalia, Rwanda and Burundi as examples.
</P>
<P>
The OAU pre-assessment team was dispatched to Tanzania by OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim to evaluate the preparations
for the forthcoming general elections at the invitations of the
Tanzanian National Electoral Commission and the Zanzibar Electoral
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The OAU observers under former Nigerian President Shehu
Shaghari will arrive in Tanzania on October 19 and is expected to
stay until November 5, Ibok said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964. But with its own government and
parliament, it is a semi-autonomous region in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It will go to polls simultaneously with the mainland in the
second multi-party elections on October 29, choosing its own
president as well as a new leader of the Tanzanian union
government.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton indicated on Tuesday
that there should be no fuss about fluctuations in the Middle East
peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians as the process
has come down to difficult issues.
</P>

"They're down to difficult issues, and they're both feeling the
pressure of these hard issues and the press of time," Clinton said,
responding to a question on why Israel on Tuesday reversed a
decision to suspend talks with the Palestinians only one day after
it was announced. (US-Mideast Peace-Clinton)

<HEADLINE> Strike Continues in Los Angeles, Negotiation to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Both sides in the four-
day-old strike by 4,400 Los Angeles bus and train operators agreed
Tuesday to resume negotiation in a dispute that has left thousands
of the area's poorest residents pounding the pavement or
scrambling to find rides to work.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
and the United Transportation Union (UTU) agreed to begin formal
contract negotiations Wednesday, marking the first meeting between
the two sides since the strike started early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
For the past four days, traffic clogged city streets, freeway
traffic swelled five percent, commuter times in some areas doubled,
cab drivers worked overtime and MTA workers picketed in more than
a dozen locations.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 buses, plus 95 kilometers of light rail and subway
lines have been halted by the dispute that centers on MTA's desire
to require some drivers to work four, 10-hour work days a week and
cut overtime.
</P>
<P>
Union members contend that such a plan would mean a 15-percent
pay cut for its senior members.
</P>
<P>
The MTA said it faces a 438-million-dollar operating deficit
over the next 10 years if it doesn't cut costs or increase fares.
The MTA has offered 2.7 percent raises per year for three years,
but the unions want four percent per year.

<P>
TOKYO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply
almost across the board in Tokyo on Wednesday on growing views
that the market has bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared 334.12 points, or 2.07
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 16,458.31.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all

</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section expanded to 677.6 million shares
from Tuesday's 591.25 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
A rally in New York's Nasdaq composite index and relative

</P>
<P>
Major high-tech issues drew buying following the technology-
heavy Nasdaq's 139.12-point rebound overnight while the improved
market sentiment boosted brokerage issues.

Communications sector also gained after the Japanese government

<HEADLINE> Columbia's Urrutia Makes Olympic History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- It has been 68 years since
Colombian athletes made their debut at Olympic Games in Los
Angeles, but it is not until the end of the century could they
return home with a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
On September 20, 2000 in Sydney, Maria Isabel Urrutia lifted
the country's first-ever Olympic gold in history in the 75kg
category at the 27th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old veteran, who won a silver medal in the 1989
World Championships, snatched 110kg and jerked 135kg for a total
of 245kg, winning the gold on body-weight.
</P>
<P>
Ruth Ogbeifo of Nigeria and Kuo Yi-Hang both also lifted a
total of 245kg, but finished second and third respectively because
of heavier body weight.
</P>
<P>
Urrutia contributed her gold medal to her mother because she
was praying for her thousands of miles away during the competition.
</P>
<P>
"The first person who came to my mind after the win was my
mother who has always looked out for me," she said. "I called her
just before the competition and she said she would be praying for
my success."
</P>
<P>
Colombia won two silvers from shooting and four bronzes in
their previous 15 Olympic appearances. Urrutia admitted that the
gold medal was right beyond her expectation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy to be Columbia's first Olympic gold medalist.
It's a huge responsibility to come here to win a medal.
</P>
<P>
"I would have been very happy to finish anywhere in the top
three. I was excited to be given the opportunity to win the gold
medal."
</P>
<P>
But there should have been no surprise for her to win a medal
of other colors because she has been in the top three for quite a
few years and competed in 11 world championships and has held
three world records.
</P>
<P>
"I have worked very hard in preparing for the Olympics," she
said. "I started to prepare several years ago after the sport
became a medal event in the Olympics. I spent four months training
in Bulgaria."
</P>
<P>
Urrutia, who has won nine world gold medals in higher
categories, said in order to compete in the lower category, she
has lost more than 10kg.
</P>
<P>
"I lost 10kg to do compete in the low division. But I have
fulfilled all my dreams. Many people do not think I can win but
others gave me strong support, I thank all the Columbians who gave
support."
</P>
<P>
To shouts of "viva Colombia", she beamed brightly and presented
his gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is just a beginning," she said. "There will more
gold medals in the future."

<HEADLINE> New Baiyun Int'l Airport Gets Guarantee Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Chang'an Guarantee
Company will provide guarantee to the construction of the new
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed between the company and the
Headquarters for Reconstruction of Guangzhou Baiyun International
Airport over the weekend, the company will extend guarantees to
the new airport developer in bidding, contract execution, and
advance payment in case contractors fail to observe the contracts.
</P>
<P>
The existing Baiyun International Airport, with a history of
over 70 years and located in the suburbs of Guangzhou, is one of
the busiest airports in China. It had an average annual growth
rate of eight percent in profits from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, the airport handled 8.5 million
passengers, up eight percent from the same period last year. It
expects to handle 13 million passengers this year.
</P>
<P>
Overburdened by increasing passengers and cargo, a new
modernized airport is calculated to meet demands from ever-growing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will be built in several stages with designs
provided by Parsons Corp. and URS Greiner Corp, two U.S. firms,
and the Guangdong Provincial Architectural Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
It will cover an area of 1,456 hectares, about four times the
area of the existing Baiyun Airport. According to a construction
plan, the first phase of the new airport is scheduled to be
finished by 2002 and will be put into trial service the following
year.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is expected to cost 20 billion yuan (about 2.4
billion U.S. dollars), 49 percent of which will be covered by the
Guangzhou Transport Investment Co., Ltd. The first-phase
construction will cost about 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.
S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By 2010, when the airport is fully completed, it will be able
to handle 80 million arrivals and departures and one million tons
of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an Guarantee Company, set up in July 1998, is China's
first professional firm that provides guarantees to projects. It
has so far established cooperation ties with a number of foreign
re-guarantee companies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to this new airport in Guangzhou, Chang'an company
has also offered guarantees to other major state projects in China,
including the State Grand Theater, and Zhongguancun Science and
Technology Park in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Fate of 266 Illegal Immigrants in Cyprus Still Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese authorities still
refused to allow the return of the 266 illegal immigrants who were
rescued from a sunk boat off Cyprus last week, local media reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants, mainly Pakistanis and Kurds, are being held at a
ship off the southern town of Limassol and waiting to be deported
back to Lebanon according to an agreement between Cyprus and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou has
received a two-person Lebanese government delegation which arrived
here Tuesday and showed it evidence that the ship had set out
Lebanon and should therefore be sent back.
</P>
<P>
Last year Cyprus and Lebanon signed an agreement that envisages
the return of illegal immigrants to the country from which they
sailed.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese officials were not convinced, and said they
would accept the immigrants only when Cyprus proved that they
actually sailed from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the immigrants complained of the filthy living
conditions on the vessel and that Cyprus banned them from
contacting the United Nations. They also complained that they were
exposed to the sun during the day and to the cold at night. Twelve
people, two of them children, had to be taken to a hospital for
gastroenteritis.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police said Tuesday they had so far obtained statements
from 15 illegal immigrants, confirming that in the early hours of
September 11, their boat sailed from Al Aza Uzai harbor of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou Tuesday put the evidence to the Lebanese officials
and more meetings are expected Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqi MIGs Flow Over Kuwait: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
has said that two Iraqi MIG jets trespassed 25 kilometers into the
Kuwaiti airspace on September 4, a local daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another Iraqi jet also flew over the Saudi-Iraqi border on the
same day, the English newspaper Kuwait Times quoted Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Sulaiman Majid Al-Shaheen as saying.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaheen said at Kuwait Journalists Association Tuesday
evening that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and their allies decided to "keep
matters secret until after the United Nations Millennium Summit,
which opened on that day, so that Iraq would not be able to use the
event to its own advantage."
</P>
<P>
But Al-Shaheen's remarks contradicted with earlier press reports
that said two Iraqi jet fighters invaded the Saudi airspace on
September 4.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. and British planes based in the region have been
enforcing two no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq since the
1991 Gulf War, the Kuwaiti official did not say how the Iraqi
planes had evaded the monitoring.
</P>
<P>
A sense of tension has been felt in the past week between Kuwait
and Iraq after Baghdad accused its small Gulf neighbor of stealing
its oil in the desert border area, the same grievance 10 years ago
sparked Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Kuwait has rejected the Iraqi
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has said that it has been contacting its allies for
consultations and to brief them on the latest development in light
of the Iraqi campaign against it.
</P>
<P>
But there is no sign that Kuwait and its western allies have
decided to make immediate joint action in reply to the Iraqi
incursion.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Withdraw From Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Austria plans to withdraw its
peacekeeping troops from Cyprus next year, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the substantial budget cuts, the Austrian government can
no longer afford to deploy soldiers in Cyprus, the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP (United Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus)
spokeswoman Sarah Russel Tuesday confirmed Austria's decision and
said that UNFICYP will now begin looking for replacements.
</P>
<P>
The Austrians, who came to Cyprus in 1964, were among the first
U.N. soldiers to arrive in the island. Initially they brought a
police contingent and later that year a field hospital. The first
battalion arrived in 1972. There are currently 236 of their
soldiers serving in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Austrians lost three soldiers in 1974 when they were
attacked by Turkish fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions that if the Austrians are to leave,
they would be replaced by Slovaks, Hungarians and Slovenians, but
UNFICYP said no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP was set up in 1964, four years after Cyprus gained
independence from Britain, when inter-communal clashes broke out
between the Greek and Turkish Communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island after a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Since then the UNFICYP controls 180-kilometer long buffer zone
across this east Mediterranean island dividing the two rival sides.
</P>
<P>
UNFYCYP now has 1,223 troops and 34 civilian police.

JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Some five hours after announcing that contacts with the
Palestinians had been temporarily suspended, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak reversed himself late Tuesday night and said that talks
between negotiators Gilad Sher and Saeb Erekat will take place
Wednesday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"Reports tonight of a suspension of negotiations with the
Palestinians are without foundation," Barak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is organizing a meeting between Israeli and
Egyptian army officers in an attempt to foster a dialogue between
the defense establishments of the two countries and reduce tensions
and mutual anxieties.
</P>
<P>
Five officers from each country took part in a meeting held two
weeks ago at a U.S. military base in Virginia. For the first time
the Egyptians also sent a senior officer, bearing the rank of
brigadier general, who does not belong to the liaison unit of the
Egyptian Army that maintains ongoing working relations with the
Israel Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Police fraud detective interrogated attorney Doron Cohen, the
brother-in-law of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, for several
hours Tuesday as part of a wider probe of alleged election campaign
irregularities by non-profit organization.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, suspected of violation of the Party Financing Law,
refused to cooperate with investigators, telling them that he was
exercising his right to silence. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The overall probe of campaign funding was ordered by Attorney-
General Elyakim Rubinstein after a scathing report from State
Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg was published last January.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A day of protests by truckers ended Tuesday afternoon, when
the treasury agreed to the trucking industry demand to calm
fluctuations in diesel fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
In a demonstration closely coordinated with police officials,
protest convoys of heavy trucks rolled north and south on the
coastal highway during the morning rush hour, but caused only minor
disruption to traffic.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Party Headquarters Bombing an Inside Job: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The bombing of the opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) headquarters in Harare last
week was an inside job, said Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs
John Nkomo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an eagerly awaited statement in the parliament, Nkomo said
police have found consignments of arms of war comprising grenades,
pistols, rifles and tear smoke cached at the party's offices.
</P>
<P>
The recovered items also included a loaded pistol, cartridges,
a box with 500 pellets and military-type hand set radios, believed
to have originated from Malaysia and imported through South Africa,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Forensic scientists are now working on the recovered debris,"
he said. "Initial investigations together with information
received by police suggested without doubt that the explosion at
the MDC head office was an inside job."
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the search of the MDC offices by
police were lawful and in the interest of national security since
it was common knowledge that an offense was committed.
</P>
<P>
He said police examinations at the scene of the crime revealed
that there was a 1.5 centimeters deep crater with a radius of 0.7
centimeter, suggesting that an explosive device had been used.
</P>
<P>
The bombing which rocked the MDC headquarters on the night of
September 10 broke office windows and doors and shattered
windscreens of two vehicles which were parked in the yard.
</P>
<P>
However, the MDC Tuesday dismissed as false claims that police
had found arms of war during last week's searches of the
opposition party's offices.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, MDC Secretary for Information and Publicity
Learnmore Jongwe described Nkomo's statement to the parliament as
an attempt to frame the MDC leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Minister Nkomo's statement, therefore, is a clear attempt by
the government and the ruling party to maliciously and falsely
concoct baseless allegations against the MDC, with a view to
discrediting it within the eyes of the public, and also to take
this as a pretext for cracking down on the MDC leadership," Jongwe
said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Hints at Shrinkage of Aid to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's share of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) resources may shrink in the future unless
it improves performance in policy and institutional reforms, The
Daily Star quoted ADB official as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's cost of borrowing from the bank will
also increase as it has hardened loan terms from its soft lending
window, Asian Development Fund (ADF), in view of scarce source and
stiff competition among the member countries, ADB resident
representative in Dhaka Phiphit Suphaphiphat disclosed at a
meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing or even maintaining the current level of ADF
lending to Bangladesh will require satisfactory performance in
terms of efforts of the government to strengthen policies and
institutions," Suphaphiphat said.
</P>
<P>
Aid absorption capacity of the country also needs to be
improved through addressing long-standing issues in project
implementation and agreed reforms in key sectors, he also noted.
</P>
<P>
The ADB representative said his bank has initiated a
performance-based lending policy for allocation of ADF resources
among eligible developing member countries. This may have negative
impact on Bangladesh's access to ADF funds due to its poor
implementation rate.
</P>
<P>
The average delay in project implementation is about three
years in the country, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In performance-based lending, allocation of ADF resources would
be based on performance in macro-economic management, commitment
to policy and institutional reforms, progress in achieving good
governance and efficiency in implementing on-going projects.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question that the ADB so far did not make any aid
commitments for this year, Suphaphiphat said Bangladesh may get an
aid commitment of 160 million U.S. dollars for three projects this
year and the agreement would be signed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
A 170-million-dollar aid commitment this year for four projects
has already been canceled, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Suphaphiphat indicated that the ADB would try to
maintain an average annual lending level in the range of 400 to
500 million dollars as per a Partnership Agreement on Poverty
Reduction signed between the bank and the government.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is one of the major development partners of Bangladesh
with a cumulative lending of 5.9 billion dollars and technical
assistance grants totaling 156 million dollars as of December,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Daimler Chrysler to Increase Re-use of Plastics from Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Daimler Chrysler, the
world's No. 5 automaker, has been testing plastics recycling
technology that could help make its vehicles 95 percent
recoverable within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
If validated in a five-month pilot project launched this month,
the company said Tuesday, the new recycling technology could
reduce by one-third the amount of automobile waste going into
landfills, provide a source for high quality recycled plastics
that can be used to produce new automotive parts, and result in
significant cost savings in the production of new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The test could also open the door to a profitable new market
for automobile recyclers in recycled plastics, polyurethane foams
and copper. There are three U.S. firms now working with Daimler
Chrysler in carrying out the project.
</P>
<P>
According to the automaker, about 95 percent of all automobiles
are recycled. But recycling is generally limited to the 75 percent
by weight of the vehicle that is metallic. The remaining 25
percent, including a significant amount of plastics, has been
difficult to recycle cost-effectively. As a result, most of that
remaining material, known as automotive shredder residue, is
disposed of in landfills. The recycling equation is further
complicated by the fact that many automakers are using increased
amounts of plastics as a way to reduce weight and improve fuel
economy.
</P>
<P>
Up to 95 percent of vehicles by weight could be recycled and
recovered by using the new technology, the company said. And the
automaker would have a cost-effective source for recycled plastics
that can be used to increase the number of components made from
recycled plastics in new vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Daimler Chrysler developed two sedans with 40 percent
of the plastic materials used from recycled material. Vehicle
weight was reduced by seven pounds and they met all requirements
for comfort, performance, quality, emissions and safety. Road
testing has confirmed their durability.

<HEADLINE> Japan Welcomes U.S. Senate's Passage of China Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan welcomed Wednesday the U.
S. Senate's passage of a bill on permanent normal trade relations
(PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome it as a move to give momentum to China's bid to
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to further move
forward U.S.-China relations," Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Kono also expressed the hope that China will be a constructive
partner in the international community, and pledged Japan will
continue cooperation with other nations to help China join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States reached an agreement on China's
entry into the WTO last November. The deal requires the U.S. to
give China PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
Following the Senate's approval of the trade bill, which has
already cleared the House of Representatives, the legislation will
become law after it is signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the passage of the bill, the U.S. Congress had to
renew China's normal trade relations status every year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Vietnam Agree to Set up Rice Pool Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Vietnam, the
largest and second-largest rice exporters in the world, have
agreed to set up a rice pool fund, Thai government announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by Thai deputy
commerce minister Paitoon Kaeowthong and Vietnamese deputy
agriculture minister Cao Duc Phat Tuesday here, Thailand will find
the markets and set the prices on low-grade rice and then split
export orders with Vietnam on a 50-to-50 basis, according to a
report from the government.
</P>
<P>
The MOU aims to end a row between the two countries on market
share of the low-grade rice exports. Vietnam has sold its low-
grade rice at a lower price than Thailand, forcing the world
market prices down, it said.
</P>
<P>
A rice pool fund, or a joint stockpile, will be set up with
each country contributing 100,000 tons of rice to it, and will
increase to over a million tons in the future, it stated.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Thailand exported 6.7 million tons of rice while
Vietnam's exports totaled 4.5 million tons. Currently, about 20
million tons of rice is exported every year in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Threaten Thailand's Exports, Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai business leaders expect
higher oil prices to dent private investment and exports this year,
The Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Production costs will go up, domestic consumption will fall and
the economies of major export markets will weaken, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Production costs have already gone up in the manufacturing
sector due to higher oil prices, Praphad Phodhivorakhun, vice-
chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The situation is likely to worsen once rising prices push up
the cost of electricity for the rest of the year since the
increase is expected to continue until January and February, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers in some sectors, like textiles and garments,
have cut production thanks to the slip in the baht exchange rate
which enables them to earn more from exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the rising oil prices have reduced purchasing
power, leading to a contraction in domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
As a result, inventories of some mass products like electrical
appliances and motorcycles are expected to return to crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
Higher oil prices since the start of the year are expected to
push inflation, measured by the consumer price index, to about
three percent for the year, compared to 0.3 percent last year and
0.4 percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Regarding exports, Praphad said the effect of the global oil
price hikes will worsen the economic situation in Thailand's major
export markets, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. These
markets have their own economic problems and the effects of the
oil prices could push down their demand for imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Vachara Planchet, secretary-general of the Thai Chamber of
Commerce, was quoted as saying that despite a slight increase in
fuel costs, there has been as much as a 30-percent increase in
transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
The fishery sector is most affected, with costs up by 40
percent for small vessels and 60 percent for large ones.
</P>
<P>
Private investment will drop since demand is reduced. Meanwhile,
manufacturers are unable to raise prices to cover increasing cost.
For automobiles, the overall market demand will drop from the
previous target of 280,000 units to 270,000 units this year, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Exports are likely to decline since manufacturing costs have
increased.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, large vessels operated by foreign companies
have doubled their cargo charges, raising the transportation cost
for exporters.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President's Right Hand Resigns Over Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Culture and
Tourism Minister Park Jie-won, a righthand man of President Kim
Dae-jung, resigned Wednesday over an alleged scandal.
</P>
<P>
Park, who has been under increased fire for alleged influence-
peddling in an illegal loan from the domestic Hanvit Bank,
resigned after prosecutors recently re-launched investigation into
the allegations in which Park was accused of involving in the
multi-billion-won loan for one of his former aides.
</P>
<P>
South Koran presidential spokesman Park Joon-young told
reporters that President Kim Dae-jung has accepted Park's
resignation so that Park could help the investigation not as a
public figure but as a common individual and the prosecution could
bring light to the allegations clearly.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung immediately appointed Kim Han-gill, chief
secretary of the ruling Millennium Democratic Party, as Park's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Park, who has been known as one of Kim's
confidants for years, played a major role in the inter-Korean
secret negotiations in China to produce an agreement for the
historic Pyongyang inter-Korean summit last June.
</P>
<P>
Park said that he decided to resign so as not to give a heavy
burden to Kim's running of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that all the suspicions including the false accusations
against me could be brought to light by the prosecution," said
Park, who had served as a presidential spokesman before taking the
position of minister in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kim Hang-gill was a renowned best-seller writer in South Korea
before joining politics as a special adviser to Kim Dae-jung of
then opposition National Congress for New Politics party in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He once served as senior presidential secretary for policy
planning and head of the planning of the election campaign
headquarters for the ruling Millennium Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Exerts Heavy Influence on Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Its haul so far stands at one
gold, one silver and one bronze, but Bulgaria's influence on
weightlifting at the Sydney Olympic Games is much greater than
that.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is the third most successful weightlifting nation in
the Olympic history behind Russia and the United States and 11 of
their 45 Olympic gold medals have been won in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Izabela Dragneva (gold, women's 48kg), Ivan Ivanov (silver,
men's 56kg) and Sevdalin Minchev Angelov (bronze men's 62kg) have
been Bulgaria's most successful weightlifters here, but the
country has also had a stake in the gold medals won by Halil Mutlu
(Turkey) and Nikolay Pechalov (Croatia).
</P>
<P>
Mutlu, a dual Olympic champion who won the men's 56kg class
here, was born in Bulgaria and started his career there before
moving to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Men's 62kg gold medalist Pechalov won an Olympic silver medal
in Barcelona in 1992 and a bronze medal in Atlanta representing
Bulgaria, but moving to Croatia three years ago for 50,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's most famous export is triple Olympic champion Naim
Suleymanoglu. Named as one of the best 25 athletes of the past
century by the world's sports media last year, Suleymanoglu costed
the Turkish Government one million U.S. dollars when he defected
from Bulgaria to Turkey in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He was aiming for an historic fourth consecutive Olympic gold
here but bombed out in the men's 62kg class when he missed all
three snatch attempts at 145kg.

<HEADLINE> Thai Ministers to Set Example in Car-free Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai cabinet ministers will
set an example in the Car-free Day, which falls on Friday, by
using small vehicles or even public transportation instead of big
cars, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move is sponsored by the National Energy Policy Office,
which stresses the need for cabinet members and senior officials
to do their bit in the Car-free Day, which is aimed to reduce the
country's dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
The report said if 10 percent of Bangkok's 1.3 million
motorists leave their cars and use public transportation at home
Friday, the saving will be 450,000 liters of fuel worth 7.2
million baht (175,600 U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Assembly of Taxi Drivers says its members will
on Friday give passengers a discount to encourage them to leave
their cars at home.
</P>
<P>
Facing the global oil price hike, the cabinet had instructed
agencies to conduct other measures to save fuel, including a
feasibility study on the use of ethanol as a substitute fuel and
laying more bicycle lanes.

<HEADLINE> Two French Journalists Rescued in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The two French journalists who
were abducted on July 9 in the southern Philippines have been
rescued unharmed by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), AFP
spokesman Generoso Senga said Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Senga said French journalists Jean Jacques Legarrec and Roland
Madura were rescued by combined forces of the 7th Infantry 1st
Division of the Philippine Army and the composite battalion of the
First Scout Rangers around 6:30 a.m. in Patikul, Jolo.
</P>
<P>
He said in a televised press conference in the southern
Zamboanga city that the journalists are now safe in the custody of
the Armed Forces in Camp Bautista in Jolo, adding that they would
be taken to the capital Manila later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two journalists were seized by the rebels on July 9 when
they attempted to interview other hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Senga said military troops hoped to rescue American hostage
Jeffrey Schilling, later in the day. Schilling, who converted to
Islam in 1994, visited an Abu Sayyaf camp on August 28 and was
reportedly abducted because of an argument over religion with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The successful rescue operation was conducted after five days
of heavy fighting in the area which resulted in the deaths of four
civilians and six Abu Sayyaf rebels. The military has also
overrun three major Abu Sayyaf camps and some smaller hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said government troops
were actually pursuing two groups of the Abu Sayyaf faction that
were holding 1 Filipino and foreign civilians hostage.
</P>
<P>
One group reportedly hid Filipino hostage Ronaldo Ullah and the
2 French journalists in the mountains of Patikul.
</P>
<P>
The other group, which is reportedly hiding in Talipao, Sulu,
is responsible for American hostage Jeffrey Schilling, three
Malaysian hostages and twelve Filipinos led by Jesus Miracle
Crusade founder Wilde Almeda.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had threatened to attack southern cities and behead
American hostage Schilling to retaliate for the military assault.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, a bomb exploded in a passenger ferry at
Zamboanga city, killing one person and injuring seven others.

SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Penny Heyns of South Africa,
world record holder and defending Olympic champion, failed to
qualify for the semi-finals of the women's 200m breaststroke on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Agnes Kovacs faced Heyns in heat five, qualifying
first and setting a new Olympic record of 2:24.92.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, who won the bronze in the 100m breaststroke on Monday,
started strongly in her heat, trailing Kovacs by just 0.96 seconds
at the 100m mark.
</P>
<P>
The defending Olympic champion then fell back during the last
leg to finish in 20th place overall at 2:30.17, namely 6.53
seconds slower than her world record performance set at the Pan
Pacific Championships in Sydney last year.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, double winner of the 100m and 200m in the 1996 Atlanta
Games, said that she was considering retiring from the sport,
saying "this could have been the last race of my career."
</P>
<P>
Kovacs, the current world champion, won the bronze medal in
this event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games behind Heyns and
eighth-qualifier Amanda Beard of the United States.

excellent form in the heats of Wednesday morning's men's 200m
individual medley, and qualified fastest for the semifinals in 2:

</P>
<P>
Rosolino will go into the semifinals as favorite. He appeared

freestyle. He did not swim in the 400m individual medley.

<HEADLINE> Russian Nemov Determined to Snatch Men's All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Alexei Nemov goes
into the men's gymnastics individual all-around final as top
favourite on Wednesday at the Sydney SuperDome.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Russian star was the highest scorer in both the
qualification round as well as Monday's team final and is
considered the hottest contender for the coveted All-Around title.
</P>
<P>
The top 36 gymnasts, with a maximum of three per NOC, will
compete on each of the six apparatuses. The scorers generated
during the qualification will not carry over, allowing the
individual all-around competition to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
During the team final two days ago, Nemov scored highly on the
rings, despite his weakest apparatus. If his performance remains
as stable and brilliant as it was during the team final, it is
expected that he will at last claim the title that he missed out
on four years ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit concerned that he may be too tired after having gone
through two tough competitions and helping the team better than
anyone else, but I still believe he can make it," said Russian
coach Leonid Arkaev.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, the fine all-arounder and twice world
champion, may pose most serious threat to Nemov. Olexandr Beresh
of Ukraine, the 2000 European champion, also has a chance.
</P>
<P>
From China, Yang Wei will perform with the confidence of being
a part of the first ever team who won an Olympic title for his
country.  Japan's Naoyo Tsukahara, the 1999 world all-around
silver medalist, will also present a challenge.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Beats S. Korea in Women's Volleyball Preliminary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Reigning Olympic champions
Cuba recovered from a previous preliminary round loss to easily
defeat South Korea in straight sets at the Sydney Entertainment
Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans struggled from the start with Cuba's aggressive,
powerful play with Ana Ivis Fernandez, Regla Torres and Yumilka
Ruiz leading the Cuban offence. The Cubans were left unfazed by
the Koreans' renowned back row defence.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was unable to score off transition plays which
meant that repeated power hitting from Cuba and the overwhelming
height advantage of the Cubans proved decisive, with Cuba taking
the set 25-17.
</P>
<P>
South Korea managed to stay in touch early in the second set
through more effective blocking from the team's tallest player
Chang So-Yun, as well as attacking with quick and precise ball
plays.
</P>
<P>
This form enabled them to accumulate some clear winners, but
whilst the Koreans still struggled to score, the Cubans winners
came easy, Cuba winning 25-13.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's game gained momentum in the third, actually
matching the aggressive Ruiz spike, but the pounding Cubans
continued to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
Exciting rallies revealed the athleticism of the two teams but
the Cuban attackers just proved too tall and powerful, the outcome
similar to the first two sets 25-15.
</P>
<P>
Cuba will next meet the emerging Italian team, who on Wednesday
morning rattled the towering Russian team. On Friday, South Korea
faces Peru desperate for a win to make the crossovers.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Identified by Indonesian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian police said the
bomb that killed 15 people and injured dozens of others at the
Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) last Wednesday was a Cyclo Trimetilin
Trimetramin (RDX) plastic explosive.
</P>
<P>
"The type of the bomb was a RDX plastic explosive," the
Indonesian Observer daily Wednesday quoted National Police
spokesman Brigadier General Dadang Garnida as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said here Tuesday that the JSX bomb appears to have been
made in Brussels, Belgium, in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of the Police Forensic Laboratory Brigadier
General Erwin Mappaseng said the explosive power of the JSX bomb
was similar to that of the August 1 blast that occurred outside
the Central Jakarta residence of the Philippine envoy.
</P>
<P>
Dadang could not identify the power of the bomb, but said the
police investigators have now questioned at least 35 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been hit by s series of bomb blasts this year,
most of them not resulting in any fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed and more than a dozen injured when the
August 1 bomb went off outside the Philippine envoy's official
residence.
</P>
<P>
Other blasts have occurred in or nearby churches in the North
Sumatra provincial capital of Medan and at the Attorney General's
Office in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The government officials and the public believed that most of
the blasts were conducted by the supporters of the former
president Soeharto.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Cheating Center in Exams Opened in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Education
Minister Tol Lahon Tuesday opened the headquarters for the
ministry's war against cheating in school exams, according to
local media.
</P>
<P>
The Examinations Office includes a high-security storehouse,
where exam papers can be printed and stored in locked metal boxes,
ready for shipment to test centers. The system also means test
information can be fed directly into a computer, allowing the
ministry to quickly develop a sophisticated database of exam
results, a report from The Cambodia Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Cheating phenomenon in examinations were widespread in Cambodia,
exam papers were often stolen and sold to students, and exam
monitors were bribed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In exam earlier this year, the ministry stepped up security,
setting up police cordons to keep crowds well away from exam
centers and introducing stiffer penalties for exam monitors caught
taking bribes.
</P>
<P>
The Examination Office building with a cost of 65,000 U.S.
dollars is part of an ongoing Australian-funded project to make
Cambodian exams fair and uniform, it said.

<HEADLINE> Barshefsky, U.S. Business Groups Hail Senate Passage of China's PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky on Tuesday hailed the Senate approval of
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
"Today's vote will stand as a historic landmark in U.S.-China
relations and marks the most significant step forward since the
opening of China in 1972," Barshefsky said after the U.S. Senate
passed the trade bill by a vote of 83-15 Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Granting PNTR for China not only provides tremendous economic
opportunities for U.S. workers, farmers and businesses, it is also
the best way to promote reform in China and stability in the
region," she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she described the agreement reached last November
between the two countries on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) as "the capstone" of the nearly 300 trade deals
negotiated by the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, called the Tuesday vote "a defining moment" in the
history of both the Senate and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Not only will it open new business opportunities, he said, it
will also help "in meeting what is likely to be our single
greatest foreign policy challenge in the coming decades, managing
our relations with a rising China."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. High Tech Industry
Coalition on China, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM)
and other business groups issued statements respectively on
Tuesday to commend the event.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue called
Tuesday's Senate vote "a huge victory for free trade and open
markets."
</P>
<P>
"This is truly a landmark achievement," said Jim Whittaker,
Chairman of the U.S. High Tech Industry Coalition on China. "By
opening, once and for all, the vast Chinese market, this
legislation will also open broad new doorways of opportunity to
our industry for exports and investments."
</P>
<P>
NAM's statement said passage of China's PNTR status is "a
prerequisite for American businesses and their workers to enjoy
the benefits of China's pending membership in the WTO, along with
international competitors."
</P>
<P>
Once the legislation is signed into law by President Bill
Clinton, the United States will terminate the annual review of
China's "most-favored-nation" status and establish normal trade
relations with China after it joins the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Allot 55 Million Dollars for Coca Cultivation Substitutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government has
allotted 55 million U.S. dollars to develop alternative crops in
coca plantation zones, said Alfredo Mendivil, head of the
Commission for Fighting Drug Consumption, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A national program of alternative development has been applied
to the country's 33,000 hectares of coca plantation in order to
substitute coca leaf, the raw ingredient for cocaine, with
alternative crops such as coffee and banana.
</P>
<P>
"Cotton, small palm, banana, pineapple and sweet potato are
among these alternative crops that will give producers greater
economic income and prevent them from enduring economic hardship,"
said Mendivil.
</P>
<P>
The alternative cultivation plan has cost about 1 million
dollars and benefited more than 1 million people from 1995 to 1999,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Peru is well on the way to achieve the target of eradicating
coca cultivation by the year of 2003, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the world's second largest cocaine producer after Colombia,
Peru has reduced coca leaf cultivation from 113,200 hectares to 34,
000 hectares in 1999, according to figures from the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to produce 175 metric tons of pure cocaine this
year, compared with 240 tons in 1998 and 550 tons in 1992, much of
the illegal drugs earmarked for U.S. markets.

BELGRADE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 to 70 percent of
Yugoslavia's employees have returned to their original positions
as a result of the government's reconstruction projects following
last year's NATO bombing campaign, a Belgrade newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government has put 3 billion dinars (217 million U.S.
dollars) into the restoration of factories damaged in NATO's
campaign, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate employment pressures, authorities also encouraged
employees to find new positions, such as working for private
enterprises or going back to the country, by providing them with
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia suffered a 100-billion-dollar economic loss in last
year's campaign. All major economic facilities were severely
damaged, 500,000 people lost their jobs, and 2 million people are
living without income.
</P>
<P>
Many large enterprises, including the refineries in Pancevo and
Novi Sad, have resumed production after one year of reconstruction.

WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill

"They're down to difficult issues, and they're both feeling the

decision to suspend talks with the Palestinians only one day after
it was announced.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's more complicated than that. ... I think you
should expect from time to time both sides to express some
exasperation. And as long as they get back to work you should feel
positive about that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who has invested lots of energy in the Middle East
peace process, would like to broker a final settlement between the

</P>

against the erratic Nigerians, who have so far been unable to
score a point.
</P>
<P>
Players such as Mercy Akide and Eberechi Opara are quite
capable of turning a game on its head but as a team, Nigeria lacks
cohesion and consistency.

China faces a stronger opponent in Norway at Bruce Stadium,
Canberra, but the Europeans have not shown anything in their first
two games to suggest they can live with one of the best teams in
the competition. While individual players such as midfielder Hege
Riise and striker Dagny Mellgren have produced flashes of form,
the team's overall performance has been uninspired.

The first half (13-11) proved to be tough enough for Sweden
against the five-time African champions as the Tunisians played an
aggressive defence, disturbing especially Sweden's Staffan Olsson.
</P>
<P>
After four successful fast breaks, Tunisia led 8-7, but they
ran out of steam and trailed by two goals at half-time.
</P>
<P>
In the second-half, Sweden's goalkeeper Peter Gentzel was the
best player for his wide, saving several shots.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, silver medalist at the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games,
took the advantage of the saves and made fast breaks for a
comfortable lead of nine goals by the end.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's captain Stefan Loevgren became the best scorer of the
match, with 10 goals out of 13 attempts.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts Greater Economic Growth For Mexico This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will see 6.5
percent economic growth this year, up 3 percentage point from 1999,
the Washington-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted
in a report published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it put Mexico's inflation rate at 9.5 percent, down
from the 1999 level.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico's economy keeps expanding at a healthy rate, as it has
since 1995," said the IMF in its World Economic Panorama report,
which will be presented at the fall session of the IMF and the
World Bank in Prague.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institution attributed Mexico's
economic stability to a prudent monetary policy, rising oil prices,
U.S. economic growth, and increased domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, the IMF said, Mexico's economic growth will
slow to 4.8 percent, while inflation will drop even further to 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report expects Mexico's current account balance to
represent 3.5 percent of its real gross domestic product (GDP)
this year and 3.7 percent in 2001, compared to 2.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among the Latin American countries, Mexico, with an estimated 6.
5 percent economic growth, is expected to be second only to the
Dominican Republic with 8.4 percent, and be followed by Chile with
6 percent, Brazil and Peru 4 percent, and Guatemala 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> LAmerican Banana Exporting Countries Seek Common Strategy against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ministers and ambassadors of
Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica met Tuesday in Guayaquil, Ecuador
's largest city, to seek a common strategy to press the European
Union (EU) to open its market for their banana.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the three major banana producers and
exporters in Latin America, and strong competitors in the European
market, came after the EU imposed on Ecuador, the largest banana
exporter in Latin America, a quota system that limits
possibilities of selling more bananas to Europe.
</P>
<P>
In response to the EU's restrictive system, Ecuador has
increased its banana production and lowered its prices.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Heinz Moeller said Ecuador will maintain a
posture and stance that the EU will have to respect, sooner or
later: free banana trade.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador hopes that within the next two years the EU will accept
a uniform tariff so that banana exporting countries can compete on
an equal footing, Moeller said, adding that his country will have
advantages because of its cheaper and better quality of bananas.
</P>
<P>
Colombia and Costa Rica also want to approach Ecuador in order
to find a common strategy to improve their conditions.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's Trade Minister Tomas Duenas said the Guayaquil
meeting isn't intended to make proposals but rather to listen to
banana exporting countries like Ecuador and Colombia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday hailed the Senate passage of a bill on
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China, saying the "
landmark" trade agreement will strengthen U.S. prosperity and
promote economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also increase "the prospects for openness in
China and a more peaceful future for all of us," said Clinton in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill by a vote of 83-
15 Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"When we open markets abroad to U.S. goods, we open
opportunities at home," he said. "This vote will do that."
</P>
<P>
The PNTR bill will provide a chance for the United States to
strengthen its prosperity and security, he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that with the passage of the bill, China will open
its markets to American products, from wheat to cars to consulting
services.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States reached an agreement on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) last November. The
deal requires the United States to give China PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that when China finishes its negotiations and
joins the WTO, U.S. high-tech companies will help speed the
information revolution in China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed his thanks for the senators and
government officials who worked hard "to achieve this important
milestone."
</P>
<P>
Once Clinton signs the legislation into law, the United States
will terminate the annual review of China's "most-favored-nation"
status and establish normal trade relations with China after it
joins the WTO.

</P>
<P>
The new predictions are contained in the World Economic
Panorama report published Tuesday in Prague during the annual IMF

<P>
Economic growth in Brazil continues to recover with the push of
booming exports, which became buoyant following the devaluation of
Brazil's currency, the real, in 1999, it added.
</P>
<P>
The increase of consumption and investments contributed to
economic growth not long ago, the document said .
</P>
<P>
"GDP growth is thought to be of 4 percent in year 2000, and 4.5
percent in 2001; as regards the current account deficit, it'll go
down significantly", said the report.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF, Brazil's primary surplus goal in the
public sector of 3.25 percent of GDP will be achieved.
</P>

<HEADLINE> United States, Australia to Vie for Women's 200m Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones of the United
States will attempt to continue her quest for five gold medals by
winning the 200m, the second event in her race program.
</P>
<P>
She leads the year's rankings ahead of teammates Inger Miller
and Nanceen Perry, who will be looking to reverse the results of
their Olympic trials. And the three Australians, Melinda Gainsford-
Taylor, Cathy Freeman and Lauren Hewitt, may also be strong medal
contenders with the support of a home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Jones is yet to win a major 200m medal but has topped the world
rankings since 1997 and is the second fastest woman in the world
ever over the distance. She did not finish the semifinal at the
1999 World Championships due to back spasm mid-race, but has fully
recovered after missing the rest of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
She won the US Olympic trials in a season best of 21.94 seconds
and has demonstrated her strength over the longer distances with
the second fastest 400m of the year of 49.59.
</P>
<P>
World champion Miller will be confident going into the race as
she is ranked second behind Jones with 22.09 seconds, which she
ran at the US trials. Her win at the World Championships was a
historic best of 21.77 and her winning margin of 0.45 seconds was
the largest in a major 200m since 1948.
</P>
<P>
She placed fourth at the 1996 Olympic Games and fifth at the
1997 World Championships, but a coaching change to John Smith in
1999 saw her lower her previous best from 22.10 to 21.77 and move
to 11th on the world all-time list.
</P>
<P>
Nanceen Perry will make her Olympic debut following an
impressive third at the US Olympic trials. Her time of 22.38
ranks her fourth in the world for 2000, while she is the world
indoor leader for the year. She is a member of the US world record
holding 4x200m team.
</P>
<P>
Gainsford-Taylor is ranked sixth for season 2000, with 22.43
and has prepared well in Australia. She has recovered fully from
major knee surgery in 1998, which saw her out of competition for
over a year.
</P>
<P>
Freeman staked her claim on a medal with an impressive victory
over Miller in Gateshead in late August, making up five meters in
the last 20 meters of the race. She has proven her ability to
perform at big occassions and no one can discount her as a strong
medal chance despite being ranked only 14th.
</P>
<P>
The unknown Australian factor is Hewitt. She will compete in
her first Olympic Games as an individual competitor after being
part of the 4x100m relay whch made the final in 1996. She is the
ninth ranked athlete entered in the event but produced the best of
her life to be placed seventh at the 1999 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
She has gained numerous but inconsistent victories in
Australian domestic races and has the ability to pull out somethng
special.
</P>
<P>
Another dark horse is Susanthika Jayashinghe of Sri Lanka, the
surprise silver medalist at the 1997 World Championships. She
showed she is coming to her peak form, with a 22.32 effort at
Yokohama on September 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China, who gained Olympic
qualification for the first time, continued their giant-killing
feats in the Olympic women's hockey with a 2-1 win over Germany in
group B here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, who stunned Champions Trophy winners the
Netherlands in their opening match, scored once in each half to
upset the 1992 silver-medallists.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wanfeng put the Chinese ahead as early as the second
minute following their first penalty corner.
</P>
<P>
Leading 1-0 at half-time, China increased their tally midway
through the second half when Chen Hui scored with a scoop from the
top of the circle.
</P>
<P>
The Germans launched a desperate attack in the last quarter,
but Inga Moeller's goal 10 minutes before the final whistle came
too late to deny the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
China, whose only setback here was the 2-0 loss to New Zealand,
swept to the top of the group with six points from three matches.
Germany and New Zealand follow with four points each.
</P>
<P>
A draw with South Africa in their last match on Friday will
ensure China a place in the medal pool round.
</P>
<P>
The Germans must defeat the Dutch on Friday to stay in
contention.

<HEADLINE> Non-Traumatic Way Observing Heart Abnormity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese doctor has invented
a non-traumatic way to observe the functioning of the heart using
several pairs of electrodes.
</P>
<P>
Li Xizhen, the inventor, who is a chief physician with Harbin
No. 211 Hospital in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, made
the non-traumatic observation possible by observing changes that
occurred to the volumetric loading of the pulmonary vein and
artery which are close to the heart.
</P>
<P>
The pulmonary circulation, known as the lesser circulation in
comparison with the systematic circulation, is easy to be affected
once abnormalities in the heart's function occurs.
</P>
<P>
Based on this theory, Doctor Li used several pairs of
electrodes, sticking them to the chest and back to record waves of
the lesser circulation.
</P>
<P>
This technology, known as lesser circulation electric
conduction technology, is more sensitive in detecting heart
abnormalities than the traditional cardiac catheterization which
would be harsh on the patient.
</P>
<P>
Su Hongxi, an honorary chairman of the Chinese Medical
Association, said that observing heart function with the lesser
circulation electric conduction technology is of great clinical
value once it is widely accepted.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Rural People Need More Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China should intensify effort
to train its rural population in the coming years, said experts
who were participating in an international seminar on the results
of the recent agricultural centers.
</P>
<P>
There is a surplus of rural labor, but the number of highly
skilled rural laborers is very small, they said.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide census on agriculture, which began in 1997 and
concluded recently, says that 14 percent of the countryside

the total rural population, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Although most employed people in rural areas were engaged in
agricultural activities, people engaged in non-agricultural
activities took up 24.3 percent of the total," said Zhu Xiangdong,
an official with the National Bureau of Statistics.

The Chinese Government has been paying attention to the issue
of surplus rural laborers, Zhu said.

<P>
"The development of small towns has been considered by
government officials and experts as an important measure to solve
the issue of this large population of rural laborers," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Shell Resumes Full Capacity Production in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The multinational oil giant
Shell corporation has resumed production to its full capacity in
Nigeria, after fixing its damaged pipelines in the West African
country's Niger delta region, said management of the corporation's
Nigerian subsidiary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The corporation cut its production on September by 130,000
barrels per day (bpd), when crude oil spilt out from its damaged
pipelines into waters near Warri, a major city in the Nigeria
delta.
</P>
<P>
The move lowered down the corporation's total production in
Nigeria to around 630,000 bpd, at a time of booming price on the
world's oil market.
</P>
<P>
Shell is the largest oil corporation operating in the Africa's
largest oil producing nation, and in 1999 it turned out an average
of 717,000 bpd in its operation, accounting for about one-third of
the country's total 2 million bpd production.

<HEADLINE> Nemov Closest to Men's Individual All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The men's gymnastics all-
around champion will be decided on Wednesday with Russian star
Alexei Nemov the hot favorite for the title.
</P>
<P>
The top 36 gymnasts, with a maximum of three per team, will
compete on each of the six apparatus. The scores generated during
the qualification rounds will be reverted back to zero, allowing
the individual all-around competition to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
During the team final, Nemov scored highly on the rings,
despite being his weekest apparatus. If his performance remains
as stable and brilliant as it was during the team final, it is
expected that he will at last claim the title that he missed out
on four year ago in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit concerned that he may be too tired after having gone
through two tough competitions and helping the team better than
anyone else, But I still believe he can make it," said Russian
coach Leonid Arkaev.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 gymnasts pose a serious threat to Nemov. The most
likely include the fine all-arounder and twice world champion Ivan
Ivankov of Belarus, despite the small mistake he made on the floor
during the qualifications. Olexandr Beresh of Ukraine, the 2000
European champion, has also enormously matured as a gymnast.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei of China will perform with the confidence of being a
part of the first ever team who won an Olympic title for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Naoya Tsukahara, Blaine Wilson of the United States,
Marian Dragulesku of Romania are also title contenders.

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Insists Controversial Position on HIV/AIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Wednesday insisted his controversial view that the HIV
virus does not necessarily cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
There is "absolutely no confusion" about how to stop the spread
of HIV, but the virus can not cause a syndrome such as AIDS, said
Mbeki at the country's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's statement, in answer to questions from opposition
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon and other MPs, followed months
of controversy over his beliefs on the HIV/AIDS link.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS is the acronym for the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome and a syndrome is a group of diseases, Mbeki told the
country's parliament.
</P>
<P>
"A virus can not cause a syndrome. A virus will cause a disease
and AIDS is a syndrome," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the question is what contribution the virus makes to
the collapse of the immune system.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's similar remarks at the opening of a high profile
international conference held in South Africa last month triggered
angry reactions both at home and from abroad.
</P>
<P>
In response to these remarks, Ashraf Grimwood, chairman of
South Africa's National AIDS Council, said recently that there is
an absolutely clear link between HIV and AIDS, and urged the
president not to give out confused messages.
</P>
<P>
Grimwood said the HIV virus destroys the immune system, paving
the way for opportunistic infections and cancers, which are
classified as making up part of the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Seeks Strong Ties With Ethiopia: Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sudan has requested
Ethiopia to upgrade its diplomatic representation in the country
to the ambassadorial level, the Walta Information Center quoted
the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry as reporting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The request was made by Sudanese External Relations Minister
Mustefa Osman Ismael during his talks with Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin in New York, the United States when the two
ministers were attending the 55th General Assembly of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum told Mustefa that the Ethiopian government would
consider the request soon.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia downgraded its diplomatic presence in the Sudan to
Charge d'affairs level as relations between the two countries
deteriorated following a terrorist assassination attempt on
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in June
1995.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attempt was then reported to have been master-
minded by a group linked to the Sudanese government.
</P>
<P>
Mustefa and Seyoum also discussed bilateral and regional issues,
particularly the situation in Somalia. Seyoum said that Ethiopia
would continue to support the establishment of a stable government
in Somalia as this was in Ethiopia's best interest.
</P>
<P>
Following the four-month-old Peace Conference of Somalia in
Djibouti, a new Somali central authority headed by President
Abdikasim Salad Hassan inaugurated in late August, thus having
paved a way to end the 10-year-old civil war in the Horn of Africa
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve: Economic Activity Expanded at Moderate Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic activity
expanded at a moderate pace in August and early September, when
growth in consumer spending slowed, labor markets remained tight
and inflation was kept in check, the Federal Reserve said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Most districts characterized economic conditions as strong and
several said that economic growth continued to be solid," the Fed
said in its latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Richmond reported that growth had picked up from earlier in the
summer, but reports from Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and
Minneapolis indicated that the overall pace of growth had softened
in their districts, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The findings, based on interviews with businessmen in all 12
Fed districts, will be used by members of the U.S. central bank's
policy making Federal Open Market Committee when they meet on
October 3 to set interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity, was flat to modestly higher in most districts in August
compared with late spring and early summer, the Fed report said.
</P>
<P>
With generally high levels of employment, "reports of wage
increases were widespread and some firms indicated that higher
labor costs were an increasing problem," the report found.
</P>
<P>
But there were few signs that higher wages were being passed on
to consumers, notably as worker productivity remained high and as
competitive pressures prevented companies from charging higher
prices, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed raised interest rates six times from June 1999 to May
this year, aiming to curb the pace of growth and to keep inflation
in check. It kept rates steady in June and in August. With a spate
of recent economic reports showing signs of moderating economic
growth, economists are growing increasingly optimistic that the
central bank may be done raising rates this year.

<HEADLINE> China Protests Against Switzerland's Tolerance for Tibetan Separatists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday expressed
discontent over Swiss authorities' indifference when a group of
locally-supported Tibetan separatists attempted to sabotage a
celebration in a Geneva theater to mark the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of the diplomatic relations between China and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"We are totally discontented with both the happening of these
incidents and the attitude of connivance adopted by the
authorities concerned," said the Chinese mission in Geneva in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
During the disturbances, some separatists even lay in the
driveway toward the theater and blocked the traffic and the entry
of many invitees, including the Chinese ambassador and deputy
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors of the celebration, the Sino-Swiss friendship
organizations, had requested the police to maintain order and
traffic. But the local police sent there played a so-called "
neutral role" by standing idle nearby and doing nothing when the
separatists were blocking free passage, preventing admission and
even threatening the safety of the invitees.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that this is a serious incident of undermining Sino-
Swiss friendship and harming the friendly atmosphere in bilateral
relations," said the Chinese mission. "Tibet has always been an
inseparable part of China's territory. Advocating for or
supporting independence of Tibet constitutes wanton interference
in the internal affairs of China."
</P>
<P>
"The 'neutral position' adopted by the authorities concerned is
in fact not neutral at all," said the Chinese mission. "Their
position has not only protected the right of the Tibetan
separatists to carry out splittist activities, but also severely
impaired the right of those who support and work for the friendly
relations between China and Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mission urged the Swiss authorities to prevent
similar incidents in the future.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Networking Equipment Market to Reap 50 Bln Drls by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from networking
equipment are expected to hit 50 billion U.S. dollars worldwide by
the end of this year, an American high-tech market research firm
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, revenues grew a healthy 8 percent from
the first quarter to 11.8 billion dollars, according to Cahners In-
Stat Group. Growth came from enterprise backbone purchases,
continued service provider network build-out, and networking
demand for branch offices, small businesses and business-at-home
users.
</P>
<P>
Quarterly growth was driven primarily by demand for WAN
equipment such as digital modems, remote access concentrators and
routers.
</P>
<P>
North America continued to dominate network hardware sales,
accounting for 54 percent of the worldwide market in the second
quarter. Asia, where service provider infrastructure is being
built at an unparalleled pace, jumped to 15 percent in revenue
share, according to the research firm.
</P>
<P>
Cisco maintained its number one market share ranking, followed
by Nortel, 3Com and Lucent, in the second quarter.
