<HEADLINE> European Conference Urges End to Kosovo Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Conference on
Tuesday condemned the persistent violence in the Serbian province
of Kosovo, calling for an immediate end to it.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the European Union (EU) member states,
all the 11 applicant countries for EU membership and Switzerland
stressed the importance of the adoption of United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1199.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Belgrade to comply fully and immediately with
the resolution, which calls for an immediate ceasefire, adopted on
September 23.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria, which holds the
rotating EU presidency, said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
report on Kosovo Monday showed that the excessive use of force
against civilians was continuing.
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 people were made homeless in the Yugoslav
province after the adoption of the U.N. resolution, Schuessel
quoted the U.N. report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those at the conference also urged Belgrade to immediately
investigate, and identify and punish those responsible for the
alleged atrocities against civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Belgrade authorities to allow and support actively
an immediate return of all refugees and displaced persons to their
homes," said a statement issued by the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference participants reiterated their call both to the
authorities in Belgrade and the leaders of the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo to resolve the situation through dialogue with
international mediation.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural European Conference was held in March this year
at the level of heads of state and government.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Conference on Child Welfare Opens in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting)
conference on child welfare opened in London early Tuesday and a
British minister called for closer international cooperation on
children protection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the three-day conference,
British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said: "We need to
work more closely together to combat child sex tourism. We need to
strengthen our exchange of information and intelligence"
</P>
<P>
"We need to understand better our differing systems of justice;
We need to work more closely to pursue and prosecute the
offender," he added.
</P>
<P>
Information release by children's charities revealed that in
Asia alone, more than 650,000 children under the age of 16 work as
prostitutes and that one million children enter the global sex
market every year.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett made it clear: "We have a duty to ensure the innocence
of children is not corrupted by the evil lust for child
prostitution. That's why your work today is so important."
</P>
<P>
Representative from 15 European Union (EU) countries and 10
Asian countries including China are expected to hold wide-ranging
discussions on better ways to protect vulnerable children.

<HEADLINE> Ivanisevic, Chang Through in Shanghai Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Top seeds Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia and Michael Chang of the United States advanced into the
second round after tough-winning matches over their opponents at
the Shanghai Open tennis on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The big-hit Ivanisevic, world number 12, fired nine aces to
defeat Brett Steven of New Zealand 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
"I feel tired because I didn't sleep well last night," the
top-seeded Croatian said of his hard work in the second set. "But
I believe I can improve a lot tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Suffering a rapid slip on the world ranking table, Chang,
second-seeded here and world No. 33, also met a strong challenge
after an easy first set, ousting Canadian Sebastien Larfau 6-2,
7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
Chang had no trouble to take the first set and built a 2-0
lead in the second before he connected to a series of unforced
errors.
</P>
<P>
Larfau dominated the net with speed and almost turned the
table around after he made it 6-5. However, the experienced Chang
recovered from his slum and regained the control of the game.
</P>
<P>
In day's other matches, seventh seed Kenneth Carlsen of
Denmark downed Martin Sinner of Germany 6-4, 6-3, while fourth
seed Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden was the only seed to be
eliminated from the tournament when he lost to Sargis Sargsian of
Armenia 6-3, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Battling Back From Cancer for World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Two years after being
diagnosed with testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and
brain, U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong could complete one of the
greatest comebacks in sports history.
</P>
<P>
He is going to compete in the World Cycling Championships this
week and likely to win.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, a two-time Olympian, won the road race world title
in 1993. Three years later, he learned of the cancer. The
European team he had been racing for dropped him.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong missed the entire 1997 season and began 1998 slowly.
In March, even Armstrong thought his career was over.
</P>
<P>
"When I left in the spring of 1998, there was a large part of
me that thought I would never come back," he said. "The day I
quit at Paris-Nice, I thought that was the last bike race I would
ever do.
</P>
<P>
"When I came home, I didn't unpack my bike for four weeks,"
said the 27-year-old Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Armstrong found he could not stay off his bike and
continued racing for the team sponsored by the U.S. Postal
Service.
</P>
<P>
He entered the Tour of Spain two weeks ago in preparation for
the World Championships, which begin Tuesday in Valkenburg,
Netherlands. His progression continued in Spain with his
fourth-place finish - eight seconds from third place.
</P>
<P>
The one-day test of cycling's greatest riders takes place
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is very much of a classic course, " said Armstrong, who
wants to compete in the 2000 Olympics in mountain bike racing.
"Very difficult, long and short steep climbs. I've heard it
described as a puncher's course. That suits me very well."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said he races now not just to win but to show those
with cancer that there is hope. "I would like to be an example
for them, for all cancer patients, not just young men.
</P>
<P>
"I promised myself that I would do whatever I could in the
future to make it easier for the next person."

<HEADLINE> Union's Hunter: NBA's Decision No Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The NBA's decision Monday to
cancel the preseason scheduled didn't surprise players union
executive director Billy Hunter.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said that the move is part of an attempt by the league
to intimidate players.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate," Hunter said. "But I believe the league,
the owners and the commissioner decided they were going to play
hardball. They locked us out. They submitted a proposal with
mechanics they knew we wouldn't accept. They had no choice except
to cancel the preseason. We're not going to accept a bad deal,
and we're not going to be intimidated into accepting a bad deal."
</P>
<P>
To underscore their resolve, players will make themselves
available to fans and the media at several NBA arenas, training
sites and workout facilities today, which would have been the
first day of training camp.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said the idea came from the union's negotiating
committee and was first suggested by Washington Wizards forward
Juwan Howard, a member of the executive board.
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to work out a settlement with the owners
and carve out a deal that's fair to both sides," Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to demonstrate to fans that's what we're trying to
do. Players will be around to enlighten fans as to what's
transpiring."
</P>
<P>
Hunter said the union hasn't planned any other activities at
this time, but it is considering staging a series of exhibition
games involving free agents if the lockout continues much longer.
</P>
<P>
He said a decision will be made about mid-October. Proceeds
from the games would go to charity and the players association.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses Cameroon of Oil Prospecting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has accused Cameroon of
intending to prospect for oil in the disputed Bakassi Peninsula,
which was claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
"We want to bring to the notice of the international community
to the deliberate act of the Cameroonian Authority to wilfully
disregard the judgement of the International Court of Justice and
provoke hostilities in the Bakassi Peninsula," the Defense
Headquarters said in a statement in Lagos Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by defense spokesman Lieutenant Colonel
S.A. Tella, quoted a report in a Cameroonian newspaper "Herald"
as saying that the Cameroonian government has signed a contract
with a Canadian company called Trophy Petroleum Company to
prospect for crude oil in Rio Del Ray for four years.
</P>
<P>
The company, with an initial capital of 13 million U.S.
Dollars, is to explore for oil in an area of over 2,300 square
kilometers around Rio Del Ray, which "is totally within the
disputed area of Bakassi between Nigeria and Cameroon," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"With this action, it is very clear that Cameroon intends to
stir up tension within the area. This is a new project contrary
to the injunction of the World Court to the two countries not to
embark on new projects within the disputed area," the Defense
Headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Nigerian ministries of Foreign
Affairs and Justice have been informed of the development and
asked to "take up the matter appropriately."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon have clashed several times over the
oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula in the Guinea Gulf since 1993. The
dispute has been filed to the International Court of Justice but
no judgement has been made yet.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Testifies In Breach of Contract Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan was back in
court Monday in a breach-of-contract lawsuit, and the NBA
superstar denied he failed to go through with making a movie.
</P>
<P>
Jordan still denied he failed to make the movie Heaven is a
Playground because of the relatively small amount of money he
would have received.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had agreed to appear for $350,000 and later signed a $4
million deal to make Space Jam. Lawyer Robert Maland,
representing the producers of Heaven is a Playground, asked Jo
rdan if that didn't give his agent sufficient incentive to steer
him away from the movie.
</P>
<P>
"No," Jordan said. Jordan and agent David Falk contend the
producers failed to come up with adequate financing for the movie.
</P>
<P>
The producers are seeking for between $16 million and $20
million in damages, or what they believe could have been the
film's profit.
</P>
<P>
Jordan maintains both sides agreed to postpone the film, and
he has countersued, alleging the producers knowingly misled him
about financing.

<HEADLINE> King's Company Loses Court Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. boxing promoter Don
King's company lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday in an insurance
fraud case that prosecutors have decided not to pursue.
</P>
<P>
Don King Productions had asked the high court to hear its
argument that King's testimony in a 1995 insurance fraud trial
should not be used against the company.
</P>
<P>
The high court turned down the company's appeal without
comment. The 1995 trial ended in a hung jury. In the second
trial that ended last July, King was acquitted of all charges
while the jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges against
his company.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they will not seek a retrial of the company.
King was accused of altering a contract with a fighter to cheat
Lloyd's of London out of $350,000.
</P>
<P>
He had taken out an insurance policy with Lloyd's in case a
1991 fight between Julio Cesar Chavez and Harold Brazier was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
The fight was called off when Chavez got hurt training.
Prosecutors said King altered his contract with Chavez in a way
that would force Lloyd's to reimburse King but not against his
company, and he testified that the contract was altered without
his knowledge or approval.
</P>
<P>
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the testimony
could be used against King's company in the subsequent trial.
</P>
<P>
In appealing to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Don King
Productions said allowing use of King's testimony would violate
the company's right to confront the witnesses against it.

<HEADLINE> Earnings Rise in UK to Dampen Rate Cut Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A surprise upward revision to
average earnings growth figures in Britain has caught the
financial markets on the hop on Tuesday and cast fresh doubt on
the likelihood of an interest rate cut this week.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics released manufacturing and
industrial output figures, which were weaker than forecast. But
out of the blue it also revised up its estimates for annual
average earnings growth, to 5.0 percent from 4.7 in June and to
5.2 percent from 5.0 in May.
</P>
<P>
The pound, which has dropped sharply in recent days as the
markets bet the Bank of England would cut interest rates on
Thursday after a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee,
rebounded to 2.7540 marks.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Hawkins, economist at BankAmerica, was quoted by BBC as
saying: "This will not sit well with the Bank of England and must
reduce the likelihood of a rate move on Thursday."
</P>
<P>
"At the very least, it will make it extremely hard to justify
an ease of more than 25 basis points," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an unexpectedly large cut in Spanish
interest rates on Tuesday, down half a percent to 3.75 percent,
was thought to increase the pressure for a U.K. rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output fell sharper than expected, 0.5 percent in
August, confirming the sector is teetering on the edge of
recession.
</P>
<P>
But wage growth has long been a bugbear for the central bank,
as it thinks earnings rising faster than 4.5 percent a year are
inconsistent with the government's 2.5 percent inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most analysts are still betting the Bank will cut
its rate on Thursday, according to the BBC report. "There is a
growing feeling that the global financial turmoil may take
precedence over domestic matters," BBC said.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Bank Governor Eddie George raised hopes of an
easing of monetary policy, saying: "There is clearly serious
weakness in some important parts of the world economy and the
balance of risks has shifted."
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been heaped on the Bank to act to help ease global
economic turmoil after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its key rate
last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A visiting U.S. official James
Anderson announced here Tuesday that his country will provide 4.7
million U.S. Dollars for Angola's refugee settlement.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, head of United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), had met with Albino Malungo, Minister of
Assistance and Social Reintegration, and signed an aid agreement
which stipulated that USAID will donate 1.5 million Dollars to
help reintegrate former soldiers of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), restore agricultural
production and develop rural education.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the United States will also assist Angolan
government and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 3.2
million Dollars to support the programs on repatriation of
Angolan refugees from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Describing the aid as "very precious", the minister said the
current situation of Angolan refugees is the worst since 1992.
</P>
<P>
At present, the southern African country has 790,000 refugees,
90 percent of them living a very hard life.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has donated 80 million Dollars to Angola
this year, of which 13 million is for helping clear landmines,
the rest is for purchasing food, medicine and materials for
production.

<HEADLINE> Annan: UN Peacekeeping Mission Must Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary
of United Nations peacekeeping operations, Annan said, "
Peacekeeping, from the start, has been an improvisation. It
proved, and continues to prove, that the U.N. is not a static or
hidebound Organization, but a dynamic and innovative one."
</P>
<P>
"Peacekeeping has been one of many activities through which the
Organization has shown its ability to adapt to circumstances, to
find its way round obstacles, and to make itself relevant to the
actual problems at hand," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the evolution of U.N. peacekeeping from patrolling
clearly marked buffer zones and cease-fire lines to the far more
complex, multidimensional operations of the 1990s had been
either smooth or simple."
</P>
<P>
"Over the decades, We have had some unmistakable successes,
such as Namibia, Mozambique and El Salvador. We have also found
ourselves maintaining calm in some seemingly intractable
stalemates, such as Cyprus and the Middle East," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"And in some places -- Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia -- we
have found ourselves standing by while the most appalling crimes
were committed. There the limits of peacekeeping were
graphically demonstrated, " Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to declare the victory. We cannot claim that
peacekeeping has been the answer to every conflict. What we can
and do claim proudly is that, in the first half-century of their
existence, United Nations peacekeeping has saved tens of
thousands of lives, and it is one of the Organization's most
important and lasting contribution to the international peace
and security," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Report Says UK to Become Major Plutonium Storehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Oxford Research Group said in
a study report Tuesday that Britain is set to become one of the
world's major storehouse for plutonium, the radiologically toxic
material.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the British stockpile of civil plutonium
is likely to double by the year 2010, at which time approximately
half of all the separated plutonium in the world will be in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The risks of storing such vast quantities of plutonium are
manifold. A primitive nuclear bomb could be fabricated relatively
easily while the ecological consequences of any accident could be
catastrophic, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Oxford Research Group also argues that the management of
this material is an environmental and a global security issue and
it wants more active government policy and greater public
accountability.
</P>
<P>
Brtain's large stocks arise because Britain is a leading
nuclear fuel reprocessor through state-owned British Nuclear Fuels
(BNFL), which receives spent nuclear fuel from reactors around the
world for reprocessing and storage.
</P>
<P>
The reprocessed fuel is eventually returned to the country it
originated from, but only after several years of storage in
Britain, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Russia Hope to Strengthen Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Russia wanted to
broaden their defense cooperation following the talks between the
defense ministers of the two countries in Athens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting his Russian counterpart Igor Sergeyev on
the sidelines of the Defendory'98 arms exhibition which opened
Tuesday in Piraeus, Cyprus Defense Minister Yannakis Omirou said
that the two countries desired to broaden their defense
cooperation aimed at strengthening Cyprus' defenses and further
promoting the already excellent bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As for the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to be
deployed in Cyprus later this year, Omirou said that they did not
discuss the matter, but added that their efforts were aimed at
returning the focus of the Cyprus problem to that of invasion and
occupation for it was certainly not one related to the arms
program of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed the current political
situation in the Balkan region and jointly ascertained that the
danger of destabilization was being created due to Turkey's
behavior, particularly following Turkey's incursion into northern
Iraq and recent escalation of tension in its relations with Syria,
said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan and Ugandan Presidents Appeal for Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi have called
for peace in the region so that economy can be further developed.
</P>
<P>
They made the appeal at the opening ceremony of an
international trade fair here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
On the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Museveni said that he hopes that hostility will be brought to an
end in the DRC so that it can start economic development.
</P>
<P>
President Moi, who came for a one-day visit, said he agreed
with what "his brother" had said and assured the public that his
country does not think terrorism can solve all the human problems
and therefore opposes all forms of terrorism totally.
</P>
<P>
The insecurity in DRC and southern Sudan poses a severe threat
to Uganda's safety, he said, adding that if there is no peace in
the region, this trade fair will not promote trade because people
dare not come out and buy things.
</P>
<P>
"I feel strongly that we should collect all the guns in Africa
so that people can move freely and fearlessly," the 74-year-old
president said.
</P>
<P>
Moi believed that only mediation and dialog can produce a
lasting solution to the security problems some of African
countries face now.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents once again condemned the disastrous bombings
in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam which occurred on August 7 and
expressed condolences to those who lost their dear ones in the
two incidents.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's border with Sudan was recently brought into the
limelight with a national mobilization in Sudan. The Khartoum
government closed all universities and colleges in the country
and asked all young people, who are capable of carrying guns, to
report to the nearest army barracks.
</P>
<P>
Sudan accused Uganda of sending troops to fight alongside with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army which has been fighting
against the Sudanese government for some 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Accuses Syria of Supporting PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Tuesday accused Syria of supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) during his talks with visiting Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the presidential press center said that
Demirel explained the attitude of Syria which supports PKK to
Mubarak during their talks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak arrived here Tuesday to find ways to defuse the
escalating crisis between Ankara and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Demirel told Mubarak that Syria must stop supporting the PKK,
and the necessary concrete steps must be taken in the settlement
to the PKK issue, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering the PKK rebels,
who have been fighting since 1984 for autonomy for the Kurdish
minority in southeastern Turkey and frequently wage cross-border
raids on the Turkish military and civilian targets from their
camps in Iraq, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, together with Iran, has denied the charges, and
criticized, in return, Turkey for forming military alliance with
Israel that threatens the Arab security and undermines Syria's
bargaining position in the peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the presidents of Turkey and Egypt
had "cordial, open and detailed talks" on the mounting tensions
between Anakra and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
"We have talked to the Syrians. We have talked to the Turks,"
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters before
leaving Ankara for Syria.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Turkey Mehdi Fethullah told reporters
here that Mubarak left here for Syria to continue his mediation
between Ankara and Damascus after a five-hour short visit to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Schaeuble Set to Lead German Conservatives in Post-Kohl Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of outgoing chancellor
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Tuesday decided to
nominate Wolfgang Schaeuble as new party chairman to succeed Kohl
who has decided to quit the post after an election defeat last
month.
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble, the 55-year-old preferred heir of Kohl, won the
nomination at a CDU leadership meeting in Bonn Tuesday. His
nomination has still to be approved by a party congress on
November 7.
</P>
<P>
At a separate meeting of parliamentary members of the CDU and
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU),
Schaeuble was also confirmed as the leader of the joint
parliamentary group of the conservative alliance, a post he has
held since 1991.
</P>
<P>
With the possible twin leaderships, Schaeuble, who is Germany's
most popular politician according to opinion polls, is charged
with the task to rejuvenate the conservative camp which is
struggling to digest their worst defeat since 1949 in Germany's
general elections on September 27.
</P>
<P>
The election returned the Social Democratic Party to power
after 16 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has announced that he will give up the CDU chairmanship he
</P>
<P>
has held since 1973 to take personal responsibility for the
election defeat.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's decision immediately triggered a power struggle within
his party, with the younger leaders of the CDU calling for a
generational change to the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
Volker Ruehe, the outgoing defense minister who comes third in
the party hierarchy, also openly criticized Kohl for declaring
Schaeuble the next party chairman before party leaders made the
decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to CDU officials, Ruehe is now one of the five
candidates for the party's four vise-chairman posts.

<HEADLINE> 100623fff S. African International Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- South African
International Trade Exhibition (SAITEX), the largest fair of the
kind in Africa, opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five-day trade event attracted some 1,000 companies from
more than 40 countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin called for the correction of unfair trade
relations between developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not correct the imbalance between developed and
developing, we will not solve the financial problems of the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is no good having large funds in the developed world
seeking investment opportunities, if those investment
opportunities are not taking place in the South as we
industrialize our countries, become manufacturing economies and
trading economies in the world economy."
</P>
<P>
He said hopes for world economic growth lied in the South.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the future growth in the world, despite
the current problems in emerging markets, despite the Southeast
Asian crisis,... does lie in the dramatic increase in trade and
investment between the southern hemisphere countries."
</P>
<P>
"SAITEX is one further step in building this relationship."
</P>
<P>
Erwin also criticized the European Union (EU) for its position
in free trade talks with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Talks broke down last month when the EU refused to make
concessions unless South Africa gives in on wine and spirit.
Erwin said the demand was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was confident that the negotiations would
proceed.
</P>
<P>
Erwin also promised that South Africa would give market access
to its neighbors more rapidly and to a greater extent than they
would.
</P>
<P>
China stole the show on this year's SAITEX with its strong
presence. More than 200 companies are showcasing their products,
ranging from textiles to household appliances and machinery.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls for Negotiated Solution to Comorian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Ocean countries
and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Tuesday called for a
peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis in Comoros.
</P>
<P>
An OAU press release issued here said the member countries of
the Indian Ocean region and the OAU met Tuesday at the OAU
headquarters here at the ambassadorial level to consider the
development of the situation in the Comoros and exchange views on
the ways and means for a speedy settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The release said W.A.W. Nhlapo, South African Permanent
Representativeto the OAU, briefed the meeting on the outcome of
the consultations on August 20 in Pretoria between the OAU and
the representatives of the separatists of Anjouan and another
ministerial meeting in Durban, South Africa, on September 1.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the other on-going efforts aimed at
seeking an early solution to the crisis including the proposed
meeting between Comorian President Mohammed Taki Abdoulkarim and
Leader of the separatists of Anjouan Cheikh Abdallah Ibrahim,
under the auspices of President nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed their serious concern about the
lack of progress in the search for a solution to the crisis as a
result of the intransigent and unrealistic position of the
Anjouanese separatists as demonstrated at the consultative
meeting held in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors believed that any initiative aimed at
consolidating the secessionist program, such as the organization
of the so-called legislative elections due to take place on
October 15 this year, would indicate lack of good faith and
cooperation and would jeopardize the on-going efforts.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors reiterated the determination of the OAU to
ensure the respect of the unity and territorial integrity of the
Comoros, said the release.
</P>
<P>
The participants strongly appealed to the Anjouanese
separatists to seize the opportunity of the proposed meeting
between President Taki and Cheikh Abdallah Ibrahim to commit
themselves to a peaceful and negotiated solution.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Some War Compensation Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 5 (Xinhua)-- Iraq has accused that many
war compensation claims filed to the U.N. Compensation Committee
are coercive and unreasonable, the Iraqi News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadhan made the accusation
in two letters to U.N. secretary-general and the Security Council
president delivered by Iraq's permanent representative to the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
Ramadhan referred to an example in the letters to the
effect that a tourist company in Netherlands demands compensations
on the grounds that it had to cancel some tourist trips from
the Gulf region to Europe during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The vice president pointed out that compensation claims alike
had political purposes which aim to cause harm to the Iraqi
people and delay their right to development.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics released earlier this month, so
far the U.N. Sanctions Committee has paid, from Iraq's proceeds
from oil sales, 1.9 billion U.S. dollars for war compensations.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolutions, Iraq is allowed to export limited
amount of oil to buy food and medicine for its people. Around one
third of its proceeds from oil sales are earmarked for war
compensations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in
1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has expressed deep sorrow and mourning over the death of
Lieutenant Colonel Jet Mwebaze who died in a plane crash in the
Rwenzori mountains in western Uganda recently.
</P>
<P>
President's Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua Tuesday
evening that the president described the officer's death as a
blow to all those who participated in the liberation struggle and
all who love freedom.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to the family of late Mwebaze, the
president hailed the late officer as a gallant soldier and brave
freedom fighter.
</P>
<P>
Museveni paid tribute to his spirit of resisting injustice and
making the highest human sacrifice possible.
</P>
<P>
He will be missed by his fellow comrades in the struggle and
by the people of Uganda, Museveni said, adding that his name will
go down in the annals of the history of the heroic struggle
against oppression in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Brother to the Chief of Staff of Ugandan Army Brigadier James
Kazini, Mwebaze was believed to have died six days after the
plane, which was carrying altogether 10 people, crashed in the
mountain ranges on September 25.
</P>
<P>
He left Entebbe for Bunia and Beni in east of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) aboard a Kenyan registered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
His pistol was later found with only five bullets left inside.
Military sources reportedly believe that he must have fired a few
times, possibly to alert the search party of his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communication said five people have so far been rescued alive,
and three have died and two are still missing.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Strives to Be Self-Reliant in Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, a major power in the
west Africa sub-region, is seeking to strengthen military
self-reliance by producing more weapons and logistics materials
itself.
</P>
<P>
A newsletter published recently by the Defense Headquarters
disclosed that Nigeria plans to develop its own hovercraft,
missile launcher and produce some aircraft equipment as well as
uniform fabrics and footwear.
</P>
<P>
According to the newsletter, the defense research and
development will collaborate with the Lagos State University to
develop an experimental prototype hovercraft capable of carrying
five passengers.
</P>
<P>
The said university has already developed a functional model
of the hovercraft, while all parts required for the production of
a prototype can be sourced locally, the newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
"The present hostilities in the Bakassi Peninsula (claimed by
both Nigeria and Cameroun) coupled with its marshy terrain favor
the use of the hovercraft by the Nigerian Armed Forces", the
newsletter said, adding it is appropriate that Nigeria
intensifies efforts to actualize the local production of
hovercraft.
</P>
<P>
A missile launcher project is also being proposed by the
defense research department. The newsletter said all inputs into
this project would be sourced locally.
</P>
<P>
It added that the success of the project will show Nigeria's
"capability of being self-reliant in the production of these
wares without recourse to foreign vendors."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also plans to end the massive importation of uniform
fabrics and footwear by producing them by itself.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter disclosed that Nigerian manufacturers have
already succeeded in producing some samples.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem facing the self-reliance efforts is fund,
the newsletter said. It proposed the establishment of a
two-billion-Naira (about 24 million U.S. Dollars) Research Trust
Fund to finance defense research and development projects.

AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of the Jordanian
Parliament Tuesday issued a statement asking Turkey and Syria to
settle their crisis through diplomatic means and avoid all forms
of threats and military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The house especially called on Turkey to refrain from threats
of military confrontation and use dialogue as the only means to
settle its disputes with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The house also called on all the governments, parliaments and
influential groups in the world to help defuse the crisis or
prevent any escalation of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Any escalation of the crisis is dangerous, especially at
this critical stage, the house added in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military top officials have manifested that their
country is in a state of undeclared war with Syria due to
Damascus' alleged support for Turkish outlawed Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey insisted that it is ready to use military force against
Syria, if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
Syria on its part contended that a Turkish-Israeli military
alliance is behind the rise of tension between the two neighboring
countries.

</P>
<P>
Wang Yachun, the managing director of China Jiefang

trade ties among the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, UMA Chairman James Wulwana said this
trade fair is a landmark of their standards.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Canada's Building Permits Value Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The total value of building
permits issued in Canada reached 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in
August, up 2.5 percent from July, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In August, residential building intentions gained steam for the
first time in five months, offsetting a slight decline in proposed
non-residential construction.
</P>
<P>
Municipalities in the country issued one billion dollars' worth
of building permits for housing, up 6.4 percent from July, while
the value of non-residential permits fell 1.3 percent to 0.9
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It was a significant rebound for the housing sector which has
recorded monthly declines since April -- except for a slight
increase during June," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in August was due mostly to an increase in the value
of building permits for single-family dwellings, which represent
about 70 percent of the residential sector.
</P>
<P>
The total value of building permits so far this year stands at
14.8 billion dollars, 12.5 percent ahead of the first eight months
of last year, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Weapons Remain in Lesotho: General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of illegal
weapons are floating around in Lesotho after the recent turmoil
in Lesotho, Defense Force chief Lieutenant-General Makhula
Masakeng said in the capital of Maseru Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retrieving these firearms has become the immediate challenge
facing the country's security forces, South African Press
Association quoted Masakeng as saying.
</P>
<P>
In his first media briefing since his reinstatement after
rebel soldiers deposed him last month, Masakeng said: "What is of
concern to the Lesotho security forces is the weapons stolen from
our armories by some of the mutineers."
</P>
<P>
Robbie Hartslief, a senior officer from the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) peace-keeping troops deployed in the
mountain kingdom, said there were still thousands of illegal
weapons, including AK47 assault rifles in the country.
</P>
<P>
The SADC troops from South Africa and Botswana entered Lesotho
on September 22 to quell rising unrest over alleged
irregularities in the May 23 general elections.
</P>
<P>
They ran into fierce resistance from rebel soldiers who had
rendered Lesotho virtually ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a stern warning that the possession of illegal
firearms would not be tolerated, Masakeng urged people with
information of such weapons or arms caches to come forward.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Global Action to Curb Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that concerted global action was needed to resolve
the world financial crisis which was worsening.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that if we act together we can end the present
crisis," Clinton told a joint annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Threatening global financial instability and world recession was
centered in the agenda of the meeting, attended by fiance
ministers and central bank governors from member nations at a
Washington hotel.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day meeting, Clinton noted that the crisis
has rocked much of Asia and Russia and is now threatening to
damage Brazil and other Latin American nations. Even the U.S.
economy is beginning to feel effects of the crisis with slower job
growth and unstable markets.
</P>
<P>
"We must take urgent steps to help those who have been hurt by
it, to limit the reach of it and to restore confidence in the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
He called for solutions that aim not only at the immediate
crisis but at the longer term. "We must modernize and reform the
international financial system to make it ready for the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president renewed his call for the
Republican-controlled Congress to approve 18 billion U.S. dollars
in U.S. funding for the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse with refusing to supply the fire department
with water while the fire is burning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called on Japan to invigorate its economy, largest
in Asia, which has been stuck in a long and steep recession and
deep trouble in its banking system.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Japan's announcement that it would provide 30
billion U.S. dollars in loan guarantees and other assistance to
other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World
Bank Group, called for new international architecture beyond a
short-term financial crisis response.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not have the capacity to deal with social
emergencies, if we do not have longer-term plans for solid
institutions, if we do not have greater equity and social justice,
there will be no political stability and without political
stability no amount of money put together in financial packages
will give us financial stability," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a reform agenda that addresses issues of
governance and social justice as well as far-reaching corporate and
financial sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the World Bank was moving towards a new
"total" approach towards its development work, moving the Bank
"beyond projects" and, in partnership with governments and civil
society, to rigorously pursue the social and structural priorities
needed to champion sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, Chairman of the Executive Board and Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund put forward a five
principles to form a new architecture, including transparency,
soundness of financial systems, involvement of the private sector,
orderly liberalization of capital flows, and modernization of
international markets.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's gold production Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to a projected slump
in Ghana's gold production and earnings for 1998, the metal's
News Agency (GNA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Production returns released by the Mines Department Tuesday,
showed about 20 percent increase in the value of gold produced
between January and June, GNA said in a special report to Xinhua
based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
From a first half-year value of 260.17 million U.S. Dollars in
1997, Ghana is expected to receive 324.78 million Dollars from
3.05 million ounces of gold produced for the same period this
year.
</P>
<P>
By June 1997, Ghana had produced 718,640 fine ounces and by
December it increased to 1.57 million fine ounces, according to
the Department's tallies.
</P>
<P>
The government, in its 1998 budget, projected a fall in gold
export earnings to 528.6 million Dollars from 1997's 563.7
million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
But, while the projection was based on a preceding bad year
and the falling gold prices on the international bullion market,
domestic volume of gold production has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The mining terrain, though, has been turbulent with inadequate
power supply, high tariffs which have swollen the production cost
of the companies and external depressed gold market, most of the
mines have adopted measures to sustain production targets or
increased it.
</P>
<P>
But, analysts have predicted a sloppy third quarter earnings
from a contraction in production levels as a result of the
cumulative effect of the energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ghana was plunged into a severe energy shortage for most part
of the year from bad weather which dried up water from its main
hydro-electric dam at Akosombo. Restoring normalcy in power
supply resulted in high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
This, has pushed up the production cost of most mines since
April when the crisis was heightened, from about 228 to 260
dollars an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Starts Controlling Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- New Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday evening announced that the Russian
government has been formed and started to take emergency measures
to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
In a television address Primakov emphasized that it is a matter
of creating normal living conditions for Russian citizens.
</P>
<P>
The government will perform obligations to pay monetary
allowances to servicemen and to pay current salaries to all
persons on the state payroll, Primakov said, adding current
pensions will be paid in October, and the payments will be further
done every month.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the government will pay all the debts to
veterans and help regions with the payment of salaries to
teachers, physicians and cultural workers.
</P>
<P>
The most important for Russia at present is to create
conditions for setting the real economy in motion, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the important role of assistance and foreign
investments in industry, agriculture and the infrastructure,
Primakov noted, "we are aware of that the stress should be put on
the development of the domestic production."
</P>
<P>
In his words, the real economy will not start working and
gaining momentum when the banking system is not revived; the clots
in all channels such as nonpayments between the budget and
enterprises and between enterprises themselves are not eliminated
and a taxation system are not set up.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to restructure the whole banking system as soon
as possible, Primakov said. The Central Bank and the government
are separating all the commercial banks into those that can and
must continue operating and those that are to be liquidated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to make proposals shortly on improving
the taxation system, in particular by reducing the producer's tax
burden, tightening the tax administering system and fighting the
shadow economy, Primakov remarked.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the taxation system must be built so as to
move much of that economy from the shadows and enable it to
operate in line with regulation, with the law.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak stopped over in Damascus, capital of Syria, on his way
back from Ankara to continue his mediation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Damascus International Airport, Mubarak
was met by Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and other top
officials. He later held talks with the Syrian side on the stance
of the Turkish leadership toward the Syrian-Turkish dispute.
</P>
<P>
In Ankara, Mubarak held talks for more than two hours with
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on ways of defusing the
mounting tensions between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for
autonomy for the Kurdish minority in southeastern Turkey and
frequently wage cross-border raids on the Turkish military and
civilian targets from their camps in Iraq, Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, together with Iran, has denied the charges, and
criticized, in return, Turkey for forming military alliance with
Israel that threatens the Arab security and undermines Syria's
bargaining position in the peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Mubarak visited Syria where he held talks with
al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Opposes Use of Ground Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Tuesday he opposed any use of U.S. ground
troops in Kosovo, but warned that NATO air strikes hit Serbs hard
if they do not quickly comply with U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen
said that the airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) could destroy a "substantial portion" of Serbia's military
power.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told the lawmakers that failures to launch such strikes
would assure continued "arrogance" by (Yugoslav President)
Milosevic in ignoring U.N. and NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen said that the U.S. should not provide any ground
troops to the region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that the United States would supply the
preponderance of air power for any NATO strikes and that any
ground operation should be the responsibility of European nations.
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress oppose sending U.S. ground troops to
Kosovo because the use of thousands of American and other
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia has continued for more than two
years with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
"We have, I think, a different situation between Kosovo and
Bosnia and I don't believe it would take that kind of a presence
that we have in Bosnia" to secure peace in Kosovo, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia
unless Belgrade authorities end the conflict with Kosovo Albanian
separatists and negotiates an autonomy agreement with them for the
southern Serbian province.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- families of the nine Iranian
diplomats and reporter killed by the Afghan Taliban forces in
northern Afghanistan on Tuesday called for trying the Taliban
leaders for the crime.
</P>
<P>
The families made the call in a letter to the U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan delivered to visiting U.N. envoy
Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who arrived here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The letter, read in a meeting between Ibrahimi and the
families, called for immediate delivery of the bodies of three
other Iranian diplomats, which were still at the Taliban's hands,
the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of six Iranian diplomats and the IRNA reporter
were returned to Tehran last month.
</P>
<P>
The families also urged to identify and put on trial
those responsible for the killing of Iranians in Mazari Sharif,
northern Afghanistan, at an international court under the
supervision of the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The letter called on Annan to dispatch a fact-finding
mission to Afghanistan as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Surge after Consecutive Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Shares across Europe recovered
strongly Tuesday after falling sharply over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
London shares rebounded after suffering four days of heavy
losses. The FTSE 100, the blue chip share index was up 205.3
points, or more than 3 percent, at 4854.
</P>
<P>
The market was lifted by better performances in Europe and
Tokyo and hopes that the 0.5 percent interest rate cut in Spain
would be reflected by the Bank of England on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen one or two big players, who have been absent of
late, nibbling away," said the head of equity trading at a leading
European investment bank. "There are still some sellers out there
but with the hope of an interest rate cut later in the week, maybe
things will steady up a bit."
</P>
<P>
Bank shares, which have been savaged by fears over the health
of the world economy, were in favour again with Bank of Scotland
shares surging more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish central bank reduced its key intervention rate by
0.50 percent to 3.75 percent. The move reduced the difference
between Spanish and German rates, something that will be necessary
before the euro is created in less than three months time.
</P>
<P>
That move, and remarks by the Bundesbank President Hans
Tietmeyer in Washington, spurred hopes that there would be
coordinated interest rate cuts across Europe. He said the
international crisis may make such cuts necessary.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's Dax ended up over 4 percent at 4815, up
214 points. The strong performance was boosted by Wall Street's
strong opening at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
German shares also benefited from a strengthening of the
dollar, which would help exporters.
</P>
<P>
But there were still worries for the banking sector, after two
big banks were put on credit watch. Deutsche Bank shares suffered
after the bank forecast weaker profits due to international
turbulence. Paris
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks opened higher on rate cut optimism. The Cac 40
index of leading shares ended up 156 points, or nearly 5 percent,
to 3136, recovering some of its big losses last week.
</P>
<P>
Some of shares which had experienced sharp falls recently, like
Alcatel, continued their recovery.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO Prepared to Use Force in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
was prepared to act in Kosovo if Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic did not comply fully with the U.N. demands.
</P>
<P>
Clinton gave the warning in a speech to the joint secretariat
meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who spoke to Blair for about 20 minutes on the
telephone about Kosovo Tuesday, said "we all agree that Kosovo is
a powder keg in the Balkans," one that left unchecked could
threaten the stability of other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
"If the violence continues, it could spill over and threaten
the peace and stability of Bosnia, of Albania, of Macedonia and
other countries in the region," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, in meetings with
Milosevic, was reiterating that Milosevic must comply with U.N.
demands that he declare an immediate cease-fire, withdraw Serb
forces, give humanitarian relief groups full and immediate access
to Kosovo and begin real negotiations with Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Holbrooke was telling Milosevic that "NATO is
prepared to act" if the Yugoslav president failed to meet the U.N.
demands.
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are high; the time is now to end the violence in
Kosovo. I hope all of you will do whatever you can to that end,"
he told the meeting which focuses on world financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"What is already a humanitarian crisis could turn into a
catastrophe. Some 250,000 people have been forced to flee their
homes. Of that number, approximately 50,000 are actually homeless.
As winter sets in, they risk freezing or starving to death,"
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA's Foreign Arms Suppliers Tried in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Angola government has
brought eight foreigners to court for involvement in flying arms
to the opposition National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Eight foreigners were recently tried in a court in Menibgue,
capital of Cuando-Cubango Province in southern Angola for
intruding into the country's air space and supplying arms to
UNITA, the Angolan News Agency Angog reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners -- six South Africans, one Belgian and one
Congolese from Democratic Congo -- were detained after they were
forced to land by the government air planes on January 20 this
year while they were transporting arms to UNITA in southern
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Among them, some were charged for supplying arms and logistics
to UNITA many times and for encroaching on the sovereignty and
security of Angola, and for breaking the United Nations'
sanctions on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Though four of the eight escaped from prison in August, they
were tried in absentia, a statement from the court said.
</P>
<P>
Arms and mining equipment, all banned by the U.N. sanctions,
were found on their plane after it was forced to land, and they
admitted their destination was to Andulo, an important strategic
city in central Angola controlled by UNITA, for delivering the
equipment to UNITA.

Netanyahu in Jerusalem in the morning and then met with
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in Jerico in
 the afternoon. She described both meetings as "useful."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright was encouraged that both leaders have
got down to business, adding that "substantive progress" has
been made.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman hinted that an agreement on the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank could be reached during a summit
between Netanyahu, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Clinton initiated the summit during a three-way meeting with
Netanyahu and Arafat in Washington last week. There were
reports of progress during that meeting.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is scheduled to stay in the region till
Wednesday, will try to "lock in" the progress on many issues
during her talks with the two sides, and U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross and Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk
will "further clear the underbrush," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The scope of the second Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank has been "largely resolved", he said. But he described
the issue of security cooperation between Israel and the
Palestinians as "more complicated."
</P>
<P>
Arafat announced in Washington last week that the
Palestinians would accept the Israeli proposal that Israel
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, as an American
initiative demands, but 3 percent will be a nature reserve
under joint Israeli-Palestinian security control.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to confirm or deny reports that the U.S.
and Israel have reached agreement on the security issue and
now it is up to the Palestinians to accept it, saying that
the U.S. is trying to "institutionalize" the security cooperation
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that a three-way meeting between
Albright, Netanyahu and Arafat will be held Wednesday morning.
Some have said that such a meeting will signify that
significant progress has been made.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Basketball Referees Concern IRS Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A special agent for the
Internal Revenue Service believes that U.S. college basketball
referees who gamble may be vulnerable to offers to fix games.
</P>
<P>
"To me, one of the biggest areas of concern is the referees,"
agent Tom Moriarty said. "Are they monitored for gambling?"
</P>
<P>
Moriarty made his remarks last week at a DePaul
University-sponsored sports gambling seminar.
</P>
<P>
"Our office has numerous cases of NBA referees who cash in
their first-class tickets provided by the league to ride coach
and pocket the difference in fares," Moriarty said. "They are
given IRS forms by the league to fill out listing this as taxable
income.
</P>
<P>
"At least nine have not done this and have been prosecuted for
criminal tax evasion. If they do that and jeopardize their
occupations for amounts from $500 to $1,200, what would someone
who has a gambling problem do if he could make $20,000, $40,000
or $80,000 by shaving points in a game?"
</P>
<P>
In all of the U.S. college basketball scandals dating from the
1940s, there never has been an accusation that a referee
influenced the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Every point-shaving incident has involved men's basketball
programs. However, at the DePaul seminar, NCAA agent Bill Saum
cautioned, "We cannot forget about women's athletics in the field
of gambling. It's just a matter of time before unsavory
individuals reach out to our women. People love to wager on what
they see on TV. Now there's a betting line on the entire NCAA
women's tournament."

<HEADLINE> China Has Rolls-Royce's Best Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce's Chairman Sir Ralph
Robins, who is here with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
said today that XR Aerocomponents Co., Ltd. (XRA), a joint venture
of Rolls-Royce and a company in Xi'an has been very successful and
is probably one of the best of all of Rolls Royce's joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
XRA delivered its first parts for Rolls-Royce last May. The
director of operation for Rolls-Royce said that this showed them
the tremendous potential for collaboration with China.
</P>
<P>
Robins said that XRA's success was not achieved in one day. He
himself has visited China at least once a year since the late
1970's, he explains, and that this is a really big market, a
market of the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has looked into the Chinese market of the next
20 years, and wants to occupy 40 percent of the civil aviation
market here.
</P>
<P>
His confidence has not been in the least diminished by the
Asian Financial Crisis, which did seem to hurt the economy on the
continent, but not its attractiveness in the long run.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Chinese airlines now use Rolls-Royce engines on more
than 150 aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Blair Talks About New UK-China Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, told a dinner hosted by the British Chamber of Commerce
here this evening, said that a new ear in UK-China relations has
opened.
</P>
<P>
If Britain is to build a new partnership with China, they need
to broaden their efforts, he told those present, and said that the
scale and pace of modernization in China are breathtaking, and
that China will be one of the great economies and political forces
of the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that a new chapter in commercial relations has also
opened, pointing to Britain's exports to China increasing by 25
percent last year. Britain is by far the largest European investor
in China, with 12 billion pounds of investment pledged, and over
2,000 British joint ventures operating in China, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had a "very positive discussion" yesterday with
Premier Zhu Rongji on other potential British investments and
contracts worth over 3 billion pounds and that Britain plans to
open a fourth consulate in Chongqing. He announced that there will
be three new projects, worth over 30 million pounds, for improved
health services, prevention of AIDs, and improved water supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was impressed by Chinese leadership's hands-off
approach to Hong Kong and that the British are able to focus not
on concerns about how Hong Kong is run, but on how Hong Kong can
best weather the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Blair also applauded China's measured response to the financial
crisis, saying that China's determination not to devalue the
Chinese yuan has been crucial to stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have reached a broad consensus
on dealing with the crisis, and agreed that analysts and finance
ministers in both countries will work together to address the
issue next month and that China has much to contribute.

Wednesday advised its nationals to leave Yugoslavia because of
possible NATO air strikes over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry also asked French travellers
not to go to Yugoslavia until further notice.
</P>
<P>
The French embassy in Belgrade on Wednesday delivered the
advice to French nationals in Yugoslavia, including the embassy
personnel and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 French nationals in Yugoslavia.

<P>
Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain have also urged their
nationals to leave Yugoslavia.

President Slobodan Milosevic did not meet the U.N. requests, NATO
would take action.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces had made all preparations for the air strikes and
the countdown had started, he warned.

strikes, likely to be decided in coming days, could be avoided if

<HEADLINE> Sudan Asks for Clarifications About Mubarak's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has officially asked
Cairo through diplomatic channels for clarifications about
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's remarks on the potentials of
Al-Shifaa pharmaceutical plant to produce chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Sudanese daily "Al Rai Al Am" quoted Sudanese
Minister of Culture and Information and government spokesman Ghazi
Salah el-Din as saying that Mubarak's remarks have undermined the
credit which the two peoples have built in order to bridge the
gap that hit bilateral relations in the past.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sudanese National Assembly (parliament) on
Tuesday, the Sudanese minister said that Mubarak's statements do
not match with Egypt's previous attitudes and do not correspond
with the efforts Egypt claims to be making in favor of Sudan's
cause.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Egyptian weekly Al-Ahram's board
chairman and editor-in-chief Ibrahim Nafie on the silver jubilee
of the October 1973 War, Mubarak said that "we know it (the
factory) is a pharmaceutical factory but it is capable of
producing ingredients for chemical weapons. There is another
chemical factory close to it."
</P>
<P>
El-Din also indicated that Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail, during a recent meeting with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa, had also called for clarifications.
</P>
<P>
He said that such statements might justify the American
aggression against the pharmaceutical factory which was destroyed
by American missiles on August 20 on the grounds that it produced
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Khartoum from Cairo Tuesday, Ismail stated
that he had had a meeting with Moussa, adding that Sudan and Egypt
were in the process of making plans to normalize relations between
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri Wednesday wrapped up his three-day visit to Saudi
Arabia, during which he discussed with Saudi leaders Arab and
Islamic issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Riyadh said Hariri, who met with Saudi King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Defense and Aviation Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, discussed with
them the current dispute between Syria and Turkey, Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are mounting between Damascus and Ankara after they
traded accusations against each other, and Turkey reportedly
threatened to resort to military option against Syria. Turkey
accused Syria of harboring and supporting the Kurdish Workers'
Party rebels fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria has lashed out at Turkey, a predominantly Muslim
country, for forming military alliance with Israel, which it says
is targeted against the Arab world, especially itself, and
undermines its bargaining position in negotiations with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Damascus
insists on its return as a condition for peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Hariri also discussed the Middle East peace
process which stalled for 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Greece Agree to Cooperate in Handling Turkish-Syrian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Greece agreed Wednesday to
cooperate in dealing with strained relations between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with his Greek
counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev described the recent escalation of tension in relations
between Turkey and Syria as "a serious issue."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and Greece had agreed to study all aspects of
relations between Turkey and Syria through the exchange of
information and analyses on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
There was a high risk of the problems getting worse because of the
launching of threats and lesser importance being attached to their
peaceful settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he would fly to Damascus to discuss the
matter with Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
While expressing concern at the escalation in tension between
Turkey and Syria, Tsohatzopoulos urged the international community to
send the message to Ankara that Turkey's threats to use force in
resolving its disputes with Syria and its incursion into northern Iraq
were "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's threats to prevent Cyprus from installing the
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Tsohatzopoulos said that as
U.N. members, both Greece and Cyprus were exercising their inalienable
right to implement a joint defense policy against a foreign threat.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Sergeyev said that they were very careful in all their
movements from the viewpoint of international law.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers agreed during their talks to promote policies of
collective security to confront crisis in the greater area of the
Black Sea and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev is currently in Greece for a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Johnson to Race Against Horses and Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Ben Johnson, thwarted
repeatedly in his attempt to be reinstated into track and field,
has turned to racing against horses and cars.
</P>
<P>
Morris Chrobotek, Johnson's agent, confirmed that the
36-year-old sprinter from Canada will participate in a bizarre
exhibition race on October 15 in Charlette town, Prince Edward
Island.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had the Olympic gold medal and 100-meter world
record stripped after testing positive for drugs at the 1988
Seoul Olympics, will run against a standardbred pacer, a
thoroughbred and a stock car in an event organized by the
Atlantic Lottery Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the race will go to the Charlottetown chapter of
the Children's Wish Foundation, which organizes trips and
celebrity visits for terminally ill children.
</P>
<P>
Lottery spokesman Mike Randall said the idea for the spectacle
came from his organization, which holds a fund-raiser each year
for the charity.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's probably the most unique event we've ever had,"
Randall said, adding it will be a serious race. "Ben is running
to win, the horses are running to win and I know the driver
always drives to win. It will be a lot of fun but what's
important is we're going to be able to raise some money for a
very worthwhile cause."
</P>
<P>
"The main reason Ben is doing this is to give something back
to the kids," Chrobotek said.
</P>
<P>
But even Chrobotek, who has been leading Johnson's attempt to
overturn his lifetime ban from track for using drugs, couldn't
help cracking jokes about the charity event.
</P>
<P>
"We want the horses tested for drugs after the race,"
Chrobotek said. "We want someone to look at the engine of the car
too."

<HEADLINE> EU Acts to Reduce Emission From Burning Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it had proposed regulation on the incineration of
waste to limit the emission of dangerous pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The proposed regulation aimed at reducing total emission of
dioxins and furants from the burning of municipal waste, clinical
waste and sewage sludge to approximately 11 grams per year by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The aim is expected to be achieved even with the expected
increase in the amount of waste incinerated.
</P>
<P>
This would mean a reduction in excess of 99 percent relative to
the 1994 level, according to commission officials.
</P>
<P>
Emissions to air from the incineration of clinical and
municipal wastes are now approximately 2,300 grams per year in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The burning of waste has been identified as the largest known
source of emission of dioxins and furants to air in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is supposed to be the most toxic man-made substance.
The most toxic is a known human carcinogen. The compounds produce
chloracne at high exposures and a wide range of non-cancer effects
are thought to occur at extremely low levels of chronic exposure,
including adverse effects on reproduction, impacts on the
development of the unborn foetus and associations with impaired
mental ability.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies estimated that emission from waste burning
account for 36,000 kilograms per year of mercury and 16,000
kilograms per year of cadmium in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The full implementation of the commission proposed regulation
on waste burning should reduce the total estimated emissions of
mercury and cadmium from incineration to 7,100 kilograms per year
and to 1,100 kilograms per year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exposure to mercury has been found to affect the nervous system
and the kidneys and may cause foetal damage while cadmium exposure
has been associated to lung cancer and kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
The amount of municipal waste incinerated in the 15-nation
European Union is expected to increase from 31 million tons per
year in 1990 to 56.5 million tons per year in 2004. The costs
were estimated to be around 550 million ECU (605 million U.S.
dollars) per year at the time being.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey accused Syria again
Wednesday of supporting militants of its outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), warning of "deterrent measures" against the neighbor.
</P>
<P>
"Eradicating separatist terrorism to preserve territorial
integrity and security of our citizens is the leading
responsibility of our government," Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said after a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
But "the most important obstacle" preventing Turkey from
attaining the goal is Syria's support for the Kurdish separatists
for years, Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that his country will "take all kinds of deterrent
measures against Syria" if Damascus does not back down on its
policy.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has long accused Damascus of sheltering PKK militants, a
charge denied by Syria. To show strength, Turkey has reportedly
massed troops backed by tanks and heavy artillery along the border
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have been at odds over issues including
Kurdish rebels, water sharing and Turkey's close military
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria has accused Turkey of forging a military alliance with
the Jewish state, which it says will endanger the interests of the
Arab world and undermine its bargaining positions in the
negotiations with Israel.

population, according to Zhang Wenfan, president of the China
Association for the Elderly.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest number of elderly now, at 120 million, a
fifth of the world's total, Zhang told a symposium on aging in
northeastern Asian countries today.
</P>
<P>
And that number is expected to be above 400 million by the year
2050, or 1 out of every 4 Chinese a senior citizen.
</P>
<P>
China is experiencing a much faster change to an elderly
society than many industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The number of elderly has been growing by 3.2 percent per year
since the 1980s, he said, and the number of people over 80 keeps
increasing as life expectancy gets longer.
</P>
<P>
And, this has caused many problems. Traditional methods of
caring for the elderly depended solely on family members, but are
difficult to apply now because the family is becoming smaller, the
young people in rural areas move to cities, more females have
jobs, and so on, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium has Chinese, Japanese and Korean
specialists discussing new methods of combining family-based
caring and community service to provide a better life for the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Chief Rejects Calls for Rate Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank president,
Hans Tietmeyer, has reiterated his opposition to a cut in the
country's interest rates as hoped by many financial experts to
help avert a possible global economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German Die Zeit newspaper, Tietmeyer
said that European interest rates must first converge at the
German levels ahead of the formal launch of the single European
currency on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the recent cut in U.S. interest rates was
not a model for Germany.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. rates are over five percent. Ours are a little bit above
3.0 percent. Nobody can truly hope that we take the Americans as a
model interest-rate level," Tietmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
European economies have seen no major impact from the financial
crises in Asia and Russia so far. But international financial
experts argue that Europe cannot not escape a global slowdown in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
Under increasing pressure for a rate cut, Tietmeyer said
earlier this week in Washington that the German central bank would
only move if the global economic crisis worsened.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Reduce Restrictions on Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Wednesday signed an
agreement to remove restrictions on investment to make the region
more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo Severino, attending the two-day
ASEAN economic minister meeting which began Wednesday, said the
agreement to set up an "ASEAN Investment Area" will make it easier
for investors in one country to invest in other countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, national treatment, which means
both local and foreign investors will be treated in the same way,
will be extended to ASEAN investors by 2010 and to all other
investors by 2020.
</P>
<P>
All industries will be opened to outside investors, except
those that affect national security and public morals, those
relating to the protection of human, animal or plant life and
those necessary to comply with laws to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
In case of serious imbalance of payments and financial woes, an
ASEAN country is allowed to impose investment restrictions, but
the restrictions must be "temporary and should not harm other
ASEAN nations," the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
Each country can also draw up a list of investment areas or
industries that can not be opened up immediately. But the list
must be phased out by 2010, except for Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam,
ASEAN's most recent members.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the economic ministers also signed an
agreement under which ASEAN nations will notify each other of any
changes in trade policies, including tariffs, quotas, surcharges,
customs valuation, export taxes and foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: China Makes Headway in Investment System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Xinhua Writer Qian Yuhong
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China has two venture funds for
small businesses that are considered a significant part of its
investment system reforms, with high return and high risk referred
to as a kind of "risk investment", that is more efficient than
investments of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
They will be used specifically to develop new technology to
perfect the industrial mix, according to an economist with the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest governing body, has decided
to put 3 billion yuan into the two funds, with hopes of initiating
risk investment.
</P>
<P>
Inefficient, poorly managed investment have been a major
headache for the Chinese government, which used to be the sole
investor and decision maker under the planned economy, so it began
the investment reforms in 1978 and set up a new system more
oriented to the market economy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The reforms include improved controls, separating commercial
loans from policy-oriented loans through a State Development Bank,
and adopting a responsibility system and have resulted in more
investors, diverse funding, and more scientific investment.
</P>
<P>
Fixed assets investment also grew from 1980 to 1997, with 14.16
trillion yuan for 763,588 projects.
</P>
<P>
However, economists point out that the reform of China's
investment system is still stunted by the planned economy. The
nation also lacks an efficient management system to supervise
investments and needs to increase market reforms for investment,
economists say.

<HEADLINE> British Court Hears "Case" in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A British moot court case that
was heard in Beijing today was attended by Chinese and British
members of the legal professional, journalists, and briefly by the
British prime minister's wife who is visiting China along with the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It was part of British Law Week and showed a trial of the Queen
vs. John Hotfoot who was accused of being the driver of a getaway
car for three armed robbers. He contended that he was forced to
drive them at gunpoint while he was just waiting for his mother on
the street. The robbers were still at large.
</P>
<P>
The judge was Lord Justice Otton of the Court of
Appeals. Prosecution and defense council were provided by two
members of the Queen's Council, and the jury was made up of 12
Chinese legal experts.
</P>
<P>
This interesting exchange can help people understand each other
better, according to Yan Junxing, president of the Chinese
Ministry of Justice's Judicial Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
"China introduced several major reforms to its legal system in
recent years, like establishing the principle of presumption of
innocence and statutory crimes and punishments, which are elements
of Anglo-American laws," he said. China's legal system is getting
closer to the British in certain aspects, but China is weak in the
execution and implementation of laws, he explains, adding that the
Chinese legal community will benefit a lot from this meeting.

<HEADLINE> British Court Hears "Case" in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's moot court shows some flaws in the British legal system
that need improvement, Yan said. For example, the defendant has no
right to argue for himself, and the fact that lawyers have too big
a role to play is likely to result in an unfair verdict because of
the different abilities of lawyers, he added.
</P>
<P>
And, long, drawn out hearings obviously put a financially-weak
defendant at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
Lord Justice Otton, who was the judge, said that the British
and Chinese legal systems have their own characteristics and that
the purpose of the moot court was to show how the British system
works, not to ask the hosts to follow the British example.
</P>
<P>
The British legal system is also changing as more British
courts try to solve business disputes and other cases out of the
court through mediation, arbitration and reconciliation, which are
widely practiced in China.
</P>
<P>
One British diplomat commented that if the British people
understand more about Chinese law and the legal system they will
probably be more interested in investing in China and the same is
true about the Chinese and British law. Cooperation and exchanges
in legal affairs between the two countries can promote economic,
trade and technological cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The moot court hearing will be broadcast later by television and
radio stations in China.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Urges Effective U.S. Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat Wednesday called for effective mediation from Washington to
broker a deal over Israeli troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Time is running out (for the U.S.) to arrange something on the
ground," Erekat said in a telephone interview with the Egyptian
Voice of Arabs Radio.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
is on a two-day mission in the Mideast to try to narrow the gaps
between the Palestinians and Israel ahead of a mid-October
Washington summit, which is designed to complete a deal on Israeli
troops withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On table is a U.S. initiative, which calls on Israel to hand
back 13 percent more of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which initially rejected the formula, proposed to hand
over 10 percent and turn the other 3 percent into a nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
After talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton last month in
Washington, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
accepted the Israeli proposal.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, then, invited Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to return to Washington in mid-October to
complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
But Erekat said that so far Albright "has not provided the
Palestinian side with any Israeli commitment to implement the
U.S. initiative."
</P>
<P>
According to Erekat, shortly before his meeting with Albright,
Netanyahu decided that Israel would press ahead with plans to set
up a new settlement neighborhood in Arab areas.
</P>
<P>
"It is something that underlines Israel's determination to foil
the peace drive. Israel is the party which undermines and thwarts
the peace process because of its unilateral measures," he
stressed.

LONDON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The six-nation Contact Group
ministers on former Yugoslavia are likely to meet in London on
Thursday to discuss the Kosovo crisis, a Western diplomat said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Office has already sent out the invitations and
it would be very surprising if the meeting did not go ahead as
planned," Reuters quoted the diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the British Foreign Office declined to confirm whether
the meeting would take place, France and Russia on Wednesday said
they would send their foreign ministers Hubert Vedrine and Igor
Ivanov respectively to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the meeting would be the last chance to get
the Russians on board before NATO launches air strikes against
Yugoslavia over Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed the idea of NATO air strikes against
Yugoslav forces without a specific United Nations Security Council
resolution and threated to veto the proposal of air strikes at the
UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group comprises Britain, the United States,
Russia, Germany, Italy and France.

<HEADLINE> NATO Still Not Decided on Action in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- NATO said on Wednesday that the
western military alliance was "fully ready" and the "next
decision" would be on activating the air strikes it menaced for
quite some time.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the
press that the allies were expecting an action order in the next
few days after the 16 NATO member states have reached consensus on
the legality and military objectives of the action to be taken.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the decision could be made in the next 48
hours, the official said that NATO was not prescribing a deadline
for its action.
</P>
<P>
But NATO officials and statesmen from major western countries
have kept saying that time is running out for Slobodan Milosevic
and that he'd better comply fully with the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs).
</P>
<P>
The same official said that NATO countries are now going
through the democratic process of getting parliamentary and
governmental approvals before the allies could get the consensus
for its go-ahead decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that the key for the turn-on of the green light from
member states was the conviction that Belgrade had not complied
with the UNSCRs, especially the Resolution 1199 adopted on
September 23. The resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire and
an entry to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia still has 14,000 regular
troops and 11,000 military police force remaining in Kosovo,
compared with 36,000 troops and police forces there 10 days ago,
according to the official who added that NATO estimated that 15
percent of the civilian housing in Kosovo had been damaged by the
Serbian forces in the past month.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the extent of the potential NATO intervention
in Kosovo, the official said that the allies were ready for the
air strikes but were still looking at plans for limited ground
deployment after the cease-fire to maintain the peace.
</P>
<P>
"No decision has been taken yet as regards ground deployment,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations on Tuesday discussed U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's status quo report on Kosovo but stopped short of
giving a mandate for the use of force by NATO in the region.
</P>
<P>
While answering what would be the legal basis for NATO action
if there is no U.N. resolution to that effect, the official said
that a collective understanding on the part of the 16 NATO member
states would offer the allies a sort of legal basis they all feel
comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was growing, said the official.
</P>
<P>
It would be a new departure for NATO to find for its actions in
non-NATO countries the legality by way of reaching consensus. In
1995, NATO waited for U.N. resolutions before intervening in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO official told the press that irreversibility was the
key in deciding NATO actions. Actions have to be resorted to if
there is no other alternative, said the official.
</P>
<P>
But he added that ultimate diplomatic push was being given to
both the Serbians and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The official could not confirm whether United States Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright would make a trip to Brussels to
attend a planned ministerial meeting of NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted NATO sources as saying that the trip had
been called off and there might not be the meeting scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
What the official confirmed was that NATO was looking forward
to the outcome for the next emergency meeting of the six-nation
Contact Group.

<HEADLINE> 70 Percent of Tobacco-related Deaths to Occur by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco-related deaths in
developing countries by the 2020s will rise from 50 to 70
percent, according to a report obtained Thursday from the office
of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP)'s resident
representative in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The publication entitled "Human Development Report 1998" and
prepared by UNDP cited the World Health Organization (WHO)'s
estimate which indicates that 3.5 million people die annually
from causes related to tobacco use at present, but by the 2020s
the death toll is likely to reach 10 million each year.
</P>
<P>
In both industrial and developing countries, half of regular
smokers die from causes related to their tobacco use, said the
228-page report, adding that smokers are three times as likely to
die between the ages of 35 and 69 as are non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP report also pointed out that since 1970s, most
industrial countries which register half of the tobacco-related
deaths at present have mounted anti-smoking campaigns while in
most developing countries the marketing and advertising campaigns
of tobacco have intensified.
</P>
<P>
Per capita cigarette consumption fell by 10 percent between
the early 1970s and early 1990s in industrial countries, but in
the same period consumption increased by 64 percent in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
What's more, per capita consumption more than doubled in
Haiti, Indonesia, Nepal, Senegal and Syria while tripled in
Cameroun and China in the same period, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian Neil Stephens has
retired after a 14-year racing career, according to reports from
Valkenburg, the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
the Reports said on Wednesday that Stephens was a member of
the Festina squad expelled from the Tour de France after an
alleged confession by their team manager Bruno Roussel that his
riders had used banned substances.
</P>
<P>
However, the 35-year-old Stephens was quoted as saying that
the alleged drug scandal "Is not the reason for my retiring". He
said this from his Spanish home on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I said that I would do two more years with Festina and then
stop riding, and it is disappointing that I am finishing my
career on this note."
</P>
<P>
He has denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs and
is ready to defend his innocence by legal means if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Union Cycliste Internationale have called for the files on
five French riders and Stephens to be dealt with as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Stephens competed for Australia in the Commonwealth Games but
was banned by the UCI from competing in the world road
championships in Valkenburg.

<HEADLINE> Computers in Alberta Unprepared for Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The millennium computer bug is
set to cause chaos in the Canadian province of Alberta because of
the provincial government's failure to tackle the problem, a
senior official has warned.
</P>
<P>
The bug could raise serious risks in the health-care system if
it causes a shutdown in medical equipment and computer systems
after January 1, 2000, provincial Auditor-General Peter Valentine
said in his annual report released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Valentine warned that other essential services, such as power,
gas and telecommunications were also threatened.
</P>
<P>
The government and other organizations such as the disaster
services branch need to quickly identify the risks and develop
contingency plans to protect Albertans, whose safety could be in
jeopardy, Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem refers to the chaos that computer experts
believe will occur on January 1, 2000. Many computer systems use
only two digits to identify the year which could lead them to
assume that 2000 is 1900 and malfunction.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Prime Minister Tony
Blair said he hopes for close cooperation between Britain and
China to jointly further the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the remark here earlier today while addressing the
opening ceremony of the "Reform of State-Owned Enterprises -- UK
and Chinese Experience" seminar, jointly sponsored by the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the Great Britain-China Center,
and the British Ministry of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Blair said both Britain and China face the need to modernize
their economies to cope with the challenges of the new world
economy and improve the lives of their people.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the participants will have a good
exchange of views, demonstrating bilateral mutual trust and
friendship, and that the seminar will lead to more cooperation and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 representatives from government departments, research
institutions and enterprises are attending the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
President of the CASS Li Tieying said this is a good
opportunity for scholars, government departments and enterprises
of the two sides to engage in broad discussions to promote mutual
understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Blair then took part in meetings via live
satellite link with participants at an ongoing international
financial seminar in Wuhan, and "face to face" with several staff

SINGAPORE, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Singapore Air
Force (RSAF) Wednesday received the delivery of six F-16C/D
Fighting Falcons purchased from the United States, the Ministry of
Defense announced in a news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes landed at the Tengah Air Base on the island in

Base, U.S, and their arrival brings to 10 the total number of the
F-16C/Ds which will constitute RSAF's major fighting force in
recent future, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Six F-16C/Ds are the second batch of delivery of the 18
aircraft which the RSAF purchased in 1994 from the U.S. The first
batch of four F-16C/Ds returned to Singapore in August.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said the rest of the squadron will
return shortly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the RSAF placed another order for 12 more F-16C/Ds
last year and the order will augment RSAF's F-16C/D force to 30
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and the U.S. reached an agreement in 1996 that the
RSAF's F-16C/D training program, which is planned to end at 2003,
will be extended to 2018.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Foreign Currency Reserves Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean foreign currency
reserves hit 15 billion U.S. dollars at the end of September,
compared to only 4.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, said the Bank
of Korea Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 94 percent of the reserves is corporate savings while 700
million dollars, or six percent, are deposits by individuals.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight percent was deposited with local commercial banks,
eight percent with foreign bank branches and four percent with
special financial institutions such as the Korea Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea attributed the sharp increase of foreign
reserves to capital inflows from corporate asset sales and the
narrowing gap in interest rates between South Korean won deposits
and foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise has contributed a great deal to keeping the
won-dollar exchange rate stable.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said the rise is indication that
business concerns may be trying to hold hard currency for fear of
a second foreign exchange crisis.

TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday called on Turkey and Syria to solve their
differences through political means and to avoid any possible
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign and domestic reporters, Kharrazi said that
Turkey and Syria, as two civilized countries, can solve their

feels the responsibility to prevent any confrontation.

Relations between Ankara and Damascus have deteriorated
recently after Turkey accused Syria of supporting Turkish Kurdish
rebels fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Turkey has stepped up military buildup
along its border with Syria and some officials even said the two
countries have entered a state of undeclared war.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that he has contacted with foreign ministers of
the two countries, and Iran will help the two countries solve
their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he criticized Ankara for concluding military pacts
with Israel and urged it to reconsider its policy on military
cooperation with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Arab and Islamic countries have condemned and worried about the
growing military alliance between Turkey and Israel, and regarded
it as a real threat to security in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OIC summit in Tehran last December called on all the member
states to review their relations with Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to possible Israeli threat to Iran, Kharrazi said
that Iran will strongly respond to any threat to its interest and
the Israelis know how strongly Iran will react.
</P>
<P>
On a question about the need of nuclear balance in the region,
he said that Iran advocates to declare the region a zone free of
nuclear and any other weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
All nuclear weapons around the world should be destroyed, he
stressed.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Administration Tuesday intensified its threat to use
force against the Yugoslav military and the police, as Washington
continued diplomatic efforts to persuade President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end the crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- After more than a year on the sidelines, European
governments are challenging the United States over how to address
the world financial crisis, suggesting that new ideas and
leadership are needed as the turmoil persists and Congress
continues to block new funding for the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and Vice President Gore are personally
leading an extensive last-minute lobbying effort to urge wavering
House Democrats to vote against the Republican plan for an
open-ended impeachment inquiry when it hits the floor Thursday,
White House officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
-- Amid stepped-up preparations for possible airstrikes
against Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, the United States faced deep
misgivings Tuesday in Congress and among some NATO allies about
the use of force as well as warnings from Moscow that military
action could disrupt future cooperation between Russia and the
Western allies.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- A compromise on IMF funding is being pushed by House Speaker
Gingrich. He says he envisions a package that would offer the 17.9
billion U.S. dollars requested by Clinton but would add conditions
and require reforms at the agency. Clinton stepped up pressure for
the funds at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
-- Investments by Long-Term Capital Management LP appear to
have arranged far beyond traditional bets on the movements of bonds
and takeover stocks, judging by recent Securities and Exchange
Commission filings on the ailing hedge fund's stock holdings.

<HEADLINE> Iran Wants to Defuse Tension with Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said on Wednesday that Iran hopes to solve the tension
with the Afghan Taliban militia through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that without the need to use force, the Taliban would
submit to the demands of the international community and Iran" to
punish the killers, return the bodies of other three slain
Iranians, and release all captured Iranians, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that Iran hoped to solve the
issue through diplomatic means and welcomed the visit to the
region of Lakhdar Brahimi, the special envoy of the U.N. Secretary
General on Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here Sunday in an effort to defuse the tension
between Iran and the Taliban triggered by the killing of Iranian
diplomats and reporter in northern Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran waits to see if the Taliban would be brought
to the terms of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have returned the bodies of six Iranian diplomats
and reporter, but the whereabouts of the bodies of the three
others were still unknown.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, over 30 Iranian drivers and aid
workers, accused of shipping supplies to the opposition forces,
are still held in the Taliban's prisons.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Brahimi's visit was not the only effort by the
international community, but it was the most important one and
Iran hopes the visit would be successful.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent withdrawal of a group of Iranian
diplomats from Pakistan, Kharrazi reiterated that they were
recalled because of the insecure situation there.
</P>
<P>
Iran, predominated by Shiite Muslims, said its diplomats faced
serious terrorist threats in Pakistan, which has an overwhelming
Sunni Muslim population. Their relations tumbled because Islamabad
supported the Taliban and Tehran backed its rival, the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi said Iran hopes its move would not be seen as
a sign of any change in bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Want U.N. Envoy to Visit Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have invited the U.N. special envoy on Afghanistan, Lakhdar
Brahimi, to visit Afghanistan for talks rather than inviting the
Taliban to Islamabad, a senior Taliban official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Taliban Interim Council Muhammad Rabbani has sent a
letter to Brahimi, who is currently in Iran, asking him to visit
Kabul for talks with the Taliban leaders, Saeedur Rahman Haqqani,
chief Taliban representative in Islamabad, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"I had handed over the letter to the acting chief of the U.N.
Special Mission to Afghanistan, James Ngobi, in Islamabad, who had
delivered the message to Brahimi in Tehran," Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said here Monday that Brahimi has invited high-ranking
Taliban officials for talks. Brahimi has no plan to visit
Afghanistan because of general embargo on U.N. officials by
Secretary General Kofi Annan to visit the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"We are responsible for Brahimi's security and I am ready to
travel with him in plane during his trip to Afghanistan," Haqqani
said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is scheduled to arrive in Islamabad Thursday after
concluding his four-day visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The recent Six plus Two (Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors
plus the U.S. and Russia) meeting in New York had mandated Brahimi
to visit the region amid growing tension between Iran and
Afghanistan over the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in the
northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said he believed that Pakistan also wanted Brahimi to
visit Afghanistan. He quoted Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman
Tariq Altaf as saying that Brahimi's mission would be incomplete
unless he visits Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Ngobi said that Brahimi's trip to Pakistan would mainly focus
on the Iran-Afghan tension. He is scheduled to hold meetings with
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz.

Jiang said that the smooth transfer of power of Hong Kong last
year marked a new chapter in Sino-British relations and Blair's
visit to China is the first by the British Prime Minister of a
Labor Party government since the establishment of diplomatic
relations.
</P>

Jiang said he believes that Blair's visit will help push
cooperation between the two countries forward in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that there has been enormous change in China since
he last visited the country 10 years ago, and that the successful
transfer of power of Hongkong marked a new era in relations
between Britain and China. His friendly exchanges on a broad range
of issues with Chinese leaders have laid a good foundation for
furthering bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that both China and Britain, as permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council, shoulder an important responsibility
for maintaining world peace and for the common progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that the Queen and the British people are looking
forward to Jiang's state visit to Britain next year.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his thanks to Queen Elizabeth for the
invitation and asked Blair to convey his regards to the Queen.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: ASEAN Should Stick to Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada warned here Wednesday that the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) should stick to its commitments to free
trade in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the 30th conference of ASEAN
economic ministers, Estrada cautioned ASEAN member countries
against "backsliding on free trade commitments," urging these
countries to maintain open markets.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that we maintain this course of continued
integration of our economies within ASEAN and the continued
integration of ASEAN with the rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that ASEAN's thrust is to promote a "freer flow of
goods and services, investments and capital," warning against
reneging on commitments to trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
"Given the interdependence of trading nations, backsliding on
our commitments would give out the wrong signals to our trading
partners -- weakening the links we have forged among ourselves and
disrupting harmonious alliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the same speech, President Estrada also called on the Group
of Seven to provide the leadership needed to bail Southeast Asia
out of the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A fast ASEAN turnaround can not be accomplished without the
concerted commitments of the G-7" which includes Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Germany, Japan and the United States, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The seven richest nations "can help contain the current
financial turmoil" by generating economic activities, maintaining
open markets and sustaining credit to the most seriously affected
economies.
</P>
<P>
Estrada urged the United States and other rich nations to make
available their share in the recapitalization of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting which began Wednesday, the economic
ministers will consider drastic tariff cuts as a pill to revive
the economies hit by Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Thai Inflation Dips to 9.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's inflation rate dipped
slightly to 9.2 percent for the first nine months of this year, a
0.2 percent fall from the same period of 1997, according to the
latest figures released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop indicated that the Thai government has managed to keep
most prices down or stable while the economy entered into
recession this year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been kept under the 10 percent target set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a condition for its
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar bailout package for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to contract at
least 8 percent in 1998, but the government has won praises for
implementing financial reforms, stabilizing the currency baht,
achieving a current account surplus and bringing bank interest
rates down, a Thai cabinet report said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of jasmine rice, vegetables, some fruits, chicken eggs
and fuel all fell in the first three quarters of 1998, while
prices of electricity, cooking gas, bus fares, telephone fees and
clothing remained stable compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
But the first three quarters saw a rise in prices of meat,
fish, tap water, health care and expressway fees.

<HEADLINE> Asian, European Countries Offer Counter-Trade Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Several countries in Asia and
Europe have offered to do business with Indonesia using the
counter-trade system, a senior official told Antara News Agency
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many countries are offering the counter-trade deals to
Indonesia, and this system could become an alternative way during
the economic crisis," Director General of Foreign Trade at the
Trade and Industry Ministry Djoko Moeljono said.
</P>
<P>
He said that companies in India and China were willing to
supply drugs while firms in South Korea were prepared to send raw
materials for shoe-making to Indonesia. Vietnam has also agreed to
become a rice supplier to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
European countries such as Belgium, Austria and France had
offered plane spare parts to national flag-carrier Garuda and to
Merpati airlines.
</P>
<P>
"But most of the commodities the foreign parties want in return
are also in great demand in Indonesia and have a high export price
so that the offers are hard to meet," Moeljono said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, India and China wanted crude palm oil, South
Korea and European countries oil and liquefied natural gas, and
Vietnam urea-based fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the goods the foreign companies want from Indonesia are
urgently needed by Indonesia itself to stabilize the domestic
market prices of those goods, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Executes Two Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Supreme People's Court
announced judgement on three smuggling cases today and two
smugglers, Zou Weiquan and Chen Baoquan, were executed today in
South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court said,
"This most serious punishment shows China's strong attitude
against smuggling."
</P>
<P>
A nationwide anti-smuggling campaign by the central government
began this July, and the announcement of the three cases is a
part of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Zou Weiquan, manager of the Hong Kong Jinfeng
Trade Corporation, in collusion with Chen Baoquan, smuggled goods
including household appliances and cars worth 38 million yuan
(about 5 million U.S. dollars), through Guangdong and Huangpu
Customs 17 times, and evaded taxes of 16 million yuan (about 2
million U.S. dollars). Zou also bribed members of the Customs
staff with 985,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the Supreme People's Court reviewed the judgement
of the Guangdong Intermediate Court and was convinced that Zou and
Chen had committed these crimes. They were then sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
The other two cases announced today involved police chief
Wen Guobin of the Yunfu Security Bureau of Guangdong Province
and Hong Kong businessman Zhou Shaoquan.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who gave a green light to smuggling and obtained bribes of
105,000 yuan, was given a life sentence and deprived of political
rights for life.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, in collusion with Bu Lu, a captain of the Dongguan
Navigation Bureau in Guangdong, smuggled 28 cars worth more than 6
million yuan (about 0.8 million U.S. dollars). Zhou and Bu were
sentenced to prison terms of 15 and 14 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that most smuggling cases are connected with regional
protectionism, and the Supreme Court is looking into this.

<HEADLINE> State Council Meeting Approves Two Draft Law Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua)-- The ninth executive meeting of
the State Council which convened here today has examined and
approved in principle the amended draft laws on highways and
military service.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting, presided over by premier Zhu
Rongji, pointed out existing problems in road and vehicle
management, especially in imposing fees on newly built highways.
</P>
<P>
The revised highway law is expected to standardize fund-raising
practices for highway building and maintenance, and reduce the
financial burden placed on people by illegally imposed road tolls.
</P>
<P>
The participants also agreed on the revised military service
law. They held that the amendment is necessary because the current
law, which was enacted in 1984, has some articles that accord
neither with the development of China's new market economy nor the
development of the armed force in the new historic period.
</P>
<P>
The two draft laws will be submitted to the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress for examination and
approval.

<HEADLINE> Education, Top Priority for HKSAR: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that the SAR government must give top priority to
education to take Hong Kong forward in an increasingly competitive
world.
</P>
<P>
In the years 1999-2000, education will continue to be the
single biggest item of recurrent expenditure, Tung said when
delivering his second Policy Address before the Legislative
Council Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the economic downturn, total recurrent spending in
this area will rise to 44 billion HK dollars (5.64 billion U.S.
dollars), Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung went on to say that the government will provide over 500
million HK dollars ( 64.10 million U.S. dollars) in grants to
public schools from 1999 to 2003 to help improve their management
and the quality of education.
</P>
<P>
To improve further the quality and professionalism of teachers
in Hong Kong, which are backbone of the education system, the
government will allocate 20 million HK dollars (2.56 million
U.S. dollars) to set up a General Teaching Council, the chief
executive said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also develop an award scheme, which will
recognize high performance and stimulate a culture of quality in
the teaching profession and provide subject training in music
and art and crafts to some 600 teachers annually over the next
seven years to ensure an all-round education for students.
</P>
<P>
The government will work towards the target of providing
primary school students with whole-day schooling from 2007-2008,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The government remains fully committed to the promotion of
mother tongue teaching though the government realizes that the
implementation of the mother-tongue learning initiative caused
some concern in the community.
</P>
<P>
Tung explained that the first reason is that expert opinion
world wide is that students learn best in their mother-tongue and
the second reason is that the government is committed to improve
the ability of Hong Kong's students to use both Chinese and
English.
</P>
<P>
To promote further the use of Information Technology (IT) in
education, in the coming year the government will allocate funds
totaling 630 million HK dollars (80.77 million U.S. dollars) in in
a bid to provide more IT training for teachers, enhance the
accessibility of all students to computers, supply technical
back-up to help schools manage their newly acquired IT facilities
and employ some 250 IT coordinators to help public schools develop
and implement their IT-based initiatives.
</P>
<P>
To enhance Hong Kong's status as a regional center for higher
education, the government will further admit non-local students,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the 1999-2000 academic year, the overall quota of
a maximum of 580 first-year, non-local undergraduate students will
include 150 outstanding Mainland students.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of helping Hong Kong's workforce acquire new
skills or upgrade their existing skills, the government will unify
the existing two Technical Colleges and seven Technical Institutes
by the year 2000 to form a single academic and training
institution, the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education.
</P>
<P>
The government will grant 500 million HK dollars (64.10 million
U.S. dollars) to the Employees Retaining Board to enable it to
provide more and better courses for the unemployed, the chief
executive said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will boost its support networks for
the jobless, in particular the young people, with the aim of
helping them find work more quickly, he added.

<HEADLINE> HK to Restructure District Organizations: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), here
Wednesday unveiled the government's plan to restructure the SAR's
district organizations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his second Policy Address before the Legislative
Council Wednesday afternoon, Tung proposed that the existing
Provisional Municipal Councils not be retained after the terms of
office of their members expire at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
A new policy bureau will be set up to coordinate and direct
policy on environmental hygiene, waste management, food safety and
nature conservation, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The new policy bureau will be underpinned by a new Department
of Food and Environmental Hygiene, as well as the existing
Environmental Protection Department and the Agriculture and
Fisheries Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
The responsibilities for food safety and environmental hygiene
currently under the purview of the Urban and Regional Services
Departments, the Department of Health and the Agriculture and
Fisheries Department will be assumed by the new department.
</P>
<P>
"An advisory committee will be established to give advice on
and monitor the government's work in this area, as well as to
allow greater professional participation in formulating policies,"
the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Tung added that the government is finalizing the planning for
the new structure, with a view to it being in place before the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government will also develop a new administrative framework
for the delivery of the services of arts and culture and sports ad
 recreation with the Arts Development Council, the Sports
Development Board and other concerned parties before finalizing
the details of the new structure, so that the government can put
this in place before the end of 1999, Tung disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The 18 District Boards (DB) will be maintained as the
government believes that they will still play a vital role in
empowering the community and providing more accountable and
responsive district services, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government will provide additional funding to the
DBs for improving the local environment, commissioning district
cultural and recreational activities, promoting more community
building programs, enhancing the DBs' role in advising on and
monitoring municipal service delivery and ensuring that the
government is more responsive to DBs' advice, by consulting them
before finalizing district programs.

<HEADLINE> HK to Provide Houses for Needy While Stabilizes Prices: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that the government will continue the construction of an
 average of 50,000 public sector flats in the next four years as
promised last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual number of flats built annually by the
private sector over the next four years is likely to vary in line
with market demand, and in line with developers' own commercial
consideration, Tung said, when delivering his second Policy
Address before the Legislative Council Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden Policy Address last year, Tung pledged to produce
85,000 flats annually, with 50,000 provided by the public sector
and 35,000 provided by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In respect of the public rental component, the government
remains fully committed to ensuring that no household in genuine
need of housing should be denied the right to decent accommodation
 and within a reasonable period of time, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We have pledged to reduce the average waiting time for a
public rental unit to three years by 2005, and we are on target to
 achieve this, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the private residential market, "the first priority
is to do what we can to promote stability in this sector," Tung
said. It is now necessary and desirable for property prices to
stabilize, Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
Property is one of the most important components of the economy
and a good home is also an important factor in maintaining the
quality of life and the residential property market in particular
serves as both a major vehicle for the personal investment of
wealth and a public barometer of social stability, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall in property prices in the past year has led to a
decrease in asset values and has hit public confidence and if

Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"As a government we cannot set the price levels, nor can we
dictate the degree of fluctuation in the market," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"But as the largest single supplier of land in Hong Kong we
undoubtedly have an influence on the long-term pricing of
property," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the government will decide early in 1999 whether
 or not to lift the nine-month moratorium on land sales up to
March 1999, which the government imposed earlier this year,
having regard to the need to ensure stability in the property
market.
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, the government's focus will be on ensuring
that we produce sufficient land to be able to meet our needs,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
A land bank will be created to ensure long term stability of
the property market, Tung said. Turning to the urban renewal
program, the chief executive said that the government would

<HEADLINE> HK to Provide Houses for Needy While Stabilizes Prices: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) said here
Wednesday that the government will continue the construction of an
 average of 50,000 public sector flats in the next four years as
promised last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual number of flats built annually by the
private sector over the next four years is likely to vary in line
with market demand, and in line with developers' own commercial
consideration, Tung said, when delivering his second Policy
Address before the Legislative Council Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his maiden Policy Address last year, Tung pledged to produce
85,000 flats annually, with 50,000 provided by the public sector
and 35,000 provided by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In respect of the public rental component, the government
remains fully committed to ensuring that no household in genuine
need of housing should be denied the right to decent accommodation
 and within a reasonable period of time, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We have pledged to reduce the average waiting time for a
public rental unit to three years by 2005, and we are on target to
 achieve this, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the private residential market, "the first priority
is to do what we can to promote stability in this sector," Tung
said. It is now necessary and desirable for property prices to
stabilize, Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
Property is one of the most important components of the economy
and a good home is also an important factor in maintaining the
quality of life and the residential property market in particular
serves as both a major vehicle for the personal investment of
wealth and a public barometer of social stability, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall in property prices in the past year has led to a
decrease in asset values and has hit public confidence and if
this trend continues, it will put pressure on the banking system,
Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"As a government we cannot set the price levels, nor can we
dictate the degree of fluctuation in the market," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"But as the largest single supplier of land in Hong Kong we

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Rules Out Snap Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a snap
general election now and said that the Barisan Nasional (BN)
(National Front) government has to focus on reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is not necessary to stretch our limited energy
between managing the economy and the elections," Mahathir, who is
chairman of the ruling 14-party BN coalition, said at the closing
of the National Congress on Economic Recovery here Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to hold a general election now because he
believed the majority of Malaysians still supported the BN,
Mahathir said when replying to one congress participant who asked
if the government would call for an early general election to show
the world that the present government still commanded support.
</P>
<P>
A snap general election was much talked about in Malaysia and
speculation is rife about the snap polls taking place in between
November this year and March next year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "Anyway, holding a general election is a very
big job. You need full attention and managing the economy also
needs full attention."
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to handle both the election and the
economy at the same time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The BN component parties have also expressed strong support for
the present leadership, Mahathir said, adding "so we (the BN
government) are still strong."
</P>
<P>
He said only if there was to be mass defection by BN component
parties, would the government consider calling for early polls.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia holds a general election every five years and the last
one was held on April 25, 1995.

BONN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- German marathon runner Uta Pippig
has been suspended for abnormally high levels of testosterone,
German Athletics Federation (DLV) officials said on Wednesday in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Pippig, a three-time winner of the Boston Marathon between
1994 and 1996 and the New York Marathon in 1993, had her samples
tested during training in Boulder, the United States, on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Both samples showed abnormally high levels of testosterone, a
performance enhancing hormone, said Klaus Mueller, chief of the
Kreischa lab that examined Pippig's samples.
</P>
<P>
Pippig will be banned for two years if DLV legal committee
rules that Pippig is guilty of doping, said Theo Rous, DLV vice
president and chief anti-doping official.
</P>
<P>
Pippig told the lab she took some medicine to battle a viral
infection.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Areas Urged to Lead in Modernizing Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has urged China's developed coastal areas to take the lead in the
country's efforts to modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The more developed coastal areas should attach greater
importance to agriculture and rural work and further deepen rural
reforms in a bid to accelerate the development of agricultural
productive forces, build an advanced agricultural sector, and
strive to modernize, by and large, the country's agriculture, said
Jiang who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader made these remarks during his inspection
tour of east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai
Municipality from October 4 to 7.
</P>
<P>
While talking with local officials, Jiang recalled that in the
past two decades, China has realized tremendous achievements under
 the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the basic line of the
Party.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Third Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee
will focus on implementing the strategic plan mapped out at the
15th CPC National Congress, summing up the experience of the
country's two-decade-old rural reforms, and making decisions on
further development of agriculture and the rural work, according
to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"The conference is of great significance to the country's rural
reform and for achieving greater development of the rural economy,"
he added.

"It is a long standing and strategic principle to put
agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, in the prime
place for the development of the national economy," he said,
noting that that to persist in this principle not only is related
to the sustained and stable growth of the agricultural sector and
rural economy, but also related to the realization of all
strategic programs mapped out at the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection, Jiang learned that Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces and Shanghai, located in the Yangtze River Delta, have
experienced a faster industrialization of the farming sector and
building markets dealing in farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Many companies specialized in farm products trading and
processing have sprung up in the rural areas, linking millions of
local farmers with the market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that pushing forward agricultural industrialization,
commercialization, specialization and modernization is of
strategic importance for the development of the country's farming
sector and rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with local officials, the Chinese leader also
showed great interest in the development of small towns in the
rural areas. Developing village-based industries and small towns
in the countryside is the only way for the country, with over 1.2
billion people including 900 million rural residents, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also urged to step up efforts to protect cultivated land and
the building of infrastructure for the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt an even stricter policy for the protection of
farmland. "It is a principal State policy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked localities to pay greater attention to reinforcing
the grass-roots units of the Party. A sound rural policy and a
better army of grass-roots officials are able to bring enthusiasm
and creativity of the farmers into full play, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Shekel Dips to Record-Low Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Under heavy selling pressure,
the Israeli currency shekel tumbled Tuesday to a record low
against the U.S. dollar, prompting fears for the approaching of
"Asian contagion."
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, the Israeli currency fell below
4.00 shekels against a dollar, a psychological line drawn by many
dealers.
</P>
<P>
The representative rate of Bank of Israel, the central bank,
finished Tuesday at 4.011 shekels to a dollar, and one dollar
bought 4.1 shekels in inter-bank trading.
</P>
<P>
This meant a 2.04 percent devaluation of the shekel.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's trading was characterized by sharp fluctuations and
heavy demand for the dollar. Most of the activity was by foreign
banks trying to cover their positions, as well as by companies and
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
"There are clearly certain parties purchasing foreign currency
and driving the shekel down," Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To defend against possible losses, some of the banks went into
a selling spree of the shekel, sending the market crushing.
</P>
<P>
The prominent seller of the shekel was Deutsche Bank. According
to dealers' estimates, it alone sold 100 million and 150 million
dollars worth of shekels Tuesday and last Friday respectively to
fend off losses from its large holdings of shekel-dominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
Other large sellers included Merill Lynch, Bankers Trust and
Citibank.
</P>
<P>
The shekel has lost 13 percent of its value against the dollar
since the beginning of this year and seen a continuing downward
trend on the currency market recently.
</P>
<P>
Local financial analysts said that the negative atmosphere on
international currency markets, rather than anything happening in
Israel, is the main reason for the decline in the shekel.
</P>
<P>
A analyst told the Jerusalem Post newspaper that the financial
crises in Asia and Russia are getting steadily worse and will
rapidly evolve into a global recession.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions are therefore being forced to reduce
their exposure everywhere, including Israel, and intend to hold
assets with little or no perceived risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the market is expected to be volatile in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
In response to the plunge, the country's two leading economic
policy-makers - Neeman and Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel -
noted Tuesday that the shekel's depreciation was in line with the
law of supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
There was no need for the central bank to intervene, they
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Neeman said that although there are crises in some
parts of the world, Israel is "aware of the situation" and "we
built a wall between us and the storm, and if we act wisely, we
can even exploit the opportunities in the world economy."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grain Markets To Remain Stable After Floods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The biggest floods since 1954
will not ignite an overall rise of grain prices, and prices will
remain stable at the current level until at least next year, said
today's China Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The flooding had at least one merit -- it helped halt
the three-year gradual sinking of the massive Chinese grain
market, according to grain expert Xie Yang.
</P>
<P>
"At least until well into next year, grain prices should remain
relatively stable," said Xie. "However, we cannot rule out the
possibility of drastic rises for certain types of grain in this
period."
</P>
<P>
Xie, a researcher with the State Council Development Research
Center, said that the floods, coupled with grain-price structural
adjustment, will cause less than five billion kilos of grain
reduction this year, which means a one percent loss against the
nation's estimated total grain output.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the one percent loss in grain output will
not much influence grain prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has huge grain reserves totalling 200 billion
kilos, compared with an annual domestic need of about 110 billion
kilos.
</P>
<P>
China will enjoy a heavy grain surplus for a long time, and
with the Chinese yuan remaining undevalued, grain prices should
not rise in the next one or two years, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
International grain trade will also help maintain a stable
grain market in China, the researcher noted.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Chinese grain prices are now roughly the same
as international prices, minimizing the effect on China of changes
in the world grain market.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Chinese farmers hold at least 350
billion kilos of grain in their own granaries, which also serves
as a strong guarantor of a stable grain market, said Xie.

Famoraja said that NIA had already acquired land in the Federal
Capital Territory to serve as demonstration center for the
building project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the NIA would involve various levels of
governments in the country in order to overcome the problem of
land and other logistics, Daily Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Famoraja said that over the years, the NIA had done researches
into and perfected on the technologies for the use of local raw
materials in house building in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition which started Monday is aimed at
serving as a forum for demonstrating the techniques and promoting
the use of local materials in the construction of housing estates
in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Famoraja, the price has been fixed at about 4,000
U.S. Dollars for a prototype two-bedroom bungalow in the proposed
estates in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
A study compiled by Nigerian Federal Office of Statistics
shows that more than 50 percent of Nigerians both in the rural
and urban areas live in slums.
</P>
<P>
The just published study indicates that 87.3 percent of urban
Nigerian households with about four to 12 persons live in single
rooms while only a minimal five percent live in flats, 0.5
percent in duplexes and 7.2 percent in whole buildings
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study describes the general housing conditions of a
majority of Nigerians as very deplorable and the situation has
not changed to date as the slums are springing up, especially in
the urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Reinforced SADC Troops to Secure Northern Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Southern African
Development Community (SADC) military intervention in Lesotho
enters a new and dangerous phase Wednesday when troops began an
attempt to secure the volatile northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
South African media reported that further 750 soldiers will be
deployed in that part of the kingdom, bringing the number of SADC
troops in Lesotho -- from South Africa and Botswana -- to 3,500.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Hartslief, commander of the joint operations,
said that he did not expect to see the troops withdrawn until at
least after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The troops are commissioned to gain control of the area from
the hands of rebel Lesotho soldiers, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Another problem facing Lesotho is that a large number of
weapons had fallen into civilian hands during the uprising in
late September.
</P>
<P>
Hartslief said that many youths were in possession of the
weapons, particularly AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns and
nine-millimeter revolvers.
</P>
<P>
Hartslief and Commander of the Botswana Defense Force
contingent, Gideon Masisi, also revealed that last month's arson
and looting of Maseru was allowed to go on unhindered because the
SADC forces were under strict orders not to act against the
civilians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grain Markets To Remain Stable After Floods (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xie's confidence in a stable grain market also comes from two
figures he personally holds as well-tested grain-price barometers
over his years of observation.
</P>
<P>
One figure is the per capita grain output of 370 kilos. Grain
prices are set to rise when a year's per capita grain output is
less than this figure. Xie estimates that China's per capita grain
output will be above 388 kilos for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The other figure is the yearly fluctuation of grain output of
15 billion kilos. China's summer grain output, indeed, was less
than 15 billion kilos this year, but that resulted mainly from
grain structural adjustment, and the floods played a very minor
role in this reduction. With the autumn harvest expected to be
bumper one, the entire year's grain decrease will be just about
five billion kilos.
</P>
<P>
While allaying the fears of urban residents, Xie is actually
calling for measures to raise grain prices.
</P>
<P>
He said that since August 1995 until this year's floods, grain
prices fell by 38 percent from their peak. For example, rice saw a
price reduction, selling at only three yuan a kilo.
</P>
<P>
Sharp price declines have caused huge losses to grain producers
and distributors and they need some protection, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
Another benefit of a grain price rise will be to activate the
Chinese economy, which has suffered some slowdown this year, he
argues.
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable grain-price rise will help pull up the prices of
other commodities, which will add new vigor to the market," he
said.

<HEADLINE> CSSHR President Addresses Civil, Political Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's recent signing of the
International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights represents
the "logical and natural development" of the country's efforts to
realize political democracy over the past century, according to
Zhu Muzhi, president of the Chinese Society for Studies of Human
Rights (CSSHR).
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the move readily shows that China attaches great
importance to human rights, including economic, social, cultural,
and civil and political rights.
</P>
<P>
China's modern history had included struggles for both national
independence and political democracy, and the Chinese citizens
lacked the right to practice political democracy until the
founding of new China in 1949, Zhu recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since then, according to Zhu, the Chinese people have, however,
taken an active part in the nation's construction and in the
establishment and implementation of socialist democracy.
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that the Chinese people now enjoy extensive
an unprecedented human rights, including civil and political
rights.
</P>
<P>
The status of civil and political rights in China can be judged
from many perspectives, with the most important aspect centering
on political democracy, Zhu said, adding that the Chinese people
demand the freedom of speech, publication, assembly and
association, parades and demonstrations, and the rights of
personal freedom and judicial protection, as the means of fully
expressing their opinions and pursuing their interests, especially
in terms of political democracy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu said, China has been implementing socialist
democracy and adopting the people's congress system in order to
guarantee running things in accordance to the will of the majority
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy has witnessed rapid sustained growth, with
constant improvings in living standards and an increasingly strong
national strength, he said. The achievements represent the
accomplishment of the demands and will of the Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous achievements are directly attributed to the
implementation of the policies and plans outlined by the people's
congresses at all levels, and this shows the people's congress
system in China is a democratic system, and that the Chinese
citizens have the civil rights and political rights to acquire
their freedom of expression and pursue their interests, Zhu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
China's human rights situation is by no means perfect in every
way, and there is still much room for further improvement, Zhu
said. After its signing of the Covenant, the country will strive
to carry forward its achievements and overcome shortcomings in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
There are many areas that still require further improvement,
and the most important thing is to extend socialist democracy and
perfect the legal system and both are closely inter-related, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to explain that the people's congress system should
be further improved at all levels, from the central authorities
down to grassroots levels, to guarantee representing fully the
popular feelings of the Chinese people. He added that a legal
system to safeguard socialist democracy must be perfected to as to
ensure that the country will be run according to law and a new
socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics be built in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Some 328 laws and related codes, more than 700 administrative
regulations and 5,000-plus local rules have been drafted since
China introduced the reform and opening-up policies 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu underlined the special significance of giving
full play to China's democratic tradition in implementing the mass
line. Any policy--making process must be first of all based on the
extensive solicitation of opinions of the masses and, when policy
decisions are reached, they must be subjected to be tested by the
masses of people in the course of practice.
</P>
<P>
As a research organization, Zhu said, the CSSHR will, as
always, continue to promote civil and political rights in China,
and will actively spread the related knowledge on the civil rights
and political rights as well as the correct understanding in this
regard amongst the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, since China did not participate in drafting the
Covenant and its national conditions differ from that in other
countries, the Chinese government will pay special attention to
the issue as properly adapting the Covenant to the existing
situation, and the country's existing laws and regulations, Zhu
added.

<HEADLINE> Abnormal Behavior of Fish Baffles Experts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Fishes in the Bay of Bengal are
behaving strangely for the past four months and of late dead fish
are found floating the sea, baffling fisheries experts who fear
that some serious changes have taken place in their living
environment.
</P>
<P>
An abnormal movement of big-sized fish from the sea towards the
shallow waters near the coastline is constantly reported.
</P>
<P>
In an extreme case, a big colony of hilsa fish was found coming
to the mouth of the river Naaf, at a depth of only three meters of
water, on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, The Independent daily
Wednesday quoted a senior official of the Department of Fisheries
(DF) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The abundance of big fish in the market during the current
season was due to the desperate movement of the fish for food and
hospitable environment," an expert hypothesized, saying "This is
not a good sign because this indicates that the parent fish got
trapped in large numbers this year."
</P>
<P>
The living environment of fishes in the deep waters might have
changed due to a change in the water temperature, or dumping of
toxic wastes by foreign ships, another expert guessed.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries expert say that the huge catch of hilsa, laitya and
other big fish recorded throughout the coastal belt during the
past few months might be the result of this abnormal behavior of
the fishes.
</P>
<P>
Neither the DF nor the Fisheries Research Institute have done
an independent study of the problem, and they have only gathered a
picture by observing the trend in fish catch this season and
listening to conversations of fishermen, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Fisheries Ministry officials are under the impression that
fishes had ran towards the coast due to an earthquake that had
shaken the deep seas near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands during
the first fortnight of August, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
An expert on marine fishery who works with the DF, however,
ruled out fishes being driven towards the shallow waters by an
under-water quake.
</P>
<P>
His impression was that there might have been some changes in
the environment in the deep sea due to a rise in the water
temperature caused by El-Nino that had been very vigorous until
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The temperature change kills the plankton that grow in water
and are taken by fishes as food, he said, adding that absence or
scarcity of food might have forced the fishes to rush towards the
shallow waters for food.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the dumping of toxic wastes in the Bay by
foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and Live-stock,
and of the DF Tuesday started investigating the extent of the
problem, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Marine fish account for over 21 percent of the nearly 1.4
million tons of fish consumed in Bangladesh annually, official
figures show.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Strong gains on the Japanese
market lifted the Australian share market by almost two percent
Wednesday, with blue chips leading the way.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed up 49 points, or 1.97 percent,
at 2,540.2, off a high of 2,543.5 and a low of 2,490.8.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei 225 Index surged 804 points, or 6.2 percent, to
13,826.0 after investors welcomed Japanese government policies to
spur its crumbling economy and rescue its banks.
</P>
<P>
Paul Xiradis, equities director at funds manager AUSBIL
Partners, said that the gains in Japan might not be sustained as
on previous occasions after government prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to be totally convinced that there is a turning
point at this part of the junction, but certainly it is very
encouraging," he said of Japanese developments.
</P>
<P>
On the stock market, the all industrials index added 82.9
points at 4,421.8 and the all resources index closed up 22.4
points, or 2.22 percent, at 1,030.5.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 292.54 million shares traded valued at
630 million U.S. dollars, with 604 rises, 469 falls and 356 stocks
steady.
</P>
<P>
Optimism that Japan has broken the political impasse on the
recapitalization of its failed banks, easing some fears of a world
credit-lending squeeze, pushed local bank and resource stocks
higher as Japan is a major market for Australian commodities.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank gained 71 cents, or 3.71 percent,
to 19.85 Australian dollars, Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained
78 cents, or 4.21 percent, to 19.30 Australian dollars, ANZ bank
gained 14 cents to 8.72 Australian dollars, and Westpac bank rose
eight cents to 8.88 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP, whose share price had recently slumped on
concerns that the Japanese recession would reduce worldwide demand
for its products, climbed 46.1 cents, or 3.85 percent, to 12.441
Australian dollars. Global miner Rio Tinto rose 14.8 cents to
19.39 Australian dollars.

<P>
The gold index closed 9.5 points, or 0.79 percent, higher at
1,223.0, off a low of 1,201.0.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes 2 U.S. Cents Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed at
its highest level in two months Wednesday, around two U.S. cents
stronger, when a surge in buying lifted the currency through the
60.00 U.S. cents level in afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, senior foreign exchange dealer at Colonial
State Bank, said market perception that the local currency was
grossly undervalued led to a flurry of aggressive buying.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed Wednesday at 60.58 U.S. cents, up
from Tuesday's close of 58.55 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
It last closed over the 60.00 U.S. cents level on August 7,
when it ended at 60.15 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
A report by investment bank Goldman Sachs also helped boost the
currency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Goldman Sachs, in its weekly report, said the Australian dollar
would see 62.00 U.S. cents before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said the Australian dollar was trading 27
percent below its fair value, and would rebound early next year.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that proved positive for the local dollar was a
rebound in the Japanese stock market, which contributed to a
strong rise on the Australian share market Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was buying 77.97 Japanese yen from 77.80
yen, and 0.9865 German marks from 0.9530 marks.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Find Ways to Make High-Quality Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have found
ways to make high-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) in Pune
about 1,500 km southwest of New Delhi have patented a process to
isolate a fungus that can enhance paper quality as well as reduce
the use of toxic chemicals in paper industry, Press Trust of India
(PTI) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cephalosporium strain, which is isolated in NCL, is the
first fungal strain to show selective enzyme action on pulp which
will help produce superior rayon-grade paper, PTI quoted scientist
M. C. Srinivasan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Plants contain carbohydrates in the form of cellulose and
hemicellulose. To produce good-quality pulp, scientists are on the
lookout for strains that contain xylanase enzyme which selectively
degrades the undesirable hemicellulose component but is free of
cellulose enzyme that breaks down cellulose. Cellulose primarily
determines paper quality. NCL's new strain was found to
selectively degrade hemicellulose. It, however, does not affect
cellulose, Srinivasan said.
</P>
<P>
Besides its cellulose-free xylanase activity, the enzyme was
found to be stable under highly alkaline conditions, which is
another desirable attribute as pulp processing takes place at high
temperature and under alkaline conditions.
</P>
<P>
As fungal action enhances pulp brightness, its use will reduce
the amount of cancer-causing chlorine compounds needed to bleach
pulp, Srinivasan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and Kuwait have agreed
to improve and diversify their bilateral trade links as both
countries have various unexplored areas to expand trade and
investment relationship, said an official handout here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A visiting Kuwait-Bangladesh parliament friendship group, which
called on Bangladeshi Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael
Ahmed Tuesday, said that they came to the country with a mission
to strengthen the friendship between the two countries through
cementing the trade relationship.
</P>
<P>
The group leader requested the minister for bilateral
agreements on avoidance of double taxation and promotion and
protection of investment.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a promising market and has a wide range of
opportunities to set up joint venture projects in the untapped
areas, the handout quoted group members as saying.
</P>
<P>
The general people, investors, exporters and importers of
Kuwait are unaware of the potentialities of Bangladesh and stress
the need of frequent visits by trade bodies and related government
organizations, they added.
</P>
<P>
"We have trade and economic agreement with Kuwait which could
be geared up through setting up joint economic commission," the
Bangladeshi minister said, adding that Bangladesh is also
interested in signing agreements with Kuwait on avoidance of
double taxation and promotion and protection of investment.
</P>
<P>
"We are offering an attractive incentive package for foreign
investment and Kuwaiti investors are highly welcome to invest in
Bangladesh," the minister stated.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between the two countries is only 6 million
U.S. dollars which could be increased by manifold "if we could
explore the areas purposefully", he added.

</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to meet at least once a year and will
hold its first meeting in January 1999, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing appreciation for the members' participation in the
council, Tung said he believes the Council will benefit from the
expertise of and advice from these prominent members of the
international business community.
</P>
<P>
"They will be best placed to advise, from an international
perspective, on the global and regional development trends
affecting Hong Kong's long-term development and the perception of
the international business community on Hong Kong's plans and
programs of activities.
</P>
<P>
"They will also be able to advise on such matters as the
investments Hong Kong would need to make in order to enhance our
role as a world-class commercial and financial center, and as a
dynamic Special Administrative Region of China under the concept
of 'one country, two systems'," Tung said.

visit to Nigeria, probably to seek assistance for his fighting
against the rebels.
</P>

Kabila, who came to power last year through a rebel action has
been facing fierce military attacks from the Tutsi rebels and
their allies in the last two months.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Sets Up Surveillance Mechanism Against Financial Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) is putting in place an informal surveillance
mechanism to guard against future financial crises similar to the
ongoing one in Asia, ASEAN deputy secretary-general Suthad
Setboonsarng said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Suthad, attending a two-day ASEAN economic minister meeting
here, said at a press conference that ASEAN finance ministers
agreed on Sunday in Washington on the "informal system" involving
all nine ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers pledged to provide on a regular basis
certain economic data which include macro-economic indicators and
figures related to trade and fiscal balance, and interest rate and
exchange rate policies, Suthad said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mechanism will work through "peer review" to
dissuade member governments from pursuing certain policies that
could harm the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta-based ASEAN Secretariat will also set up an "ASEAN
surveillance technical support unit" that works with experts from
the
Manila-based Asian Development Bank in collecting and monitoring
the data, Suthad said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that submission of the data is not "mandatory" and
that each country would have to trust fellow members.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism would "provide an early warning system" and
provide a forum to monitor and discuss economic developments"
which have a bearing on the well-being of ASEAN members, Suthad
said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN finance ministers will meet twice a year,
starting next March in Hanoi, Vietnam, to analyze the data and
provide recommendations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN consists of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Mainland To Play Pivotal Role for HK Economic Recovery: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
said Wednesday in his 1998 policy address that Hong Kong must
strengthen cooperation with the mainland in order to bring its
battered economy back to the path of growth.
</P>
<P>
In his second policy address unveiled Wednesday, Tung said that
Hong Kong needs to adopt two key initiatives to stimulate its
economy, which is predicted to shrink four percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"First, we must work to maintain Hong Kong's status as an
international trade center. Second, we must strengthen our
cooperation with the mainland in all areas," the chief executive
told the 60-member Legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's interior has historically provided the
impetus for Hong Kong's economic growth, and Hong Kong has always
played an important role in promoting the mainland relationship
with other countries. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong has
become the mainland's most important center for fund-raising,
trading and re-export.
</P>
<P>
As the World Bank predicted, China will become one of the
largest economic entities in the world in the 21st century, which,
 Tung noted, indicates that Hong Kong will have different roles to
 play and new functions to perform.
</P>
<P>
"We must now consider how to reinforce our role as the bridge
between China and the international community, as well as how to
enhance our function as a leading business center for China and
the Asia Pacific region," said the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government will play a leading role in creating an environment
conducive to closer cooperation between the mainland and Hong
Kong, ranging from expanding economic links to enhancing academic
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will put Hong Kong back on course for a
prosperous future, by offering businesses greater scope for
development and people more job opportunities, said Tung.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tung Unveils New Policy for Hong Kong's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
unveiled the 1998 Policy Address here Wednesday, which put forth
strategies to ride Hong Kong out of the current economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Tung Wednesday presented to the 60-member Legislature his
second policy address, entitled "From Adversity to Opportunity."
He laid out key strategies for growth, namely, to broaden Hong
Kong's economic horizon by developing high-value-added industries,
and to reinforce existing strengths of Hong Kong as an
international financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
Tung acknowledged that the Asia financial turmoil has not only
rocked Hong Kong's economy, which is predicted to contract about
four percent this year, but also exposed inherent weakness in its
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
To bring the battered economy back to the path of growth, Hong
Kong needs to rely on the new engines, innovation and technology,
said the Chief Executive, who proposed in his speech to set up an
Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, and inject five
 billion HK dollars (640 million U.S. dollars) to launch an
Innovation and Technology Fund.
</P>
<P>
He enumerated a string of government initiatives in promoting
technology-driven industries, including:
</P>
<P>
* positioning Hong Kong as an Internet hub and information
technology center in the Asia Pacific region,
</P>
<P>
* launching an on-line government electronic services network,
</P>
<P>
* building a world class teleport to provide the best possible
global satellite links,
</P>
<P>
* Setting up a 100-million-HK dollar (12.8 million U.S. dollar)
film development fund to rejuvenate local film industry, which has
a promising large market, and
</P>
<P>
* taking forward proposals to turn Hong Kong into the
international center for Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Apart from expanding economic horizon, Tung suggested that Hong
Kong continue to build on its existing strengths to ensure the
long-term economic vitality. In the wake of the currency crisis,
Hong Kong will enhance its role as an international financial
services center by boosting regulatory system and developing new
products, such as a venture board for the trade of shares in
smaller and emerging companies.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address, Tung also listed specific measures to
stimulate the flagging tourism industry, facilitate small and
medium-sized enterprises, build large infrastructure projects, and
stabilize property prices.
</P>
<P>
Education is a top priority despite the economic downturn, Tung
told the 60-member Legislative Council. In 1999-2000, education
will continue to be the single biggest item of recurrent
expenditure, amounting to 44 billion HK dollars (5.6 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government plans to grant 500 million HK dollars (64
million U.S. dollars) for retraining employees, in an effort to
ease the worsening unemployment, which hit a decade high of five
percent.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address, Tung also pledged to create a better
environment, taking care of people in need, and improve health and
public hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive stressed time and again in his two-hour
speech that Hong Kong must strengthen cooperation with the
mainland in all areas for an earlier economic recovery and
sustained long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
"We must now consider how to reinforce our role as the bridge
between China and the international community, as well as how to
enhance our function as a leading business center for China and
the Asia Pacific region," he told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Tung said that the recovery of the Hong Kong
economy hinges on four factors: an improvement in the external
economic environment, a steady interest rate, stability in the
property market, and the restoration of public confidence.
</P>
<P>
He called on Hong Kong people not to lose confidence, which is
 the most crucial factor for recovery.

<HEADLINE> Technology to Become New Engine for HK's Growth: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
pledged to make innovation and technology Hong Kong's new engines
of economic growth in his 1998 policy address, which was unveiled
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Innovation and technology are important drivers of economic
growth," Tung stated in his second policy address at the
Legislative Council on Wednesday afternoon. "In a knowledge-based
global economy, they are essential in adding value, increasing
productivity and enhancing our overall competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive proposed to set up an Applied Science and
Technology Research Institute, which, now a dearth to Hong Kong,
will serve as a mid-stream link between basic scientific research
and its commercial application in the future.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government will inject five billion HK dollars
(640 million U.S. dollars) to launch an Innovation and Technology
Fund.
</P>
<P>
The two initiatives were part of the recommendation package
submitted in September by the Commission on Innovation and
Technology, which, founded in March this year, was charged with
the task of advising the Chief Executive on technology and
industry policies.
</P>
<P>
Tung vowed in his policy address to build Hong Kong into an
Internet hub and information technology center in the Asia Pacific
region. Accordingly, Hong Kong will develop a world class teleport
to provide the best possible global satellite links and launch an
on-line government electronic services network before 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive planned to earmark 100 million HK dollars
(12.8 million U.S. dollars) to rejuvenate local film industry,
which has a potential audience of over one billion in the
world-wide Chinese community. The fund will be used to promote
creativity and application of technology in film production.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medicine is another potential competitive edge Hong
Kong could exploit in the future, said the Chief Executive, who
promised to take forward proposals aimed at turning Hong Kong into
 an international center for Chinese medicine and medical
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a lesson from the Asian financial turmoil, which has
already dragged Hong Kong into a painful period of economic
readjustment, Tung said that Hong Kong's economic base has been
too narrow and the new strategies for growth will be to focus on
expanding diversity of the economy.
</P>
<P>
High value-added industries are a key focus of development in
the wake of the regional financial turbulence, said Tung. "A clear
policy objective is to enhance the capability of Hong Kong firms
to innovate, stimulate technological development, and encourage
its commercialization and application in Hong Kong," he told the
legislators.

<HEADLINE> Absenteeism by American Workers at All-time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Unscheduled absenteeism by
American workers is at an all-time high and small businesses are
hit the hardest, a new human resources survey suggested.
</P>
<P>
As shown by the annual survey on absenteeism, released this
week by CCH Inc., the absences are now costing small business
owners nearly twice as much as they did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The yearly absenteeism rate for small businesses has soared 46
percent since 1994, from 5.4 missed days per employee to eight
days in 1998, said CCH in the survey report.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the only of its kind in the United States, covered
400 U.S. companies, with a total of 800,000 employees. And CCH
Inc. is a leading provider of business and tax information.
</P>
<P>
While many innovative employment benefit programs are viewed as
effective in stemming the tide, CCH said, few of the programs are
actually in place and entrepreneurs expect absenteeism to get even
worse.
</P>
<P>
Absenteeism means unscheduled time off for any reason, such as
for family issues, personal illnesses, personal needs, entitlement
mentality and stress.
</P>
<P>
As the rate of absenteeism for small business soars, so does
the cost. CCH figures that unscheduled absences could cost small
business 1,044 U.S. dollars per employee this year, or 38 percent
more than the 757-dollar average for all businesses. That puts the
possible total price tag of these absences for a small business
with 99 employees as high as 103,000 dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are indirect costs associated with unscheduled
absences, including overtime pay for other employees, hiring a
temporary employees and supervisory time spent rearranging work
schedules.
</P>
<P>
A decline in morale and lower productivity among workers who
are expected to cover for an absent employee may also add to
indirect costs. These hidden costs can add another 15 to 25
percent to the direct cost, CCH said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say one of the best ways to control unscheduled
absences is to provide employees with paid time off, a bank of
hours to be used for various purposes rather than separate
accounts for vacation, sick leave or personal time.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain, Iran To Restore Full Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Minister of Labour
and Social Affairs Abdulla Al Shola has said Bahrain and Iran have
agreed to restore their relations to ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Shola, who was on a visit to Iran, made the announcement in an
exclusive interview carried by the Wednesday edition of the Al
Itihad daily of the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
He said an agreement was reached after intensive talks in
Tehran Tuesday with Iranian officials to reciprocate ambassadors
soon. But he did not say when.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Iran recalled their ambassadors in May 1996 after a
row over Bahrain's unrest - a 19-month wave of riots Manama said
had Iranian backing.
</P>
<P>
Iran has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Shola said that Bahrain has a keen interest in maintaining
"positive" relations with Tehran and in improving regional
security in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he has also signed a memorandum of
understanding for mutual political and economic cooperation with
his Iranian counterpart Hossein Kamali.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Appointed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has appointed Aret Adams, former managing
director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, as his
special adviser on petroleum resources.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Tuesday night in capital Abuja by the Chief
Press Secretary's office also announced other six appointments
which immediately took effect, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Petroleum Resources Ministry was scrapped when
the federal cabinet was reshuffled in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar had indicated that the Petroleum Resources Ministry
would be brought under his supervision as part of measures to
combat the lingering fuel crisis in the oil-exporting country.
</P>
<P>
The decision to bring the ministry under the presidency
followed the fuel crisis in the industry resulting in the
breakdown of most of the nation's refineries.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed special adviser is an ardent believer in
the complete overhaul of the petroleum industry and one of the
proponents of divestment of government's interest in the oil
sector.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with This Day newspaper, Adams said that
"I have a very strong reason that we should privatize the
refineries and privatize any public sector organization that is
supposed to deliver results in a profit basis."
</P>
<P>
The adviser also believes in the immediate deregulation of the
downstream sector of the petroleum industry.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Rise Sharply in Tokyo </HEADLINE>

<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices skyrocketed in Tokyo
Wednesday with the Nikkei index posting this year's second-biggest
point gain on expectations that a new bank-recapitalization bill
will be enacted during the ongoing Diet, or parliament, session.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 803.97 points, or 6.17
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 13,825.61.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all First Section
issues, surged 50.03 points or 5.02 percent to 1,046.98.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section was heavy at an estimated 620
million shares, up from Tuesday's 401.22 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Shares were higher across the board, with the banking sector
rebounding 8.69 percent as investors' confidence in the financial
system apparently improved because of possible approval of the
bank-recapitalization bill, which would allow the government to
inject public funds into capital-short banks, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Other than the progress of the bank legislation, traders
attributed the climb to growing expectation that the European
countries will soon implement joint interest rate cuts to prevent
their economies from falling into recession.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,337 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
overwhelmed losers 1,067 to 127, while 102 issues ended
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Iran Upholds Right to Use Force against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Wednesday that Iran would not give up the right to
use force against the Afghan Taliban militia for the killing of
nine Iranian diplomats and reporter.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that before the use of force, the Taliban would submit
to the demands of the international community and Iran" to punish
the killers, return the bodies of other three slain Iranians, and
release all captured Iranians, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that Iran hoped to solve the
issue through diplomatic means and welcomed the visit to the
region of Lakhdar Brahimi, the special envoy of the U.N. Secretary
General on Afghan affairs.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here Sunday in an effort to defuse the tension
between Iran and the Taliban triggered by the killing of Iranian
diplomats and reporter in northern Afghanistan in August.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran waits to see if the Taliban would be brought
to the terms of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have returned the bodies of six Iranian diplomats
and reporter, but the whereabouts of the bodies of the three
others were still unknown.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, over 30 Iranian drivers and aid
workers, accused of shipping supplies to the opposition forces,
are still held in the Taliban's prisons.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Brahimi's visit was not the only effort by the
international community, but it was the most important one and
Iran hopes the visit would be successful.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent withdrawal of a group of Iranian
diplomats from Pakistan, Kharrazi reiterated that they were
recalled because of the insecure situation there.
</P>
<P>
Iran, predominated by Shiite Muslims, said its diplomats faced
serious terrorist threats in Pakistan, which has an overwhelming
Sunni Muslim population. Their relations tumbled because Islamabad
supported the Taliban and Tehran backed its rival, the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi said Iran hopes its move would not be seen as
a sign of any change in bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Go to U.S. Court for Refund of F-16s Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has finally decided
to go to U.S. court for the refund of 658 million U.S. dollars
which it paid the United States for the purchase of 28 F-16
fighter planes.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Karachi-based major English daily
Dawn, the Pakistani government has engaged a U.S. law firm, Patton
Boggs, for initiating legal proceedings against the U.S.
government for the breach of contract and recovery of the paid
money.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Law Minister Khalid Anwer is reported to have had
meetings with six U.S. law firms in July this year. And Patton
Boggs has finally been selected after evaluating the proposals of
the U.S. firms, their assessment of the legal aspects and fees.
</P>
<P>
A representative of Patton Boggs will arrive in Pakistan later
this month for the legal matter.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan signed a contract for the purchase of 28 F-16 fighters
on September 27, 1989 at the cost of 1.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In October 1990, the U.S. passed the Pressler amendment which
banned arms supply to Pakistan. Pakistan continued quarterly
payments in the hope that sanctions against it would be lifted.
Pakistan stopped its payment when the U.S. refused to deliver the
planes.
</P>
<P>
The suit for the refund of money would be filed in a U.S. court
of claims. The decision of the court can be impugned in the
relevant circuit of U.S. court of appeals and eventually in the
U.S. supreme court.
</P>
<P>
According to the assessment given to the Pakistani government,
the decision of the court of claims will take about two years. If
any party approached the appellate court, it will take another two
or three years.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government had expected that after Pakistan's
nuclear detonations in May this year, the dispute would be
resolved out of court.
</P>
<P>
However, after a recent visit by Pakistani officials to the
U.S., the government has come to the conclusion that legal remedy
was the only solution of the F-16 issue.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Arafat Meet in Three-Way Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ BORDER CROSSING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- During her second
day of shuttle diplomacy Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright brought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat together for talks.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral talks, which have just started, took place at
this border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu
and Arafat met here almost exactly a year ago - on October 8 last
year, seven months after the peace process began to falter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the holding of the trilateral talks itself
signifies that progress has been made in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday night
that real progress has been made in the talks and "the mood is
right." But he stressed that dozens of unresolved issues still
remained, such as interim matters, the third redeployment, and
perhaps most importantly, security.
</P>
<P>
Albright is on a mission to bring the two sides closer to
completing a deal for a further Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, paving the way for a Middle East summit expected to be held
in Washington in mid-October between Netanyahu, Arafat and
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
She has held two rounds of talks with Netanyahu and one with
Arafat Tuesday, which she described as "useful."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Lure Foreign Capital to Hi-Tech Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus aims to develop a viable
hi-tech industry amid encouraging signs that major multinationals
abroad may be interested in investing in the area of technology
and energy.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Minister of Commerce and Industry Nicos Rolandis made
the statement in an interview with the weekly business newspaper
"Financial Mirror," published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis, who just returned from a trip to the United States,
said that following intensive contacts with ranking officials of
major corporations, he felt they have "a lot of interest" in
setting up new divisions that will help toward the creation of a
viable hi-tech industry in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the immediate areas of interest include software
development, biotechnology, development of new technologies and
energy and design of electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two committees he appointed to hammer out a
new industrial policy, with special emphasis on the creation of a
hi-tech sector, are to hand in their reports by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said his ministry will also come up with specific
measures to attract foreign investors and set up a mechanism by
which to overcome bureaucratic hurdles confronting foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
On incentives that may be offered to foreign investors,
Rolandis said these include tax breaks, subsidies on the
construction of new production facilities, stable labour costs,
the availability of well-trained staff and other support measures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover he said plans are underway to attract a large number
of Cypriots currently living abroad, who together with the
existing human resources available on the island would become the
nucleus around which a viable hi-tech industry can take shape.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Special Silk Storehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China has recently opened a
special silk storehouse in the city of Wujiang in eastern Jiangsu
Province, in a bid to regulate the prices of silk and products at
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest silk exporting country and the
silk export has been a major source of foreign exchange income.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's silk industry has suffered a decline
since 1994 when uncontrolled competition led to sharp price cuts,
increased stocks and poor economic returns for silk export
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, the government has established a silk
storage system and set up a special storehouse. The government has
decided to allocate two billion yuan (about 240 million
U.S. dollars) to purchase silk in order to regulate the market
price and avoid abnormal fluctuations in both silk production and
prices.
</P>
<P>
Located at the center of China's major silk producing areas,
Wujiang has been one of the country's important bases of silk
production and export. The existing facilities and management
expertise there are favorable for the establishment of the special
silk storehouse.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok's Office Market Expected to Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok's office market is
expected to worsen and vacancy rates will range between 35-40
percent in the second half of this year, Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of April, the average vacancy rate of offices in
Bangkok's central business district stood at 22 percent, twice of
that in Kuala Lumpur (11 percent) and over four times as much as
that of Manila (4 percent), TNA quoted real estate consultant
Jones Lang Wootton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vacancies in Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Manila are
increasing as new projects are introduced at a time of declining
demand. Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta will all have vacancy
rates of around 20 percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Vacancies in Bangkok will remain some way ahead, with the
completion of new office projects over the second half of this
year, resulting in a vacancy rate of 35-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
By the end of April, office rents in Bangkok were considered as
the cheapest when compared with Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.
Rents in Bangkok were expected to fall further in the second half
of this year.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Amid stormy trading on the currency markets, the shekel
depreciated by 2.04 percent against the dollar Tuesday, with the
representative rate set at a new high of 4.011 shekels to a
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Bank Leumi dealing room head Haim Formowitz said that the main
reason for shekel's decline was the rise of the dollar abroad. He
also said that the currency markets are expected to be volatile in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that
he would go ahead with construction in Tel Rumeida, a Jewish
enclave in the West Bank city of Hebron, but that the work would
not begin until an archaeological salvage dig has been conducted.
</P>
<P>
With the announcement, Netanyahu apparently tried to please
both settlers pressing for a quick start of construction and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has demanded a
halt to settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A three-way meeting among U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat will be held Wednesday at the Eretz border crossing
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at bringing Israel and the Palestinians
closer to completing a deal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank. If Albright succeeds in bridging the remaining gaps
over a U.S. peace initiative, a deal may be signed in Washington
later this month.

<HEADLINE> Scenic Area to Be Built Near Largest Saltwater Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A national-level tourist area
will be built near China's largest saltwater lake in the
northwestern province of Qinghai, according to the China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Lake covers an area of 4,583 square kilometers and is
about 200 kilometers from the capital city of Xi'ning. A number of
attractive mountains, islands, and old towns are scattered around
the lake.
</P>
<P>
But not very many tourists head for the lake because of
a short tourism season, incomplete tourist facilities and cold
weather over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The CNTA and the Qinghai provincial government have jointly
drawn up a plan to develop tourism resources, build hotels
catering to average folks as well as a convention center and
villas, and operate a luxury tourist ship on the lake.
</P>
<P>
The lake will become a large tourist resort, said a CNTA
official, adding that this is a key project among the country's
massive efforts to speed up the development of ecological tourism
resources in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Emerges as New Turpan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dynasty Winery Co. Ltd.
never dreamed an ideal grape production base would emerge right at
its doorsteps in Chadian Village in the north China municipality
of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The rather obscure village was home to only a few small
vineyards a short 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
A vineyard filled with heavily laden vines currently stretches
for miles over 1,800 hectares. The vineyard is five times larger
than the famous 1,500-meter Turpan grape corridor in west China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The Tianjin vineyard has
estimated annual grape production capacity of some 35,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Tianjin is quite different that in Turpan, a
city widely known as one of the nation's major fruit production
bases. Tianjin grapes are used solely for winemaking, particularly
the Rose Aroma variety which has two national medals for high
quality.
</P>
<P>
The vineyard is a major supplier for the Dynasty Winery, a
Sino-French joint venture which is a flagship enterprise in the
country's wine industry.
</P>
<P>
The winery, however, is not the sole beneficiary, with
statistics show that the vineyard contribute over 100 million
yuan annually in local revenue and grape growers themselves earn
an average 12,000 yuan per year.

efforts "the link-up of the two networks will not only shorten the
geographic distance between the two countries, but will also play
a role in enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship of the
two people."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged First-User Certificates after
observing a dialogue over the network between a female student at

A team of boys and girls gathered today in the garden of the
Observatory for some extra-curricular science activities, as the

<P>
The couple then climbed atop the observatory, now a showcase
for a dozen ancient astrological instruments. Mrs. Blair was
surprised to learn that one of the instruments is still used by
students today.
</P>
<P>
The Observatory staff then presented the Blairs with a model of
one of the instruments made in 1673.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his impressions of the Observatory, Blair
said, "It's extraordinary. More interesting is that it is an
example of early collaboration between the East and the West. It's
wonderful!"

<HEADLINE> Zambia Loses $600M Due to Gemstone Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is losing 600 million
U.S. Dollars annually through illegal exports of gemstones
especially emeralds.
</P>
<P>
A report issued recently by the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) said that tracking the performance of the gemstone
sub-sector in Zambia is a very difficult exercise due to informal
operations and the bad record of small miners in adhering to tax
obligations.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the value of gemstones being smuggled out of
the country, Zambia earned only 10.3 million Dollars and 13.8
million Dollars respectively in 1996 and 1997, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Copperbelt Development Association (CBA) has said
that while drawing up policies for the mining sector, the
government should include gemstones into these policies instead
of concentrating on copper alone.
</P>
<P>
CBA publicity secretary Tim Kondolo complained that precious
stone mining on the Copperbelt is still in its infancy in spite
of having been going on for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
If properly exploited, the gemstone industry has the potential
of becoming a major foreign exchange earner next to copper, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The CBA official called on the Zambian government to improve
security in the area as this is an important step of attracting
investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
On the on-going privatization of the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM), the ECA report said that the successful
transfer of the mines into private hands is the key to enhancing
not only the mining sector but the entire economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
It noted that while small mines have already been disposed of,
only the sale of bigger Nkana and Nchanga mines will attest the
government's commitment to the full privatization of the mining
sector.
</P>
<P>
"The mines sold so far are considered as small cows in
Zambia's mining pen and the world is waiting for the sale of
Nkana and Nchanga copper mines, the fattest milk cows," said the
report.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Reaching Tax Revenue Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Although the growth rate of its
industrial and commercial tax revenues so far this year has been
lower than in the past few years, China will still be able to
reach this year's target of increasing revenues by 80 billion yuan
(9.6 billion U.S. dollars), according to sources from the State
Tax Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's industrial and commercial tax
revenues reached 515 billion yuan (62 billion U.S. dollars) in the
first eight months, up 7.9 percent over the same period last year
or an increase of 37.7 billion yuan (4.5 billion U.S. dollars),
60.7 percent of this year's targeted amount.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Administration of
Taxation, in the first half of the year revenue increase basically
matched the country's economic growth, with an 8.8 percent growth
in industrial and commercial tax revenues, higher than the
country's 7 percent GDP growth for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Asian financial crisis and slumping
domestic demand are among the major causes of the slow revenue
growth.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months the country's taxation system stepped
up supervision of tax levies and recovered overdue taxes worth
17.3 billion yuan (2 billion U.S. dollars), and at the same time
disposed of many tax evasion cases.
</P>
<P>
Vice-director of the SAT Lu Renfa said that with full support
from the State Council and the expected recovery of the economy
in the second half, the target of increasing revenues
by 80 billion yuan this year can be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Eurobond Issue Makes a Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Amid the world financial market,
turmoil, Lebanon on Tuesday recorded a sell-out when it went ahead
with the issue of a new 100 million U.S. dollar Eurobond, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The issue, which carries an interest yield of 8.75 percent
over a seven-year period, was launched by the U.S.-based
international financial group Merrill Lynch, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This is Lebanon's third Eurobond issue in one year, after two
successful borrowings of 1 billion dollars in March and 350
million dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government planned to borrow a total of 2 billion
dollars on international financial market within this year in an
effort to restructure its national debt, which is predominated by
the high interest rate Lebanese pound.
</P>
<P>
Fuad Sinyoura, Lebanese minister of state for financial
affairs, said that 42 percent of the buyers of this issue were
non-Lebanese, as four Lebanese banks bought substantial quantities
of the Eurobond.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the strong demand for the new issue
came shortly after the news was leaked that Lebanon's Army
Commander Emile Lahoud has been given the nod of approval from
Syria to become the country's next president.
</P>
<P>
During the Lebanese-Syrian summit meeting on Monday, Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi
agreed that Lebanon's constitution be amended to clear way for the
succession of Lahoud to Hrawi's post.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 35,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, is believed to
be the main power broker and only king-maker in the country.

YANGON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- There remain only 223 parliament
representatives out of the 485 elected in the 1990 general
election in Myanmar, according to a military official.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Thein Swe, head of the Department of Bureau of
Strategic Studies of the Ministry of Defense, disclosed at a press
conference here Wednesday that of the 485 elected MPs, 27 were
dead, 61 resigned and 174 removed, indicating that the remainder
does not constitute half of the total number elected.
</P>
<P>
Of the remainder, 147 are from the National League for
Democracy (NLD) party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on some events which have taken place since April
this year, the official said that "the NLD has been deliberately
employing all kinds of tactics and pursuing a course that would
result in confrontation and collision with the government."
</P>
<P>
Regarding NLD's recent unilateral formation of the People's
Parliament, he also warned that the government will be tolerating
the unlawful acts with magnanimity as long as there is no harm to
the state and the people.

<HEADLINE> US Urged To Lift Injunction on Timber Imports from NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith Wednesday urged the United
States to lift an injunction stopping the issue of new permits or
the renewal or amendment of existing permits for the import of
non-tropical timber from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an on-going annual conference of the New Zealand
Forest Owners Association in Wellington, Smith said New Zealand's
view is that "there is no justification for the injunction", which
was issued by the U.S. District Court in San Francisco in July.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a study of pest intercepts in the U.S. between
August 1995 and March 1998 shows no intercepts on logs and lumber
from New Zealand. "Our view is shared by the U.S. Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture," he added.
</P>
<P>
Smith said New Zealand is expecting a hearing to be held in
early January 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Smith said the past year had been a "tough" one
for New Zealand forest industry with exports to Japan and the
Republic of Korea reducing more than a quarter.
</P>
<P>
In those two markets alone, he said, New Zealand has lost
nearly 300 million New Zealand dollars (150 million U.S. dollars)
in export receipts.
</P>
<P>
"Across the board the decline has been 6 percent in the year to
June -- not good, but not totally disastrous as some would have us
believe," he said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Should Think About Single Currency with Australia: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A single currency could
replace the
New Zealand and Australian dollars sometime next decade, according
to a
New Zealand banking expert.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Wednesday frontpaged an interview
with
Professor David Tripe, director of Massey University's Center for
Banking
Studies, quoting him as saying less than three months before the
European
Union takes its first concrete step to a single currency, the
"Euro", New
Zealand "should think about a single currency with Australia --
perhaps
the 'anzac'."
</P>
<P>
Now was the time to start thinking about a single currency,
though it
could take five to 10 years to introduce, he told the Dominion.
</P>
<P>
Tripe noted that a single currency would simplify trade, reduce

business transaction costs and be a further step toward a single
market
building on the Closer Economic Relations agreement between the
two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should look at what is going on in Europe carefully because
 there
may be lessons in it which may be of use to us," the professor
said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand and Australia have had a common currency before --
the
pound sterling. Separate currencies were established after both
countries
set up their own central banks but they moved away from sterling
in value
only after the second World War.

<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China is currently tightening
controls over the use of recently issued treasury bonds valued at
100 billion yuan in order to help ensure fulfillment of this
year's eight percent economic growth target.
</P>
<P>
According to today's People's Daily, 17 inspection teams will
be dispatched to 27 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
to oversee the effort, according to Zeng Peiyan, minister of the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The most recent treasury bond issue was supported by an equal
amount of special bank loans. Related funds will be earmarked for
infrastructure construction projects designed to boost domestic
demand and offset the negative impact of financial crisis sweeping
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Investing such a large amount of money in such a short period
of time is unprecedented, said Zeng, adding that strict
supervision will be necessary to properly implementing the
investment plan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance recently announced regulations
governing the supervision and timely placement of funds.

<HEADLINE> Lover's Promenade Disappears in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai media once carried
numerous stories about the so-called "Lover's Promenade" along the
famous Bund, a popular attraction for visitors from throughout the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, an Australian tourist recently expressed
disappointment that the formerly popular area has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The Lover's Promenade was popular for over 20 years until
numerous public entertainment venues for young people opened in
the city, according to a local resident name Xu, who lives on
Ermei Street near the Bund.
</P>
<P>
Numerous older Shanghainese met their future mates along the
Bund. Xu, 50, recalled how he referred to the Bund as "the same
old place" when making a date with his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Xunzheng, an academician with the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that young couples dating 20 years ago found it
difficult to have a romantic place to spend their leisure time in
the densely populated city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that couples would congregate along the Lover's
Promenade in droves when the area was at its peak. He said couples
would flock to the area along the Huangpu River levee like birds
at dusk, with little room left for those arriving late.
</P>
<P>
The promenade began to loose its appeal in the mid-1980s when
reform and opening gave the city a new look.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has constructed housing complexes covering two million
sq.m. and modern transportation facilities such as subway and
viaducts in the area over the past two decades. Housing conditions
have improved dramatically and younger Shanghainese now enjoy
greater privacy at home.
</P>
<P>
Young couples can now visit a wide array of favorite venues
such as new department stores, teahouses, cafes, restaurants and
dance halls.
</P>
<P>
The over 7,000 hectares of city parks also offer a pleasing
environment for young couples.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that many young people have never heard of the Lover's
Promenade. He also noted that the young people of today enjoy a
more colorful life than his generation.
</P>
<P>
While large groups of people continue to enjoy the cool breeze
and beautiful sites along the river levee, the once famous Lover's
Promenade no longer exists.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Plans Massive Telecommunications Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality in
southwest China plans to invest 11.6 billion yuan (1.4 billion
U.S. dollars) over the next three years in developing
telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
The figure will exceed total telecommunications investments
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, China's newest municipality, lags behind other major
metropolitan areas in terms of telecommunications infrastructure,
especially related facilities in rural areas. The lack of access
to convenient telecommunications has made it inconvenient for
overseas investors to do business in the city.
</P>
<P>
Municipal government statistics show that only 25 percent of
the local villages have access to telephones, with the access rate
some 50 lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The local government plans to build the city into
an"information port" in order to improve the investment
environment and promote the development of high technology.
</P>
<P>
Funding over the next three years will mainly be used to build
a main transmission network, exchange platforms, a village
telecommunications network and the telecommunications network in
the Three Gorges area.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN Security Council to Resume Comprehensive Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions is the legal
and moral responsibility of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting President of the Security Council Jeremy
Greenstock of Britain, Aziz, who is here for a visit, told
reporters that Iraq had not received sufficient guarantees from
the council that it would conduct an honest review of Iraq's
progress in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction in return
for Iraq's resumption of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that deliberations of the council and the work
on the preparations, the basis, and the framework of the
comprehensive review has not yet reached its final end," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who has been here for over a week, is trying to work out
a solution to the latest impasse over U.N. arms inspection in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He has held two rounds of talks with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, which yielded no results. The third round of talks
between Aziz and Annan will take place on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors
in early August, a move the council called totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the council's repeated calls for the resumption of
cooperation, Iraq has not changed its stand. Last month, the
Council decided to suspend its regular review of U.N. sanctions
against Iraq until the latter reverses its decision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council offered to conduct a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance of U.N relevant resolutions once the
nation resumes cooperation with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Lashes Out at South Korean-Japanese Fishery Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Wednesday strongly
criticized a South Korean-Japanese fisheries accord, calling it
violation of the sovereignty the Korean nation and a "brutal
trample" on international law.
</P>
<P>
Japan and South Korea in September reached accord on a new
fisheries pact, under which the two countries will establish a
fishing zone around a disputed group of islets in the Sea of
Japan, called Takeshima in Japan and Tokto in South Korea, 35
nautical miles from the shores of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper pointed out
that the accord defining Takeshima, or Tokto, as "tentative
waters" where Japan can fish and explore reveals Japan's intention
to incorporate the islets into its territory and establish
administration there.
</P>
<P>
The islets shall never be a bargaining chip, the commentary
emphasized, adding that Japan has no rights to make explorations
in the area. It also urged South Korea to "stop selling out its
territory and resources."
</P>
<P>
Another DPRK official newspaper, Democratic Korea, also carried
an article attacking the South Korean-Japanese accord.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Political Talks on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday night called for an early resumption of unconditional
talks between the two parties in Kosovo conflicts in order to
achieve "a comprehensive political solution."
</P>
<P>
In an oral statement to the press, Jeremy Greenstock, president
of the 15-member Security Council for October, said that "Council
members insisted on the need for an early resumption of
negotiations, without preconditions, in pursuit of a comprehensive
political settlement of the (Kosovo) crisis."
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of the council's consultation on
a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said that the
fighting was intensified in Kosovo after the Security Council
adopted a resolution on September 23 demanding an immediate
ceasefire in Serbia's province of mainly ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"Council members supported the Secretary-General's call for a
thorough investigation, under international supervision or with
international participation, of atrocities committed by all sides
to the conflict," the statement said, adding "They urged the ICTY
(the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia) to
extend its investigations to cover these atrocities."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members shared Annan's assessment of the
danger of a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, the statement said,
adding that "they underlined the importance of full and unimpeded
humanitarian access throughout the affected area and the need to
create conditions for the safe return of refugees and displaced
persons to their homes."
</P>
<P>
The Council members asked Annan to consider how he could ensure
that the United Nations Secretariat had "a first-hand capacity" to
assess development on the ground, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed that "there had yet to be full
compliance with all the requirement" of relevant Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, they made clear their determination to see
full and sustained compliance in accordance in accordance with
their responsibilities under the (U.N.) Charter," it added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Security Council noted that "military activity had
appeared to wind down and withdrawals had taken place in recent
days, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The oral statement was made as NATO was preparing for possible
air strikes on Yugoslavia if Belgrade failed to carry out the
resolution requirement.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report to the Security Council, said on Monday
that Kosovo had witnessed "appalling atrocities" over the past
weeks, and the Serbian security forces should bear the bulk of the
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Tuesday afternoon,
Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to
the United Nations, voiced his dissatisfaction with Annan's
report, saying the report "is one-sided, and inadequate in many
things."
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts broke out in Kosovo in February this year after
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's two
million population, have been battling with Serbs for
independence.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided
to file an anti-subsidy case and initiate anti-dumping proceedings
against elastic rubber tape exports from India, a government
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first such case by the United States against
India. The results of the investigations into the subsidies are
expected to be out around November 12 this year and a preliminary
report of the anti-dumping proceedings around January 25 next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both moves have serious implications for India's exports and
are likely to put subsidy schemes in trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has started several such cases against
Indian exports before.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a growing number of such cases and the resultant
threat to various export incentive schemes, India's Commerce
Ministry constituted a special cell last month to fight against
anti-subsidy and anti-dumping investigations concerning Indian
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Indian products against which anti-subsidy and anti-dumping
cases have been filed by the European Union include stainless
steel bright bars, steel wire ropes and cables, stainless steel
fasteners, antibiotics and polyester filament yarn.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung arrived in Japan Wednesday for a four-day state visit for
talks with Japanese leaders on the establishment of a new
bilateral partnership in the next century.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, his first trip to Japan since taking office
in February, Kim is expected to have an audience with Japanese
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko and hold summit talks with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
At the Seoul-Tokyo summit talks Thursday, Kim and Obuchi will
discuss a wide range of issues including Japan's apology for its
past colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula and bilateral
cooperation in economic and other areas, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to issue a "joint declaration of a
new South Korea-Japan partnership for the 21st century" at the end
of their meeting, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and Kim may also sign a provisional agreement on a new
bilateral fisheries pact Thursday, which the two countries,
through last-ditch efforts, managed to achieve in time for Kim's
visit.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Kim is scheduled to deliver a speech at
Japan's Diet (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The South Korean leader will also travel to Osaka in western
Japan before wrapping up his visit Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In Seoul, senior South Korean officials said Kim's trip will be
highlighted by non-economic issues despite economic issues are no
less important.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean people are observing the state visit with keen
interest, keeping a specially close eye on whether Japan will
apologize for its atrocities in the 1910-1945 colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, Japanese emperors and prime ministers have failed
to make official apology for Japan's atrocities and war crimes
against Koreans and the people in other nations countries in
history.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials said they are expecting Japan to make a
"full apology" for the atrocities it committed against Korea and
the Korean people in history.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials hoped that Kim's visit will expand
offical dialogue channels between cabinet members of the two
countries in various fields such as defense, economy and culture.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Vows to Support Yugoslavia Against Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Lukashenko
stated in Minsk on Tuesday that his country would extend all
possible support for Yugoslavia against threatened NATO-led
military strike against the country over the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Lukashen declared to the
press that Belarus was prepared to support Yugoslavia in every
aspect, including providing weapons and military equipment to
fight back possible NATO-led attacks. However, he said Belarus
would not send troops to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko stressed Belarus's support for Russia's opposition
to NATO's resort of force, but only Belarus's stand was even
tougher. He said Minsk would "support Slavic brothers on every
issue."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that Estonian Defense Minister Oovel
said his country might participate in NATO's military actions in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that insofar as NATO suggests its partner states
participate in the "peace-keeping" activities in Kosovo, Estonia
would consider it very carefully.
</P>
<P>
He said the Defense Ministry of Estonia regards participation
in such activities as absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
Oovel pointed out that Russia's opposition to western countries'
military actions in Kosovo would not influence Estonia's position,
because "Estonia is an independent country."
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia
unless Yugoslavia ends the conflict with Kosovo ethnic Albanian
separatists and negotiate an autonomy agreement with them for the
southern Serbian province.

(825.49 million U.S. dollars) on airport development during the
9th five-year plan period (1998-2002). International and domestic
passenger traffic is estimated to grow by about 6 percent and 10
percent respectively during the plan period. Cargo traffic is
expected to rise by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Concrete steps for involving the private sector in development
of airports are necessary as airport construction is highly
capital intensive," officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority of India also plans to take up expansion
and modification of existing terminal buildings, construction of
new terminals and complexes at 30 airports in the country at an
estimated cost of some 4.44 billion rupees (97.2 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Urges Strengthening Architecture of Monetary System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank chief
urged world financial leaders at a meeting here to strengthen the
architecture of the international monetary system so as to
effectively prevent and resolve financial crises.
</P>
<P>
"The main cause of the current crisis is that international
cooperation and the evolution of the international financial
system lag far behind economic globalization and the financial
integration process," said Dai Xianglong, Governor of the People's
Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
"The speed of liberalization exceeded the pace of enhancing the
economic management abilities of the crises-hit countries," added
Dai at the first day session of the three-day annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that the faster pace of globalization in the early
1990s has led to a substantial increase in capital flow which has
been beneficial to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
But more and more capital flow and foreign exchange
transactions have become dissociated from production and trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
Speculators with huge sums of capital are able to take large
leveraged positions to control and manipulate markets for profit,
causing volatility, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has not come to a consensus on
effective mechanisms for the monitoring and containment of risks
brought about by volatile capital flow," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that capital account convertibility should be carried
out in an orderly and well sequenced manner. Member countries are
entitled to determine measures to manage capital flow, taking into
consideration of their specific circumstances and stages of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on China's experience with foreign exchange management
system reform, he said that "if a country lacks the conditions for
full convertibility, while still in need of foreign capital, it
can keep foreign debt at a reasonable size with well-structured
maturities (debts due at a certain time) through appropriate
foreign exchange management."
</P>
<P>
He called on major industrial countries to take primary
responsibility for maintaining the stability of the international
financial system and the steady growth of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"They should strengthen the coordination of interest rates and
exchange rate policies to stabilize international financial
markets."
</P>
<P>
He also urged industrial nations to increase their financial
assistance to crises-affected countries, expand their imports from
those countries, and guard against trade protectionism. At the
same time, those huge speculative funds should be well regulated
by the authorities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The governor commended the IMF and the World Bank for their
efforts and contributions in preventing and solving financial
crises in some regions and countries. He hoped the international
financial institutions could play a more effective role in
resolving the current financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the World Bank for increasing the price of its
loans at a time of substantial reductions in capital flowing to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"This departs from the Bank's long-standing principle of
pricing loans according to the development purpose, thus sending
the wrong signal to international capital markets, harming its
good relations with borrowing members, and eventually hurting its
own reputation," said Dai.

<HEADLINE> Thailand May Be First Out of Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Staporn Kavitanon,
secretary-general of the Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI) has
expressed "cautious optimism" that Thailand is well on the way to
being the first nation to emerge from the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Staporn told the British-Thai Business Group Tuesday that
macroeconomic indicators, such as exports, showed a "light at the
end of the tunnel" although gross domestic product (GDP) growth is
still likely to contract by around 8 percent this year, the
Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While the value of Thai exports is likely to decline in U.S.
dollar terms, the volume has risen by 14 percent in the first
seven months this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of products such as computers, canned seafood, rubber
products and automobiles and components are showing double-digit
growth in dollar terms and traditional exports such as rice and
garments are higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
"Thai exports to the European Union which accounts for some 16
percent of all Thai exports, increased by 12.1 percent during the
first half of 1998 and exports to the United States were also up
sharply," Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
The BOI estimated that exports for this year will exceed 53
billion U.S. dollars which, when combined with declines in
imports, will result in a healthy trade surplus of about 11.5
billion dollars. Staporn said that by the end of the year, the
current account will show a surplus of 15 billion dollars, roughly
14 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed to the healthy flow of foreign direct
investment (FDI). For the first five months of this year, FDI,
according a Bank of Thailand's report, was roughly equivalent to
the 104 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) received in the whole
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months, the baht traded at a relatively
narrow range of 38-42 to the dollar, despite concerns about the
Japanese yen, the Malaysian ringgit and other regional
currencies. In the past two weeks, the baht has strengthened again
and is now trading under 40 to a dollar, Staporn said.
</P>
<P>
He said the increased stability of the baht permitted the Bank
of Thailand to relax monetary policy allowing interest rates to
fall dramatically.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inflation for September was 7 percent, reducing
the annual forecast to less than 9 percent -- well below the
International Monetary Fund target.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities seized
498,000 tablets of amphetamine stimulant drug in a raid in the
country's eastern Shan state late last month, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The seizure was made by a combined team of regional

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Flood-Hit Industries Get Special Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the central bank
of the country, has identified about 1,200 flood-affected
industrial units to provide them with special credit for immediate
rehabilitation, The Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank also estimated that the loss of the industrial units
badly-hit by the country's worst-ever flooding will be over 6
billion taka (about 127.7 million U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has prepared a report on the flood-affected
industrial units after conducting a survey in cooperation with the
specialized and commercial banks and the report is likely to be
submitted to the Finance Ministry soon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bank loans for rehabilitating flood-hit industrial units
including garment, small and cottage industries and other
industrial units would be provided on the basis of the Bangladesh
Bank's report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention the amount of special loans
to be given to the identified flood-affected industrial units.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's estimate of flood damage to the industrial
sector was much lower than that by the Bangladesh Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, which estimated that about 11,000
industrial units had been badly affected by the
over-two-month-long flooding and the loss of the industrial sector
was about 20 billion taka (about 425.5 million dollars), the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the central bank in a circular asked the
specialized and commercial banks to give special loans only to the
flood-affected industrial units to be identified by the bank.

<HEADLINE> WBA Can't Give Welterweight Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- WBA won't be allowed to
award its vacant welterweight title to the winner of the bout
between its No.1 and No. 3 boxers, a state judge ruled today in
New Jersey, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after the WBA's No. 2 contender, Jose Luis
Lopez, challenged the sanctioning, saying WBA was obligated to
let him fight for the title.
</P>
<P>
State Superior Court Judge Amos C. Saunders agreed, and
ordered that the WBA must let promoters bid on a fight between
Lopez and the No. 1 contender, Andrey Pestrayev of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The fight between Pestrayev and No. 3 James Page on October 10
can continue.
</P>
<P>
Main Events lawyer Patrick C. English said it was highly
unusual for the No. 2 contender to be excluded from a title fight
when the title is vacant.
</P>
<P>
The ruling from Saunders came Monday following a hearing in
his Passaic courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The WBA welterweight crown was vacated by Ike Quartey of Ghana
for a shot at the WBC welterweight belt November 21 against Oscar
De La Hoya. Lopez fought Quartey to a 12-round draw in October.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Sees Financial Crisis Rooted in System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, Managing
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Tuesday said
the whole financial system, not just individual country, was now
sunk in crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the IMF-World Bank Annual
Meeting, Camdessus said, "We are speaking not just of countries in
crisis, but of a system in crisis, a system not yet sufficiently
adapted to the opportunities and risks of globalization."
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the current situation was not as dire as
in 1928 when the world plunged into recession, and that
"recession on a global scale can be avoided."
</P>
<P>
"If we keep a steady nerve, if all countries pursue stability,
structural adjustment and orderly liberalization of their
economies, this crisis can be overcome. And countries at the heart
of the turmoil can emerge stronger and better prepared for the
challenges of the next decades."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said existing programs in Asia were working well, and
both exchange rates and interest rates were stabilizing and moving
to more appropriate levels. "Inflation is in check, external
positions have strengthened remarkably as current accounts have
swung from deficit to large surplus," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
However, Camdessus added that countries need to cooperate "to
repair the major shortcomings in the global system which the
crisis has brought to light."

<HEADLINE> Rubin Consults U.N. Chief for Better Handling of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
Treasury Robert Rubin met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
here Tuesday evening to discuss how the United Nations can do its
part to help overcome the financial crisis now affecting the world.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a 45-minute caucus in the U.N. building in New
York, Rubin said they focused on the immediate challenges certain
parts of the world will face and prevention of crisis in the
future.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. plays a very important role in nation-building and
institution-building in developing and emerging market countries,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The world body has been trying to deal with long-run problems,
and now it is having an additional burden to bear when the
financial crisis is going to create more poverty and more need for
humanitarian assistance, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The more serious the crisis comes to certain parts of the
world, the more serious it is going to affect us," Rubin said,
adding that that is why the U.S. sees it so imperative to support
institutions like the U.N., "which are very central to deal with
these problems."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said "it is enormously in the U.S. interests" for his
country to pay its 1.6-billion-U.S.-dollar back dues to the
U.N. and to pay its quota for the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
Annan said they discussed some of the things that the U.N.
tries to do to help governments strengthen their institutions, in
addition to stressing the need for more aid and investment flows
and debt relief for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time a U.S. Secretary of Treasury coming out
of an IMF-World Bank meeting has chosen to consult with a
U.N. Secretary-General, not only on the current crisis, but also
seeking solutions in the long-run, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was requested by the U.S. administration, the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan, he and Rubin did not discuss specific work
plans, but their discussions would continue.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Development Zones Promote Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's development zones have
taken full advantage of the capital's comprehensive investment
environment to record rapid development and emerge as a new focal
point of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of 1997 show that more than 8,100
enterprises had established operations in the Beijing's New
Technology Experiment Pilot Zone, Economic and Technological
Development Zone and various other industrial zones in the city's
22 districts and counties.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises in the zones recorded a 1997 output value of
25.1 billion yuan (3.02 billion US dollars) and accounted for 14.6
percent of the city's total industrial output value, up
dramatically on the 2.4 percent level for five years ago.
</P>
<P>
High technology operations, which account for some 80 percent
of enterprises in the zones, involve electronic information,
electromechanical, bioengineering, new resource, pharmaceuticals
and building-materials
 sectors.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's development zones have also attracted more than 1,000
foreign enterprises, with contracted foreign funds totalling 3.2
billion US dollars, including foreign direct investment (FDI) of
2.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The zones approved 338 foreign-funded enterprises during the
first six months of this year, up 1.5-fold on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development has been attributed to the improved
investment environment in the Chinese capital and a series of
preferential policies local governments have adopted to attract
foreign funds.

<HEADLINE> Panama Reiterates not to Re-open MCC Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Panama on Tuesday ruled out
the possibility that it will resume negotiations with the United
States while President Perez Balladares is in power on the setting
up of an anti-drug center in the central American country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Panama and the United States have sought to agree
on establishing a Panama-based Multinational Counternarcotics
Center (MCC) in which military personnel from the United States
and other hemispheric countries will take part.
</P>
<P>
But last month, the two countries announced that they failed to
reach an agreement after two years of efforts because the
U.S. insisted that its troops be deployed at the center.
</P>
<P>
Under the Panama Canal treaties, American soliders should leave
by December 31, 1999, when the control of the Panama Canal passes
to the Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Eduardo Ritter said Tuesday
that before a new government comes into office on September 1,
1999, it will be impossible for Panama to re-open the MCC
negotiations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ritter made the remarks following an announcement by
U.S. Ambassador to Panama William Hughes, who told local press
that negotiations on establishing the MCC will resume with the
next Panamanian government expected to be elected on May 2, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hughes added that Panama is an appropriate country to practice
military operations in the region, and his country is interested
in resuming negotiations over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said, however, that the U.S. government would be wrong
to re-open the negotiations because the two governments already
decided to end them.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States should initiate steps to
dismantle its Howard Air Force base in Panama, which that country
originally intended to turn into the MCC's future headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Builds 15 Power Plants in Eight Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has built 15
hydroelectric power plants in cooperation with the Yunnan
Machinery Equipment Import and Export Corporation (YMEIEC) of
China since 1990, according to Myanmar electric power authorities
sources.
</P>
<P>
The total value of machinery for the plant projects are worth
about 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise
(MEPE) reached a new 160-million-dollar contract with the YMEIEC
on the implementation of the Paunglaung hydroelectric power
project in Pyinmana, central Mandalay division of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Paunglaung plant is the biggest of its kind and the first
underground factory in Myanmar with an installed capacity of 280
megawatts (mw), accounting for 28 percent of Myanmar's existing
installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to the MEPE, added projects for Ye Ywa, Bilin,
Thaukyekhat, Shweli and Kun will be implemented one after another.
</P>
<P>
A recent annual official report on Myanmar's economy revealed
that the installed generating capacity of the MEPE was 1,207 mw in
the 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March, accounting for 77
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The MEPE generated 4.2 billion kilowatt-hours (kwh) of
electricity in the year, of which 1.6 billion kwh or 39 percent
were produced by hydropower.

<HEADLINE> Many Timber Firms Facing Closure in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Almost half of Indonesia's
timber-related companies may call it quits due to growing
uncertainty over their business, the Jakarta Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Forestry Society's chairman, Sudradjat, Tuesday
said that at least 40 percent of the country's timber-related
companies planned to switch to more promising business sectors
such as plantations.
</P>
<P>
Depletion of the country's forest resources, the soaring prices
of timber and wood-processing equipment, high capital costs and
the government's wavering policies are the major reasons that they
are mulling leaving the industry.
</P>
<P>
"Many timber companies here no longer expect that their logging
contracts will be extended. They are preparing to enter new
businesses which they consider have better prospects, such as
plantations," Sudradjat said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government's plan to limit ownership of
forest assets has raised concerns because wood-processing
industries would no longer have a sufficient log supply if the
legislation is introduced.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia currently has 421 timber companies, 1,701 sawmill
companies, 115 plywood companies and six pulp and paper companies.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat said that at least 156 timber companies whose logging
contracts have ended are still awaiting the government's decision
on whether the contracts would be extended.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overseas demand for Indonesian plywood has shown
signs of improvement with increases in orders from several Asian
countries, the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I have checked with all of Apkindo's (the Association of
Indonesian Wood Panel Producers) member companies. Most of them
have said they have closed their doors to new contracts until the
end of December. But they will receive new orders for next year's
delivery," Sudradjat said.

<HEADLINE> Franco-Italian Summit Ends with Wide-Ranging Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Franco-Italian summit closed in
Florence on Tuesday with Italian and French leaders finding common
ground on virtually all subjects they discussed.
</P>
<P>
They made a joint appeal for diplomatic efforts to help end the
Kosovo crisis in Yugoslavia and agreed on the European Union's
institutional reforms and farm policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, France has
asked Italy to reduce interests rates to contribute to the
continent-wide economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and
his French counterpart Huber Vedrine signed an accord to create a
joint Italian-French university to be based in Turin and Grenoble.
</P>
<P>
However, the summit was overshadowed by an ongoing Italian
government crisis stemmed from differences over the new 1999
budget between Prodi's ruling coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
Even at the press conference after the summit, bilateral issues
were sidelined.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be sincere if I didn't say that there was a cloud
weighing on our discussions," Prodi said, referring to the crisis
which may see his government without a majority in parliament on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
French leaders, on their part, expressed support for the
Italian government.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say that we have the deepest respect for the Italian
government," Chirac said after 90 minutes of talks this morning to
round up the wide-ranging discussions following Monday.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said he believed a solution
would be found to solve the "complex problems" faced by Prodi's
government.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foreign Minister Urges Closer Relations with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini called for closer relations with Iran during a meeting with
visiting Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri in
Rome on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dini expressed Rome's support for "the constructive line of
dialogue" launched by Tehran at the United Nation's general
assembly in New York last month.
</P>
<P>
"Once Iran's international relations are fully restored, it
will play a key role in the stability of the Middle East and the
Persian Gulf," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy's wish for stronger ties with Iran was
"confirmed by the intensity of the high-level political contacts
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister visited Iran in March, followed by
Lower House Speaker Luciano Violante in April. Prime Minister
Romano Prodi also made a landmark visit to Tehran in July.
</P>
<P>
Noting that cultural dialogue could play a key role in
bilateral relations, Dini said a series of colloquia with European
and Islamic scholars were being planned by Italy and Iran.
</P>
<P>
At the Lower House in the afternoon, Nouri and Violante signed
a protocol aimed at intensifying strategic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol called for annual meetings between work groups of
the two houses and encouraged contacts between young deputies and
women in the Italian and Iranian parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also met with Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and
Senate Speaker Nicola Mancino on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Confident Government Can Survive Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A confident Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi said on Tuesday that his government has a chance to
steer away from a crisis stemming from differences between
coalition partners over the 1999 draft budget.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a Franco-Italian summit in Florence, Prodi said
his coalition was looking for ways to garner enough votes from its
parliamentary majority to pass the government's 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
"There's a window still open and we intend to proceed in this
direction," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
At meetings last weekend, the Communist Refoundation party, the
left ally in the coalition, voted to withhold its vital support
for the budget package in parliament, sparking concerns for the
survival of Prodi's center-left coalition that went into power in
1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the 34 leftist deputies in the Lower House were
sharply divided on the issue. Chairman of the Communist
Refoundation party Armando Cossutta announced his resignation on
Monday to affirm support for Prodi's administration.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said he would brief parliament on the new budget on
Wednesday and asked for a vote of confidence for his government.
</P>
<P>
"If we receive the vote of confidence, we'll continue.
Otherwise we'll hand over the reins," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition led by Prodi's Olive Tree party enjoys a
comfortable majority in the Upper House, but its majority in the
Lower House relies heavily on the backing of the Communist
Refoundation party.

COLOMBO, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
grant 5.68 million U.S. dollars for the development of the Sri
Lankan fishing industry, the official newspaper Daily News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is a sequel to Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development
Minister M. Rajapakse's recent visit to Japan to seek its
expertise and technology to develop Sri Lanka's fishing sector.
</P>
<P>
Rajapakse Tuesday evening told the paper that part of these

at Tangalle on the country's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
The project envisages upgrading the existing harbor facilities
and adding new features such as a supermarket, hostel, fuel and
cold room facilities, the report quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
A specialized training program will also be inaugurated with
these funds for local fishermen soon, Rajapakse said.
</P>
<P>
He was hopeful that Japan would increase assistance to Sri
Lanka, the minister said, adding that a fisheries cooperative
society in Japan had agreed to provide a two-year training course
for Sri Lanka's fishermen in handling modern equipment.

<P>
BUCHAREST, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania supports the
international community's stand on the Kosovo crisis, but is still
hopeful that a political solution can be achieved, a statement by
the foreign ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that Yugoslav authorities should comply
with a relevant U.N. Security Council resolution, which demands an
immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of Serb forces, granting
international humanitarian and relief groups free access to
Kosovo, and opening negotiations among conflicting parties,
Romania's Media Fax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It voiced support for efforts made by the Six-nation Contact
Group for the former Yugoslavia and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). It also hoped the international community
would take into consideration opinions and security interests of
other countries in the region and prevent the crisis from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
The statement backs the six-nation contact group, the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the
European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations in
their efforts to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It suggests the OSCE ensure an effective monitor of the
settlement to the crisis through direct participation by its
permanent missions.
</P>
<P>
The statement also calls on Belgrade to adopt an open manner
and to trust the international community.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to launch an air attack against Yugoslavia
unless Yugoslavia end the conflict with Kosovo ethnic Albanian
separatists and negotiate an autonomy agreement for the southern
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Russia and many other countries oppose the use of force in
Kosovo. Belgrade has repeatedly claimed that the Kosovo issue is
an internal affair and needs no outside intervention.

ROME, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Threats of military intervention

</P>

Speaking at the end of a two-day French-Italian summit, Italian

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Removing Hurdles to Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering the removal of regulatory barriers hampering the
country's privatization program, the Jakarta Post Wednesday quoted
a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
A regulation on the operation of state-owned infrastructure
companies should be revised to speed up the process of privatizing
such companies, State Minister of the Empowerment of State
Enterprises Tanri Abeng said.
</P>
<P>
Existing law stipulates that the firms and the government have
exclusive rights to manage the country's infrastructure sector and
prohibits the selling of shares to private parties.
</P>
<P>
"The government is considering changes in the law and
regulations so the privatization program can be realized," Tanri
told members of the House of Representatives Commission VIII on
state budget on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to privatize 12 state-owned firms during
the 1998-99 fiscal year ending March in order to inject some 1.5
billion U.S. dollars into the state budget in privatization
proceeds.
</P>
<P>
Tanri admitted that the government would not achieve its target
of privatizing 12 state-owned companies in the current fiscal year
because of the regulations and what he called "social-political"
obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Another barrier i the current bearish capital market sentiment
which is causing difficulties in raising a reasonable amount of
cash from the privatization program, he added.

TIANJIN, October 7 (Xinhua) -- China's social development has
brought great changes to people's ideas about jobs like community
services including nursing, washing, and cleaning.
</P>
<P>
The traditional view was that this kind of work was undignified
and many unemployed workers were unwilling to do it. But things
have changed and "it is far better than just staying idly at
home," according to Wang Ping, a 40-year-old women who was laid

"It was quite difficult at first," Wang says, because the old
woman often complained, and she felt exhausted after a day's
work. But, now she is getting used to it, and they get along quite
well.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is an old industrial and commercial center in northern
China and changes in the economic and industrial structure have
meant that more than 320,000 workers have lost their jobs over the
past few years.
</P>

There are now many organizations that provide community service
jobs for unemployed people. The Tianjin Family Service Company is
one of them, which finds suitable jobs for over 300 people every

<HEADLINE> Forex Adjustment Promotes Vietnam's Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The devaluation of the Vietnamese
dong against the U.S. dollar in August has resulted in larger
profit margins for exporters and a lower trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Ngoc Tuan, head of the government Pricing Committee,
said the change brought a 10-percent profit rise for rice export,
7 percent for fisheries export and more than 1,000 Vietnamese dong
profit for each U.S. dollar's worth of coffee exported.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment has had a big impact on imports, but it has also
meant lower import receipts and an improved balance of trade.
</P>
<P>
The government will consider import subsidies for enterprises
which have incurred large losses due to the adjustment, but in
general business people should take this as a personal challenge,
Tuan was quoted Tuesday by the English daily The Saigon Times as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The official also said Vietnam was facing high pressure from
the large difference then between black market and official rates,
which caused the holding of dollars by speculators and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Vietnam obtained an export turnover
of 6.93 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this
year, up 4.1 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Import receipts in the nine months reached 8.58 billion
dollars, down 0.3 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exports in 1998 are estimated officially at 9 billion
to 9.3 billion dollars, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in the past nine months was 7.9 percent, mostly
caused by higher prices for rice, which went up by 21 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Trend in Eastern China's Private Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 7 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly growing private
sector in China's Zhejiang Province is changing as investment,
products, and organizations continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more private enterprises have shifted
investment from industry to agriculture and services. In the first
half of this year, the number of individual businesses in
agriculture was up 33.54 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Another trend is for private enterprises to put more funds into
research and development of new products. In the six months to
June, over 1,300 new brands were registered.
</P>
<P>
To improve management and their competitive edge, more private
enterprises are incorporating. During the first half of this year,
some 4,000 corporations were set up in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The private enterprises are also actively engaged in the
reorganization of state- and collectively-owned enterprises in the
province. From January to June, they merged with or acquired 460
state- and collectively-owned enterprises. Since 1994, more than
11,200 private enterprises in Zhejiang have left their
collectively-owned status.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's private economy had an industrial output that
accounted for 38 percent of the provincial total in 1997.

<P>
MANILA, October 7 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks after being officially
closed, Philippine Airlines (PAL) Wednesday took to the blue sky
again with the operation of 19 domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
The first flight out of Manila took off at 4:40 a.m. for
Zamboanga, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The national flag carrier first restored flights to 14 domestic
destinations, mostly the major cities in the Philippines. The PAL
management said the resumption of international service will also
be resumed on October 15.
</P>
<P>
PAL announced its re-opening on October 2 following the
favorable outcome of a two-day referendum among PAL ground
employees belonging to the PAL Employees Association and the PAL
management.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, 61 percent of the employees said "yes" to an
agreement brokered by President Joseph Estrada between the
management and the employees.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the management will give to the employees
20 percent of the PAL ownership and three seats in the 12-seat
board of directors in exchange for the suspension of the labor's
collective bargaining agreement for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
PAL closed shop on September 23 due to heavy financial losses
and the breakdown of talks between the management and the PAL
Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
PAL's closure dealt a heavy blow to the country's air traffic
and economy. President Estrada worked hard to save the oldest
airlines in Asia and finally persuaded the two sides to reach the
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Shearer to Stay in Newscastle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle United striker Alan
Shearer has reaffirmed his desire to stay at the club after new
reports that he could quit the success-starved club.
</P>
<P>
The Magpies have failed to win a trophy since Shearer moved to
St James' Park for 15 million in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Question marks about his future on Tyneside were raised when
Ruud Gullit took charge in August but seven goals in four games
put an end to those doubts.
</P>
<P>
However, following Newcastle's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal on
Sunday, Shearer reiterated his wish to be part of winning set-up.
That was interpreted as a threat to quit but he insists he is
prepared to give Gullit a chance to turn things around.
</P>

Shearer said: "I have already pledged my support, commitment
and future to Newcastle United and despite misleading headlines
this morning, this remains the case."
</P>
<P>
Shearer has been repeatedly linked with a move to the
continent both before and after joining the Magpies from
Blackburn, with Barcelona one of the clubs said to be interested
in him.
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa manager John Gregory also came out this season and
said he wanted to sign Shearer but his bid was rejected by both

<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United will have to
get permission from BSkyB if they want to sign any new players
for more than one million pounds (about 1.68 million U.S.
dollars) until a final decision is made on the satellite TV
company's takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB have made a 623.4 million pounds offer for the Old
Trafford club and shareholders have until October 26 to give
their reply.
</P>
<P>
But the deadline could be extended if the Office of Fair
Trading has not reached a conclusion on whether the proposed deal
contravenes government regulations by that date.
</P>
<P>
United would normally not be allowed to conduct any transfer
deals, but Sky have agreed to waive their veto up to the one
million mark.
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman insisted they would make no attempt to
influence United in the transfer market.
</P>
<P>
She said: "Clearly BSkyB has no interest in preventing the
successful running of Manchester United either during the offer
period or once the acquisition is completed. We have no intention
of doing so."
</P>
<P>
United chairman Sir Roland Smith promised on Monday that
manager Alex Ferguson would remain in complete control of team
affairs and the board would continue to oversee the day-to-day
running of the club.

<HEADLINE> Number of Poor People Reduces in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- China's poverty-stricken
population fell from 80 million at the beginning of the 90s to 50
million at the end of 1997, according to China's Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Shen Guofang.
</P>
<P>
However, the unprecedented summer floods made its
poverty-relief task more formidable, he told the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly was in session to deal with the implementation of
the Outcome of the World Summit for Social Development held in
Copenhagen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has affected 21.2 million ha of land and 223
million people, with a direct economic loss of over 20 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the Chinese Government has always made the
elimination of poverty an important part of its program for
national economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
It strives to ensure resources input into the poverty
eradication program by earmarking funds and preferential loans to
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly decided in 1992 to convene a special
session in 2000 to review the follow-up action since the
Copenhagen summit. preparations for the session have already
begun.
</P>
<P>
Shen stressed that as countries differ in their economic basis,
political systems and cultural traditions, they should implement
effective social development strategies and plans in line with
their national conditions.

<P>
NEW YORK, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Blue chip stocks closed with a
small gain, but most other stocks at Wall Street turned lower
Tuesday after a morning rally as investors remained skeptical
about the results of the multinational talks in Washington aimed
at healing the ailing world economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 7,753, 27 points
higher than that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators finished lower despite a morning rally
fueled by Monday's late rebound, big gains on foreign markets and
other positive signs both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones, which lost 58 points on Monday after rallying
back from a 232-point slide fueled by fears about the negative
results of the Washington meetings, is about 1,600 points below
its historic peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has been calling for concerted
and bold actions by the world's leading industrial nations to
contain the growing financial crisis in Asia and Russia. But his
calls has not yet got positive response from U.S. partners in

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia not Satisfied With Annan's Kosovo Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav
diplomat on Tuesday voiced his dissatisfaction with a Monday
report by U.N. Secretary-General who said that the Serb security
forces should bear the bulk of responsibility of what has been
reported as atrocities in Kosovo, Serbia's province of mainly
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the report at all, because it is one
sided and inadequate in many things," said Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here, Jovanovic said, "By
naming Yugoslavia and Serbia the primarily responsible for the
situation in Kosovo, the report turned things upside down."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the primarily responsible side is the side which has
started terrorism in Kosovo, he said, referring to the action by
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to seek independence by force.
</P>
<P>
In his report which suggested Yugoslav forces had made only a
limited withdrawal, Annan blamed Serbian security forces for most
atrocities against Kosovo Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
"The accusations are unfounded, and the allegation is totally
misplaced and misguided," he said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the Yugoslav Government has the right to fight
against terrorism and separatism and to maintain security and
uphold the nation's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement as NATO is preparing a possible air
strike on Yugoslavia if Belgrade fails to carry out the September
23 Security Council resolution, which called for an immediate
ceasefire in Kosovo and the beginning of political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that there are some positive development on the
ground -- there is no fighting and no humanitarian catastrophe in
Kosovo, and the government has provided refugees with everything
including materials to repair their houses, tools and clothes, and
the government has guaranteed their security," he said, "Life in
Kosovo is nearly normal."
</P>
<P>
However, the ethnic Albanian secessionists and terrorists
advised the refugees and displaced people to stay in the woods
instead of returning home, so that Western media can have some
photos and file some news stories in order to "create an image of
humanitarian catastrophe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move by the ethnic Albanian terrorists, and Western
media has "made the situation much more complicated" in Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Serbia, a main republic of Yugoslavia, on
Monday denounced Western media for having "manipulated their own
public using numerous fabrications and lies about the situation in
Kosovo" in order to help NATO with legal basis for the use of
force against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister, during his participation at the
just-concluded general debate of the 53rd General Assembly
session, extended an invitation to Annan to pay a visit to Kosovo
himself so that the U.N. chief "can get the first-hand information
on what is going on in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Annan, through his spokesman Fred Eckhard, said he was kept
well-informed by such groups as the six-nation Contact Group, the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees, and his special representative
for Children and Armed Conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Even his report was issue, Mr. Annan still has the need to
visit Kosovo himself," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jovanovic, former foreign minister of Yugoslavia,
voiced his appreciation of China's efforts to uphold justice and
the principle of the U.N. Charter at the international community.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Announce Football Shake-up (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 6 (Xinhua) -- UEFA will introduce an expanded
32-team European Champions' League from next season, an increase
of eight teams, Lennart Johansson, president of European soccer's
governing body, said in Lisbon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Johansson also confirmed that the European Cup Winners' Cup,
inaugurated in the 1960/61 season, was to be discontinued after
this season to be merged with an enlarged UEFA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA will invite all our member clubs to participate but we
will not force anyone to be part of our family," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
"A private company wanted to take over the best part of our
club competitions and have appealed to the European Commission to
help them do so but the European Commission can take what
decision it likes.
</P>
<P>
"I am not prepared to sit back and let this happen. We are
perfectly entitled to organize our own competitions and will do
so -- and I am confident our member clubs feel the same way and
will be part of them."
</P>
<P>
In all nearly 200 European clubs would be involved in UEFA's
competitions. Even though the Cup Winners' Cup is being
discontinued after 38 seasons to be merged into an expanded UEFA
Cup, more clubs than ever would have the chance to play in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The plans for the Champions' League have been at the center of
UEFA's deliberations.
</P>
<P>
All of Europe's 48 national champions, plus runners-up,
third-placed teams and fourth-placed teams from the top nations
will be eligible to take part in the competition -- a total of 71
teams.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen teams, plus the previous season's champions, will
automatically qualify for the first-round group stage -- and they
will be joined by 16 survivors from three qualifying rounds
played in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Those 32 teams will then be placed in eight groups of four
teams with the top two in each group advancing to a second round
of 16 -- comprising four groups of four.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams in those groups will advance to the
two-legged quarter-final knockout stage with the winners
advancing through to the final.
</P>
<P>
The two teams who reach the final would have played 17 matches
-- but if they had won through from the three qualifying rounds
they could have played 23 matches in the competition all season.
</P>
<P>
As now, the losers in the qualifying rounds will switch to the
UEFA Cup for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
UEFA have been galvanized into action by the Milan-based
sports marketing group Media Partners, who are planning to
organize a 36-team European Super League with prize money of 1.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They are also proposing a new knock-out competition called the
Pro Cup comprising 96 teams -- and have made a formal complaint
to the European Commission, saying UEFA are abusing their
dominant position by preventing independent bodies organizing and
marketing football competitions in Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johansson hit back on Tuesday. "UEFA will go on to set the
pace in European football and defend the principles of solidarity
and central marketing.
</P>
<P>
"There will be more money available for the clubs in our
competition and under our new proposals nobody will lose anything.
</P>
<P>
"We are in a position to give more to the top associations and
to open the door wider to the smaller associations."
</P>
<P>
Although the UEFA prize money on offer was not confirmed on
Tuesday it is believed to be between 600-800 million Swiss francs
(446-595 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While that sum is lower than the prize money being offered by
Media Partners, it is considerably more than UEFA were offering
before talk of a breakaway Super League began last summer.
</P>
<P>
Guido Tognoni, the project manager of UEFA's European Club
Football 2000 Task Force which has worked out the formats for the
new competitions, said: "UEFA is like a cast-iron banker's
guarantee. I am sure the clubs will now be more confident about
UEFA's proposals.
</P>
<P>
"Who can be sure of what money will really be put on the table
by anybody else?"
</P>
<P>
UEFA executive committee member Dr. Joseph Mifsud of Malta
added: "We are very confident about the future of European
football under UEFA. We know why this has come about but the
expansion of the Champions' League was always inevitable and
would probably have happened in a year, maybe two in any case.
</P>
<P>
"As it is, perhaps this is not just about money but also about
integrity based on sporting criteria and not on an elitist idea p
ut about by others."
</P>
<P>
The details of the two re-styled competitions will be
fine-tuned over the next two months and are expected to be
ratified by the next UEFA committee meeting in Tel Aviv in
December.
</P>
<P>
UEFA's decision comes after pressure from Europe's leading
teams over the last two months to overhaul their club
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Several sides, including English Premiership giants Manchester
United, Arsenal and Liverpool, had been in discussions with Media
Partners International over forming a European Super League.
</P>
<P>
However, the clubs came under pressure from FIFA, who
threatened to suspend any team who signed up for the Super League.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners president Rodolfo Hecht, who on Friday filed a
complaint for restrictive practices against UEFA with the
European Union, said that UEFA's executive committee, who are
meeting this week in Lisbon, should revise their decision and
accept his company's ideas on reforming the major European
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"All the major European clubs have already recognized that the
European Football League (EFL) offers them massively revamped
competitions and matches of the highest level," the Italian said.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners proposals are to replace the three official cup
competitions run by UEFA with a midweek Super League of 36 teams
and a Pro Cup with 96 clubs from 51 countries, starting in
2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
However, Sepp Blatter, President of world football's governing
body FIFA, warned on September 25 that any clubs who sign up for
the proposed privately-backed Super League will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, speaking after a FIFA Executive meeting, stressed
that the world governing body would take a tough line against any
attempt to break up the "family of football".
</P>
<P>
FIFA would ask the club's national football federation to
suspend the team, thereby preventing them from playing in their
national league or any continental cup competition.
</P>
<P>
The tough line was taken in a resolution by FIFA's executive
after a two-day meeting, saying that its principles of solidarity
"are under direct attack by commercial companies with the
agreement of certain prestigious clubs."

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank to Resume Talks on New Loan with Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) decided to give a last chance to
Romania, and start talks on possible new loans at the end of this
month, the Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile said Tuesday when
returning from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Prime Minister was on a visit to Washington to
attend the annual meeting of IMF and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile said the two international financial bodies made
the decision after talks with the Romanian delegation. He added
that he had asked the two financial bodies to support Romania in
the following 3-6 months so the world financial crisis' effects be
by then diminished.
</P>
<P>
According to the Prime Minister, talks with the World Bank for
the ASAL (Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan) program would
start at end-October. Depending on results of negotiations,
Romania would receive as many as 150 million U.S. dollars. The
World Bank would also grant financial support in the field of
social protection to start the implementation of two programs: the
Fund for social protection and that for the closing of certain
mines.
</P>
<P>
A far as the IMF was concerned, Poul Thomsen, head of the new
team of IMF negotiators would come to Bucharest at the end of
October to start talks for the conclusion of a new stand-by loan
arrangement, said Radu Vasil.
</P>
<P>
Both IMF and the World Bank representatives noticed the slow
pace of privatization and restructuring of the banking sector,
said Radu Vasile, adding that the IMF representatives expressed
dissatisfaction that in over 8 years, six stand-by accords settled
with Romania's governments were locked in and, as a result, this
would be "the last effort to granting trust to the Romanian
government". And for this, said the Prime Minister, some new
"political crisis elements or instability" would be but in
Romania's disadvantage, and "Romania will become a country in
stoppage of payments," Radu Vasile ended.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Asks U.S. Ship to Leave Its Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government Tuesday
urged the U.S. to remove "without precondition" a military vessel
it has deployed within the West African country's territorial
waters, a report from Monrovia said.
</P>
<P>
"Liberia will welcome the withdrawal without any precondition
in the spirit of diplomatic interaction for the mutual benefit of
both countries," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The arrival and deployment of the U.S. military vessel in
Liberian territorial waters is in violation of Liberia's
territory integrity and sovereignty," added the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ship with 30 marines on board was deployed after the
18-19 September clashes between supporters of former faction
leader Roosevelt Johnson and government forces, in case it needs
to evacuate its citizens from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson fled into the U.S. embassy to take refugee and was
later flown out of Liberia by a helicopter. He is now reportedly
under protective custody in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
While Johnson was negotiating with embassy officials for
admission, Liberian security forces reportedly opened fire at
people inside the embassy, killing two close aides of Johnson and
injuring two embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
The incident has caused tension between the Liberian and U.S.
governments. For this Washington has closed its embassy and
evacuated some of its staff members and their families.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also demanded a thorough investigation of the
shooting incident and apology from the Liberian government.

his flash visit to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Strained ties between Mideast neighbors Syria and Turkey have
deteriorated in recent weeks with Syria bridling at Turkey's
growing military links with Israel and Turkey threatening Damascus
for allegedly aiding Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made a several-hour visit to Turkey and Syria Tuesday
in his bid to contain the escalating tensions between the Mideast
neighbors from developing into armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In statements to the journalists aboard the same plane that
took him back from Ankara to Damascus, Mubarak said he had offered
a set of proposals for the Turkish side to study.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has offered both Syria and Turkey a purely Egyptian
concept for the settlement of the dispute in order to start a
direct dialog that would lead up to an immediate solution," noted
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"The ideas propose both sides to meet to discuss the problem
which emanates mainly from the destructive activities of the
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he has the impression after his four-hour closed-door
meeting with Demirel that the PKK issue has caught extreme concern
of the Turkish public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"But I have assured Demirel that it is extremely difficult to
our region to bear any more military showdowns especially that the
current atmosphere is electrified and brim with doubts," said
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"I said that the only solution now is to give way for
negotiations and dialog.
</P>
<P>
"I will be in contact with presidents Demirel and Assad after
this shuttle tour when both will have started studying our ideas
which aim to open up the doors of dialog and negotiations," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency, Egypt will brief
Turkey on the outcome of the meeting Mubarak had with Syrian
President Hafez al Assad in which Mubarak spoke of the results of
his talks with the Turkish leader.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing efforts aim at arranging a meeting between the
foreign ministers of Turkey and Syria and opening the road
for the resumption of their joint committee meetings in a bid to
contain the mounting tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although Egyptian officials refused to disclose details of
Mubarak's trip, Turkish newspapers said Mubarak will be carrying
to Ankara a plan on gradual reconciliation between Turkey and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
This plan might lead to holding a series of Turkish-Syrian
ministerial meetings, probably to be followed by a quadrilateral
summit that would include the leaders of Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
according to the Turkish press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's trip to Ankara came between the two rounds of talks
between Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus
Sunday and late Tuesday. Mubarak has called on both sides to
restrain from any provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
Both sides appear to have pulled back from the brink in recent
days with separate announcements they sought diplomat means to
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said on Saturday that
Turkey plans a military exercise along the Syrian border after the
end of current NATO exercises in the area.
</P>
<P>
It also announced plans for fresh naval maneuvers in the
eastern Mediterranean and joint air exercises, which Syria says
directed against itself.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Afghan Issue Cannot be Solved Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami reiterated here on Tuesday that the Afghan crisis could
not be solved through military means.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi,
Khatami said that real peace could be restored in Afghanistan
only when the Afghan people have the capability to decide their
own fate.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that those resorting to force should be pressured
to respect the international norms and laws, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the Taliban occupied the whole Afghanistan and drove
the other groups out of the scene, tranquillity would not return
to Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president underlined the needs for international
organizations, particularly the U.N. and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), as well as neighboring countries to
cooperate to restore peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's military deployment along the border with
Afghanistan, Khatami said that Iran would not accept insecurity
on its borders even though "we believe that war is not the first
choice to solve issue."
</P>
<P>
Iran has deployed more than 200,000 troops along its border
with Afghanistan after eight Iranian diplomats and a reporter were
killed by the Taliban in August.
</P>
<P>
Any country would defend its independence and security on its
borders, Khatami said, adding that the Taliban should respect
international laws and norms.
</P>
<P>
He called on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to put pressures
on the Taliban to return the remaining bodies of Iranian
diplomats killed in Afghanistan, release other Iranians captured
by the Taliban and punish those responsible for the killing of
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who arrived here on Sunday to defuse the tensions
between Iran and Taliban, underlined the need for international
organizations to join hands to solve the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Anyone will not oppose, but support Iran's demand for the
release of Iranian citizens under Taliban's captivity, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Rejects Syrian Defense Minister's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government Tuesday
rejected Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas' recent remarks
that Jordan had prevented Saudi Arabia's army from reaching the
battle field during the October War in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Nasir Judeh told reporters after a
cabinet meeting that Talas' remarks were "strange and untrue,"
adding that "facts are known that Jordan offered all possible
help to the Saudi (Arabian) forces as they passed through Jordan
with a military plane (during the war)."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Judeh expressed the cabinet's rejection to any
accusation against Jordan, especially at a time that the kingdom is
trying to help the region avoid a new catastrophe that might arise
from the current crisis between Syria and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government hopes that such accusation and remarks
will not be repeated, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has strained relations with Syria, who has been blaming
the kingdom for staying too close with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria is now under pressure from Turkey, who earlier manifested
that it is in a state of undeclared war with Syria due to
Damascus' alleged support for the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
Syria on its part contended that a Turkish-Israeli military
alliance is behind the rise of tension between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also enjoys close military and political relations with
Turkey.

to pave the path for peace," Mubarak said in an interview with

JERICO, WEST BANK -- Both Israel and the Palestinians have to
make "hard choices" in order to put the peace process back on
track quickly, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat after almost two hours of talks, Albright

and the previous one held Tuesday morning with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but said these meetings were
"useful."

two sides closer to an agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank, which would pave the way for a four-day Middle East
summit in Washington in mid-October.
