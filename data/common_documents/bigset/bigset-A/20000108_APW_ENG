Bush, McCain Clash at Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second Republican campaign debate. McCain
said it was fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus the U.S. might not have. Bush retorted that his plan was more generous
than McCain's for lower income taxpayers and added firmly: "There is enough
money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to take care of the
basic services of government, and there is enough money to give the people a
substantial tax cut. And that's what I intend to do."

Cubans Rally for Elian's Return
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- Tens of thousands of people from Elian
Gonzalez's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday night to demand his return
from Miami. The rally matched the emotional content of angry demonstrations by
Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely oppose a U.S. government decision to return
Elian to his father's home here. Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami,
has temporary custody of the boy and want to keep him permanently in the United
States. He says he can give Elian a better life off the communist island. The
U.S. government has ruled that Elian and his father should be reunited by next
Friday, Jan. 14.

Mexican Students Reject Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Striking Mexican students rejected university officials'
offer Friday to meet some of their demands to end an eight-month strike that has
shut down the nation's largest public school. The strikers, who seized the
campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico on April 20, said the
offer did not go far enough. The students said they are now demanding the
release of several students arrested after launching bottle rockets at the U.S.
Embassy during a December demonstration. While there are 268,000 students at the
university, the strikers represent a few thousand.

	   BEIJING (AP) -- A 19-year-old dissident in eastern China's Jiangsu province
has been sentenced to three years in prison on subversion charges, a human
rights group reported Saturday. Family members who recently visited Wang were
told he had been refusing food, the fifth time he has staged a hunger strike
since he was arrested last February, the center said. Wang is believed to have
been convicted for writing an open letter to President Jiang Zemin urging the
Communist Party to eradicate rampant corruption, the Information Center said.

Speculation Looms in Shipyard Killings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- A fired shipyard employee gunned down two men in a
deliberate act of revenge that was elaborately plotted, prosecutors alleged in
filing murder charges Friday. Kevin William Cruz, 30, was charged with two
counts of aggravated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder in
the Nov. 3 attack. Cruz was fired from the Northlake Shipyard in January 1999.
Prosecutors believe he harbored a grudge because he was fired soon after the
company's insurance company cut off his benefits for a work-related injury,
saying he wasn't really hurt. Cruz was arrested Tuesday and was being held on $4
million bail.

Rapper Puff Daddy Faces Shooting Lawsuit

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rap star Sean "Puffy" Combs was hit with a $50 million
lawsuit Friday by a man who was shot in a Times Square-area nightclub last week.
Robert Thompson, 38, of Danbury, Conn., alleges he was shot in the right
shoulder by Combs protege Jamal Barrow during a dispute in Club NY on Dec. 27.
Kenneth Nolan, Thompson's lawyer, said Combs was sued because it is unclear
whether the rapper encouraged Barrow to fire and whether Combs had a gun in the
club. Nolan said that if he learns that Combs did nothing illegal, he will amend
the complaint.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives File Petition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, an
anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify
before the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the
country while the courts consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered wildly as Elian -- holding the subpoena in
front of his face while being held aloft by a relative -- appeared outside the
house where he has been staying with relatives. He gave the peace sign before
heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Cuba, Elian's father was angry about Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What right does that man have?'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during a news
conference in his hometown of Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and
immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube at sea after his
mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned while trying to reach Florida
by boat.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was placed with his great-uncle and great-aunt in Miami, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14. The decision touched off protests in the
Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
	   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said Friday's news rejuvenated Elian's
Miami relatives, who have spent much of the last two months dealing with the
international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They feel relaxed,'' Gutierrez said. ``I believe they're going to have a
good night's rest tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, the committee's chairman, said in a release he ``issued a subpoena
to Elian Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the
Florida State court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law named for him
and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that while
the subpoena requires that Elian attend the hearing in Washington, it's highly
unlikely that his actual appearance will be sought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no response to phone messages left with the INS in Washington late
Friday over the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers filed a petition asking that Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that would allow him to seek
asylum for the young boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, meanwhile, tens of thousands of people rallied in a seaside plaza
Friday night to demand his return. ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with
kisses,'' a Cuban country music band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo,
accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington to appeal
directly to Attorney General Janet Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked President
Clinton to reverse the INS order.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and the state
court action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I plan to respond as quickly as possible,'' she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno has said she was consulted on the INS decision and approved of it.
Clinton said Friday the INS did the right thing.	   ``I believe they followed
the law,'' Clinton said. ``This is a volatile and difficult case. ... We need to
keep this out of the political process as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protesters in Miami were much calmer Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Cuban exile community called for more civil disobedience. About
100 protesters marched in front of the federal building in Orlando on Friday
night, waving Cuban and American flags and chanting ``Cuba libre'' and ``long
live the USA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters planned a large demonstration in Little Havana on Saturday and
were planning to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the child is sent back to Cuba without his day in court, all hell is
going to break loose,'' said Jose Basulto, founder of Brothers to the Rescue, an
anti-Castro group.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas, Cuba, was marked by songs, tears and personal
recollections of Elian. It was the most personal and emotional of many held
since early December, when Cuban President Fidel Castro promised mass
mobilization until the boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, his four grandparents and his great-grandmother began
weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage as the group sang of the
boy's mother. Gonzalez looked particularly distraught, his eyes red from crying.
</P>
<P>
	   During the day Friday, Elian played in his relatives' yard with a puppy
named Dolphin, a gift from Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. The black Labrador
chased Elian around the yard and playfully nipped at his blue soccer shorts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian tells me he does not want to go back to Cuba,'' said Delfin
Gonzalez, another of Elian's great-uncles. He said Elian wants his family to
come here.

<HEADLINE> Inserts grafs 8-11 with background on Panama Canal. Edits at  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Friday night
that he would "liberate the (Panama) Canal if I have to" as president to
safeguard American interests. The Republican presidential front-runner and Sen.
John McCain also clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second GOP campaign debate
in as many nights.
<P>
	   "It's fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus that we might not have," McCain said to his rival, standing a few feet
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush retorted that his plan was more generous than McCain's for lower income
taxpayers, and added firmly: "There is enough money to take care of Social
Security. There is enough money to take care of the basic services of
government, and there is enough money to give the people a substantial tax cut.
And that's what I intend to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in a state with substantial military facilities and numerous
military retirees, the GOP contenders also sharply criticized Democratic
presidential contenders for saying they would only appoint officials to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff who would permit gays to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes led the attack, saying he would renew a ban on gays in the
military that was in effect until Bill Clinton won the White House. He
challenged McCain to join him, but the Arizona senator refused. He said he would
stick with the current "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
</P>
<P>
	   They attacked as Vice President Al Gore was backpedaling on comments he had
made earlier in the week, declaring he had not meant "to imply that there should
ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of officers in
the U.S. military."
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP field of hopefuls - Gary Bauer, Steven Forbes and Sen. Orrin Hatch
in addition to Bush, McCain and Keyes - met in a warehouse at a party
fundraising dinner a few weeks before the South Carolina presidential primary.
They were joined by an occasionally raucous dinner crowd that booed at questions
deemed to be impertinent.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate topics ranged broadly, and touched briefly on a controversy
surrounding letters that McCain wrote to federal regulatory agencies on behalf
of political donors. For the second night in a row, McCain, chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, said he was merely trying to prod a sluggish
bureaucracy, and said after the debate that his office would release numerous
pieces of correspondence on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked about the Panama Canal by Bauer, who said he opposed the
recent turnover of the waterway to Panama under a treaty ratified by the Senate
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that as a young congressional candidate at the time, he had
opposed the treaty. If elected president, he said he will uphold the treaty, but
added that he would do "whatever it takes to keep the canal open. ... I'll
liberate the canal if I have to" to maintain Americans trade and other strategic
interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's father, former President George Bush, dispatched troops to Panama
while serving in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain jabbed Bush over taxes as part of a running disagreement between the
two men, and Bush returned fire on the subject of campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, as he had in New Hampshire on Thursday night, that McCain's
proposal would hurt Republicans. Hatch said with his insistence on campaign
finance overhaul, McCain was beginning to remind him of "an accordion player who
only knows one tune."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood his ground, though, and said it was essential to rid the
country of the influence of interests."
</P>
<P>
	   At times, the audience appeared to view the event more as an athletic
contest than a political debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Boos erupted early, in response to a question posed to Bush about the
Confederate flag, which flies atop the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this
flag issue," the Texas governor replied, declining to take sides in a
racially-tinged issue. Moderator Brian Williams sought to pursue the issue, but
the crowd booed louder, and Bush merely repeated that he thought it was an issue
for South Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also said it was an issue for the state's residents to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has campaigned hard in the state, defended anew the letters he
has written to federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors. "Whenever a
constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I believe that
people like me should weigh in," said McCain, who wrote the letters in his
capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator was addressing a question about an Associated Press story
detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with SBC, another phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were the only two asked about the Confederate flag, and the
two men both said it was up to residents of the state to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the contenders tackled another volatile South Carolina issue, a
proposed state-run lottery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he was opposed, adding, "the gambling industry is corrupting our
culture."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes harkened back to the lessons learned in his home state of New Jersey,
saying intending to use a lottery to fund education improvements - as proposed
in South Carolina - is "a false deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was emphatic. "If you solicit my advice I'll tell you this: All
governments everywhere - federal, state, local - should get out of the business
of putting a corrupting, regressive tax on the backs of their people," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush used a post-debate interview with moderator Williams to criticize
commercials the Forbes campaign is preparing in New Hampshire attacking on the
subject of taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it doesn't serve the Republican Party well," he said, and predicted
that the voters would turn against them.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Canadiens 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Milan Hejduk had his fourth two-goal game of the season as
the Colorado Avalanche completed a two-game season sweep of the Montreal
Canadiens with a 4-1 victory Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Montreal goalie Patrick Roy made 22 saves, and Chris Dingman and Adam
Deadmarsh added goals to help Colorado extend its unbeaten streak to a
season-best five games (4-0-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Forsberg had three assists to extend his points streak to seven games.
He has a goal and 12 assists during the streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Weinrich scored for Montreal, 0-4-3 in its last seven games and 0-4-1
overall in Denver. Jeff Hackett, 0-3-2 in his last five starts, made 30 saves
for the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
	   Dingman opened the scoring midway through the first period off a cross-ice
pass from Joe Sakic.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal failed to convert on two power plays and several scoring chances,
the best coming with Greg de Vries serving a high-sticking minor late in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Thornton got a pass from Karl Dykhuis in the slot, but Roy gloved
Thornton's shot from close range.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal tied it on Weinrich's power-play goal with 4:01 left in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Hejduk, who hadn't scored since Dec. 12, put Colorado back in front with
3:27 left, and added his 20th of the season on a two-man power-play with two
seconds remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Deadmarsh completed the scoring at 7:04 of the third period, his fourth goal
in two games.
</P>
<P>
	   Linesman Baron Parker left the game early in the second period because of a
leg injury.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: let welfare families keep more child support money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Child advocates are praising Gov. George Pataki for
his proposal to let welfare families keep more of the child support payments
they are receiving from non-custodial parents.
<P>
	   Included in Pataki's 2000-2001 state budget plan to be presented to the
Legislature on Tuesday will be a provision doubling the limit from $50 to $100 a
month in support payments that families on welfare can receive.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will make his sixth budget proposal to the state Legislature in
Albany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The child advocates said Friday that if any families need the extra money,
it's those on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has always been an issue with us for those lucky enough to be getting
child support that they and their children should see the benefits of that
support," said Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "The
money is supposed to be for the kids."
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of child support that people on welfare can receive is limited so
taxpayers can be reimbursed for the cost of the public benefits their families
are taking in.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Pataki administration reported that about $1 billion in child
support payments were made in New York. Of that, about $190 million was
forwarded to the state so state, county and federal taxpayers could be
reimbursed for the cost of welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward said that for some families on welfare, getting an extra $50 or $75 a
month could even take them off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine McKenna, associate director of another youth advocacy group,
SENSES, said increasing the pass through can be an incentive for the custodial
parent to cooperate in finding the missing parent who owes child care and to
make that missing parent more willing to pay up.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really frustrating if they are socked for $120 or $150 and their child
is only seeing $50," McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other child-related initiatives the governor said would be in his next
budget included:
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing from 159,000 to 178,000 the number of child care slots available
for the children of working poor families.
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing the state's child care block grant from $626 million in the
current fiscal year to $711 million in 2000-01. In addition to providing more
day care, the increase would also expand oversight and monitoring of child care
facilities, improve services for the children of migrant workers and provide for
the fingerprinting of all regulated child care providers, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding the state's "celebrating fatherhood" campaign to encourage males
to voluntarily take part in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding efforts to determine whether parents paying child support have
health care programs which could also cover those children. If the children are
now on welfare, their health care is paid by taxpayers through Medicaid.

<HEADLINE> Another $12 million put toward farm land easements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The highest amount ever - $12 million - will be
funneled this year into a state program designed to keep crucial tracts of
farmland out of developers' hands.
<P>
	   Fifteen communities will get the latest state grants under the Farmland
Protection Program. They bring to $30 million the amount allocated since 1996
under the farm preservation program.
</P>
<P>
	   "By investing now, we're helping to ensure that the heritage of farm
families and the bucolic landscapes of our state will survive well into the next
century," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grants are awarded to town or county farmland protection boards and are
designed to fund up to 75 percent of the projects. Municipalities must
contribute the other 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   No farmland is actually bought as a result of the program. Rather, easements
on the land are purchased which will prevent the property in the future from
being developed. That guarantees that farms will remain farms, even if the land
passes into other hands or is willed to relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers, the selling of easements can provide them with cash that could
allow some of them to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify, farms must be active, ongoing agricultural concerns situated on
scenic, well-tended properties. Ideally, the farms should also be adjacent to
other environmentally sensitive lands or to parcels on which easements have
previously been secured under the Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   New York is making "great strides" in preserving farmland through the
program, said Jerry Cosgrove of the American Farmland Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   "The result is that farmers can pass their farms on to their children and
reinvest in their communities' economic and environmental quality of life,"
Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosgrove's group helps identify the most valuable and vulnerable pieces of
farmland and gives localities and farmers technical help in negotiating the
Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's $12 million in state funding is comprised of $7.5 million from
the 1996 state environmental bond act and $4.5 million from the state's
Environmental Protection Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest projects qualifying under the program, their location, the amount
of land involved and the cost to the state are:
</P>
<P>
	   -Macedon, Wayne County; more than 834 acres; $748,465.
</P>
<P>
	   -Montgomery, Orange County; about 481 acres; $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southampton, Suffolk County; 30.5 acres; $828,965.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southold, Riverhead, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton, all in
Suffolk County; undetermined number out of 47 parcels encompassing 2,469 acres;
$2.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Molinari: McCain on NY primary ballots in 25 CD districts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain says he is hoping the federal
courts will put him on New York's Republican presidential primary ballot across
the state.
<P>
	   The head of the Arizona Republican's New York campaign said Friday that
supporters have qualified GOP primary delegate slates in 25 of the state's 31
congressional districts through the state's cumbersome petition process.
</P>
<P>
	   While that falls short of McCain's goal of getting on the ballot statewide
through petitions, it would allow him to give the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, a contest in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very pleased," Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head of
McCain's New York effort, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that "to have gathered almost 30,000 signatures with very little
resources and without the help of the Republican establishment is simply
astonishing." He also said the fact that he could not get on the ballot
everywhere in the state through petitions, "underscores the unfairness of the
state's Byzantine Republican election laws."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's all-volunteer New York team was working against a midnight Thursday
deadline for mailing petitions to various election boards across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari called the results a major accomplishment given the state's
notoriously difficult ballot access rules and the support for Bush from New York
Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes filed petitions with the state
Board of Elections on Monday they said qualified them for the ballot across the
state. Bush, Forbes and McCain are the only candidates in the state's March 7
GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore, Bill Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche have filed petitions they say
qualify them statewide for the March 7 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections, after considering challenges to any of the
petitions, plans to certify the Democratic and Republican primary ballots Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have his delegate slates
placed on the ballot throughout the state. Molinari said he expects that lawsuit
to be heard later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Molinari said the congressional districts where McCain forces may
not have been able to collect sufficient signatures from party members to get
delegate slates on the primary ballot are in the lower Hudson Valley and across
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They identified the districts as the 18th (represented by Rep. Nita Lowey),
22nd (represented by Rep. John Sweeney), 24th (represented by Rep. John McHugh),
27th (represented by Rep. Thomas Reynolds) and 30th (represented by Rep. Jack
Quinn).
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said it was uncertain if enough signatures had been collected by
the midnight deadline in the 26th Congressional District, which is represented
by Rep. Maurice Hinchey.

<HEADLINE> 17 former utility workers harmed by asbestos settle for $2 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Fourteen retired utility workers and the heirs of
three others stricken with asbestos-related diseases have accepted $2 million to
settle a lawsuit against a group of asbestos companies.
<P>
	   The men, ranging in age from 56 to 75, were exposed to asbestos insulation
products while working at Rochester Gas &AMP; Electric Corp. as far back as the late
1950s, their attorney, Dennis Herron, said Friday. Most of them retired in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the men who sued for damages in 1997 have since died of lung, colon
and throat cancers. Their share of the award goes to their families. The
wrongful death and injury lawsuit had gotten to the first day of jury selection
Thursday before being settled.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the settlement, the identities of the 21 defendants - asbestos
manufacturers, suppliers and distributors - were kept confidential. The utility
was not sued because New York employers are protected from claims under a
workers' compensation law.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were employed at a variety of power stations in the Rochester
region, including the Ginna nuclear plant on Lake Ontario's southern shore.
Power plants use great amounts of insulation for high-pressure steam pipes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government banned the use of asbestos at industrial work places
in 1972. Exposure to asbestos can result in illness anywhere from 10 to 40 years
later, Herron said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The interesting thing with a lot of these 17 guys is they didn't work
directly with these products," he said. "They were doing their job next to a guy
who was replacing asbestos pipe covering ... and were exposed as a bystander."
</P>
<P>
	   All of the men were eventually stricken with illnesses linked to asbestos
exposure, from various cancers and asbestosis, a scarring of the lungs, to
pleural plaques, a thickening of membranes lining the lungs. Effects range from
labored breathing to death.
</P>
<P>
	   It was at least the fourth asbestos lawsuit in Rochester since 1996 that
ended in a payout.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1996, the family of a retired Kodak worker who had recently died
of mesothelioma - the only form of lung cancer directly linked to asbestos
exposure - was awarded $375,000 in a settlement with five asbestos manufacturers
and a distributor.
</P>
<P>
	   In August 1997, nine asbestos manufacturers and distributors paid more than
$500,000 to the widow of a former Eastman Kodak Co. worker who had died five
months earlier of mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, 18 makers and suppliers of asbestos paid $1.25 million to a Kodak
worker and the families of four fellow employees who had died of
asbestos-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a 1982 study by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,
about 27.5 million American workers were exposed to asbestos from 1940 to 1980.
The study estimated that 365,000 people would die from asbestos-related diseases
by the year 2030.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Are estate rights granted before birth?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Two women who had children with a man who died in
an explosion are headed to court to keep another woman's unborn child from any
lawsuit settlement.
<P>
	   A judge will decide the complicated case in Erie County that tackles whether
a fetus has the right to share in the estate of a dead father.
</P>
<P>
	   That man, Keith Bosch, 31, died Dec. 27 from third-degree burns he suffered
in an electrical explosion in Erie County. An attorney said he seeks a civil
suit in the death which could result in a large award or settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectant mother lived with Bosch for two years before his death. On
Thursday, her attorney, Robert Boreanaz, said he will offer court motions to
protect the rights of the fetus. The birth is expected in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   But John F. Maxwell, an attorney representing the mothers of two of Bosch's
other children, is expected to argue that the fetus does not gain rights to an
estate until birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell added that the father must be identified through DNA and blood
testing, which can only happen after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Erie County Surrogate Judge Joseph S. Mattina said the decision may hinge on
Roe vs. Wade in which the Supreme Court ruled that "a fetus is not a person . .
. (and) does not have a legal personality or identity until it sees the light of
day."
</P>
<P>
	   If Mattina follows that ruling, the future well-being of the fetus could be
decided by the guardians and attorneys who represent Bosch's two other children.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell told Mattina that he would be seeking a "substantial claim ... for
the wrongful death" of Bosch.
</P>
<P>
	   The two mothers he is representing are asking the court to appoint Bosch's
father, Roger Bosch, as administrator of his son's estate and themselves as
co-administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   But Boreanaz countered that because the expectant mother had been living
with Bosch for two years prior to his death, she should be named guardian for
the fetus and co-administrator of the estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Tissue and blood samples from Bosch have been preserved for DNA tests.

<HEADLINE> Middle ground found for dying woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Sheila Pouliot is near death, and her family wants
to make sure she doesn't suffer unnecessarily any more.
<P>
	   After a series of court hearings and the intervention of the state attorney
general's office, the severely mentally disabled Pouliot won't. Her family and
University Hospital officials settled their dispute on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Their compromise will let the state provide nutrition while also honoring
the family's wish to avoid intrusive procedures to keep the 42-year-old Pouliot
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not expected to prolong her life," said Martha Mulroy, the lawyer
representing the Pouliot family. "We agreed to maintain her care and comfort and
make sure her pain management is going to be addressed."
</P>
<P>
	   Pouliot has been disabled since she was 9 months old. She's now unable to
move or communicate. Her family cared for her at home until she was 20. For the
past two decades, she resided at a developmental home. Shortly before Christmas,
a gastrointestinal tube that has been her lifeline began to cause internal
bleeding, and Pouliot was sent to University Hospital for medical help.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a move that left Pouliot in the middle of a court battle over her
family's wishes to let her die versus the hospital's attempt to continue
providing her nutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital's position is that providing nutrition is not the same as
providing medical treatment. The family contends that providing her nutrition
amounts to major medical treatment that will only prolong her suffering since
death is imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   Pouliot's family, as well as her doctors, clergy and a lawyer appointed to
represent Pouliot's interests, also contend that to provide her nutritional
needs would require medical intervention that could present serious risks.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep her alive, doctors wanted to establish another feeding line in her
leg. That could result in doctors breaking bones in Pouliot's body because of
the rigid position she's in and the brittleness of those bones, according to
court arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Mulroy went to court Tuesday and obtained an order restraining the hospital
"from providing nutrition of any means or any other life-sustaining treatment"
unless approved in advance in writing by Pouliot's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   In court affidavits, Pouliot's doctors said using a femoral line in her leg
increased the possibility for "prolonged pain, infection, fractured bones and
thrombosis (blood clots). These efforts will not ... improve her state of health
or prolong her life."
</P>
<P>
	   While Assistant Attorney General Winthrop Thurlow agreed to the treatment
compromise, the state also filed a notice of appeal of state Supreme Court
Justice James Tormey's restraining order. Thurlow said that legal step in no way
alters the agreement over Pouliot's treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Thurlow and hospital spokesman Daryl Geddes declined comment on why the
hospital took the action it had.
</P>
<P>
	   Mulroy said the family was satisfied that the focus had remained on Sheila.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's the one we really all do care about," Mulroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a matter of maintaining her dignity through this terminal event.
That's what her family wants. They love her very much."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sunday School Teacher Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A former Sunday school teacher who authorities said bilked
church members, neighbors and others out of $5 million pleaded guilty Friday to
mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Eugene James, who supported a lavish lifestyle while posing as a
commodities trader, faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$200,000 fine at his sentencing in March.
</P>
<P>
	   James, 36, who taught a preschool Sunday school class at the Calvary
Assembly of God in suburban Dunwoody, promised returns of as much as 18 percent
a month on investments he made, according to federal court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   However, James invested less than $200,000, of which he lost about $120,000,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal authorities said there were at least 25 victims in Georgia and
Florida who invested between $300,000 and $500,000 each in two commodity trading
pools that James established.

<HEADLINE> Pataki: let welfare families keep more child support money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Child advocates are praising Gov. George Pataki for
his proposal to let welfare families keep more of the child support payments
they are receiving from non-custodial parents.
<P>
	   Included in Pataki's 2000-2001 state budget plan to be presented to the
Legislature on Tuesday will be a provision doubling the limit from $50 to $100 a
month in support payments that families on welfare can receive.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will make his sixth budget proposal to the state Legislature in
Albany on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The child advocates said Friday that if any families need the extra money,
it's those on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has always been an issue with us for those lucky enough to be getting
child support that they and their children should see the benefits of that
support," said Elie Ward, executive director of Statewide Youth Advocacy. "The
money is supposed to be for the kids."
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of child support that people on welfare can receive is limited so
taxpayers can be reimbursed for the cost of the public benefits their families
are taking in.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, the Pataki administration reported that about $1 billion in child
support payments were made in New York. Of that, about $190 million was
forwarded to the state so state, county and federal taxpayers could be
reimbursed for the cost of welfare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward said that for some families on welfare, getting an extra $50 or $75 a
month could even take them off public assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine McKenna, associate director of another youth advocacy group,
SENSES, said increasing the pass through can be an incentive for the custodial
parent to cooperate in finding the missing parent who owes child care and to
make that missing parent more willing to pay up.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really frustrating if they are socked for $120 or $150 and their child
is only seeing $50," McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other child-related initiatives the governor said would be in his next
budget included:
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing from 159,000 to 178,000 the number of child care slots available
for the children of working poor families.
</P>
<P>
	   -Increasing the state's child care block grant from $626 million in the
current fiscal year to $711 million in 2000-01. In addition to providing more
day care, the increase would also expand oversight and monitoring of child care
facilities, improve services for the children of migrant workers and provide for
the fingerprinting of all regulated child care providers, Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding the state's "celebrating fatherhood" campaign to encourage males
to voluntarily take part in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   -Expanding efforts to determine whether parents paying child support have
health care programs which could also cover those children. If the children are
now on welfare, their health care is paid by taxpayers through Medicaid.

<HEADLINE> Another $12 million put toward farm land easements  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The highest amount ever - $12 million - will be
funneled this year into a state program designed to keep crucial tracts of
farmland out of developers' hands.
<P>
	   Fifteen communities will get the latest state grants under the Farmland
Protection Program. They bring to $30 million the amount allocated since 1996
under the farm preservation program.
</P>
<P>
	   "By investing now, we're helping to ensure that the heritage of farm
families and the bucolic landscapes of our state will survive well into the next
century," Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grants are awarded to town or county farmland protection boards and are
designed to fund up to 75 percent of the projects. Municipalities must
contribute the other 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   No farmland is actually bought as a result of the program. Rather, easements
on the land are purchased which will prevent the property in the future from
being developed. That guarantees that farms will remain farms, even if the land
passes into other hands or is willed to relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   For farmers, the selling of easements can provide them with cash that could
allow some of them to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify, farms must be active, ongoing agricultural concerns situated on
scenic, well-tended properties. Ideally, the farms should also be adjacent to
other environmentally sensitive lands or to parcels on which easements have
previously been secured under the Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   New York is making "great strides" in preserving farmland through the
program, said Jerry Cosgrove of the American Farmland Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   "The result is that farmers can pass their farms on to their children and
reinvest in their communities' economic and environmental quality of life,"
Cosgrove said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cosgrove's group helps identify the most valuable and vulnerable pieces of
farmland and gives localities and farmers technical help in negotiating the
Farmland Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's $12 million in state funding is comprised of $7.5 million from
the 1996 state environmental bond act and $4.5 million from the state's
Environmental Protection Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest projects qualifying under the program, their location, the amount
of land involved and the cost to the state are:
</P>
<P>
	   -Macedon, Wayne County; more than 834 acres; $748,465.
</P>
<P>
	   -Montgomery, Orange County; about 481 acres; $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southampton, Suffolk County; 30.5 acres; $828,965.
</P>
<P>
	   -Southold, Riverhead, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton, all in
Suffolk County; undetermined number out of 47 parcels encompassing 2,469 acres;
$2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   -Elbridge, Onondaga County; 567 acres; $865,000.

<HEADLINE> Molinari: McCain on NY primary ballots in 25 CD districts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Sen. John McCain says he is hoping the federal
courts will put him on New York's Republican presidential primary ballot across
the state.
<P>
	   The head of the Arizona Republican's New York campaign said Friday that
supporters have qualified GOP primary delegate slates in 25 of the state's 31
congressional districts through the state's cumbersome petition process.
</P>
<P>
	   While that falls short of McCain's goal of getting on the ballot statewide
through petitions, it would allow him to give the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, a contest in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel very pleased," Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, head of
McCain's New York effort, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that "to have gathered almost 30,000 signatures with very little
resources and without the help of the Republican establishment is simply
astonishing." He also said the fact that he could not get on the ballot
everywhere in the state through petitions, "underscores the unfairness of the
state's Byzantine Republican election laws."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's all-volunteer New York team was working against a midnight Thursday
deadline for mailing petitions to various election boards across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari called the results a major accomplishment given the state's
notoriously difficult ballot access rules and the support for Bush from New York
Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes filed petitions with the state
Board of Elections on Monday they said qualified them for the ballot across the
state. Bush, Forbes and McCain are the only candidates in the state's March 7
GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore, Bill Bradley and Lyndon LaRouche have filed petitions they say
qualify them statewide for the March 7 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections, after considering challenges to any of the
petitions, plans to certify the Democratic and Republican primary ballots Jan.
31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have his delegate slates
placed on the ballot throughout the state. Molinari said he expects that lawsuit
to be heard later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Molinari said the congressional districts where McCain forces may
not have been able to collect sufficient signatures from party members to get
delegate slates on the primary ballot are in the lower Hudson Valley and across
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
	   They identified the districts as the 18th (represented by Rep. Nita Lowey),
22nd (represented by Rep. John Sweeney), 24th (represented by Rep. John McHugh),
27th (represented by Rep. Thomas Reynolds) and 30th (represented by Rep. Jack
Quinn).
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said it was uncertain if enough signatures had been collected by
the midnight deadline in the 26th Congressional District, which is represented
by Rep. Maurice Hinchey.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Are estate rights granted before birth?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Two women who had children with a man who died in
an explosion are headed to court to keep another woman's unborn child from any
lawsuit settlement.
<P>
	   A judge will decide the complicated case in Erie County that tackles whether
a fetus has the right to share in the estate of a dead father.
</P>
<P>
	   That man, Keith Bosch, 31, died Dec. 27 from third-degree burns he suffered
in an electrical explosion in Erie County. An attorney said he seeks a civil
suit in the death which could result in a large award or settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectant mother lived with Bosch for two years before his death. On
Thursday, her attorney, Robert Boreanaz, said he will offer court motions to
protect the rights of the fetus. The birth is expected in six months.
</P>
<P>
	   But John F. Maxwell, an attorney representing the mothers of two of Bosch's
other children, is expected to argue that the fetus does not gain rights to an
estate until birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell added that the father must be identified through DNA and blood
testing, which can only happen after birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Erie County Surrogate Judge Joseph S. Mattina said the decision may hinge on
Roe vs. Wade in which the Supreme Court ruled that "a fetus is not a person . .
. (and) does not have a legal personality or identity until it sees the light of
day."
</P>
<P>
	   If Mattina follows that ruling, the future well-being of the fetus could be
decided by the guardians and attorneys who represent Bosch's two other children.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell told Mattina that he would be seeking a "substantial claim ... for
the wrongful death" of Bosch.
</P>
<P>
	   The two mothers he is representing are asking the court to appoint Bosch's
father, Roger Bosch, as administrator of his son's estate and themselves as
co-administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   But Boreanaz countered that because the expectant mother had been living
with Bosch for two years prior to his death, she should be named guardian for
the fetus and co-administrator of the estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Tissue and blood samples from Bosch have been preserved for DNA tests.

<HEADLINE> Middle ground found for dying woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Sheila Pouliot is near death, and her family wants
to make sure she doesn't suffer unnecessarily any more.
<P>
	   After a series of court hearings and the intervention of the state attorney
general's office, the severely mentally disabled Pouliot won't. Her family and
University Hospital officials settled their dispute on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Their compromise will let the state provide nutrition while also honoring
the family's wish to avoid intrusive procedures to keep the 42-year-old Pouliot
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not expected to prolong her life," said Martha Mulroy, the lawyer
representing the Pouliot family. "We agreed to maintain her care and comfort and
make sure her pain management is going to be addressed."
</P>
<P>
	   Pouliot has been disabled since she was 9 months old. She's now unable to
move or communicate. Her family cared for her at home until she was 20. For the
past two decades, she resided at a developmental home. Shortly before Christmas,
a gastrointestinal tube that has been her lifeline began to cause internal
bleeding, and Pouliot was sent to University Hospital for medical help.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a move that left Pouliot in the middle of a court battle over her
family's wishes to let her die versus the hospital's attempt to continue
providing her nutrition.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital's position is that providing nutrition is not the same as
providing medical treatment. The family contends that providing her nutrition
amounts to major medical treatment that will only prolong her suffering since
death is imminent.
</P>
<P>
	   Pouliot's family, as well as her doctors, clergy and a lawyer appointed to
represent Pouliot's interests, also contend that to provide her nutritional
needs would require medical intervention that could present serious risks.
</P>
<P>
	   To keep her alive, doctors wanted to establish another feeding line in her
leg. That could result in doctors breaking bones in Pouliot's body because of
the rigid position she's in and the brittleness of those bones, according to
court arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Mulroy went to court Tuesday and obtained an order restraining the hospital
"from providing nutrition of any means or any other life-sustaining treatment"
unless approved in advance in writing by Pouliot's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   In court affidavits, Pouliot's doctors said using a femoral line in her leg
increased the possibility for "prolonged pain, infection, fractured bones and
thrombosis (blood clots). These efforts will not ... improve her state of health
or prolong her life."
</P>
<P>
	   While Assistant Attorney General Winthrop Thurlow agreed to the treatment
compromise, the state also filed a notice of appeal of state Supreme Court
Justice James Tormey's restraining order. Thurlow said that legal step in no way
alters the agreement over Pouliot's treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Thurlow and hospital spokesman Daryl Geddes declined comment on why the
hospital took the action it had.
</P>
<P>
	   Mulroy said the family was satisfied that the focus had remained on Sheila.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's the one we really all do care about," Mulroy said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a matter of maintaining her dignity through this terminal event.
That's what her family wants. They love her very much."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Man Dies at Antarctica Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Canadian man who worked as a contractor for the U.S.
polar program in Antarctica has died of unknown causes, officials of the
National Science Foundation announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   John G. Biesiada, 43, of St. Catharines, Ontario, was pronounced dead about
8 a.m. EST by medical personnel at McMurdo Station, the main U.S. scientific
base in Antarctica, the NSF said in a statement released Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the cause of death was not known. An autopsy is planned.
Biesiada's body was discovered at 1 a.m., Saturday, Antarctica time. McMurdo is
17 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Biesiada was a civilian radar technician working for the Space and Naval
Warfare Center at McMurdo.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said that Biesiada had passed the medical examination required of
all personnel deployed to the South Pole in the U.S. Antarctica program.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. scientific research in Antarctica is coordinated by the NSF which
operates three stations on the south polar continent. The south polar region is
now in the midst of its summer and about 1,200 people are currently working at
the American bases, including about 850 at McMurdo.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 3, Stars 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks hadn't managed a third-period rally all
season. On Friday night, they found out how much fun a comeback victory can be.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Brashear scored the go-ahead goal with 7:03 left as the Canucks
rallied to beat the Dallas Stars 3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks had won only twice in their previous 18 games and were 0-12-0
when trailing after two periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver faced a 1-0 deficit at the start of the third period, but scored
three goals in a 9:46 span.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great win for us," Brashear said. "We've tried to fight through this
in the third period, put some pucks on the net, get some rebounds. We needed
some ugly goals."
</P>
<P>
	   Brashear's shot from the slot qualified as an ugly goal, deflecting off the
skate of Stars defenseman Jamie Pushor and past goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tried to rush the net and was in the right place," Brashear said. "I was
able to get it at the net hard and it deflected off the skate."
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mogilny scored from the right circle 2:04 later.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas held a 1-0 lead after two periods on Kirk Muller's power-play goal in
the first period, but Vancouver tied it with 14:45 left on Todd Bertuzzi's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Garth Snow stopped 31 shots for the Canucks. Snow made a difficult save
against Brendan Morrow with 9:30 left while the Stars were on a power play.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a big lift for us," Snow said. "When we've been behind at the start
of the third period before, we've had some breaks go against us. Tonight things
went right for us."
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars had an 11-2 shots advantage in the second period, but Snow kept it
a one-goal game.
</P>
<P>
	   Muller said his team seemed satisfied with the one goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We tried to win a 1-0 game tonight and you can't do that in this league,"
Muller said. "If you do, you're playing with fire. We should have had a killer
instinct, but instead we tried to sneak out with two points."
</P>
<P>
	   Stars defenseman Brad Lukovich left the game in the first period because of
a mild concussion. Dallas left wing Jere Lehtinen also was sidelined in the
first period by an ankle injury. Both players will be evaluated on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Demands Return of Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- In Cuba's most emotional demonstration since an
international custody battle broke out over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, tens of
thousands of people from the boy's hometown rallied in a seaside plaza Friday
night to demand his return from Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally matched the
emotional content of angry demonstrations by Cuban exiles in Miami who fiercely
oppose a U.S. government decision to return Elian to his father's home here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his four grandparents and his
great-grandmother began weeping as they sat in a row of chairs facing the stage
as the group sang of his mother, who was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from
crying. Telling the crowd of ``hard and difficult days'' suffered since the
child was rescued at sea, Gonzalez said that ``our tears have given way to
patriotic pride'' seeing tens of thousands turn out regularly demand Elian's
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
fishermen found him lashed to an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the
boy and wants to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give
Elian a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez has demanded that his child be returned to him, and the U.S.
government has ruled that the father and child should be reunited by next
Friday, Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally in Cardenas was the most personal and emotional of many held since
early December when President Fidel Castro promised mass mobilization until the
boy was returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The speakers included classmates from Elian's elementary school, his
teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him since
he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly,
two kites sailed high over the rally -- one of them flown by a boy named Julio.
</P>
<P>
	   It was imprinted with Elian's portrait and read, ``Julio claims you,
Eliancito.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, encouraged the crowd
to keep protesting until the boy is back with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot call a truce yet,'' Alarcon said, warning that exiles in Miami
were trying to delay the child's return. ``We cannot let down our guard until
the kidnapping of Elian comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also called for an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that he
blamed for the custody flap. Under the law, any Cuban who reaches American soil
has the right to stay and seek permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The case of Elian Gonzalez is the most repugnant expression of this law,''
said Alarcon, Fidel Castro's top man on American policy issues. ``It is the most
vulgar, the most cruel manipulation of a child ... really child abuse.'

<HEADLINE> Ex-Interior Secretary Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Former Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. was
recovering from surgery Friday following a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan, 71, had a heart attack Thursday night and was rushed to the Heart
Hospital of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They did a procedure on him this morning and he's doing quite well,'' said
Jean Lujan, his wife. She said doctors plan on releasing him early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan has suffered from cardiac problems for several years. He had his first
heart attack in 1983 and underwent a triple bypass. He and his brother, Edward,
spent time in the hospital in 1996 after suffering mild heart attacks just days
apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since then it has flared up a little bit, but this was a little more
serious,'' Mrs. Lujan said. ``Thank God he's resting and came out of his
anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan, a Republican, served 20 years in the U.S. House from New Mexico's 1st
Congressional District. He retired in 1988. President Bush appointed him
interior secretary in 1989, an office he held for four years.
</P>
<P>
	   After retiring, Lujan remarked in an interview that he did not realize how
much his political life had demanded of him.
</P>
<P>
	   However, he has remembered his Cabinet post fondly. He has a framed
photograph of President Bush's first Cabinet meeting and a wooden Interior
Department plaque in his office.

Anti-Castro Lawmaker Subpoenas Cuban Boy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, an
anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before
the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the country
while the courts consider his case. In Cuba, Elian's father was angry about
Burton's subpoena. "What right does that man have?" Juan Miguel Gonzalez said
during a news conference in his hometown of Cardenas. "I am the father of Elian
and immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak for him."

Bush, McCain Clash at Debate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
clashed sharply over tax cuts in the second Republican campaign debate. McCain
said it was fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus the U.S. might not have. Bush retorted that his plan was more generous
than McCain's for lower income taxpayers and added firmly: "There is enough
money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to take care of the
basic services of government, and there is enough money to give the people a
substantial tax cut. And that's what I intend to do."

	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- In a move portrayed as evidence of progress,
President Clinton presented Israel and Syria a "working document" Friday that
could be a pathway to a land-for-peace treaty between the two old foes. In
another measured step forward, Clinton met with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, first together, then
separately. It was the first face-to-face meeting between Barak and al-Sharaa
since Tuesday. "We are moving down the track," State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said before formal talks drew to a close for the Jewish Sabbath and the
Muslim Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

Confederate Flag Supporters Rally

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- With a bell ringing for South Carolina's Confederate
War dead, Confederate flag supporters began a three-day rally Friday at the only
statehouse where the Confederate flag still flies from the dome. The Confederate
flag, with its field of red and star-studded blue cross, is seen as symbol of
hate by some opponents. But groups like those gathering at the rally see it as a
symbol of Southern heritage. South Carolina remains the only state that flies
the flag above its Statehouse, and the NAACP has called a tourism boycott of
South Carolina until the Legislature brings it down.

offer did not go far enough. The students said they are now demanding the
release of several students arrested after launching bottle rockets at the U.S.
Embassy during a December demonstration. While there are 268,000 students at the

<HEADLINE> Russia Shuffles Combat Commanders  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia has replaced its two top combat generals in
its campaign in Chechnya, a reshuffle that suggested government frustration with
the failure to take Grozny and strike a decisive blow against rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The government insisted the changes were a routine staff rotation. The
reshuffle announced Friday came as Russian commanders indicated that a
scaling-back of the bombardment of the shattered capital had been ordered.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian ground forces began a major drive Dec. 25 to take Grozny, but have
made little progress in the face of fierce rebel resistance. Russian commanders
said last month that the city would be taken within days.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel fighters in the city launched counterattacks this week and showed no
sign of giving up. Rebel commanders say they are ready to fight for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian forces, which swept over the northern plains of the breakaway
territory, are also facing touch fighting in the southern mountains, where the
rebels are entrenched in heavily fortified bases.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry said Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev was replaced as commander
of the Eastern front by his deputy, Maj. Gen. Sergei Makarov.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Western front, Maj. Gen. Vladimir Shamanov was sidelined in favor of
Maj. Gen. Alexei Verbitzky. Little was known about the new commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry insisted the rotations were normal practice, but the
moves will be seen as dismissals. Acting President Vladimir Putin, who took over
when Boris Yeltsin resigned Dec. 31, may want to wrap up the war before
presidential elections March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   The personnel changes were ``not the result of any professional error of the
commanders who are just returning to their former positions,'' according to a
military statement read on Russian state television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   NTV, a private television channel, said Shamanov's removal might be linked
to reports that Russian soldiers massacred about 40 Chechen civilians last month
in the village of Alkhan-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Shamanov, who helped formulate the strategy to occupy Chechnya, returned to
his previous post as chief of the 58th Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The general became famous at the start of the campaign in September for his
hard-driving tactics. His soldiers adored Shamanov, who had a reputation of
leading from the front, unlike most other senior commanders.
</P>
<P>
	   Troshev, who will continue in his previous post as commander of the Northern
Caucasus military district, insisted at a press briefing Friday in the southern
Russian city of Mozdok that no errors had been made.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that Russian forces were scaling back their operations in
Grozny, but indicated that fighting was not being called off altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of confusing remarks broadcast on Russian TV channels, Troshev
said Russian forces would ``suspend military activities in all directions''
because of the threat posed to civilians in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said combat operations would continue in areas of the city where
there were no civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To halt does not mean we won't continue, we are conducting the military
activities around the clock in the areas where there are no civilians,'' he said
in the TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
	   The news agency ITAR-Tass reported from Mozdok that Troshev's comments
referred to air and artillery bombardment of the capital. A spokesman for the
Defense Ministry in Moscow said he was not sure what Troshev meant.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no details about how long any pause might last.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian artillery and aircraft have been battering Grozny since September
despite the presence of up to 40,000 civilians hiding in basements in the city.
Russia has announced cease-fires in the past to allow civilians to leave, but
did not halt all combat operations during those lulls.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of fog and snow, federal planes and helicopter gunships flew 43
combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military said Friday. It claimed to
have killed more than 30 rebels.

<HEADLINE> A Glimpse of the Electorate  </HEADLINE>
   By TED ANTHONY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- The signs shouted ``McCain 2000.'' The caps said
``Vietnam vet'' and ``VFW.'' And around the crowded bar where the Arizona
senator's supporters watched him debate his rivals on TV, the sentiment was
pretty much the same: McCain, McCain, McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the midst of this partisan party Thursday night, one quiet corner
table at Libby's Bar &AMP; Grill offered a voter cross-section. Four colleagues from
a county courthouse -- a Democrat, an independent, a lifelong Republican and a
McCain volunteer -- debated the merits of John McCain, the GOP debate and the
entire presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   There was Tim Dempsey, a Republican and McCain backer who wasn't entirely
happy with the candidates' prickliness. ``It was kind of a free-for-all --
one-line zingers. It's become Don Imus politics,'' he said. ``I don't know how
much we all learned tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was Karen Pawlak, a longtime independent who wasn't sure where her
vote would go but came with her friends to the McCain gathering out of curiosity
and liked what she saw of the senator. ``I'm pretty close. Tonight helped,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was Kathy Nikitas, a Democrat-turned-independent who admits she
wouldn't mind seeing Bill Bradley as president but has volunteered for the
McCain campaign. ``There's just something about this person that made me say a
couple of years ago, `That man should be my president,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   And there was Jenny Sheehan, a Democrat through and through, a former
Michael Dukakis staffer who is drawn to McCain and says she would vote for him
over Al Gore, though not over Bill Bradley. ``I love the thought of a
Bradley-McCain race,'' she said. ``That would be thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
	   This seems to happen a lot in New Hampshire, where voters pride themselves
on being independent-minded. Partisan gatherings are peppered with people who
are undecided, leaning or just want to see politics and pageantry firsthand.
</P>
<P>
	   At the next table over, Agnes Waldron, a retired emergency-room clerk, was
still mulling things over. Don't be fooled by the McCain 2000 sign sitting at
her table, she said: ``I'm still thinking.''
</P>
<P>
	   For the quartet from the Rockingham County Courthouse, the thrill was more
in participation than partisanship -- something they consider a hallmark of New
Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It might seem strange that somebody's interested in both Bradley and
McCain,'' said Ms. Nikitas, who is. ``But they're both willing to tell us what
we don't want to hear, no matter what the reaction. And this country needs to
hear things it doesn't want to hear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dempsey, pressed for something he didn't like about McCain, cited the
``Keating Five'' -- the 1991 incident in which he and four other senators faced
allegations they improperly intervened with federal banking regulators to help a
savings-and-loan financier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't pass the smell test,'' said Dempsey, who works in the county
treasurer's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Sheehan, a victims' advocate in the county prosecutor's office, knows
McCain through her brother, who worked for the late Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.
``I don't agree with him on every single issue,'' she said, ``but I think John
McCain is very decent.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly an hour after the debate ended, McCain showed up and wound his way
through the cheers to the courthouse gang's table. They were dazzled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator,'' Ms. Sheehan told him, ``you have a great sense of humor.'' Then
a pause. ``Don't lose it.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain giggled.
</P>
<P>
	   For Ms. Sheehan, lifelong Democrat pondering a GOP vote, the evening was
complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've enjoyed my first Republican event. I've survived,'' she said. Then
she looked skyward. ``But my mother's turning over in her grave.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Orchestra Debuts Hall  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The most passionate fans in Cleveland this weekend won't
be football crazies but classical music enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday night, the world-class Cleveland Orchestra plays for the first
time in its refurbished home, Severance Hall, following a $36.7 million
renovation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to it,'' said Jodith Janes,
a season ticket-holder for about 30 years. ``I expect most of the city of
Cleveland is just as eagerly awaiting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much has changed since work began two years ago on Severance, which is
regarded as one of America's finest concert halls and is on the National
Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
	   An ugly, modernist concert shell has been discarded for an ornate one that
blends seamlessly with the lotus flower decorations throughout the hall. An
organ made unusable by a previous renovation is being reinstalled.
</P>
<P>
	   A new extension to the building has opened up a cramped backstage. All of
the seats in the 2,000-seat hall have been replaced. A full-service restaurant
has been added. So have more women's restrooms, which were almost nonexistent in
the original, 1931 version of Severance.
</P>
<P>
	   The main idea is to give patrons the kind of amenities they have come to
expect from other entertainment venues, from movie theaters to sports arenas
like the newly opened Cleveland Browns Stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   For all that is new, orchestra executives have preserved the look of the old
Severance, right down to matching one-of-a-kind Art Deco light fixtures and rare
Spanish marble in a corridor. And the orchestra has only tinkered with the
Severance's greatest asset: its acoustics.
</P>
<P>
	   Since a renovation in 1958 under the late George Szell, the musical director
who guided the orchestra to international prominence, Severance has had a
distinctive, enveloping sound.
</P>
<P>
	   Judging from a rehearsal for Saturday night's opening concert, which is
being televised locally and sold out despite $300 ticket prices, the Cleveland
Orchestra's fans won't be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're delighted,'' said concertmaster William Preucil. ``The sound's got a
bloom and richness and clarity to it. It's like going home again.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the renovations, the orchestra had to play at a downtown theater.
</P>
<P>
	   In perhaps the most concrete sign of Cleveland's devotion to the group,
orchestra patrons paid for about $25 million of the renovations. The rest came
from a state grant.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist's Exile Spotlights Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dramatic escape into exile of Tibet's last primary
Buddhist leader was the second incident in two days to show the Chinese
government's persistent problems with organized religion.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old Karmapa, leader of one of Tibetan Buddhism's four sects,
arrived Wednesday at Dharmsala, India, to meet the Dalai Lama, Tibet's political
ruler in exile.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Catholics aligned with China's communist regime ordained five
new bishops not recognized by Rome on the very day that Pope John Paul II was
conducting his annual elevation of new bishops from around the world. That
timing was interpreted as a snub that dooms, at least for now, Vatican efforts
to normalize the church situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese regime has also detained thousands of Falun Gong followers since
outlawing the spiritual movement five months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The harrowing flight of the Karmapa across the Himalayas ``reveals the
shambles of China's policy of trying to manage religion,'' says Robert Thurman,
Columbia University professor and friend of the Dalai Lama. ``Their suppression
is not working, and their attempt to pretend to get along with Buddhism doesn't
work, either.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet in
Washington, said the Beijing regime tried to use the Karmapa ``to showcase their
religious freedom policies. It will make it much more embarrassing that he's
been so highly covered by the official media.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thurman said it was essential for the Karmapa to leave so he could receive a
thorough Buddhist education and pass on his tradition, which he said was not
possible under Chinese control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some distinguished teachers still remain behind, but among the leaders of
the major forms of Tibetan Buddhism, all have now felt it necessary to escape in
order to practice their religion,'' said Donald Lopez, professor of Tibetan
studies at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The only major Buddhist figure who remains in Tibet, said Lopez, is the
Panchen Lama designated by the Chinese government. But he ``has absolutely no
status with the Tibetan people'' because the Dalai Lama has recognized a
different youth whose whereabouts are now unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   China and the Vatican have had no formal relations since 1951, when the
Communist Party kicked out missionaries and forced Catholics to sever ties with
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government refuses to accept the pope's authority to appoint and
consecrate bishops worldwide, and has authorized an official Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   By the official church's count, there are 5 million Catholics in China, with
60,000 new members each year. Catholic experts in Hong Kong put the figure at 10
million to 12 million. Many church members, including priests, move between the
official church and an underground church that is loyal to the pope.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas monitoring groups say persecution of underground Catholics persists
in some areas of China, with the detentions of priests and worshippers.

<HEADLINE> Trucks Dominate Detroit Auto Show  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- If there's one message that will be heard loud and clear at
this year's triumphant Detroit auto show, it's this: The car of the future is a
truck.
</P>
<P>
	   From hulking four-door pickups to micro-sport utility vehicles and station
wagons on steroids, trucks will dominate the 2000 North American International
Auto Show just as they dominated the sales charts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet industry watchers point to some warning lights for the industry. Among
them: growing competition and rising fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the large American manufacturers, along with several Asian and
European automakers, will show off new production models and concept vehicles at
the show, which begins with media previews Sunday and opens to the public Jan.
15. The emphasis on trucks is so strong that the hometown gang -- General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler AG -- have no
major passenger car introductions scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies can say they are just giving consumers what they want. SUVs
were the fastest-growing segment in 1999, up 15 percent over the previous year,
according to Morgan &AMP; Co. in West Olive, Mich. Trucks accounted for 58 percent
of the 11.6 million vehicles sold by GM, Ford and Chrysler in 1999 -- and
probably a much larger percentage of their vehicle profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim O'Connor, Ford division president, noted that more than 40 new SUV
models have been introduced since 1991 and that at least 10 more are due out in
the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone wants a piece of this action," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Why the boom in trucks? One reason is that the strong economy and the
booming stock market are enabling people to buy extra vehicles and more
expensive ones.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Cherven, an analyst with the Polk Co., found that trucks and SUVs were
often the second vehicle in a family, and that 61.5 percent of U.S. households
owned more than one vehicle in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Another reason is the increase in households with children. Analyst Michael
Ward with Salomon SmithBarney found that increases in SUV sales in the 1990s ran
parallel to the boom in children under 14.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Detroit auto show, considered the most important event of its kind
in North America, automakers have prepared several new truck and SUV models.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has already shown its Pontiac Aztek SUV and Chevrolet Avalanche truck-SUV
combo; it will also have further details about its deal with AM General, the
maker of the monster Hummer SUV. Chrysler will unveil new versions of its
minivans. Ford will display a new mini-SUV, its entry against models already on
the market from Honda and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota and Honda will show off new SUVs heading for production, while Audi,
Subaru and even Volkswagen will show off SUV and pickup concept vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   While experts say total U.S. vehicle sales in 2000 could decline slightly
from a record 16.9 million in 1999, it could also be the year that automakers
sell more trucks than cars in the United States. They came close in 1999, with
trucks accounted for 48.5 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   But with all the new models entering the market, automakers may have to
reduce the profit margins to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "If history is any indication, companies won't let vehicles sit on their
lots, and price will be the competing mechanism," Cherven said. "There's
certainly some potential benefit to consumers if some of those segments become
overly competitive."
</P>
<P>
	   Rising gasoline prices also could be a threat to truck and SUV sales. Art
Spinella, an industry sales analyst with CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore.,
said GM, Ford and Chrysler could feel a crunch if customers switch back to more
fuel-efficient cars.

	   "It's short-sighted, because effectively what they're doing is giving up the
car market," he said. "They're releasing the car market to the Japanese and
Europeans."
</P>
<P>
	   But many of the newer SUVs are designed to deliver better fuel economy. And
Ward predicted that with the strong economy and stable demographics, truck and
SUV sales will remain strong in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fuel prices certainly are a risk to the SUV market, but we believe that
increasing gas prices would only shift the mix toward minivans -- kids don't
disappear in a recession or when fuel costs are higher," Ward said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Claims Mideast Talks Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With Mideast peace talks on a break, Israeli and
Palestinian delegates are looking over a U.S. ``working document'' given them by
President Clinton as a possible pathway to a land-for-peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations were due to resume tonight at the end of the Jewish Sabbath and
continue on Sunday. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the round of
talks could wind down early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are moving down the track,'' Rubin said before formal talks drew to a
close for the Sabbath and the Muslim Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is difficult stuff. This is very hard stuff,'' Clinton said Friday on
his fourth day of mediating between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa on details of a settlement. The
deal would be based on the proposition that Israel should give up the Golan
Heights to gain Syria's diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president gave the U.S.-drafted
document, about seven pages long, to the two sides during a 45-minute, three-way
working meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This working document provides a summary of the issues to be decided and
the differences between the parties,'' Lockhart said. ``It is designed as a
procedural tool to focus the substantive discussions and to help bridge the
differences that now exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations in this college town 70 miles northwest of Washington had
stalled over procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel insisted that committees on peace terms and border security meet
first, and they did. But Rubin said panels on the timetable of an Israeli
withdrawal on the Golan Heights and on water resources would meet before the
round ends.
</P>
<P>
	   After returning to the White House, Clinton made a series of phone calls to
other world leaders to ``update them on the status of the peace talks in
Shepherdstown and give them a status report, from his perspective, on what
transpired today,'' said national security spokesman David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spoke with French President Jacques Chirac for about 10 minutes,
Leavy said. He then spoke with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for 20
minutes and with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, which Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had directed her
aides to prepare, details both the agreements and disagreements during
negotiations here, in Washington last month and before a breakdown four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's certainly progress to have a document before the parties,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, ``We have limited expectations (of) what can be completed with
one round.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright planned to join al-Sharaa and the rest of the Syrian delegation at
a luncheon today marking the end of Ramadan after attending the Israelis'
traditional dinner Friday evening marking the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli deletation also planned Sabbath services using a Torah borrowed
from a synagogue in Silver Spring, Md.

<HEADLINE> Judge Says No to Hot Cocoa in Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Steaming cocoa is too hot for federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Jimm Hendren refused on Thursday to allow jurors to
handle cups of hot cocoa as evidence in a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer for Ron Austin, who has filed a $1 million lawsuit over spilled
hot chocolate, wanted to perform an in-court demonstration during which jurors
in the lawsuit would be given a cup of 150-degree cocoa.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Charles Fuqua said the demonstration was necessary to show the
temperature of the beverage that burned Austin's foot last year when he spilled
a cup in his van while pulling away from a restaurant's drive-through window.
</P>
<P>
	   Austin, who suffered second-degree burns, claimed the van's transmission was
destroyed when he was unable to use the brake and had to throw the vehicle into
reverse to keep from colliding with oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proposed demonstration is nothing more than a Perry Mason tactic that
has no place in the courtroom,'' argued Roger A. Glasgow, the restaurant's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Fuqua's ``proposed experiment would not even accomplish its stated
purpose unless he proposes pouring the hot chocolate on the jurors or asking
them to insert their fingers into the hot beverage.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Soccer Team Visits U.S.  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Sprinting and passing, dodging and diving, the
Iranian soccer players scrimmaged on the field. Nearby, a huge red billboard
extolled "Bud, King of Beers" -- a potent symbol of the American lifestyle
condemned by Iran's ayatollahs.
</P>
<P>
	   Farshid Asad held a simpler sign, a handmade cardboard placard proclaiming
"Welcome to U.S.A." and featuring green and white Iranian flags. For Asad, the
visit of his nation's team was a reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the first step, I hope," said Asad, a native of Tehran who now owns a
sandwich shop in San Francisco's suburbs. "It's time to forget the past."
</P>
<P>
	   Next weekend, Iran's soccer team will play the nation its leaders have
branded the "Great Satan." It will be the first time the two teams have met on
U.S. soil since relations between their countries turned hateful over the
1979-81 hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   The game follows an exchange of wrestling teams in 1998 and highlights what
appears to be a partial thaw in relations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the latest step in the process of the United States and Iran coming
back together," said John Marks, president of Washington-based Search for Common
Ground, a private group promoting international understanding.
</P>
<P>
	   "The two countries are feeling each other out in a slow way. There are
substantial differences that won't be settled on the soccer field or the
wrestling mat, but these build confidence and make possible other exchanges."
</P>
<P>
	   Iran plays Mexico on Sunday at the Oakland Coliseum, then meets Ecuador on
Wednesday at the Coliseum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 16, the Iranian team plays the United States at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena -- a rematch of the 1998 World Cup game in which Iran defeated the
Americans 2-1 in France.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran's captain, Javad Zarrincheh, at 32 is one of the few members of his
team old enough to remember the hostage crisis, when Washington severed
diplomatic ties with Iran after militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in
1979 and held 52 Americans for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am very happy that, after 21 years, soccer has given me a chance to be
here," Zarrincheh said through a translator. "I am happy sport will be a bond
that will bring people of the world together."
</P>
<P>
	   Although relations remain tense between the countries, things have improved
since the 1997 election of reformist President Mohammad Khatami and his appeal
for "a crack in the wall of mistrust."
</P>
<P>
	   That led to a group of American wrestlers attending a tournament in Iran in
1998, and an Iranian wrestling team visiting the United States. There have been
exchanges of environmentalists, and an American astronaut went to Iran to watch
an eclipse.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 Iranians and Iranian-Americans greeted the visiting team at the
Oakland Airport late Wednesday. A few dozen fans were on hand during practice
Thursday, expressing hope the team's visit will work like the ping-pong
diplomacy of the early 1970s, when sports exchanges helped warm U.S. relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
	   "The goal is soccer. We are happy to play against three strong teams," said
Iranian coach Mansour Pourhaidari. "It is also true that sports brings people
together, and I am happy when this gap narrows."

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major Faces Court-Martial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Air Force major faces a court-martial for refusing to
take the anthrax vaccine, contending it could jeopardize his health.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates, a pilot stationed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, is
believed to be the highest-ranking military officer accused of refusing to
follow a direct order to take the shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department has ordered that the anthrax vaccine to be
administered to all 2.4 million active duty and reserve troops as protection
against biological warfare. About 380,000 service members have started the
six-shot regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 military personnel have refused to take the vaccine because
they fear its safety, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates could have accepted a so-called Article 15, a nonjudicial punishment
provided under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But he said that would not
solve his problem because his commander would simply order him again to take the
shots, restarting the disciplinary process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm facing a court-martial,'' Bates said in a telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   His military lawyer, Capt. Bill Burke, said a court-martial was the standard
next step in such cases. In refusing the Article 15 on Friday, Bates' only other
option was to demand a court-martial even though he has offered since November
to resign his commission.
</P>
<P>
	   If Bates is convicted after a court-martial, he could be sentenced to up as
much as five years' imprisonment depending on the exact wording of the charge,
Burke said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After 13 years of exemplary service to my country, I am willing to give up
my job, my rank and everything I have worked for to avoid taking an unsafe
drug,'' Bates said in a letter to the Air Force explaining his decision. ``I can
only conclude the vaccine poses an undue risk.''
</P>
<P>
	   In testifying before a congressional committee in October, Bates said he
became concerned about taking the shot after he found a dozen people in his
squadron had ``unusual or disabling illnesses that did not exist prior to the
anthrax vaccine and the causes are unknown.''
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions included autoimmune disorders, crippling bone or joint pain,
memory loss, inability to concentrate, thyroid damage, liver damage and cysts
around the heart, he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates regards the shots as experimental and said a soldier's consent should
be required for the vaccine. He said he cannot afford to get sick because he
must provide financially for his wife and three children, including an autistic
son.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, a public affairs officer at Dover, said the Air Force
could not comment on Bates' case specifically. But he did confirm Bates declined
the Article 15 punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform Committee,
wrote to Defense Secretary William Cohen on Dec. 28 saying it appeared the Air
Force was retaliating against Bates for testifying to his panel. After
testifying, Bates was told to take the vaccine sooner than other personnel,
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The congressman has asked Cohen to allow Bates to resign. Cohen told Burton
he would look into the allegation of retaliation.

<HEADLINE> Fed Surpluses Could Grow Larger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House and congressional budget analysts are ready to
project federal surpluses for the coming decade that may be $800 billion bigger
than last year's $3 trillion estimate, officials of both parties say.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to huge piles of unanticipated federal revenue the red-hot economy is
producing, analysts say coming official projections will at least equal the
earlier $3 trillion estimate. Even that would be impressive, considering last
year's spending binge by lawmakers that ate well into the surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   But depending on what assumptions are made about spending, the new estimates
-- one by the Congressional Budget Office, the other by the White House Office
of Management and Budget -- could surpass last year's by perhaps $800 billion,
said Democratic and Republican legislative aides who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Either way, the stage is set for an election-year showdown over whether the
huge kitty should be used for tax cuts, spending or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The projections are likely going to show there is some real money in our
fiscal future, about which the presidential candidates can have a legitimate
debate,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former CBO director who is now a senior
fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO and White House officials declined to discuss their numbers. CBO will
release its new projections later this month and the White House on Feb. 7, when
President Clinton presents his budget for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The new estimates will cover the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. Last year's
projections were for the 10 years beginning with 2000, which runs through next
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short run, analysts say the estimates will show a budget surplus,
excluding Social Security, of perhaps $10 billion to $20 billion for this year,
and perhaps up to $60 billion for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Those numbers are important because they would let Republicans claim they
honored last year's promise not to use Social Security money to pay for other
programs. That pledge -- which President Clinton also embraced -- seemed in
jeopardy when lawmakers approved tens of billions in extra spending, threatening
to eat into Social Security's surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A surging economy is bailing out Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress,
... outpacing even Congress' and Clinton's spending inclinations,'' said Stephen
Moore, fiscal policy director for the libertarian Cato Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures also mean there would be plenty of resources for the tax cuts
Republicans want and the extra spending Democrats prefer for fiscal 2001.
Congress will begin working on tax and spending legislation for 2001 when it
returns to work Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   With both parties trying to create distinctions between themselves that
voters will remember on Election Day, bipartisan agreement on major tax or
spending issues seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the projected surpluses should be so big that some of the money
could be used for tax cuts or new spending for Medicare, defense and other
programs and leave huge sums that can be apportioned later. In the meantime, any
unused surplus money automatically would reduce the $5.8 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $3 trillion surplus projected last year, $2 trillion was to come from
Social Security. Both parties consider that money politically untouchable for
spending for other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $1 trillion in black ink was to come from the rest of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The size of the projected surplus is growing chiefly because, for yet
another year, the unexpectedly strong economy is producing more federal revenue
than anticipated. In addition, spending for programs, including Medicare, has
been less than expected.

<HEADLINE> Energy Department Files Nuclear Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some lawmakers say they're concerned that an Energy
Department reorganization plan that creates a new nuclear weapons agency does
not go far enough to insulate the agency from the rest of the department's
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson sent the plan to Congress on Friday and
pledged to complete the reorganization by March.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to alleged Chinese espionage and lax security at nuclear weapons
labs, Congress last year directed that all nuclear weapons programs at DOE be
consolidated under a semiautonomous National Nuclear Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are committed to implementing the (new agency) and ensuring that the
national security mission of the department is met,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But two House members said the planned reorganization contradicts the law's
demand for semiautonomy for the new agency because it has a number of senior
officials serving dual roles within the agency and in the parent department.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, a leading sponsor of the legislation creating
the new agency, accused Richardson of ``attempting to shoehorn'' the DOE
bureaucracy into the new agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is clearly resisting one of the most fundamental elements
of the reform plan'' to establish a nuclear weapons program ``distinct and
separate from the Energy Department,'' Thornberry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., whose district includes the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, also said the reorganization ``contradicts the
law by giving some employees dual responsibilities in the (agency) and the
department.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson's planned reorganization requires that agency positions
responsible for security, counterintelligence, legal affairs and environmental
and health protection be held by officials who have those same responsibilities
within the overall department.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of the reorganization law, including Richardson, are concerned that
the agency would become a powerful fiefdom unaccountable to the rest of the
department. Richardson also has criticized the idea of having separate security
and counterintelligence officials within the agency and DOE.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., a Richardson ally, said the reorganization eases
those concerns and still ``complies with the letter and spirit of the law''
creating the agency. He said it also ``protects public health and safety and
protects the important national programs and resources of the (weapons)
laboratories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bingaman and others also had been concerned that civilian research at the
Los Alamos and Sandia labs in New Mexico, as well as at Lawrence Livermore,
might be jeopardized once the facilities were absorbed within the new agency.
But the reorganization stipulates that the labs be allowed to continue to
perform scientific research for non-defense programs.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Debate Again  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The latest in a series of Republican
presidential debates had a distinctly Southern flavor, with the candidates
haggling over the Confederate battle flag, the value of state lotteries and the
propriety of gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   At times, the audience of 3,000 appeared to view Friday's event more as an
athletic contest than a political debate. It gathered in a former warehouse for
chicken and pecan pie at the state GOP's annual ``Silver Elephant Banquet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boos erupted early, in response to a question posed to the front-runner,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, about the Confederate flag. It flies atop the nearby
Statehouse, even though some in South Carolina -- especially blacks -- consider
it a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe the people of South Carolina can figure out what to do with this
flag issue,'' Bush replied to a chorus of cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   When moderator Brian Williams of MSNBC sought to pursue the issue, the crowd
booed louder, and Bush merely repeated that he thought it was an issue for South
Carolinians to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain of Arizona also said it was an issue for the state's
residents to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina, which holds its primary Feb. 19, is critical to McCain's
election strategy. He decided to skip the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 so he could
focus on the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator hopes a victory there can be followed with a strong showing
here, a state with a large military presence that should be hospitable to the
former Vietnam prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
	   With those stakes, McCain again defended the letters he has written to
federal agencies on behalf of campaign donors. The issue also came up in the
group's debate on Thursday in New Hampshire, and was likely to resurface on
Monday when the candidates reassemble in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Also participating in the debates are conservative activist Gary Bauer,
publisher Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and radio talk show host Alan
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whenever a constituent of mine or a citizen ... can't get an answer ... I
believe that people like me should weigh in,'' said McCain, who wrote the
letters in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator was addressing a question about an Associated Press story
detailing a letter he wrote last year on behalf of Ameritech, which was seeking
permission to merge with another telephone company, SBC.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter-writing issue is a troubling one for McCain, whose candidacy has
flourished on the basis of his call for a ridding the nation's political system
of the influence of big-monied special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing in a state with substantial military facilities and numerous
military retirees, the GOP contenders also sharply criticized Democratic
presidential candidates for saying they would only appoint to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff officers who would permit gays to serve openly in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes led the attack, saying he would renew a ban on gays in the military
that was in effect until Bill Clinton won the White House. He challenged McCain
to join him, but the senator refused. He said he would stick with the current
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
	   They attacked as Vice President Al Gore was backpedaling on comments he had
made earlier in the week, declaring he had not meant ``to imply that there
should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of
officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was asked about the Panama Canal by Bauer, who said he opposed the
recent turnover of the waterway to Panama under a treaty ratified by the Senate
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that as a young congressional candidate at the time, he had
opposed the treaty. If elected president, he said he will uphold the treaty, but
added that he would do ``whatever it takes to keep the canal open. ... I'll
liberate the canal if I have to'' to maintain Americans' trade and other
strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's father, former President George Bush, dispatched troops to Panama
while in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain jabbed Bush over taxes as part of a running disagreement between the
two men, and Bush returned fire on the subject of campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, as he had in New Hampshire on Thursday night, that McCain's
proposal would hurt Republicans. Hatch said with his insistence on campaign
finance overhaul, McCain was beginning to remind him of ``an accordion player
who only knows one tune.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood his ground and said it was essential to rid the country of the
influence of special interests.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the contenders tackled another volatile South Carolina issue, a
proposed state-run lottery.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer said he was opposed, adding, ``the gambling industry is corrupting our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes harkened back to the lessons learned in his home state of New Jersey,
saying that intending to use a lottery to fund education improvements -- as
proposed in South Carolina -- is ``a false deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes was emphatic. ``If you solicit my advice I'll tell you this: All
governments everywhere -- federal, state, local -- should get out of the
business of putting a corrupting, regressive tax on the backs of their people,''
he said.

<P>
	   FORBES: Quotas and set asides are wrong, and that's why we genuinely need
real affirmation of opportunities starting by letting parents choose their own
schools for their own children.
</P>
<P>
	   HATCH: When affirmative action means job training outreach and education
it's good. When it starts pitting one group against another throw a system of
preferences, it's bad. And I've got to tell you quotas are wrong for America,
and I agree: Equal opportunity is what we should have for everybody.
</P>
<P>
	   KEYES: I think it maybe more important to ask whether it's helped the people
it was supposed to help. And I think it has actually hurt them by damaging the
reputation of many minorities in this country and not giving them credit for
their real achievements, and I think that's wrong.

	   Bush was asked by Bauer about the recent turnover of the Panama Canal back
to Panamanian control:
</P>
<P>
	   BAUER: Are you willing to take the steps necessary including putting our
military back in Panama in order to stop the Chinese from taking over influence
there?
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: Our country has signed a treaty; I believe we ought to honor the
treaty. But when I'm the president, if I find in any way, shape or form the
canal is closed to world interests, I will do whatever it takes to keep the
canal open.
</P>
<P>
	   It is in our national strategic interest to have a peaceful hemisphere. It
is in our national strategic interest to have a hemisphere in which trade can
flow freely. And I will liberate the canal if I have to.

<P>
	   McCain was asked, for the second night in a row, about his role overseeing
the FCC, which makes important decisions regarding some of his key campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Q: Senator, I'm reading from the Associated Press ... ``two weeks after
Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him, Senator John McCain sent a
stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of being unfair toward the
phone company.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senator, your letter went on to say that the letter was not meant to benefit
any one single person.
</P>
<P>
	   And you have said in your own defense that this is part of what is wrong
with Washington. However, do you understand now the appearance here and can you
tell us here tonight is there anything else about the transportation you use,
about the letters you have written, anything else that you know of that is about
to come out?
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN: I have, first of all, no idea. But the fact is that again my job as
chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation is the
oversight of bureaucracies that are supposed to be serving the people. The
Federal Communications Commission has not been doing that. But all the times
when I have weighed in I have asked them to do their duty and to expedite the
procedures as they're laid out under the law and according to existing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   I will continue to do that job, and when a constituent, a person of mine who
has trouble -- or a citizen of this country who can't get a reaction or an
answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with their tax dollars -- I believe
that people like me should weigh in, particularly when it is my responsibility
as chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was given the chance to ask Gov. Bush about the differences between
their two proposed tax cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   MCCAIN: Well, governor, I know your people are running around saying that
your tax cut is bigger than mine. I think the phrase they used was the tax gap
between Bush and McCain. I'm more concerned about the surplus gap. It's fiscally
irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a surplus that we may
not have. My tax plan is fiscally conservative. It's about the same as yours for
middle-income and lower income Americans. It places a top priority on saving
Social Security. It offers a needed tax break for middle income people and it
begins paying down the national debt. My friends, we ought to pay down the
national debt. George, the American people are tired of people who make
promises, who make promises about tax cuts that they can't keep.
</P>
<P>
	   BUSH: The senator and I have a fundamental disagreement. Let me see if I can
put it in human terms for you.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris and Beth Bradley came to the airport today. They make $42,000 a year
in income. Under the plan that you laid out, Mr. Senator, here in South
Carolina, they will receive a $200 tax cut. Under the plan that I propose and
will get through the United States Congress, they receive a $1,852 tax cut. The
fundamental difference is that the additional $1,600 -- the difference will go
to Washington under your idea, and under my idea it goes into people's pockets.
There is enough money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to
meet the basic needs of our government. And there is enough money to give the
American people a substantial tax cut and that's exactly what I'm going to do.

<HEADLINE> New York a magnet for out-of-staters with high political hopes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York has long been a lure for immigrants. It is
also still a magnet for out-of-staters who have their eye on elected office.
<P>
	   On the same day that Hillary Rodham Clinton moved into her new Westchester
County home to set down New York roots to run for the U.S. Senate, former
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld unpacked his bags in Manhattan with thoughts of
a possible run for the New York statehouse in 2006.
</P>
<P>
	   Now there's talk that Sen. Bob Kerrey, often mentioned as a Democratic
presidential contender, might accept a job as head of Manhattan's New School
University. That means that if the Nebraska Democrat and former Navy SEAL did
someday mount another run for the White House it could be from the Empire State.
</P>
<P>
	   What's going on?
</P>
<P>
	   "We always lay out the welcome mat in New York. The more the merrier," said
Maurice Carroll, a pollster with Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, which
does some carpetbagging of its own. Despite being based in Hamden, Conn., many
of its polls are on the hot political races in neighboring New York.
</P>
<P>
	   New York does, after all, have a rich heritage of electing outsiders.
</P>
<P>
	   The most noteworthy example is Robert F. Kennedy. Despite the Kennedy name
being virtually synonymous with Massachusetts, he ran for and won a Senate seat
in New York in 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York has a reputation as enough of a cosmopolitan place that you don't
have to have spend your whole life here to develop the political credentials to
win office," said Michael Knox Beran, who wrote "The Last Patrician: Bobby
Kennedy and the End of American Aristocracy."
</P>
<P>
	   More proof was that after Kennedy, James Buckley, of Connecticut,
represented New York in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   One of New York's first senators, Rufus King, hailed from Massachusetts and
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the man Mrs. Clinton wants to replace, grew up in
New York City's Hell's Kitchen but also spent significant time in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The trail from Boston to New York has also been famously traveled by
baseball greats Babe Ruth, Wade Boggs and Roger Clemens, noted Marist College
pollster Lee Miringoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "That raises the key question for Weld of course," Miringoff joked. "Is he a
Yankee or a Red Sox fan? The answer to that question will determine his
acceptability."
</P>
<P>
	   Weld is not known as a particularly avid baseball fan, preferring to play
squash a few times a week.
</P>
<P>
	   But for a primer on the politics of baseball, just ask Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   She invited a firestorm of skepticism when she tugged on a Yankees cap at
the White House earlier this year and declared she had always been a fan of the
Bronx Bombers. Mrs. Clinton, who rooted for the Chicago Cubs during her
childhood in Illinois, later had to explain that the Cubs had been her National
League favorite while she had adopted the Yankees as her American League team.
</P>
<P>
	   That explanation left some diehard Yankees fans, like her most likely Senate
race rival New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
	   Weld did not return a phone call seeking comment Friday. But in an earlier
interview the moderate Republican said he'd be "hard to stop" if he did decide
to add the title New York governor to his resume. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who has
never lived or worked in New York, Weld grew up on Long Island and has a
vacation home in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
	   To satisfy New York's residency requirements, Weld must live in New York for
five years before running for governor. For now he's busy buying and selling
companies as a managing partner at McDermott, Will &AMP; Emery's New York office.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton must only be living in New York by election day to run for the
Senate to satisfy residency requirements. She moved into her Chappaqua home this
week to deflect carpetbagging charges.

<HEADLINE> ABC Announces Agreement With NAACP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK -- (AP) -- ABC has become the second major network to reach a deal
with the NAACP to promote diversity in its ranks, agreeing among other things to
tie executive bonuses to success in employing minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, NBC announced its own agreement, removing the threat of
a boycott the NAACP began considering last summer when it drew attention to the
lack of minority actors on new fall shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC's deal similarly concentrates more on changing the behind-the-scenes
operations of the network in the hope that it eventually makes a difference in
what goes on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is just one step on a long road toward creating a diverse environment,"
ABC President Patricia Fili-Krushel said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC has agreed to assign high-level mentors to minority employees, set up a
diversity training program and consider a producer's diversity record when
deciding who will run its programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The "statement of understanding" with the NAACP also sets up a series of
meetings between ABC executives in charge of personnel and representatives of
the civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the agreement makes it clear that increased opportunities for
people of color is a priority at ABC," said Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said he expects to reach agreements with CBS and Fox within the next
week or so. The agreement with CBS will address the number of minorities
onscreen more than the other deals have, Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the NAACP's deal with NBC has angered a coalition of Hispanic,
Asian-American and Indian groups that had thought they were all working
together. They have since set up their own meeting with NBC President Bob
Wright.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume "agreed to join this coalition, and before we knew it he holds a press
conference announcing this deal. Not good," Esteban Torres, the coalition's
Hispanic representative and a former congressman, told the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said he always made it clear to NBC that he was representing more than
just his own organization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've never seen this as a black-white situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan's ears burn as Ventura meets with Trump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan had the
feeling he was being talked about.
<P>
	   As billionaire Donald Trump and Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura met Friday to
mull a possible Trump run for the Reform Party nomination, Buchanan joked about
what they might discuss.
</P>
<P>
	   "My guess is my name will come up in the conversation," he said. Ventura,
the Reform Party's highest-ranking elected official, has criticized Buchanan and
said Friday he would consider supporting Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's certainly not leaning toward me," Buchanan said of Ventura. "But the
truth is if you're going to beat Pat Buchanan, you've got to get in the race.
You've got to get down on the field, you can't just make comments from the box
office. And thus far no one has gotten into this race to challenge us for the
Reform Party nomination."
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan also threatened Friday to go to the Federal Election Commission to
protest new rules that could keep him - or any other third-party candidate - out
of televised debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a conspiracy designed to perpetuate monopoly control of the
presidency and the White House by the two dominant national parties," he said of
rules announced Thursday by a special debate commission. "We're going to fight
this in court and we're going to fight it in the court of public opinion, and I
can tell you right now we're going to win it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan group set up in 1987
as an impartial sponsor of the nationally televised debates, said they would be
limited to candidates showing at least 15 percent support in national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   That could leave Buchanan off the screen.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is about giving the American people a third choice other than these
two Xerox copies we get every four years," he said after meeting with leaders of
New York's Conservative Party at a restaurant on Manhattan's East Side.
</P>
<P>
	   He introduced Putnam County real estate developer Edward Heelan as his New
York campaign chairman. Heelan said the campaign had submitted papers to appear
on primary ballots in 29 of New York's 31 congressional districts. The filing
deadline for the March 7 primary was midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, who bolted the GOP to mount a campaign for the Reform Party
nomination, said he hoped to be on New York's Conservative, Right to Life and
Independence lines in the general election. The Independence Party is New York's
affiliate of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I can win those nominations, I think the Republican candidate, who I
expect to be Mr. Bush, will fold his tent and write off New York," Buchanan
declared. "It will be a Buchanan-Gore race for the state of New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the tiny but influential Conservative Party have also met with
Republican hopefuls Steve Forbes and Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Buchanan said
his meeting was cordial, but that the party leaders plan to wait until September
to decide whom to support.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan also offered some thoughts on New York's Senate race, expected to
pit first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "There could be a third party candidate running, Right to Life and Reform
and Conservative as well," he said. "Do not rule out the possibility of a
three-way race for the U.S. Senate from New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan declined to say whom the third-party candidate might be.

<HEADLINE> Bush Stands by Tax Pledge  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush's pledge in a debate this week that he
would not raise taxes has reignited claims that he has broken such campaign
pledges before in Texas. The leader of a tax watchdog group said in a campaign
ad that the governor's performance on the question of taxes ``is a record of
broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rival Steve Forbes accused Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner,
on Friday of breaking a no-new-taxes pledge. Bush denied it and said his record
of cutting Texas taxes by about $3 billion speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm saying I cut the taxes. The implication is I tried to raise taxes. I
cut taxes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the controversy -- and a new television commercial being
aired by Forbes -- is a 1994 written statement given to the Houston-based group
Taxpayers for Accountability during Bush's first race for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   That statement, bearing what appears to be Bush's signature, said: ``I,
George W. Bush, candidate for the position of governor, pledge to oppose any
legislation establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales
tax.'' Campaign officials have said they don't know where the signature came
from, although they believe it was produced by an automated pen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't determine the exact circumstances'' under which Bush responded to
the 1994 pledge request, Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say Bush in 1997 did propose some tax increases to the Texas
legislature to help fund a $3 billion property tax rollback.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush proposed half-cent hikes in the 6 1/4 percent state sales tax and motor
vehicle sales tax; implementing a new business tax that would have extended
business levies to sole proprietorships and partnerships for the first time; and
spending $1 billion of a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan failed, never even receiving a vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, legislators approved a $1 billion cut, using the surplus. In 1999,
Bush won passage of another tax cut bill -- including about $1.35 billion in
property tax reductions, $277 million in consumer tax cuts and $229 million in
business tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you go back and look at the history of the tax package, it was a tax
cut on day one and it was a tax cut on the day I signed it,'' Bush said Friday
of his 1997 plan.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the Forbes ad, the head of Taxpayers for Accountability, Mary C.
Williams of Houston, sees it differently, saying: ``His record as far as taxes
are concerned is a record of broken promises.''
</P>
<P>
	   That no-tax pledge also sparked controversy during Bush's 1998 re-election
campaign. At that time, Bush's chief spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, told the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram that the governor didn't sign the document.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a copy of his signature. It is either a tracing or an auto-pen of his
signature,'' Ms. Hughes said then.
</P>
<P>
	   But she acknowledged that Bush's campaign returned the pledge to Ms.
Williams. She said whoever in the campaign office returned the questionnaire
didn't follow Bush's policy of not signing pledges.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Hughes also told the Star-Telegram that a separate letter that
accompanied the pledge -- saying almost the same thing and bearing Bush's
signature -- wasn't signed by him, either, although he authorized its content.
</P>
<P>
	   In a phone interview from Houston on Friday, Ms. Williams said Bush -- then
making his first run for governor -- was asked to sign a blanket no-tax pledge
issued by her taxpayers' group. Instead, she says, Bush returned to her a
modified written statement, which is posted on the group's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I accepted it but didn't like it. You can read it and judge it for
yourself,'' she said. ``He's trying to claim he didn't sign the pledge, but he
did.''
</P>
<P>
	   Setting the pledge controvery aside, critics say many Texas taxpayers never
saw extra cash because the property tax cuts were eaten up by rising property
values and higher local school tax rates. Bush has said a provision raising the
homestead exemption from $5,000 to $15,000 was genuine relief, particularly for
owners of moderately priced homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Hailey, spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, said Bush not only
broke his 1994 no-tax pledge, but the Republican's tax-cutting ideas ignored the
state's huge number of renters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He proposed a tax increase for half the people of Texas,'' Hailey said.
``The people who rent wouldn't have received a dime's worth of tax breaks, yet
Governor Bush proposed they pay a higher sales tax, a higher motor vehicle sales
tax and a new business tax that would have caused prices to go up for products
and services.''

<HEADLINE> County Gets Custody of Disabled Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- A judge has awarded Chester County custody of a
severely disabled boy whose parents left him at a hospital the day after
Christmas with a note saying they could no longer care for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be developing a treatment plan in the best interests of the child,
like all children we deal with,'' said James Forsyth, executive director of the
county's Department of Children, Youth &AMP; Families.
</P>
<P>

and conspiracy after they were accused of leaving their 10-year-old son Steven
in the emergency room of the A.I. du Pont Hospital for Children in Rockland,
Del., on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been at the hospital ever since.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials could not say Friday when the boy would leave the hospital to

	   On Wednesday, the Kelsos filed a petition asking a judge for permission to
visit him. There was no indication of when they would get an answer.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members have said the couple had been caring for their son in 10-hour
shifts after they were unable to find nursing help during the Christmas
holidays.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven, who was born three months premature and was hospitalized for the
first 18 months of his life, cannot walk or talk, suffers from frequent seizures

<HEADLINE> McCain Letters Spark Questions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From airlines to telephone companies, Sen. John McCain
wrote to federal regulators on behalf of more than a dozen contributors over the
last three years, according to hundreds of documents that were to be made public
today.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee, weighed in on
behalf of BellSouth, trying to offer long-distance service; Ameritech, trying to
merge with SBC Communications; America West airlines, trying to offer airline
service out of Flagstaff Airport; and other corporate givers.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were provided to The Associated Press by the Senate Commerce
Committee on Friday. Besides the memos written on behalf of donors, there were
hundreds of letters written in response to individuals, including more than 20
letters referred to the Transportation Department from travel agents upset about
airlines capping their commissions.
</P>
<P>
	   And the memos show that McCain intervened just as forcefully on behalf of
companies that did not give to his campaign. For example, in a July 1999 letter
to Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard, McCain complained
about the delay in transferring a broadcast license for a Texas radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is hardly alone in his letter writing. The FCC said this week it had
received between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces of correspondence a year from lawmakers
in the past three years about issues pending before the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said the senator would ask all federal agencies on Monday to release
the letters he had sent them over the last three years. And the senator
challenged his competitors for the Republican presidential nomination to release
letters they had sent on behalf of campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's letters came to light at a pivotal time. The Arizona senator has
risen in the polls while campaigning to rid the nation's political system of
what he calls the ``pernicious'' influence of money.
</P>
<P>
	   That campaign theme has struck a chord among independents, and has helped
vault McCain into a highly competitive race with Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
New Hampshire, the nation's first primary state.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent days, he has been forced to answer questions about his role
helping donors.
</P>
<P>
	   Twice in 1998, McCain urged Kennard to consider wireless services, such as
Sprint PCS, as competitors to BellSouth, which wants to provide long-distance
service. Such a ruling would remove a regulatory barrier the regional Bell
companies faced in their bids to enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I encourage you to give serious consideration to whether PCS is providing
competition to the local exchange market,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Commerce Committee Republican staff director Mark Buse said McCain's
advocacy on behalf of the Baby Bells was consistent with his support for
telecommunications competition that would result in lower prices for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth and its employees have contributed $30,000 to his presidential bid
through Sept. 30, his third-most generous contributor. The company also hosted a
fund-raiser for him in Atlanta this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth spokesman Bill McCloskey said the company has been a longtime
donor to McCain's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We tend to give to people who ask us,'' McCloskey said. ``People who have
influence over our industry are more likely to ask us because they know us, and
they know us before we appear before their committee. We help our friends, and
John McCain is our friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also went to bat before the FCC on behalf of two other Baby Bells,
Ameritech and SBC Communications, who were seeking the agency's permission to
merge.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks after Ameritech Chairman Richard Notebaert held a fund-raiser for
him last spring, McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing
them of being unfair toward the merger.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter accused the commission of ``applying a different, and much
stricter, burden of proof in this merger proceeding than the commission has
applied in evaluating other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also said, ``This letter expresses no view on the merits of any issues in
this proceeding and is not written to benefit any particular party.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a debate Friday night, McCain was questioned about the Ameritech letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the times when I have weighed in, I have asked them to do their duty
and to expedite the procedures as they're laid out under the law and according
to existing regulations,'' he said. ``I will continue to do that job, and when a
constituent, a person of mine who has trouble -- or a citizen of this country
who can't get a reaction or an answer from a bureaucracy that's paid for with
their tax dollars, I believe that people like me should weigh in.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ameritech denied any connection between the fund-raisers and McCain's
letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was totally Dick Notebaert's personal involvement as a member of the
host committee in Chicago,'' spokesman Dave Pacholczyk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bude, the Commerce Committee staff director, noted that McCain also has
butted heads with the Bells. For example, Bude said, McCain is a strong
supporter of portability, the practice of allowing telephone customers to retain
their phone numbers if the move within the same area code. And he challenged the
fees the Bell companies were charging competitors to use their networks.

<HEADLINE> Feds: Endangered Fish on the Rebound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- An endangered fish whose ancestors swam with the
dinosaurs appears to be making a comeback in the Missouri River, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service said.
</P>
<P>
	   Biologists working at the Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge said
they have found pallid sturgeon hatchlings in the wild for the first time in
decades, an encouraging sign in the effort to save the species from extinction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is wonderful,'' said Steve Krentz, who leads the Bismarck, N.D.-based
Pallid Sturgeon Recovery Team. ``Until these were found, the only young pallid
sturgeon we'd seen were products of spawning operations at hatcheries.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wildlife workers found the fish in August. A laboratory analysis, just
completed, confirmed at least one to be a pallid sturgeon, Krentz said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The pallid sturgeon can grow to 100 pounds, reach 6 feet in length and live
60 years. Distinguished by pale, bony plates instead of scales, it has a
reptile-like body, a sucker-type mouth and large whisker-like growths that help
it sense its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
	   The fish, once common, has been on the endangered species list since 1990.
Dams built on the river altered the pallid sturgeon's habitat, taking away the
shallow, silty conditions -- along with the sand and gravel bars -- that it
needs to thrive.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice's 3-pointer against his former teammates gave
Los Angeles its first lead with 2:36 left and the Lakers downed the Charlotte
Hornets 87-83 Friday night for their 13th consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 23 points and 16 rebounds as the Lakers rallied in the
fourth quarter and overcame a 34 percent shooting night to win for the 20th time
in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte led 73-60 early in the fourth quarter. But Kobe Bryant, who had
made just three of 17 shots, scored consecutive baskets during a 9-0 run in
which Rice also hit a 3-pointer as the Lakers closed to 78-77 with 3:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice then nailed his go-ahead 3-pointer and made a steal that set up
O'Neal's basket for a 82-78 lead. Rice finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Coleman had 17 points for Charlotte, including the 10,000th of his
career, and David Wesley and Bobby Phills added 17 points each for the Hornets,
who traded Rice to the Lakers last season for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones.

<HEADLINE> LA Police Chief Proposes Changes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Police Department's embattled anti-gang
unit would come under closer supervision and officers' tenure limited under
changes proposed by Chief Bernard Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   The unit has emerged at the center of the worst Los Angeles police
corruption scandal in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, four people have been released from prison, other convictions have
been thrown out and a dozen officers have been removed from active duty amid
allegations that arrests were fabricated and suspects were shot by police
officers for no reason.
</P>
<P>
	   At the center of the probe is the department's Rampart Division and its
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, or CRASH, unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the changes detailed Friday is limiting an officer's time on the
detail to three years. The department is also considering changing the unit's
name and increasing the supervision of anti-gang officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are making some realignments and some consolidation,'' said Dennis
Zine, vice president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League. ``They are not
calling for the disbandment of police involvement in the gang area.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not abolishing the anti-gang program at all,'' added Sgt. John
Pasquariello, a police spokesman. ``We're making it better and a little more
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, a federal magistrate judge said he intends to vacate a drug
conviction that sent Esaw Booker, 54, to prison for five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Booker said he has fought for nine years to have his cocaine possession
conviction reversed because he was framed. The officer who arrested him, Rafael
Perez, has said he and other members of the Rampart Division anti-gang unit
planted evidence on suspects and shot some without justification.

<HEADLINE> Dying Cost Rises in Silicon Valley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- In Silicon Valley, getting a place for a family of
four is expensive. Throw in a mountaintop view and a professionally tended yard
and a $265,000 find is a steal.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not about a reasonably priced home. It's a cemetery plot.
</P>
<P>
	   A special section of four-person burial plots with panoramic views at San
Mateo County's Skylawn Memorial Park are part of Silicon Valley's other
real-estate boom. Cemetery lots in desirable settings appreciate in value as
fast as houses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's demand, like anything else,'' said John Milne, director of family
services at San Jose's Oak Hill Memorial Park. ``You can buy a cemetery lot in
Iowa for $100. Here, the average price is about $3,400.''
</P>
<P>
	   A General Accounting Office study found cemetery lots nationally ranged from
$150 to $1,900 in 1997, but government officials and industry groups said they
usually don't track such costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, people in the business say they've seen big price hikes
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Karel van Haeften, part owner of Cemetery Property Resales in San Mateo, in
1999 brokered 21 cemetery plots whose value increased considerably faster than
the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
	   One San Jose are plot priced at $1,250 in 1987 was valued recently at
$3,720. Another sold for $2,500 in 1987 is now worth $12,095. By contrast, the
average price of goods tracked by the CPI has approximately doubled since 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   As with housing for the living, cemetery plots in choice locations tend to
be pricier.
</P>
<P>
	   At Skylawn, plots low on the hill sell for $7,500. Built into a plaza at the
very top were 20 family plots, each big enough for four people, which were going
for $265,000 or $66,250 per body.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are willing to pay for the value that they receive,'' said the
cemetery's general manager, Margo Scolari, noting that three of the plaza plots
have been sold.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Birthday Celebrations Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Elvis Presley would have been 65 today and to mark
the occasion his fans will get another chance to see him as a much younger man.
</P>
<P>
	   A concert with Presley performing on video with live backup musicians is
part of a birthday celebration staged by Graceland Enterprises Inc., the
business manager of his estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Graceland has taken the concert around the world since its debut in Memphis
in 1997. It is scheduled for a second European tour this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Fan club officers hold an annual meeting in Memphis in conjunction with the
birthday, and a gospel brunch is scheduled Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tonight's two-hour concert, with seating for 8,300 at the Mid-South
Coliseum, is a blend of Elvis videos on a 20-foot screen and live performances
by singers and band members who toured with him in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once we start, we're not following any kind of digital track. We're just
going with his voice," said Joe Guercio, the show's musical director.
</P>
<P>
	   Presley's birthday celebrations generally attract several hundred fans from
around the country and abroad. Annual gatherings on Aug. 16, the anniversary of
his 1977 death, draw much larger crowds.

<HEADLINE> Floor Brokers Sentenced for Scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge has sentenced four New York Stock Exchange floor
brokers and two executives to prison or home detention for engaging in illegal
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   William Killeen, 39, the head of Wall Street brokerage Oakford Corp., was
sentenced to 20 months in prison and the firm's vice president, Thomas Bock, 46,
was sentenced to 18 months. Both men were fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   They admitted that their now-defunct company illegally allowed floor brokers
to execute personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   This was believed to be the first case to result from illegal personal
trades by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers. They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for
any account in which they have an interest because they can have immediate
access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge on Friday rejected arguments that four of the firm's brokers
should not face prison terms because they were not properly informed by the
Stock Exchange that what they were doing was a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The brokers, John Savarese, 35, Mark Savarese, 38, Edward Mueger, 65, and
Thomas Cavallino, 43, had all pleaded guilty earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Savarese brothers were each sentenced to four months in prison followed
by two months of home detention. They were each fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueger was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home
confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   And Cavallino was sentenced to six months of home confinement and fined
$100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term but increased his fine after
listening to pleas that he be left at home to care for his son.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Demands Return of Boy  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- After an emotional day remembering his son, the
father of Elian Gonzalez angrily denounced a U.S. lawmaker's attempt to prevent
the 6-year-old boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally by tens of thousands of people from the boy's hometown, Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, told the crowd Friday of the ``hard and difficult
days'' he has suffered because of the bitter tussle over his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Marked by tears, songs and personal recollections, the rally was the most
emotional demonstration since the international custody battle over Elias began.
Elian was found on an inner tube floating off the coast of Florida on
Thanksgiving Day, after his mother drowned in an attempt to flee to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government ordered Elian's return to Cuba by Jan. 14, but on Friday
Rep. Dan Burton subpoenaed the boy to testify before a congressional committee,
in an attempt to keep him in the country. Also Friday, one of Elian's Miami
relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   The elder Gonzalez was angered by Burton's move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What right does that man have?'' he told a news conference after the rally
in Cardenas. ``I am the father of Elian and immigration has said that I am the
only one who can speak for him
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally in a a seaside plaza, Gonzalez and Elian's four
grandparents and great-grandmother began weeping as a Cuban band sang of his
drowned mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian, Cardenas awaits you ... with kisses,'' a Cuban band sang.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez looked particularly exhausted and distraught, his eyes red from
crying.
</P>
<P>
	   Speakers at the rally included classmates from Elian's elementary school,
his teacher, his school principal, and the doctor who has been caring for him
since he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   In a homage to the small boy with dark eyes who loves all things that fly,
two kites sailed high over the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   During the rally, many of the young children broke down in tears and were
carried out by parents or members of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly, encouraged the crowd
to keep protesting until the boy is back with his father.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot call a truce yet,'' Alarcon said, warning that exiles in Miami
were trying to delay the child's return. ``We cannot let down our guard until
the kidnapping of Elian comes to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami, has temporary custody of the
boy and wants to keep him permanently in the United States. He says he can give
Elian a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers filed a petition Friday asking that Lazaro Gonzalez be named his
guardian, a position that would allow him to seek asylum for the young boy.
Elian's father is now his guardian.

<HEADLINE> Life Cereal To Revive Mikey Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Hey, it's Mikey! He's back!
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, it's not the same Mikey. But Life cereal is bringing back the
character made famous in the 1970s commercial, updating him from a cute finicky
kid to a handsome finicky adult.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're excited to bring back a commercial that people have loved for years,"
said Todd Magazine, a vice president of Quaker Oats Co., which makes Life.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mikey ad campaign is being relaunched, 28 years after its debut, with an
all-adult cast. The lines are the same, and so is the shtick. Only the actors
playing Mikey and his breakfast mates are new.
</P>
<P>
	   In the original ad, which aired from 1972-84, two kids share their suspicion
of a cereal that's "sposed ta be good for ya." They decide to test it out on
their kid brother Mikey, because "he hates everything."
</P>
<P>
	   But pudgy-faced Mikey, who never utters a word, takes to it, prompting the
famous lines: "He likes it! Hey, Mikey!"
</P>
<P>
	   The original Mikey ad was "the best kid commercial ever," said David Lubars,
president of the Fallon, McElligott ad agency in Minneapolis, who has no
connection to either ad. "It was a combination of a good idea and because the
kid was so likable. There's something magic about it."
</P>
<P>
	   The new commercial, created by Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding, is to be launched Jan.
17 and run through June.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad agency heeded research, which found that 70 percent of adults could
identify the Life cereal ad from just a brief description. The ad placed No. 10
in TV Guide's list of "The 50 Greatest Commercials of All Time."
</P>
<P>
	   So why not bring back a freckled 3-year-old, like the one who filmed the
spot with his two brothers in 1971?
</P>
<P>
	   Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding executives say they wanted to add a twist. They
selected a handsome Mikey in his 20s -- New York-based actor Jimmy Starace --
who eats Life as he sits reading his morning newspaper, alongside a man and
woman. In the spirit of the original, all three act like kids.
</P>
<P>
	   Mikey is the latest advertising icon to be resurrected as Madison Avenue
bets on Americans being as nostalgic about old commercials as they are about old
rock 'n' roll. The Green Giant, Mr. Whipple and Charlie the Tuna -- they've all
been resurrected.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago-based Quaker hopes the new Mikey can work some old magic on a
product facing fiercer-than-ever competition from endless rows of cereals lining
supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   The original Mikey was assured by Quaker that he would remain anonymous in
publicity associated with the campaign's return. But icons, even former ones,
find it hard to escape the media.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracked down at New York radio station WKTU where he works as an advertising
account manager, John Gilchrist, now 31, said he remains under contract to
Quaker and couldn't say much.
</P>
<P>
	   "It never ends, it seems," he said of Americans' fascination with the
character.
</P>
<P>
	   What about a reprise of that role?
</P>
<P>
	   "That would be nice. ... Hopefully you'll see me again."

<HEADLINE> Alcohol Tax Brings Fear to Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOPPENISH, Wash. (AP) -- At Tiny's Tavern, bartender Nena Garcia wonders how
much longer she'll be employed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yakama Nation, which already bans liquor sales on tribal land, has
imposed a new tax on alcohol sold on private land within the reservation and a
$5,000 license fee on liquor distributors.
</P>
<P>
	   The move has been criticized by the governor and it raises legal questions
about the authority of tribes to tax non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian tribes across the country have taken various steps to curb
alcohol-related problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, the Blackfeet Tribal Council banned liquor sales on its Montana
reservation for five days and suggested it could be the forerunner of year-round
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
	   Activist Russell Means in October suggested opening a liquor store near
South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is officially dry, and using
the profits to treat alcoholism. Stores in Whiteclay, Neb. -- just two miles
from the reservation -- sell millions of dollars worth of beer each year, most
of it to Oglala Sioux.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yakama tribe's moves affect some 50 businesses. At least two major
distributors already have refused to deliver to the central Washington
reservation, and that means Tiny's, in nearby Wapato, hasn't been able to get
any beer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're stocked for a little bit, maybe a month or so. After that I don't
know," Ms. Garcia said. "I'm afraid I might lose my job."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Gary Locke, who opposes the Yakama tax, did announce this week that the
state is closing the two privately operated state liquor store franchises in
Wapato and Toppenish "out of respect for the Yakama Nation's desire to reduce
consumption of alcohol on the reservation."
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Paddock owns the Wapato franchise. He hopes to move his business to
Union Gap, a few miles north and off the reservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Paddock said several people stand to lose their livelihoods because of the
new wholesale tax, which raises the price of a six-pack of beer by about $2.40.
Restaurants and lounges could be hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Yakama Tribal Council adopted the tax ordinance in November,
leaders said the money would be used for alcoholism treatment and education and
for drunken-driving enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We share their concerns about alcoholism and the illegal overuse of
alcohol," Locke said after meeting with tribal leaders and area mayors.

	   However, he said the tax is "the wrong way to go" in trying to fight
problems such as chronic alcohol abuse, teen-age drinking and fetal alcohol
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Christine Gregoire has said the tax may be illegal
because it is imposed on non-tribal members.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribal Council Chairman Lonnie Selam, however, said he believed the tax
would withstand legal challenge. The governor said negotiations over the issue
will continue and urged businesses to hang on.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one of three private clubs is considering allowing members to bring
in their own liquor, and then charging them a fee for glasses and mixers. At the
Double D Saloon and several other businesses, petitions are being circulated
urging Locke to fight the tax.

<P>
	   David Meyers, owner of The 88-Cent Store across the street from the Double
D, doesn't sell alcohol but he's opposed to the tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "I believe it's too radical, and that Toppenish residents will end up going
out of town to buy their alcohol, thus causing major problems with drinking and
driving," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Esther Serna, who owns the El Paso Cafe, said she was neutral on the tax.
</P>

	   "I don't sell a lot of beer," she said. "But I do feel sorry for the people
(it) will make go out of business."

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice's 3-pointer against his former teammates gave
Los Angeles its first lead with 2:36 left and the Lakers downed the Charlotte
Hornets 87-83 Friday night for their 13th consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 23 points and 16 rebounds as the Lakers rallied in the
fourth quarter and overcame a 34 percent shooting night to win for the 20th time
in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte led 73-60 early in the fourth quarter. But Kobe Bryant, who had
made just three of 17 shots, scored consecutive baskets during a 9-0 run in
which Rice also hit a 3-pointer as the Lakers closed to 78-77 with 3:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice then nailed his go-ahead 3-pointer and made a steal that set up
O'Neal's basket for a 82-78 lead. Rice finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Coleman had 17 points for Charlotte, including the 10,000th of his
career, and David Wesley and Bobby Phills added 17 points each for the Hornets,
who traded Rice to the Lakers last season for Elden Campbell and Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers (28-5), with the best record in the league, are off to their best
start since the 1985-86 team started with the same record on its way to an NBA
title.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, sidelined with an elbow injury, did not suit up. Campbell scored nine
points before he fouled out late in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte seemed to be taking control early in the fourth quarter when the
Lakers missed their first seven shots and the Hornets opened a 13-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   But Charlotte then went cold, going some six minutes between baskets, as the
Lakers closed the gap.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers kept it close for most of the third quarter, twice pulling within
two points, the last time at 57-55 with 3:45 left in the period. But the Hornets
were up 66-60 at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Coleman had 12 first-half points and Wesley 10 to help the Hornets take a
47-44 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles made just 14 of 42 (33.3 percent) from the field in the first
half, with Bryant going 2-for-12 as he scored seven points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers were particularly frigid early, going more than four minutes
without scoring to fall behind 17-6 eight minutes into the game. They hit just
five of 22 shots in the quarter and trailed 27-18 heading into the second
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones was with Los Angeles from 1994-99, and Campbell played for the Lakers
from 1990-99. Rice was with Charlotte from 1995-98 and holds several franchise
records, including highest scoring average in a season, 26.8 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- David Robinson had 24 points and nine rebounds and Tim
Duncan had 19 points and 15 boards Friday night as the San Antonio Spurs routed
Phoenix 102-83 -- the worst loss in Scott Skiles' 11 games as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio, which had lost two in a row and five of eight, built a 22-point
lead in a dominating third quarter and coasted in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs were 13-for-13 at the foul line in the third quarter, while the
Suns were 0-for-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Cliff Robinson scored 22 points for the Suns, who have lost three of four.
Jason Kidd struggled through a 2-for-14 shooting night for four points, tying
his season-low. Kidd also had 13 assists for Phoenix, which shot 37 percent from
the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta, in his second game back after a life-threatening seizure
sidelined him for seven games, scored 14 -- but only four in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs outscored Phoenix 30-16 in the third quarter and led 82-62
entering the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   After leading 52-46 at the half, San Antonio scored eight consecutive points
to go up 68-53 on Robinson's two free throws with 5:16 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs' run hit 18-5 on consecutive baskets by Avery Johnson to put San
Antonio ahead 78-58 with 1:09 left in the quarter. Antonio Daniels' two free
throws gave the Spurs their biggest lead of the quarter, 82-60, with 11.1
seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   By halftime, Robinson had 20 points and seven rebounds. He took 15 shots in
the first half and made eight of them as the Spurs led 52-46 at the break.
Robinson finished 9-for-19 from the field.

<HEADLINE> Inmate's Autobiography on Internet  </HEADLINE>
   By ASHLEY ESTES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- A man convicted of killing a teen-age girl wrote an
account of his crime, conviction and religious conversion in an autobiography
posted on the Internet after his execution.
</P>
<P>
	   David Ray Duren, 37, was electrocuted early Friday for the 1983 robbery and
shooting death of Kathleen Bedsole, 16.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote ``An Attitude Adjustment'' at the request of high school students,
said Birmingham minister Richard Copeland, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren mixes his own story with Biblical quotations and references. ``I'm
writing to you from death row, where I am awaiting execution,'' he begins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a shameful thing to admit ... but it is my hope that through
sharing these things ... that I may help you, or those you know, avoid making
the same poor choices I made.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he felt ``tremendous shame'' at recounting Miss Bedsole's death and
his other crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The hatred that I felt for myself -- that I was ever capable of such
inhumanity, such destruction of innocent lives,'' he wrote. ``It never goes
away, it never fades.''
</P>
<P>
	   Duren writes about dabbling in drugs, saying he once had to be revived by
cardiopulmonary resuscitation after mixing heroin, methamphetamines and alcohol,
and he was discharged from the Army for smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren was the first inmate executed in an electric chair since the U.S.
Supreme Court decided in October to consider a Florida case concerning whether
the chair is cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Bedsole and her boyfriend, 16-year-old Chuck Leonard, were in Leonard's
parked car when they were approached by Duren, then 21, and accomplice David
Kinder, 17. Duren and Kinder forced the teen-agers into the car's trunk and
drove to a secluded spot, where the youths were tied up and shot. Leonard
survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Kinder was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Duren, who said he became a born-again Christian and was baptized in 1986,
had opposed any last-minute appeals to avoid the electric chair. He declined to
make a final statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``David wanted to express his deep sorrow for his horrible crime of 16 years
ago, and for the pain that he caused for the victims and their families,''
Copeland said after the execution. ``He wanted the world to know he was sorry.''

Gore Backpedals on Gay Policy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Under political pressure, Vice President Al Gore
backpedaled Friday from his statement that he would require candidates for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with his intention to let gays serve openly in
the military. "I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of
inquiry into the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,"
Gore told reporters. Gore, under fire from military brass and some of his own
political allies, spoke two days after his original comments at a candidates'
debate. The comments have sparked dissent from former members of the joint
chiefs and from Sen. John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran campaigning for Gore in New
Hampshire.

anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before
the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the country
while the courts consider his case. Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to
an inner tube at sea after his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned
while trying to reach Florida by boat. The boy was placed with family in Miami,
but the Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled Wednesday that he must be
returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14.

announced Friday came as Russian commanders indicated that a scaling-back of the

said it was fiscally irresponsible to promise a huge tax cut that is based on a
surplus the U.S. might not have. Bush retorted that his plan was more generous
than McCain's for lower income taxpayers and added firmly: "There is enough
money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to take care of the
basic services of government, and there is enough money to give the people a
substantial tax cut. And that's what I intend to do."

the flag above its Statehouse, and the NAACP has called a tourism boycott of

<HEADLINE> Floor brokers sentenced for greed on Wall Street  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge sent three former New York Stock Exchange floor
brokers to prison along with the owners of a now defunct brokerage, saying greed
got the best of them.
<P>
	   "It involved not only intentional violations of the rules but the making of
false statements and the making of false records," U.S. District Judge Jed S.
Rakoff said at sentencing Friday. "It was done out of greed."
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff handed the stiffest sentences to the two heads of a company that
helped the brokers trade illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   A sobbing William Killeen was sentenced to a year and eight months in prison
for his part in the scam engineered in part through his company, Oakford Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Killeen, 39, of Colts Neck, N.J., was president of the now defunct company
that engaged in a securities conspiracy by allowing floor brokers to execute
personal trades ahead of orders from their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's vice president, Thomas William Bock, 47, was sentenced to a
year and a half in prison and fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Floor brokers are paid a commission to conduct trades for client brokerages
and their customers.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not permitted to make trades for themselves or for any account in
which they have an interest because their positions on the floor can provide
them with immediate access to market-moving news, giving them an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff also fined Killeen $50,000 after the defendant said he was "extremely
sorry."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is with great regret that I stand here today," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said Killeen's honorable dedication to his family and his
community conflicted with his business life in which he and others engaged in "a
series of blatantly unlawful acts motivated by greed." Rakoff added, "He is the
proverbial person who led two lives."
</P>
<P>
	   "But in his business life, greed overcame respect for the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bock and Killeen had admitted during guilty pleas last year that they had
their company pay their personal expenses including car leases, vacations and
mortgage installments between 1992 and 1996. Those payments amounted to $207,000
for Killeen and $330,000 for Bock, the government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sentencing of Killeen and Bock were two of six to occur throughout the
day, four of them floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected arguments by lawyers that the brokers should not face
prison terms because they were not properly informed by the NYSE that what they
were doing was a crime. The prosecution is believed to be the first case to
result from illegal personal trades made by floor brokers.
</P>
<P>
	   John Savarese, 35, and his brother, Mark, 38, both floor brokers from Garden
City, were each sentenced to four months in prison to be followed by two months
of home detention. Both were fined $15,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward Mueger, 65, of Jupiter, Fla., was sentenced to three months in prison
and three months of home confinement. He was also fined $15,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Cavallino, 43, of Shrewsbury, N.J., was sentenced to six months of
home confinement and fined $100,000. The judge spared Cavallino a prison term,
but increased his fine, after listening to pleas that he be left at home to care
for his son.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Stanley Howse Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rapper Stanley Howse of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony has pleaded
innocent to weapons charges and making a terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Howse, 26, was arrested Monday when relatives in Los Angeles called police
after an argument that apparently started when Howse arrived for a visit.
Investigators said the rapper, who entered his plea Thursday in Municipal Court,
was armed with a loaded shotgun and refused to leave the house after officers
arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Howse, known as "Flesh Bone" with his Grammy-winning rap group, faces one
count each of possession of a gun by a convicted felon, illegal possession of a
shotgun, illegal possession of a short-barreled shotgun, making a terrorist
threat and resisting an officer. All are felony charges.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty last year to assault with a deadly weapon in a case
triggered by a dispute with a former neighbor who complained about shots being
fired at Howse's home on July 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Howse was sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to undergo anger
management training and perform community service.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Feeling the weight of your New Year's resolutions?
Jack LaLanne understands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know where most people with New Year's resolutions get their
exercise?'' the fitness guru asked Friday. ``Breaking their New Year's
resolutions. That is their exercise.''
</P>
<P>
	   At 85, LaLanne is fit and trim and just as excited about exercise as when he
first began showing television audiences in the 1950s how to get in shape. He
says the key is setting realistic goals and sticking with them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know, the average person means well,'' he said. ``They read all this
stuff. Somebody motivates them. They set their goals too high. They do it two or
three times and say, 'This is too tough.' And they quit.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's the wrong approach, he said, before addressing an overflow crowd at a
fitness forum sponsored by a local hospital and outreach organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Staying in shape is a lifestyle,'' said LaLanne, who still works out two
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not something you do for two weeks or four months to lose 20 pounds.
It is something you do for the rest of your life, just like ... combing your
hair.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Told Lee He Failed Lie Exam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fired nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee was misled by federal
investigators who told him he'd failed a Department of Energy lie-detector test,
The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   During a long interrogation, FBI agents pressed Lee to confess passing
nuclear weapons secrets to China. Lee, however, denied that, insisted he was
telling the truth and was never told by his interrogators that DOE polygraph
operators had in fact given him a very high score for honesty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know why I fail,'' Lee told the FBI. ``But I do know I have not
done anything. ... I never give any classified information to Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Post obtained a transcript of the March 7 interrogation, which was
recorded by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the questioning by the federal agents was highly
adversarial and ended only after Lee asked repeatedly to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, a 60-year-old Taiwan-born researcher, is being held without bail for
allegedly copying classified nuclear data to computer tapes, seven of which are
missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors deny their investigation was biased or unfair and
maintain that the FBI's skepticism about Lee's statements was justified because
he'd lied in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has pleaded innocent to 59 counts under the Atomic Energy and Espionage
Acts. If convicted, the former employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
could face life in prison.

weapons in fierce battles against Christians.
</P>
<P>
	   The unrest that has gripped the Maluku and North Maluku provinces, or Spice
Islands as they were known during colonial times, has reached a fever-pitch in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence also has sparked fears that the world's fourth most populous
country could splinter along deep-rooted religious and ethnic fault lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Separatist movements in other provinces in the archipelago -- such as Aceh
and Irian Jaya -- threaten Indonesia's territorial integrity. But only the
conflict in the Malukas has the potential to spread quickly to other areas of
the nation where the majority Muslim population coexists with people of other
religions.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions in the region date to the 15th century, when Dutch, Portuguese and
English traders competed for control of the valuable spice trade centered on the
islands. Western traders, explorers and missionaries brought their faiths with
them.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Muslim and Christian communities are still split along religious
lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent tension has been fueled in part by the migration in recent years
of thousands of Muslims from other parts of Indonesia. Christians fear they may
become a minority in one of the few places they have been a majority.
</P>
<P>
	   As a whole, Muslims make up almost 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million
people.
</P>
<P>
	   The bloodshed began a year ago while Muslims were celebrating Eid al-Fitr --
a holiday marked by gift giving and family reunions. The fighting was sparked by
a minor scuffle between a Christian bus driver and his Muslim conductor.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then at least 2,000 people have died in clashes that spread from the
provincial capital, Ambon, to outlying islands. In the past two weeks alone,
about 1,000 people are estimated to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts at peace have come to nothing. Last May, the two sides signed a
peace accord, but fighting broke out two days later.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, President Abdurrahman Wahid visited Ambon and told residents
they had to find peace themselves rather than look to the central government for
answers. New fighting erupted the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christians generally distrust the Muslim-dominated government in Jakarta
and have called for the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government is not perceived as being neutral,'' said Dede Oetomo, a
political analyst and lecturer at Airlangga University. ``International
peacekeepers wouldn't take sides in the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
	   Parliamentary speaker Amien Rais recently called on the armed forces to
separate the warring groups. He said Indonesia's very existence could be
threatened if the ethnic unrest spreads to the nation's main island, Java.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the violence spreads to Java and other islands, then this republic will
disband very quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, about 80,000 Muslim demonstrators in Jakarta, the capital,
threatened to declare a holy war in the defense of Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past week, security forces conducted a massive sweep of Ambon,
confiscating thousands of illegal weapons. But many local militia members say
they will keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   Samsul, the young Muslim warrior, said he would not rest until ``the
Christians stop trying to wipe out the Muslims from this island.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jani Albar, a Muslim fighter, said he buried a large dagger under his house
before soldiers searched his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fighting won't stop,'' the 22-year-old said. ``Everyone has buried
weapons.''

<HEADLINE> Syrian Village Watching Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HADAR, Syria (AP) -- In a village on a snowy hillside where people have to
shout across a mined valley to relatives in Israeli-occupied territory,
residents have been closely following the peace talks being held in an equally
secluded town in rural West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   On radios and televisions, they hear and see the Arab news broadcasts from
Shepherdstown, W. Va., where President Clinton intervened again Friday to try to
push Israel and Syria to a land-for-peace agreement that would end 50 years of
hostilities and change the map of their area in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1973, Israel occupied Hadar, this Druze village of 10,000 people, and
then abandoned it the following year as its troops pulled back 3 miles.
</P>
<P>
	   Mashir Bassar, a 46-year-old resident who works as a teacher, said Friday
that he is hopeful peace will result -- and is afraid the opportunity may not
come around again. But he said he is concerned that there has been no formal
Israeli commitment to returning all of the Golan to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said the price of peace would be
painful to his country but has not publicly spelled out any plan of withdrawing
completely from the 744 square miles that Israel still occupies.
</P>
<P>
	   Bassar said his secondary school students discuss the peace process in class
and follow developments at home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We teach the students about full peace -- the need for returning all of
the land,'' he said. ``What we have heard up to now from Israel is only words
about peace, nothing about returning the land.''
</P>
<P>
	   Syria's state-run media, which reflects government thinking, voiced similar
complaints Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper Al-Thawra called on Israel to announce an ``honest, specific
and clear position that reflects its commitment to the land-for-peace
principle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Damascus Radio accused Israel of procrastinating at the talks in their fifth
day on Friday, saying the Israelis ``say things that completely differ from what
they do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian negotiators, the radio commentary said, went to West Virginia
``basically to discuss peaceful relations with Israel but also to restore the
whole area of Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hadar residents agree that less than a full Israeli withdrawal is not
acceptable. But even those who have lived through the past half century of wars
and hostility say they have hope for peace soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Osman Yatouf, 65, says he expects peace to come in his lifetime. For Yatouf
-- who sells costume jewelry, baby clothes, socks and lotions in a cramped shop
along Hadar's steep and winding main street -- peace would mean visiting his
sister any time he likes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sihan Yatouf lives in Majd al-Shams, a Druze village just inside
Israeli-occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Cross arranged for her to visit Hadar for a month nine years ago.
She can telephone her brother from time to time. But the siblings mainly
communicate through megaphones that allow them to call out news 200 yards across
the mined valley that divides them.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a valley that has earned two names over the decades -- the Valley of
Shouts and the Valley of Tears.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students Reject Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Students who have shut down Mexico's largest public
school with an eight-month strike rejected an offer from university officials to
meet some of their demands, saying the offer didn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The offer that the strikers turned down Friday included eliminating a plan
to raise tuition at the National Autonomous University of Mexico from the
equivalent of a few cents to $140 annually. That proposed tuition increase --
the first in decades -- was what originally sparked the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   The university negotiators walked out of Friday's talks after six hours
because the students refused to discuss the offer.
</P>
<P>
	   After the talks, the strikers said in a statement that they are now
demanding the release of several students arrested during a Dec. 11
demonstration for allegedly hurling rocks and launching fireworks at the U.S.
Embassy and police. That protest was called to demand the release of other
demonstrators arrested during the recent World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of striking students seized the university campus April 20. While
there are 268,000 students at the university, the strikers represent a few
thousand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have come close to meeting the demands originally put forward'' by the
striking students, said Xavier Soberon, who represents the university's rector
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The students' demands also include automatic admission for graduates of the
university's prep school and a lowering of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The university offer, drawn up by newly appointed Rector Juan Ramon de la
Fuente, maintained that those issues should be voted on at a convention of
university staff, faculty and students.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Constitution Plan Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By OLIVER TEVES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippines' president announced today he
would yield to widespread opposition and suspend one of his administration's top
priorities, the amendment of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a leader, I must listen,'' Joseph Estrada said in his annual report to
the nation in which he also announced a shuffle of his top economic Cabinet
posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada had vowed repeatedly not to abandon his goal of removing
constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership of land and key industries,
saying they impede investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But many Filipinos believe that opening up the charter, ratified a year
after the ouster of dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, could endanger its
democratic provisions. Tens of thousands of people protested against the
proposed changes in several demonstrations last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, Estrada said his government would now focus instead on
short-term economic measures that would cause ``less cost to national unity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada, whose popularity has plunged in recent months, spent much of his
speech announcing changes in policies and personnel aimed at rejuvenating his
administration and boosting its sagging support.
</P>
<P>
	   He confirmed that Trade Secretary Jose Pardo will replace Finance Secretary
Edgardo Espiritu, who resigned this past week. Espiritu, an experienced banker,
helped lead the country's recovery from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Pardo, who has close ties to business as former president of the Philippine
franchise of 7-Eleven and Burger King but has limited experience in fiscal
policy, will be replaced by House Majority Leader Manuel Roxas II.
</P>
<P>
	   Roxas, a former investment banker, authored a bill that would open the
retail trade sector to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet reshuffle is widely seen as an effort by Estrada to find new
direction following criticism that his government has failed to develop a
credible blueprint for helping the millions of Filipinos living below the
poverty line, and has not pushed through much-needed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada also unveiled a new committee joining the president and economic
advisers that will create and implement economic policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The new economic team faces formidable policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 budget deficit is likely to far surpass the target of $2.1 billion
because of poor revenue collection. As of the end of November, the deficit
already exceeded $2.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore on the Defensive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Both Democratic presidential candidates were forced
onto the defensive: Vice President Al Gore mending fences with Gen. Colin Powell
and backpedaling on a sticky question of gays in the military, Bill Bradley
buying TV time to justify the very premise of his ``big ideas'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The sparks were flying even before the pair went head to head in today's
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Feeling the pinch of Gore's latest line of criticism -- likening the Bradley
agenda, top-heavy with a massive health care plan, to Ronald Reagan's for its
focus on only ``one or two things'' -- the Bradley campaign said it spent
$250,000 on a new television ad that would pelt New Hampshire voters five or six
times on Manchester TV and another five or six times from nearby Boston
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People accuse me of offering big ideas that they say are risky,'' Bradley
says in the ad. ``I say the real risk is not doing the things I've set out to do
in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   It marked the first time that Bradley, in his active ad campaign, used a
spot to respond to Gore. It also marked a sharp escalation in the back-and-forth
of the tight race for Iowa's Jan. 24 delegate caucuses and New Hampshire's Feb.
1 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Over in the Gore camp, the back-and-forth was internal as Gore, within the
space of one hour Friday evening, juggled two self-deployed political land
mines.
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to clear up an embarrassment caused by his campaign manager and
then, hastily called a news conference -- safely after most dinnertime news
broadcasts -- to retract comments earlier in the week that he would require
candidates for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with his intention to let gays
serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore said
after a pep rally at Valley High School.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, under fire from military brass and some of his own political allies,
spoke two days after his original comments during a debate in New Hampshire. The
comments sparked dissent from former members of the joint chiefs and from Sen.
John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran campaigning for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In what aides called a ``clarification'' of his original statement, Gore
said, ``What I meant to convey was I would not tolerate, nor would any commander
in chief, nor would any president tolerate orders not being followed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The line seemed to be borrowed from Bradley. Both Democrats were asked in
Wednesday's debate if they would make agreement on gays in the military a litmus
test for appointments to the joint chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said such a test was unnecessary because military officers follow
orders from their commander in chief, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore answered the litmus-test question this way: ``I would insist,
before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that that individual
support my policy. And yes, I would make that a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
	   After two days of news reports quoting current and retired military officers
aghast at Gore's remark, the vice president blamed reporters for not hearing him
right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not what I meant to convey -- that's what you heard,'' he said.
``I didn't use that term, litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
	   At Gore's campaign rally, supporter Carolyn Klein faulted Gore for ever
suggesting such a prerequisite. ``What matters is if he can work well with them,
and not whether they agree or disagree. Not everyone agrees with me on my job
either but we work together,'' said Klein, a food-service director for the local
school district.
</P>
<P>
	   But Klein, 59, also faulted Gore for wasting energy on the question. ``I
think that's the least of our issues right now. We have so many problems to work
on, that he's making too much of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for the day's other thorny distraction, Gore campaign manager Donna
Brazile said in a recent interview that Republicans used blacks like General
Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to pose for
pictures, but did not really care about them.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell responded with an angry letter to the Gore campaign that he
distributed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Brazile and Gore separately telephoned Powell. Gore refused to say whether
either of them apologized outright to the retired general.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're friends of long standing ... it was a very friendly and warm
conversation,'' Gore told reporters. ``I reaffirmed my total respect and regard
for him as an American hero, for him as a national leader and for him as a
personal friend.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidates normally preoccupied with their own
nomination pounced on Gore for the missteps.
</P>
<P>
	   Front-runner George W. Bush called the Powell remark by Brazile, who
included Oklahoma GOP Rep. J.C. Watts in her indictment, ``slash-and-burn
politics'' and said he would ``watch and see how Gore handles it.''

<HEADLINE> The man with the million-megawatt smile is state's $100 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A lot of people wouldn't make it to work if they just
learned they had won the lottery - especially if the job started at 4 a.m.
<P>
	   But Johnnie Ely strolled into The Java Shop early Wednesday morning, ready
to cook his specialty - a vegetable omelet. When he mentioned to co-workers at
the midtown Manhattan bar and restaurant that he was the winner of the $100
million New Year's Eve Millennium Millions lottery, his boss was incredulous.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't believe him, even after he told me he had confirmed it," said
coffee shop manager Winston Willer. "But I told him, 'What are you doing here?
Go home."'
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Ely flashed his $100 million smile as he was introduced as the
winner of the largest jackpot in state history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am a happy, happy man," said the 66-year-old short order cook - make
that, ex-short order cook. That much was obvious as he joked with reporters at a
news conference held at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Opting for a lump sum cash payment, Ely won $44 million. After taxes, he
will receive a check for about $27 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Ely, who lives in the South Bronx with his wife of 35 years, Rosemary, a
nurse, didn't learn he was the sole first place winner of last Friday night's
drawing until Monday night. He was visiting friends in New Jersey and didn't
check his tickets until he heard that the winning ticket was still unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I checked the first ticket and nothing. Then the second ticket and - bingo,
bull's-eye - that was it," Ely said. But he didn't trust his aging eyes and
asked his son, Johnnie Jr., to check, too. Once he confirmed it, Ely said, "Like
a fool, I called the wife out."
</P>
<P>
	   "She put on her glasses, looked the numbers over and said, 'Sweetie, can I
retire now?"'
</P>
<P>
	   "You can retire," he told her. "Can I get a used car?" his son chimed in.
"Yes, you can," Ely calmly answered. He also has two grown daughters.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's cool, real cool to be able to do all the things you've always dreamed
about doing," he said. "But it's the kind of thing that now that you've got it,
you freeze."
</P>
<P>
	   Ely, who has worked for 35 years as a short order cook, spent $100 on
tickets over a month, including the two random quick pick tickets he picked up
the night before the drawing at a Manhattan check cashing store.
</P>
<P>
	   He also belonged to a pool with other workers from The Java Shop.
</P>
<P>
	   "It couldn't happen to a nicer guy," said waitress Hilda Purdy, now a former
co-worker. She said Ely used to call her "Cookie," and was always there with
fatherly advice. "If I could tell him one thing, I'd say, 'I'm glad for him. I
wish that money gives him all the happiness he's looking for."'
</P>
<P>
	   He is a regular lottery player, spending $5 a day on tickets. He's also had
many smaller wins. "I've won $1,300 three or four times, $500 to $600 a half a
dozen times and practically every week I win $25 or $30," he said. Despite his
windfall, he planned to keep on playing.
</P>
<P>
	   Ely said his unexpected early retirement has left him not really knowing
what to do. "I still wake up at 2:30 every day, only now I just look out the
window." He said he planned to take care of his extended family, including
helping several nieces and nephews through college, but beyond that he had no
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He called himself a simple, practical man who likes to fish in his spare
time, drink diet soda and eat lots of vegetables - not too crunchy. Asked what
he wanted for himself, Ely replied:
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't need nothing. As long as I keep the good health I've had through
the years, what else does a man really need?" Then, flashing that
million-megawatt smile again, he joked, "I mean, I'm a millionaire, right?
That's what this is all about, brother. I am a millionaire!"

<HEADLINE> FBI Misled Fired Nuclear Scientist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fired nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee was misled by federal
investigators who told him he'd failed a Department of Energy lie-detector test,
The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   During a long interrogation, FBI agents pressed Lee to confess passing
nuclear weapons secrets to China. Lee, however, denied that, insisted he was
telling the truth and was never told by his interrogators that DOE polygraph
operators had in fact given him a very high score for honesty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know why I fail,'' Lee told the FBI. ``But I do know I have not
done anything. ... I never give any classified information to Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Post obtained a transcript of the March 7 interrogation, which was
recorded by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said the questioning by the federal agents was highly
adversarial and ended only after Lee asked repeatedly to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, a 60-year-old Taiwan-born researcher, is being held without bail for
allegedly copying classified nuclear data to computer tapes, seven of which are
missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors deny their investigation was biased or unfair and
maintain that the FBI's skepticism about Lee's statements was justified because
he'd lied in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee has pleaded innocent to 59 counts under the Atomic Energy and Espionage
Acts. If convicted, the former employee of the Los Alamos National Laboratory
could face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Watters, Seahawks Ready To Go  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks think they belong in the playoffs. Now,
they want to prove it to the rest of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just because the situation isn't ideal, doesn't mean you shouldn't be happy
about the position you're in," tight end Christian Fauria said. "This is my
fifth year here and I never thought this would happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a 1-5 finish after an 8-2 start, the Seahawks won the franchise's
second AFC West championship to get into the playoffs for the first time in 11
seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   They'll face the wild-card Miami Dolphins, another 9-7 team, on Sunday in
what probably will be the final game in the Kingdome. Like the Seahawks, the
Dolphins dropped five of their last six.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Seahawks win, they'll play next at AFC East champion Indianapolis
(13-3), which has a bye this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't really matter how you get in," Fauria said. "People talk about
getting in the back door. So what? We still got in the house."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Holmgren, Seattle's first-year coach and general manager, and the
Seahawks snuck into the house while the rest of the division watched Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
	   After the New York Jets beat the Seahawks 19-9 last Sunday, Seattle got into
the playoffs when Joe Nedney kicked a field goal in overtime for Oakland to beat
the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Watters, held to 30 yards on nine carries in the loss to the Jets
because of a sprained right knee, returned to practice this week for the first
time in two weeks. He hopes to give young quarterback Jon Kitna a running game
against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   Watters, a six-time 1,000-yard rusher, is confident the Seahawks can rebound
and become the same team they were when they were 8-2.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is going to care that we lost to the Jets if we go in here and smack
Miami pretty good and we keep on going in the playoffs, especially if we win the
whole thing," Watters said. "No one is going to say that we played bad against
the Jets."
</P>
<P>
	   The Seahawks have played 176 regular-season games and have had two winning
seasons since their 1988 team, coached by Chuck Knox and with Dave Krieg at
quarterback, lost a playoff game to the Bengals 21-13. The Seahawks got only 22
yards rushing from Curt Warner and John L. Williams in that game, while Krieg
passed 50 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's game will be only the franchise's eighth in the postseason, but
with Holmgren's acumen and billionaire owner Paul Allen's money the Seahawks are
looking for a lot more playoff appearances. Allen will have a new outdoor
football stadium in Seattle for the 2002 season, and he's hopeful he will have a
team in the Super Bowl by then.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Seahawks are looking ahead optimistically, the Dolphins are a team
that might be facing major changes.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jimmy Johnson might step down after this season and Marino, 38, might
retire after his 17th NFL year. Johnson won a pair of Super Bowls in five
seasons in Dallas, but hasn't been able to win one with Marino in his four years
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Both have said they'll decide about their futures after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seattle, Marino will be facing a team that led the league with 30
interceptions this season, including five each by cornerbacks Shawn Springs and
Willie Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino faced the Seahawks in the playoffs as a rookie in 1983 and again in
1984. No quarterback in NFL history has completed more passes (4,967) for more
yards (61,361) and more touchdowns (420) than Marino.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a nerve injury in his right shoulder, Marino missed five starts
in the middle of the season and was replaced by backup Damon Huard. Marino has
thrown 17 interceptions, including 12 in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the Seahawks, the Dolphins see no reason why they can't turn their
season around in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no juggernaut like Denver last year," Dolphins guard Kevin
Donnalley said. "It's wide open. We think we've got as good a chance as
anybody."

<HEADLINE> Bills' Reed Stands By His Words  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills wide receiver Andre Reed promises
to be his old self today.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Wade Phillips "is looking for me to play 100 percent, and that's what
I'm going to do," Reed said as the Bills prepared to meet Tennessee in a
wild-card playoff game. "The bottom line is I'm going to go out and try to be
the best I can to help this team win. It's about winning, and that's all I want
to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, it was all about criticizing. Reed made disparaging
comments about the team on his Internet site Tuesday. His discouraging words
came only two days after he helped Buffalo beat Indianapolis 31-6 with five
receptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The catches moved him into second place on the NFL's career receptions list
with 945, behind only Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 49ers. But on Tuesday, it
didn't seem to matter to Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't just a happy moment for me, but also frustration," Reed wrote.
"The five balls that I did catch weren't even routes, and that just makes me
look bad, like they have to give me charity throws. They've just been throwing
me bones to keep me happy, but I'm not happy at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the franchise realizes that, and they know that I don't want to be
here anymore," Reed continued. "You look at the game Monday night with Jerry in
San Francisco. The 49ers still respect Jerry, and whether it was his last game
in that uniform or not, I think he went out the way he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here, they haven't given me that freedom and respect. I'm sure San
Francisco wouldn't do that to Jerry Rice. It'll be a chip on my shoulder for a
long, long time. I think I can start fresh somewhere else and offer a team
something next year and hopefully go out the way I want to."
</P>
<P>
	   When confronted Thursday about his remarks, Reed was not contrite.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to duck anything about how I feel about the situation this
year," he said. "People have their own feelings about things. Sometimes you
close your mouth so many times and it eats you up. And it's been eating me up
all year. I just said how I feel."
</P>
<P>
	   Reed, a 15-year veteran and likely Hall of Famer, said he has put the matter
behind him -- for now -- and is focusing on Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed's journal also included criticism of quarterback Doug Flutie, who was
replaced by Rob Johnson after starting the first 15 games of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "You may have heard that I am not on speaking terms with Doug Flutie," Reed
wrote. "Doug Flutie has changed as a person over one year."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie and Reed spoke to each other on Thursday and cleared the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no problem between Andre and I," Flutie said. "It never has been as
far as I was concerned."
</P>
<P>
	   Flutie said Reed apparently was upset because he thought Flutie had him
pulled from the Nov. 28 game at New England. Reed did not catch a pass and his
playing time was limited by the coaching staff because he suffered from a rib
injury the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was told during the New England game that he was hurt, that his ribs were
bothering him, and they put Peerless (Price) in," Flutie said. "I guess he was
under the impression that I went to the coaches, and that was the only thing he
indicated was bothering him."

<HEADLINE> Jackson Group Assails Rhodes Firing  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Alleging that racial discrimination may have played a role
in coach Ray Rhodes' firing, Jesse Jackson's civil rights group is criticizing
the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainbow Sports director Charles Farrell, who promotes sports opportunities
for minorities for the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, said he intends to outline his
concerns in a letter to the Packers next week. Jackson is the coalition's
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition also wants to meet with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue to
discuss the dismissal of Rhodes, who is black, and the league's work on minority
hiring for management and coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Tagliabue probably will attend a Jan. 14
coalition conference at which he has been invited to speak. NBA commissioner
David Stern, former Toronto Raptors general manager Isiah Thomas and former
National League president Len Coleman also are expected to participate. Farrell
hopes to meet with Tagliabue at that time in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes was fired Monday after the Packers finished 8-8 and missed the
playoffs for the first time in seven seasons. Rhodes completed just one year of
the four-year contract he signed a year ago to replace Mike Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
	   "Would a white coach have been dismissed with an 8-8 record?" Farrell said
Friday from his New York office. "Why hire a coach for four years and then
dismiss after one?"
</P>
<P>
	   Rhodes' firing after one .500 season was unexpected, but hardly
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Carroll, who is white, was also fired Monday after the New England
Patriots finished 8-8. Dennis Erickson, who is white, was fired last year by the
Seattle Seahawks after going 8-8 in three of his four seasons there.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Packers' abrupt dismissal of their entire coaching staff ended what
some considered an important first in NFL race relations. Rhodes' staff was the
first in league history to feature blacks in all three top positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Former offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis and defensive coordinator Emmitt
Thomas are black, as are four of the 11 position coaches -- receivers coach
Charlie Baggett, linebackers coach Johnny Holland, running backs coach Harry
Sydney and assistant defensive backs coach Lionel Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's heavy in terms of losing a head black coach and sidetracking head
coaching aspirations of two additional coaches," Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   General manager Ron Wolf declined comment. Team president Bob Harlan spent
the day in meetings and was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone messages for Rhodes and Lewis were not immediately returned, and
attempts to reach Jackson were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
	   When Wolf hired Rhodes a year ago, he insisted race played no part in the
selection. Rhodes had been fired days earlier by the Philadelphia Eagles after a
29-34-1 record over four seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue has been outspoken about football's need to hire coaches from a
more diverse ethnic pool, but the league has made little progress. There have
been just four black head coaches in league history.
</P>
<P>
	   Although approximately 70 percent of the NFL's players are black, only two
black head coaches remain -- Minnesota's Dennis Green and Tampa Bay's Tony
Dungy.
</P>
<P>
	   Art Shell, who had a 56-41 record in six seasons as the Raiders' coach, is
the only other black head coach in NFL history. There are no black general
managers in the league.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis and Thomas have been considered head-coaching candidates for years and
have been interviewed for various positions.
</P>
<P>
	   "(Being a coordinator) is the train to a head coaching position, and that
train has been sidetracked. It may even be derailed," Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, Holmgren's offensive coordinator in Green Bay for seven seasons
before taking the same job under Rhodes, has spoken publicly about his
frustrations with coaching opportunities -- but he didn't necessarily link them
to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Am I frustrated? Yes, but so are a lot of good assistant coaches around
this league who are white and black," Lewis said in a December interview. "I
don't know if the race issue has been a factor. I'd like to think it wasn't, but
you don't ever really know."

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Free agents Aaron Sele, Andy Benes and Juan Guzman have
picked the places where they want to pitch in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Sele, 38-20 for Texas the past two seasons, agreed to a $29 million,
four-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Benes, whose career slumped during two seasons with Arizona, returned to the
St. Louis Cardinals for an $18 million, three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Guzman, who finished strong for Cincinnati, got a two-year contract from
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Sele, whose deal was subject to him passing a physical, was 18-9 with a 4.79
ERA last year. The 29-year-old right-hander had narrowed his choices to Tampa
Bay and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   His deal calls for salaries of $7 million in each of the first three years
and $8 million in the fourth. The Orioles are deferring $2 million a year
without interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Benes was 18-10 on the Cardinals' NL Central championship team in 1996. He
left as a free agent after 1997 when general manager Walt Jocketty and Benes'
agent, Scott Boras, agreed to a five-year deal about 1 1/2 hours after the Dec.
7 deadline for players to re-sign. The contract was rejected by the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm thrilled to death to be coming back," Benes said. "I really felt in my
heart St. Louis is the place I want to be. The last couple years I've had on a
different color uniform, but my heart was in St. Louis."
</P>
<P>
	   Benes, 32, was 13-12 with a 4.81 ERA in 198 1-3 innings last year, winning
six of his last seven decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   His deal calls for a $2 million signing bonus that's payable from 2003-10,
$2.5 million this year and $6 million in the next two seasons. The contract has
a $6 million mutual option for 2002 with a $1.5 million buyout.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he can make $500,000 a year in performance bonuses if he has 34
starts and 230 innings.
</P>
<P>
	   Guzman, 33, was a combined 11-12 with a 3.74 ERA in 33 starts for Baltimore
and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay wanted a starting pitcher to replace Rolando Arrojo, traded last
month in a four-team deal that brought hard-hitting third baseman Vinny
Castilla. Guzman's contract includes a club option for a third year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Devil Rays, who also signed slugger Greg Vaughn last month, had pursued
free agent pitchers Sele and Steve Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
	   "Juan brings not only outstanding pitching credentials, but a tremendous
competitive spirit and the experience of pitching for championship ballclubs,"
general manager Chuck LaMar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other free agents found new homes Friday. Utilityman F.P. Santangelo
got a $1.6 million, two-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers, and right-hander
Brian Williams got a $600,000, one-year contract from the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim signed three second basemen, agreeing to a one-year contract with
Scott Spiezio and minor league contracts with Pat Kelly and Jason Bates.
</P>
<P>
	   Left-hander Norm Charlton decided to stay with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
agreeing to a minor league contract. He would get a $500,000, one-year deal if
he's added to the major league roster and the chance to earn $500,000 more in
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Six free agents who rejected salary arbitration offers from their former
teams faced a midnight EST deadline Saturday to re-sign: left-hander Chris Haney
(Cleveland), right-hander Omar Olivares (Oakland), right-hander Steve Trachsel
(Chicago Cubs), outfielder Shawon Dunston (New York Mets) and left-hander Darren
Oliver (St. Louis).
</P>
<P>
	   Five players eligible for salary arbitration agreed to one-year deals
Friday, including Los Angeles right-hander Darren Dreifort ($3.7 million),
Toronto left-hander Pedro Borbon ($800,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Also signed were three Cardinals: third baseman Craig Paquette ($595,000),
left-hander Paul Spoljaric ($550,000) and right-hander Mark Thompson ($400,000).
</P>
<P>
	   Approximately 107 players are eligible to file for arbitration by the Jan.
14 deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the San Francisco Giants acquired right-hander Ken Ray from the Kansas
City Royals to complete the Dec. 13 trade that sent right-hander Jerry Spradlin
to the Royals.
</P>
<P>
	   And Pete Incaviglia, who hit 206 home runs during several stops in the
majors, signed with the Nashua Pride of the independent Atlantic League.
</P>
<P>
	   The 35-year-old outfielder hit a combined .181 with one homer and 13 RBIs
last year while playing for the Triple-A teams of Arizona and Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   "He says his arm is feeling better than it ever has," newly picked Nashua
manager Butch Hobson said. "He can hit the ball a long way. He'll get some
standing ovations."

<HEADLINE> Rocker's Critics Demand His Release  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- John Rocker's critics say there's only one response to the
relief pitcher's "hate-filled heart" -- and it's not the psychological tests
ordered by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   They want the Atlanta Braves to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker's comments about immigrants, minorities and gays were bigotry, not an
off-the-cuff mistake or mental disorder, said Michael Langford, president of
Atlanta's United Youth-Adult Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "John Rocker is not crazy," he said. "His hateful remarks are not a result
of what is in his head but rather a result of a hate-filled heart."
</P>
<P>
	   Langford said the psychological evaluation, ordered Thursday by baseball
commissioner Bud Selig, is like "treating a cancer with an aspirin."
</P>
<P>
	   "We will not tolerate the intolerance of this ignorant redneck from
down-south Georgia," said the Rev. Gerald Durley of Concerned Black Clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said he fears for Rocker's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't want to be in the same county with him," Jones said Friday on
Atlanta radio station WSB-AM. "You don't come out and say things like that
without some people taking some extreme objection."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones and Braves pitcher Tom Glavine said Rocker would have a chance to
redeem himself with his teammates -- but only if he shows drastic changes in
attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   Glavine said he still was "as upset and aggravated as everybody else is
right now."
</P>
<P>
	   "If there's any way possible that he can make amends with the guys in the
clubhouse that he's obviously offended, and that includes everybody, then you go
from there," Glavine said in a television interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The tests reportedly were to begin Friday in Baltimore. Selig said he would
await the evaluation results before deciding on any discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner called Rocker's remarks in last month's Sports Illustrated
"reprehensible and completely inexcusable."
</P>
<P>
	   But the commissioner's decision was not nearly enough for leaders of about
20 advocacy groups who protested outside Turner Field. They said nothing short
of Rocker's release by the Braves would satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the kind of player we don't need in this city," said Atlanta City
Councilman Derrick Boazman, whose resolution condemning Rocker's remarks was
adopted by the council Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker's father said the outcry against his son has been far too harsh.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're saying worse things about John than they did about (Oklahoma City
bomber) Timothy McVeigh," Jake Rocker said in The Macon Telegraph on Friday.
"It's the worst assassination against a young man that I've ever seen. He needs
to be reprimanded, needs to be watched closely, but he needs to be given a
second chance."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker told Sports Illustrated he would never play for a New York team
because he didn't want to ride a train "next to some queer with AIDS." He also
said, "I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. ... How the hell did they get in
this country?" He called a black teammate a "fat monkey," mocked the driving
skills of Asian women and insulted single mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker apologized and said he was not a racist. His agent, Randy Hendricks,
said Thursday the reliever would not comment on baseball's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Braves president Stan Kasten said Rocker deserved a chance to repair his
relations with the team and fans. He and Braves general manager John Schuerholz
said they had spoken with Rocker, and the reliever seemed genuinely remorseful.
</P>
<P>
	   But the team's reaction struck Rocker's critics as hollow.
</P>
<P>
	   "He knew exactly what he was saying," said Jeff Graham, executive director
of Atlanta's AIDS Survival Project. "This was the exact image that Mr. Rocker
hoped to portray."
</P>
<P>
	   The rally at Turner Field drew about 40 people, mostly leaders of Atlanta
civic groups representing Asian-Americans, blacks, Hispanics, gays, Christians
and AIDS activists.
</P>
<P>
	   Langford said the groups would stage a fans' boycott if further action is
not taken before the baseball season begins in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, 25, saved 37 games for the Braves last year. He created a personal
rivalry with the city of New York during the NL Championship Series, calling
Mets fans "stupid" and accusing them of throwing batteries and insulting his
mother.

<HEADLINE> Woods Cruising To Another Win  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Ernie Els wanted a chance to play with Tiger Woods
early in the year, the perfect opportunity to see what the two-time U.S. Open
champion would have to do in order to challenge the No. 1 player in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The first meeting on Friday was a real eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
	   While Els put together a solid 3-under 70 under more blustery winds in Maui,
Woods seemed to be playing a different course -- certainly a different game --
in the second round of the Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods put himself halfway home to his fifth straight PGA Tour victory with a
7-under 66 -- eight strokes better than the average score Friday -- that gave
him a four-stroke lead over Els and left everyone else wondering whether Woods
had a pulse.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guy is kind of a freak, you know what I mean?" Els said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods drove the green on two par 4s and had four eagle putts for the second
round. While the trade winds continued to rage across the Plantation Course at
Kapalua, he missed only two greens and made his only bogey on a three-putt from
about 105 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   After two days, Woods was at 9-under 137 and on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
	   Jesper Parnevik made two double bogeys on the back nine for the second day
in a row, but this time it cost him. He had a 1-over 74 and was six strokes
behind at 143. Jeff Sluman (72) was another stroke back.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending champion David Duval continued to save his worst swings for the
par-5s and shot even-par 73, joining Tim Herron and Jim Furyk at 1-under 145. No
one else was under par through 36 holes, and not many had a realistic chance of
catching Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more you're in awe of him, the more you can't beat him," Stuart Appleby
said. "He has the potential to be the best player in the last 50 years, no doubt
about that. You could pat him on the back, but what's the point? He knows how
good he is."
</P>
<P>
	   No one since Ben Hogan in 1953 has fired off five straight victories. Woods
reached four at the American Express Championship in Valderrama to close out
last year, in which he became the first player in 25 years to win eight tour
events.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven weeks later, not much has changed. New season, same old story.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods, however, isn't thinking about his streak. As far as he's concerned,
it ended as soon as the PGA Tour ran out of official events in 1999. The streaks
of Hogan in 1948 and '53, and the record of 11 by Byron Nelson, all took place
in the same calendar year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The string is over," Woods said of his four straight victories to close out
the '99 season. "That was last year. This is a whole new year. I need a fresh
start. I need to move on and try to play good golf and improve my game."
</P>
<P>
	   For all the talk about a rivalry between Woods and Duval, or Woods and
Sergio Garcia, the player Woods has confronted more during his short career is
Els.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago in Thailand, Woods charged from eight strokes off the lead in
the final round of the Johnnie Walker to catch Els and beat him in a playoff.
Still stinging over that loss, Els returned the favor a month later by crushing
Woods in a 36-hole Sunday at Bay Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   Their last encounter was three months ago in Disney, where Els made a
crucial bogey on the back nine Sunday and lost by one.
</P>
<P>
	   Lately, Els concedes he isn't in the same league as Woods, or even Duval.
But he also views 2000 as a turning point in his career, a challenge to himself
that he can compete with the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Today might be as good a day as any to find out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like to beat him once," Els said. "Don't get me wrong -- I'm not out
there playing for second. But it's awfully tough playing a guy who's driving
onto greens that are 450 yards away."
</P>
<P>
	   Els exaggerated, but only slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods popped his driver a mere 398 yards to reach the green on the par-4
6th, then nailed another one on the 373-yard 11th hole that grazed Furyk's left
foot as he was lining up a putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tiger ... this guy is on fire," Els said. "He's got all the talent in the
world. What can you do? You've just got to stick to your guns. But he's got
bigger guns than I have. If he goes out there and shoots another two 66s,
there's no way we can get there.

<HEADLINE> Beckham Suspended for World Cup Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- David Beckham could have wound up in worst
shape. All he got for his latest violent kick was a one-game suspension and
$1,250 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Manchester United star was penalized Friday by FIFA, soccer's governing
body, for his actions in Thursday's 1-1 tie against Mexico's Necaxa in the first
World Cup Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson, ejected for protesting Beckham's
expulsion, also was suspended for one game and fined $3,125. The pair will miss
today's Group B game against Brazil's Vasco da Gama.
</P>
<P>
	   FIFA could have suspended Beckham for longer, but its disciplinary committee
decided not to.
</P>
<P>
	   Beckham also was ejected for a violent kick during England's second-round
loss to Argentina in the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Beckham nor Ferguson, who on Thursday said the expulsions were
"unfair," were immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sao Paulo, Real Madrid of Spain and Corinthians of Brazil (both 1-0-1)
played a 2-2 tie in the opener of Friday's Group A doubleheader. Nicolas Anelka
scored for Real Madrid in the 19th and 71st minutes, but Corinthians got goals
from Edilson in the 28th and 70th.
</P>
<P>
	   Corinthians goalkeeper Dida stopped a penalty kick by Anelka in the second
half after Fabio Luciano fouled Savio inside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
	   In the second game, Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr beat Morocco's Raja Casablanca
4-3 on Moussa Saib's 85th-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuad Al Amin, Ahmed Bahja, Fahad Al Husseini also scored for Al-Nassr (1-1).
Omar Nejjary, Bouchaib El Moubarki and Talal El Karkouri scored for Raja (0-2).

</P>
<P>
	   In the Americans' first game since their World Cup stars began a boycott
over wages, they beat the Czech Republic 8-1 Friday in the opener of the
four-nation Australia Cup.
</P>
<P>

wouldn't appear unless they U.S. Soccer Federation agreed to higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The 18 women on the U.S. roster had combined for just one previous
international goal.
</P>
<P>

from Kester, beating goalkeeper Zuzana Pincova. Susan Bush made it 2-0 in the
17th minute, and Nikki Serlenga scored in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Utah City Prepares for Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- John Aalberg has a full plate this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	As manager of the Soldier Hollow venue that will stage the cross country and
biathlon events during the 2002 Winter Olympics, he's got lots to monitor during
the U.S. cross country championships.
</P>
<P>
	``We're testing the flow of people,'' said Aalberg, a U.S. Olympic skier in
1992 and `94. ``We're asking the athletes how they like the course of the trail.
There are so many little things. It's a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
	The Nordic skiing event that begins today is part of a big Olympic weekend in
the Park City area.
</P>
<P>
	There's also a World Cup freestyle skiing competition and U.S. championships in
the so-called ``sliding'' sports of bobsled, luge and skeleton, which is sort of
a face-first version of luge.
</P>
<P>
	With the Winter Games 25 months away, the competitions represent the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee's first major events at three important Olympic venues.
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big reason we do these test events,'' said Herwig Demschar, SLOC's
director of Alpine sports. ``You can't just pull the Olympic Games out of your
pocket.''
</P>
<P>
	World Cup skiing races in the super-G and slalom were scheduled for Park City
in November but that event was moved to Colorado because of a lack of snow in
Utah.
</P>
<P>
	Now there's plenty of snow, setting the stage for another try.
</P>
<P>
	At Deer Valley Resort, the freestyle skiing World Cup runs today and Sunday.
Skiers will pound the moguls one day and perform daring aerials the next.
</P>
<P>
	At the largest Olympic venue, the expansive Soldier Hollow, some 400 Nordic
skiers will trek over trails carved through the woods near Midway. The event
runs through Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
	At the Utah Winter Sports Park, the frozen track that winds down Bear Hollow
gets a big test as American titles are decided in bobsled, luge and skeleton.
</P>
<P>
	In skeleton, athletes race alone down the course face first, their chins only
inches above the ice at speeds up to 80 mph. Skeleton, dropped in the early
1900s as an Olympic sport, returns in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	Duncan Kennedy, America's most successful singles luger and a television
commentator for this week's events, said it's significant to stage all three
sliding sports simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge event for everybody involved,'' Kennedy said. ``Whether they
can pull it off, we'll see, but it's a great experiment. We're really setting a
footprint for the future.''
</P>
<P>
	The Paralympic Games, which will run in March 2002 after the Olympics, also had
a preview this week with the Huntsman Cup for disabled skiers at Park City
Mountain Resort.
</P>
<P>
	After months of planning and construction, the three venues are largely
finished. However, officials will work out of trailers until buildings go up at
Soldier Hollow at the Winter Sports Park.
</P>
<P>
	Other facilities, such as parking lots, remain unfinished.
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't really done much to publicize the sliding events because we still
don't have enough parking,'' said Wendy Watkins, a clerk at the Winter Sports
Park.
</P>
<P>
	It was a mass of frenzied voices inside the Winter Sports Park's main trailer
Friday, as a stream of bobsledders, lugers and skeleton racers and officials
checked in.
</P>
<P>
	At each site, the people in charge were eager to start.
</P>
<P>
	``We've done our homework,'' said Jeff Chumas, who will oversee the freestyle
events. ``I just really look forward to these next couple of days and certainly
the next couple of years.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Johnson New Ill. State Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NORMAL, Ill. (AP) -- As football coaching jobs go, Denver Johnson is walking
into a pretty good situation at Illinois State.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of taking over a struggling program, Johnson is inheriting a team
that had one of the best seasons in school history last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Redbirds already play a style of football similar to his own, so he
won't have to teach totally new schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   About the only downside, Johnson said, is that expectations tend to be
higher for coaches taking over successful teams. But he thinks there is plenty
of opportunity to exceed recent achievements.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think there is a tremendous amount of unrealized potential here," Johnson
said as he was introduced as coach Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson left Murray State, where he had a 21-12 record in three years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Denver knows the complexities of what it takes to be a successful head
coach because he's been one," Perk Weisenburger, ISU athletics director, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson, 41, replaces Todd Berry, who left at the end of the season to take
the top job at Army. Berry rebuilt Illinois State football, leading the Redbirds
to the Gateway Conference title this season and an 11-3 record, losing to
Georgia Southern 28-17 in the I-AA semifinals.
</P>
<P>
	   Berry was voted the league's coach of the year. His overall record at the
school was 24-24 in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the horizon has broadened and the future is bright for Illinois
State football," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Berry left behind a program that's in good shape with young players
and plenty of momentum. Johnson, who coached with Berry at Tennessee-Martin,
said they follow similar coaching philosophies, and he doesn't expect to make
many changes on either side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a fan sitting in the stands, I don't think you'll notice any drastic
changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   First on the agenda, Johnson said, is recruiting. He said he will contact
the two high school seniors who have already committed to ISU and then begin
working on other recruits. But he said he must begin building relationships with
returning players immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first recruiting job I feel like I have to do right now is with the
young men already in this program," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson played on the offensive line at the University of Tulsa, then spent
four seasons in professional football. His first full-time coaching job was at
Tennessee-Martin, and he later coached at Oklahoma State and Mississippi State.
He spent one year at Oklahoma before taking over at Murray State in 1997.

	   Paul Coffey talked. Jeff O'Neill listened -- and scored.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neill had two third-period goals as the Carolina Hurricanes rallied to tie
visiting Anaheim 4-4 on Friday night, the franchise's first four-goal comeback
since 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   "Between the second and third periods, Paul Coffey motivated the troops,"
said O'Neill, who drew Carolina within two 36 seconds into the third off an
assist from Coffey.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neill made it 4-3 midway through the period with his 14th goal, and Glen
Wesley tied it with 7:27 left. Coffey, the highest-scoring defenseman in NHL
history, also assisted on Wesley's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In other NHL games, it was Pittsburgh 5, Toronto 2; Vancouver 3, Dallas 1;
Edmonton 5, Tampa Bay 1; and Colorado 4, Montreal 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrei Kovalenko began the rally -- the Hurricanes franchise's first
four-goal comeback since the Hartford Whalers tied Montreal 5-5 on March 19,
1980 -- late in the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was a big character point," Carolina coach Paul Maurice said. "It's
going to have some long-lasting affects in that room."
</P>
<P>
	   Teemu Selanne had a first-period goal, and Marty McInnis, Jim McKenzie and
Jeff Nielsen scored in a 6 1/2-minute span of the second period to give Anaheim
a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's ridiculous what happened," Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg said. "Guys
stopped working. Some guys didn't. Some guys stuck with it, but a lot of guys we
count heavily on just shut it down."
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim is 0-4-1 in its last five.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexei Kovalev scored a short-handed goal in the second period as Pittsburgh
beat visiting Toronto to give Herb Brooks his 200th NHL coaching victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks, 10-4 since replacing Kevin Constantine on Dec. 9, has a career
record of 200-202-61 with the New York Rangers, Minnesota, New Jersey and
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   Darius Kasparaitis, Michal Rozsival, Jan Hrdina and Martin Straka also
scored for Pittsburgh. Dimitri Yushkevich and Jonas Hoglund scored for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Brashear scored the go-ahead goal with 7:03 left in Vancouver's
victory in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Bertuzzi and Alexander Mogilny also had third-period goals, and Garth
Snow made 31 saves to help the Canucks win for only the third time in their last
19 games (3-12-4).
</P>
<P>
	   Kirk Muller scored for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tommy Salo stopped Mike Sillinger on a penalty shot in the second period as
Edmonton beat Tampa Bay, extending the Lightning's winless streak to 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Marchant, Ryan Smyth, Rem Murray, Ethan Moreau and Bill Guerin scored
goals, and Mike Grier matched his career high with three assists to help the
Oilers improve to 5-0-3 in their last eight home games. Fredrik Modin scored for
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan Hejduk scored two goals late in the second period and former Montreal
goalie Patrick Roy made 22 saves for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Dingman and Adam Deadmarsh added goals, and Peter Forsberg had three
assists to help Colorado extend its unbeaten streak to a season-best five games
(4-0-1). Eric Weinrich scored for visiting Montreal.

	   Break up the Bulls!
</P>
<P>
	   Better yet, break up the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   The worst team in the NBA finally put together its first two-game winning
streak of the season Friday night, beating Washington 110-103 just two nights
after defeating the Wizards in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   "They haven't scored 100 points all year and they went and scored 110
tonight. I don't know who is the worst team, them or us," Washington coach Gar
Heard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Toni Kukoc, in his second game back after missing most of the season with
back spasms, led the Bulls with 33 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, the Lakers defeated Charlotte 87-83, Vancouver beat New Jersey
101-91, Phoenix routed San Antonio 102-83, Atlanta beat Toronto 105-97, New York
defeated Orlando 94-86 and Boston beat Sacramento 101-93.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago gained its first road victory of the season after 15 consecutive
losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards held several 10-point leads in the first half and had an
11-point advantage early in the third quarter before Kukoc and B.J. Armstrong
sparked the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong scored 10 of his 14 points in the third quarter as the Bulls
rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to take a 77-73 lead heading into the
final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc scored 10 in the fourth quarter, including a jumper with one second
left on the shot clock and 2:45 left in the game for a 101-90 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We probably can't go lower than this," Washington guard Rod Strickland
said. "We can't help but take the heat for this one. This is not good."
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice's 3-pointer against his former teammates gave Los Angeles its
first lead with 2:36 left and the Lakers went on to their 13th consecutive win.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal had 23 points and 16 rebounds as the Lakers rallied in the
fourth quarter and overcame a 34 percent shooting night at home to win for the
20th time in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Derrick Coleman had 17 points for Charlotte, including the 10,000th of his
career, and David Wesley and Bobby Phills added 17 points each.
</P>
<P>
	   At East Rutherford, N.J., Michael Dickerson scored 28 points as Vancouver
won its second road game in four nights.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Bibby finished with 20 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, Shareef
Abdur-Rahim had 19 points and Othella Harrington added 16 points and 12
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies, who won just one of their first 13 road games, improved to
4-6 overall and 2-4 on the road since Lionel Hollins took over as coach on Dec.
16. They beat the Heat in Miami earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies also snapped New Jersey's home winning streak at nine games.
New Jersey hadn't lost at the Meadowlands since Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   At Phoenix, David Robinson had 24 points and nine rebounds and Tim Duncan
had 19 points and 15 boards as San Antonio routed Phoenix for the Suns' worst
loss in Scott Skiles' 11 games as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio, which had lost two in a row and five of eight, built a 22-point
lead in a dominating third quarter and coasted in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs were 13-for-13 at the foul line in the third quarter, while the
Suns were 0-for-2.
</P>
<P>
	   At Atlanta, Jim Jackson scored 22 of his 31 points in the second half as the
Hawks snapped a season-high five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Isaiah Rider added 27 points, 20 in the first half, and Alan Henderson had
19 for the Hawks, who played their third game in a row with Stan Albeck handling
the coaching duties for Lenny Wilkens, who has the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   Vince Carter broke out of a mini-slump and had 34 points for the Raptors,
who erased a 17-point lead and went in front 82-81 on two free throws by Carter
with 6:28 left in the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Johnson's basket from the top of the key with 6:10 to play gave the
Hawks the lead for good, 83-82.
</P>
<P>
	   At Orlando, Allan Houston scored 23 points and Latrell Sprewell had 19 as
New York won its third in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Ewing had 18 points, nine rebounds and three blocks, while reserve
Kurt Thomas finished with 10 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss was the sixth in seven games for Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   At Boston, Kenny Anderson hit his only 3-pointer with two minutes left after
Nick Anderson's long-range shots kept bringing Sacramento back.
</P>
<P>

Antoine Walker's 17 and Vitaly Potapenko's 16.

<HEADLINE> Veteran DE Thomas Inspires Colts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Defensive end Mark Thomas hopes to give his team a
little inspiration as the Indianapolis Colts prepare for their first-ever
playoff game in the RCA Dome.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas said he'll bring the Super Bowl championship ring he won as a member
of the 1994 San Francisco 49ers to practice next week and show it to his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
	   "It might not come out until the (next) weekend, maybe Saturday night in the
hotel," Thomas said Friday after the Colts completed their second day of
practice since they ended the regular season with a 31-6 loss at Buffalo on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts, who won't know their AFC semifinal opponent until Sunday, have
the weekend off and start serious preparations for their Jan. 16 date against
either Seattle, Buffalo or Tennessee. Indianapolis will play Seattle if it
defeats Miami. If the Dolphins win that game, the Colts will take on the winner
of Saturday's wild-card game between Buffalo and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts haven't concentrated on a possible opponent during the past two
days of practice.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest thing was just fundamentals and techniques. The last two weeks
we haven't done a good job on the little things," Thomas said. "In this game,
the little things will wind up being big things that get you beat and send you
home."
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, a reserve for most of the season, is the only member of the team who
has experienced the jubilation of winning the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just know for me, when I was in San Francisco before we had won ... coach
(George) Seifert to one of the meetings brought in the Super Bowl trophy, sat it
down, and said this is what we're fighting for," Thomas said. "For me,
personally, it really affected me because it was the first time I got to see it.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you see something tangible, you realize this is what you're going for.
It just makes it more real. For me, it really made a difference."
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the Colts players will be in the playoffs for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of guys on this team that are young, a lot of guys that may
not have even seen a Super Bowl ring. I think it can be a good source of
motivation," Thomas said. "I don't think it is necessarily going to be the thing
that puts us over the edge, but I think anything you can do to help get an edge,
can only help."
</P>
<P>
	   The Colts were uncertain if linebacker Cornelius Bennett, who led the team
in tackles with 114, will be ready to play in the AFC semifinal after injuring
his left knee Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope he can come back. We need him. He's obviously a good player, and a
good leader. Any time we can get him on the field, even if he can only play
sparingly it will be a great thing," Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The game will be the first home playoff game for the Colts, who produced the
biggest turnaround in NFL history by finishing 13-3 after going 3-13 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "This (first-round) bye definitely has helped us. Hopefully, guys have taken
this week to focus on what they need to do to get better and to improve on our
past two performances," Thomas said. "We're going to come in next week, know who
we're going to play and be ready to go to work."

	   Cowboys safety George Teague said there are no easy answers for the Cowboys
(8-8) when they visit the Minnesota Vikings (10-6) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the guys will beat you deep and quick and fast, or take the other
guy and die slowly," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Safety Darren Woodson said blitzing isn't the answer, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to take your chances. I know teams that really get after them take
chances every once in a while and put pressure on Jeff George. But sometimes you
get burned by that pressure," Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because nobody is better at exploiting 1-on-1 matchups than Moss, and nobody
is better at third-down underneath routes than Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys have more to worry about than just Moss and Carter, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to double-team Randy Moss and Cris Carter when you have a healthy
Robert Smith because he can take it the distance," Woodson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith didn't play the last time these teams met, on Nov. 8, because he was
out after undergoing a double hernia operation. He still topped 1,000 yards
rushing for the third straight year despite missing four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Without a healthy Deion Sanders to cover Moss or Carter, the Vikings have
had no problem torching the Cowboys' secondary in their last two meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanders hopes things will be different Sunday now that he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   "But even if you had Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes, I don't know if you'd
have enough talent to match up with those guys," Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss caught three touchdown passes totaling 163 yards and Carter had seven
catches for 135 yards as Minnesota beat Dallas 46-36 on Thanksgiving 1998.
Sanders missed that game with a toe injury.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the NFL's most productive tandem combined for 15 catches, three
touchdowns and 207 yards as the Vikings scored the final 27 points after falling
behind 17-0. Sanders, the NFL's best cover cornerback, limped through the game
with hamstring and groin problems.
</P>
<P>
	   While fans would love to see Sanders and Moss go head-to-head on every snap,
Dallas coaches will mix up their coverages to avoid being predictable.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're talking about something that's on everybody's wish list but
doesn't really happen," Gailey said of the Sanders-Moss matchup. "I know if I
was just a fan out there watching the game, that's one you'd like to see.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's one of those situations if it happens during the course of the game,
you'll enjoy watching it. If it doesn't happen, then it'll be one of those
things we'd wish we would have seen."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 15 times Sanders lined up against Moss two months ago, Jeff George
went that way only twice. The matchup was a draw as Sanders knocked down a long
pass and Moss had an 8-yard catch.
</P>
<P>
	   "Deion's unbelievable," George said. "When he's not healthy, he's
unbelievable. Just his presence on the field is unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
	   "But that doesn't mean you shy away from the guy. We have every bit of
confidence in our receivers and our running game."
</P>
<P>
	   The Cowboys with they could say the same about their banged-up secondary.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kevin Mathis looks to be a little closer than Kevin Smith at this point,"
Gailey said after both cornerbacks practiced Friday. "But we'll wait until game
day to make a decision on both guys."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has missed the last two games with a strained right hamstring. Mathis
has been out three weeks with a sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith would be the first option to start at left cornerback, then Mathis. If
neither is available, Charlie Williams would start for the third straight week.
</P>
<P>
	   So, what's the answer to containing Moss and Carter?
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish our offense would let that clock tick down to the last second before
we snap every ball," Sanders said, "because the more you keep those guys off the
field, the less opportunities they have."

Anti-Castro Lawmaker Subpoenas Cuban Boy

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- In efforts to prevent Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, an
anti-Castro lawmaker subpoenaed him Friday to testify before a congressional
committee and one of his Miami relatives sought to become his legal guardian.
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said he subpoenaed 6-year-old Elian to testify before
the Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10, so he remains in the country
while the courts consider his case. Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to
an inner tube at sea after his mother, stepfather and eight other people drowned
while trying to reach Florida by boat. The boy was placed with family in Miami.

announced Friday came as Russian commanders indicated that a scaling-back of the

surplus the U.S. might not have. Bush retorted that his plan was more generous
than McCain's for lower income taxpayers and added firmly: "There is enough
money to take care of Social Security. There is enough money to take care of the
basic services of government, and there is enough money to give the people a
substantial tax cut. And that's what I intend to do."

Life Cereal To Revive Mikey Ads

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Life cereal is bringing back Mikey, the character made
famous in the 1970s commercial. The Mikey ad campaign is being relaunched, 28
years after its debut, with an all-adult cast. The lines are the same, and so is
the shtick. Only the actors playing Mikey and his breakfast mates are new. In
the original ad, which aired from 1972-84, two kids share their suspicion of a
cereal that's "sposed ta be good for ya." They decide to test it out on their
kid brother Mikey, because "he hates everything." But pudgy-faced Mikey, who
never utters a word, takes to it, prompting the famous lines: "He likes it! Hey,
Mikey!" The new commercial is to be launched Jan. 17 and run through June.

<HEADLINE> Former Soccer Star Maradona Ailing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) -- Former soccer star Diego Maradona has a
serious heart condition and will remain hospitalized for about a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona, who tested positive for cocaine after he was hospitalized this
week, was in intensive care on Tuesday after doctors diagnosed him with high
blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   He was moved to a regular hospital room on Thursday after improving.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have detected a severe heart pathology," Dr. Frank Torres said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said he consulted with Maradona's personal physician, who said the
condition had not been detected in previous checkups.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Alfredo Cae, Maradona's personal doctor, described the former star's
condition as "delicate." Cae said he did not think Maradona's condition was
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
	   Torres said Uruguayan police will continue their investigation into
Maradona's case after blood and urine samples taken from the star on Wednesday
revealed heavy traces of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona has not been questioned in the case, although his manager,
Guillermo Coppola, and a friend, Pablo Consentino, have been queried by
Uruguayan authorities. Police have also searched the summer home where Maradona
was staying.
</P>
<P>
	   An admitted cocaine addict, Maradona was twice banned from international
competition after testing positive for drug use. A positive test for cocaine in
1991 prompted a 15-month suspension from the Italian League and a positive test
for stimulants during the 1994 World Cup led to a 15-month suspension by FIFA.

<HEADLINE> Report: Japan To Develop Nuke Robot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan will develop a robot that can clean up radioactive leaks
like the one that killed a worker last year in the nation's worst nuclear
accident, a news report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ministry of Trade and Industry plans to team up with several companies
to develop the robot, which would spare humans the dangerous task of controlling
leaks at nuclear plants, Kyodo News agency reported. Ministry officials were
unavailable for comment over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Several workers were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation when they
dealt with an accident in September at a uranium-reprocessing facility in
Tokaimura, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   A worker who was among those who triggered the disaster by using too much
uranium to make fuel died last month from radiation sickness. Two other workers
remain in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The leak exposed at least 92 other people to less serious doses of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget for the robot is equivalent to $29 million, and the government
hopes to complete the project by 2001, Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Objects to 'Anna and King'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- After banning "Anna and The King" within its
borders, Thailand is taking its objections to the film overseas, instructing its
embassies to explain to the world why it sees the movie as a distortion of
history.
</P>
<P>
	   New guidelines issued to Thai embassies by the country's Foreign Ministry
were published Saturday in the newspaper the Nation. Thai censors decided the
film denigrates a beloved 19th-century monarch, King Mongkut, by portraying him
as being under the sway of teacher Anna Leonowens, who taught English to the
king's children.
</P>
<P>
	   "The film attributes part of Thailand's success to Anna Leonowens, whom it
believes belongs to a superior race, while she was in fact an individual of
doubtful origin and could have even been half-Indian," said the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministry, like the censors, found the film offensive and said it wrongly
portraying the king of Siam -- as Thailand was then known -- as barbaric,
senseless and irrational.
</P>
<P>
	   The measures highlight deep feelings in Thailand against the film, which was
made by 20th Century Fox and stars Oscar-winner Jodie Foster and action hero
Chow Yun-fat.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox has decided not to appeal the censor board's ruling against the film
last month, saying there is no chance it could be reversed.
</P>

William Andrew Bates
</P>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- William ``Bill'' Andrew Bates, a Kansas City
television pioneer and former WDAF-TV general manager, died Thursday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates began his broadcasting career in 1937 at KWOC radio in Poplar Bluff.
Four years later, he joined WDAF radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Bates helped turn WDAF into Kansas City's first commercial TV station in
1949 and later served as manager until 1964. He later headed Mid-America

William Butterfield Decker
</P>
<P>
	   ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) -- William Butterfield Decker, a novelist and former New
York editor, died Thursday of complication from a stroke. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Decker moved to New York in 1959 and began his career in the publishing
industry at McGraw-Hill. He later became an executive editor at Viking Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Decker edited such authors as Earnest Gaines (``The Autobiography of Miss
Jane Pittman''), Larry McMurtry (``The Last Picture Show''), and Pulitzer
prize-winner Wallace Stegner.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote two novels: ``To Be A Man'' in 1967, which The New York Times named
one of the 10 best novels of the year, and ``Holdout'' in 1979, which won the

Makhmud Esambayev
</P>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Makhmud Esambayev, a renowned Chechen dancer who thrilled
audiences in the Soviet Union for decades, died Friday at 75, the news agency
ITAR-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, citing information from a Chechen cultural society, said
Esambayev died in Moscow of an unspecified ailment.
</P>
<P>
	   Esambayev studied music and choreography in the Chechen capital of Grozny
and made his first public appearance at age 14 with the republic's dramatic
theater and philharmonic orchestra.
</P>
<P>
	   Esambayev founded the Premier Ballet Theater in Moscow and won some of the
Soviet Union's top honors, including being named a Hero of Socialist Labor.
Jerome Goldstein
</P>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Jerome Goldstein, who began selling Scott's Liquid Gold
furniture polish from his garage and turned it into a nationally known brand,
died Wednesday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein developed large-cell lymphoma about seven years ago and was
aggressively fighting the disease until a few weeks ago when his condition
worsened, said his son Mark, who succeeded his father as president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein's mother, Ida, acquired the Scott's Liquid Gold business from
door-to-door salesmen in 1951. She bought it for her three boys as something for
them to do, said Mark Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was Jerome Goldstein who began mixing the formula in his mother's
garage and making sales calls with the polish to Colorado mountain towns.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the company added aerosol air fresheners and in 1991 developed a
line of facial skin-care items containing alpha hydroxy acids.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a tough guy, with a never-say-die attitude,'' Mark Goldstein said.
``He was a great teacher and he was a lot of fun.''
Thomas J. MacBride
</P>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Thomas J. MacBride, the former state assemblyman and
federal judge who presided over the trial of Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme, died
Thursday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   MacBride was appointed to the U.S. District Court by President Kennedy in
1961 and later became chief judge of the Eastern District of California. He
transferred to senior status, a form of semi-retirement, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   MacBride was best known for presiding over the dramatic trial of Fromme, a
follower of Charles Manson who was convicted of attempting to kill President
Ford in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   MacBride served in the Assembly from 1955 until 1960.
Don Martin
</P>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Don Martin, the Mad magazine cartoonist whose hapless
characters met frying-pan-in-the-face fates punctuated by wacky sounds like
SHAGLOMP! and SHKLIP!, died Thursday of cancer. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
	   His jokes prompted the magazine to dub him ``Mad's Maddest Cartoonist.''
</P>
<P>
	   Martin's cartoons had a vocabulary all their own. ``SHKLIP'' was the sound
made when construction workers tossed concrete at each other. ``SPLOP''
described a surgeon throwing body parts into a doggie bag. ``FAGROON'' came from
a collapsing skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin left Mad magazine in 1987 after a falling-out with its publisher, the
late William Gaines, and accepted a job at Cracked, a competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   His paperbacks of cartoons not published in the magazine sold more than 7
million copies.
Alex Pitcher
</P>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Alex Pitcher, a civil rights leader who helped prepare
legal briefs for the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education,
died Thursday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitcher was named president of the San Francisco chapter of the NAACP in
1994.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked with Thurgood Marshall, then chief attorney for the NAACP, and in
1954, he helped Marshall prepare the briefs that helped determine the decision
in the historic school desegregation case.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court ruled that separating public schools in Topeka, Kan., by
race was inherently unequal. The ruling resulted in the desegregation of school
systems nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitcher moved to San Francisco in 1963 and continued his civil rights work.
Harald Hermann Rossi
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Harald Hermann Rossi, a biophysicist who developed an
innovative use of radiation to track its effects on living things, died Jan. 1
at his home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossi developed what became known as microdosimetry, which measures the
microscopic distributions of energy for different types of radiation. Those
measurements are important factors in radiation therapy and radiation
protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossi designed many instruments now used in radiation measurement, including
the proportional counter, which measures the energy deposited by radiation in
microscopic sites like cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Vienna, Rossi came to the United States in 1939, and completed his
doctorate in physics at Johns Hopkins before joining the department of
radiological research at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in 1946. He was a
professor of radiation oncology at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at
Columbia University until he formally retired in 1987 and took emeritus status.
Robert McG. Thomas
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert McGill Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times
whose obituaries moved readers to tears and laughter, died from abdominal cancer
Thursday at his family's summer home in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas began writing obituaries full time in 1995 after serving as a police
reporter, a rewrite man, a society news reporter and a sports writer. He was
credited with using a fresh approach to writing obituaries, finding key details
to illuminate lives that might otherwise have been overlooked or underreported.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people he chronicled were Johnny Sylvester, who died in 1990, 64
years after he came to fame as a bedridden boy who inspired Babe Ruth; Douglas
``Wrong Way'' Corrigan, who took off from New York for California in 1938, and
landed his small plane in Dublin some 28 hours later; and Edward Lowe, a sawdust
merchant from Cassopolis, Mich., who found a new use for kiln-dried granulated
clay he had been selling as sop for grease spills, a product eventually named
and marketed as Kitty Litter.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Shelbyville, Tenn., Thomas went to Yale University, where he worked
on the student newspaper and flunked out as a result of a decision, he said,
``to major in New York rather than anything academic.''
</P>
<P>
	   After joining the Times as a copyboy in 1959, Thomas spent the next four
decades in a variety of reporting assignments, often prowling police stations
and working the phones in the late hours to produce fast-breaking stories.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, who had a home in Manhattan, is survived by his wife, Joan, two
sons, a sister and two grandchildren.
James W. Walter
</P>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- James W. Walter, founder of a leading home builder and
industrial company, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter's Tampa-based business, Jim Walter Homes, sold and financed more than
330,000 single-family houses in 24 states.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, later under the names Jim Walter Corp. and Walter Industries,
diversified into coal mining, paper distribution and aluminum products, becoming
one of the 200 largest industrial companies in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Man Swallowed 55 Crack Pipes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) -- A Florida man who swallowed 55 small glass pipes used
to smoke cocaine was recovering after surgeons removed the paraphernalia from
his stomach, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At first, I thought it was vials of powder cocaine. Then I realized it was
crack pipes, and when I saw how many there were, I really couldn't believe it,''
Brunswick police investigator Alison Drawdy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges were immediately filed against the 35-year-old Jacksonville man,
who went to an emergency room Tuesday complaining of severe abdominal cramps,
heartburn and indigestion.
</P>
<P>
	   He apparently swallowed the pipes while high on crack and did not realize
what he was doing, Ms. Drawdy said. The glass tubes ranged up to 4 1/2-inches
long and a quarter-inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said that he had ingested them over a couple months, and that it's been
three months since he ate the last one,'' Ms. Drawdy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Information about the man's condition was not released by Southeast Georgia
Regional Medical Center.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmaker Subpoenaes Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker has subpoenaed Elian Gonzalez to testify
before Congress in a bid to keep him in the United States for at least another
month while courts decide whether the 6-year-old should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The subpoena was announced Friday night by Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana hours
after one of Elian's Miami relatives took the first step toward becoming the
boy's legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged by Burton's attempt to keep his son
from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What right does that man have?'' a red-eyed Juan Miguel Gonzalez said in
his hometown of Cardenas, where many wept during a rally for Elian. ``I am the
father of Elian and immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   The developments are the latest in a remarkable international custody battle
that has dominated headlines for weeks. Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day
clinging to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned
attempting to reach the United States. Two other adults also survived.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Wednesday that
Elian should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14, sparking protests in Miami and
celebrations in Cuba, where Fidel Castro has led the call for Elian's return.
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have both indicated support of
the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came Burton's announcement that Elian would testify before the
Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10 so he can remain in the country while
the courts consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered Friday night as Elian -- holding the subpoena
in front of his face while being held aloft -- appeared outside the house where
he has been staying with relatives. Urged by relatives, he gave the peace sign
before heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said the news rejuvenated Elian's Miami
relatives, who have spent much of the last two months dealing with the
international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They feel relaxed,'' Gutierrez said. ``I believe they're going to have a
good night's rest tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, the committee's chairman, said he ``issued a subpoena to Elian
Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the Florida State
court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law named for him
and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against the
communist nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it is
unlikely that Elian's actual appearance will be sought in Washington next month.
There was no response to phone messages left with the INS in Washington late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers filed a petition asking that Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that would allow him to seek
asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week. They were expected to meet today with
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has
INS oversight. Smith said there should be an inquiry into whether Elian's
constitutional rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo,
accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to
appeal directly to Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked Clinton to reverse the INS
order.	   Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and the
state court action.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protests in Miami were much calmer Friday. About 100 people marched in front of
the federal building in Orlando, waving Cuban and American flags and chanting
``Cuba libre'' and ``long live the USA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters planned a demonstration in Little Havana today and were planning
to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rise in crime really a product of cooked books  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the New York Police Department, where crime
statistics can make or break a supervisor's career, the numbers from one
Brooklyn precinct were alarming: a 19 percent jump in crime last year.
<P>
	   But it wasn't just the current head of the 88th Precinct who suffered for
the increase. His predecessor, police acknowledged Friday, had underreported
crime figures from the year before, creating the apparent crime wave in the Fort
Greene section.
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Charles F. Dowd, who was promoted because of his work in the 88th
Precinct, was transferred out of his new job and denied an expected promotion
when the skewed numbers became public knowledge. The New York Times first
reported the discrepancy on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite suspicions about Dowd's record-keeping, his successor, Capt. James
Guida, also lost his command amid concerns that crime in the precinct remained
too high. Guida is to be transferred out of the 88th Precinct, published reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
	   According to The Times, at least five police commanders have been questioned
about the veracity of their statistics since 1996. The use of crime statistics
in planning police activity is one factor in the dramatic drop-off in the city
crime rate, which is now at a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd apparently misclassified felony cases as less-important misdemeanor
cases. The result: robberies were down from 606 in 1997 to 399 in 1998; assaults
were down from 263 to 188; grand theft was down from 292 to 207.
</P>
<P>
	   When the numbers went up in 1999, Guida appeared in trouble. Robberies
appeared to jump from 399 to 470, assaults went from 188 to 195, and grand theft
increased from 207 to 326. An internal police audit turned up the reason for the
shocking increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Dowd, who kept his captain's rank, was never charged with any wrongdoing. He
is now in a non-command job at a Queens precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who initially told The Times that Dowd
"was dumped because he was playing with the statistics," later said that Dowd
had not willfully misled the department.

   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- A top Armenian television executive has been charged
with helping organize an attack in parliament that killed Armenia's premier and
seven other top officials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vatican Says China Ordination Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican's missionary news service called China's
shadow ordination of five bishops a failed political gesture, saying scores of
seminarians boycotted the ceremony in open defiance of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   China's state-controlled church ordained the bishops without Vatican
approval Thursday in what was widely seen as a slap at the Roman Catholic
Church, which conducted its traditional Epiphany ordination of bishops at Saint
Peter's the same day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their political game failed,'' the missionary news service, Fides, said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   China and the Vatican broke diplomatic ties in 1951, when the Communists
forced the country's millions of Catholics to sever relations with Rome. China's
officially sanctioned church does not recognize papal authority, including the
authority to appoint bishops.
</P>
<P>
	   Fides claimed China originally intended to ordain 12 bishops, matching the
number at the St. Peter's ceremony, but was able to coerce only five to take
part.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All were under extreme pressure,'' Fides said. The five now face a
``difficult time because of their de facto illegitimate ordinations.''
</P>
<P>
	   The faithful could refuse the sacrament from their hands, and some followers
already had asked the Holy See not to recognize the ordinations, the missionary
news service said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 130 seminarians at the National Seminary of Beijing boycotted the
ceremony after being forced to attend a rehearsal on Wednesday, Fides claimed.
It quoted one, unidentified boycotter as saying they now ``fear pressure and
even prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some bishops invited to the ceremony disappeared shortly before, it said. It
said attendance was only about 200, compared to 400 to 600 for a normal Sunday
Mass at the same Beijing cathedral.
</P>
<P>
	   China called the ordination an internal affair of the state Catholic church,
not subject to interference. Officials denied the ceremony was timed to the St.
Peter's ordinations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmaker Subpoenas Cuban Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker has subpoenaed Elian Gonzalez to testify
before Congress in a bid to keep him in the United States for at least another
month while courts decide whether the 6-year-old should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The subpoena was announced Friday night by Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana hours
after one of Elian's Miami relatives took the first step toward becoming the
boy's legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged by Burton's attempt to keep his son
from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What right does that man have?'' a red-eyed Juan Miguel Gonzalez said in
his hometown of Cardenas, where many wept during a rally for Elian. ``I am the
father of Elian and immigration has said that I am the only one who can speak
for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why should it be delayed? Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   The developments are the latest in a remarkable international custody battle
that has dominated headlines for weeks. Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day
clinging to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned
attempting to reach the United States. Two other adults also survived.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Wednesday that
Elian should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14, sparking protests in Miami and
celebrations in Cuba, where Fidel Castro has led the call for Elian's return.
President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno have both indicated support of
the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Then came Burton's announcement that Elian would testify before the
Committee on Government Reform on Feb. 10 so he can remain in the country while
the courts consider his case.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 supporters cheered Friday night as Elian -- holding the subpoena
in front of his face while being held aloft -- appeared outside the house where
he has been staying with relatives. Urged by relatives, he gave the peace sign
before heading back indoors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Congress of the United States is affording Elian Gonzalez what INS and
this administration has not, which is his legal right and his right to due
process,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation. ``This gives him the protection that he will not be repatriated to
Cuba between now and Feb. 10.''
</P>
<P>
	   Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez said the news rejuvenated Elian's Miami
relatives, who have spent much of the last two months dealing with the
international custody battle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They feel relaxed,'' Gutierrez said. ``I believe they're going to have a
good night's rest tonight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, the committee's chairman, said he ``issued a subpoena to Elian
Gonzalez to ensure that no precipitous action is taken until the Florida State
court in Miami can adequately address the Gonzalez case.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton is an outspoken critic of the Castro regime. A 1996 law named for him
and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., strengthened the 1959 trade embargo against the
communist nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it is
unlikely that Elian's actual appearance will be sought in Washington next month.
There was no response to phone messages left with the INS in Washington late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, lawyers filed a petition asking that Elian's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that would allow him to seek
asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week. They were expected to meet today with
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has
INS oversight. Smith said there should be an inquiry into whether Elian's
constitutional rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo,
accompanied by one of the family's lawyers, flew to Washington on Friday to
appeal directly to Reno. Gov. Jeb Bush also asked Clinton to reverse the INS
order.	   Reno said she is considering the issues raised in the meeting and the
state court action.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast to Thursday, when two Cuban exile leaders and 133 other people
were arrested and police were forced to use tear gas to disperse a crowd,
protests in Miami were much calmer Friday. About 100 people marched in front of
the federal building in Orlando, waving Cuban and American flags and chanting
``Cuba libre'' and ``long live the USA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters planned a demonstration in Little Havana today and were planning
to drive around Miami International Airport on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Massing Border Troops  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRED MULENGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) -- Zambia's government on Saturday denied reports that
it was deploying troops on the Angolan border to resist a possible cross-border
strike by Angolan government forces against Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The report in South African media is ``totally false, baseless and
malicious,'' Zambian Information Minister Newstead Zimba said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government's position of neutrality in any conflict in the region,
including that in Angola, is well known and cannot be over emphasized,'' Zimba
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Angolan government troops recently launched an offensive against UNITA
rebels along the country's southern border with Namibia. The Angolan troops,
with Namibia's permission, crossed into Namibian soil last month to crush
pockets of UNITA resistance. The troops were moving eastward along the
Angolan-Namibian border toward the Zambian border.
</P>
<P>
	   The Angolan government has previously accused Zambia of allowing war
materiel to pass over its porous border to UNITA, but amid Zambia's denials has
patched up relations with the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Zambian information minister said his country ``has never supported
UNITA and has no intention whatsoever of doing so now or in the future as long
as that movement does not respect international norms of conduct.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has imposed sanctions on UNITA for its violations of the
U.N.-brokered peace pact that unraveled in late 1998 when full-scale war
resumed. Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has accused the rebels of breaching
the peace pact and restarting Angola's 25 year civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimba said renewed fighting in Angola has damaged Zambia's security,
stability and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Family Planning Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will ask Congress for tens
of millions more in funding for contraception and other family planning services
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said his 2001 budget proposal will
include $35 million more to underwrite such services in the United States -- a
15 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The money does not go to fund abortions, the White House said. Instead, the
money is intended to help prevent unwanted pregnancies among poor women,
teen-agers and others with reduced access to health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make
abortion more rare,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase is the largest in more than two decades, and brings
the total administration proposal for family planning in the United States to
$274 million for next year, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would be shared among 4,600 clinics nationwide, and pay for what
the White House called ``the full range of reproductive health services,''
including contraceptives and health screenings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These services make a critical difference in people's lives,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds will help prevent more than one million unintended pregnancies
each year, a White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also is seeking $169 million in new money for family planning
and counseling services overseas -- a 45 percent increase over the fiscal 2000
budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am asking Congress to support these funds, and to provide them without
restrictions that hamper the work of family planning organizations, and even bar
them from discussing or debating reproductive health policies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a deal to get Congress to release $926 million in back payments
to the United Nations last year, the administration reluctantly accepted
restrictions on $385 million in federal funds for groups that perform abortions,
or lobby for liberalized abortion laws internationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said then he would try to remove the restrictions, which barred U.S.
money to private family planning groups that perform or promote abortions even
with their own money.

<HEADLINE> Putin May Have E.German Stasi Honor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin earned a decoration
for service from East Germany's Stasi secret police during the time he worked
there as a KGB agent, according to reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Der Spiegel and Focus newsmagazines reported that Putin earned the bronze
order in 1988 from former Stasi head Erich Mielke. Spiegel said the honor wasn't
anything particularly outstanding, but showed he was a typical rank-and-file
member of the intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1975 and 1990, Putin worked as a KGB officer in East Germany. In
Dresden, where he was working with the rank of major when he earned the medal,
he recruited businessmen from West Germany and East German citizens to work as
informers for Moscow, Spiegel reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who became acting president after Boris Yeltsin's surprise
resignation Dec. 31, is the front-runner in Russian elections set for March 26.

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Sees Tax Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can look forward to a year of tax relief if
Republicans have their way, beginning with an end to the ``marriage penalty,''
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., chairman of the House Republican Conference, said today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the sun rises on a new century, we are ready to take the next steps,''
Watts, R-Okla., said in the weekly Republican radio address. ``We will make the
tax code equally fair to one-income and two-income families.''
</P>
<P>
	   The marriage penalty is the additional tax many two-income married couples
must pay above what they would owe if they were single. Watt said passing
marriage penalty relief by April was only the first of three tax-relief bills
planned for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Republicans also want to allow parents to put up to $2,000
annually for each child into tax-free education savings accounts, Watts said.
The third bill would offer tax incentives to struggling rural and urban
communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will create jobs, encourage savings and help poor neighborhoods become
prosperous,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting this week as the fifth anniversary of the Republican takeover of
Congress, Watts said the GOP's accomplishments would continue.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Have Slow First Week  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- The Israelis and Syrians began the week
chugging along the path to peace. A couple of days later they were trotting. At
the end of the week, they were moving on down the track.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the State Department's assessment of five days of talks between the
two longtime foes -- diplomatic-speak for little progress achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   During that period, there were only two face-to-face meetings between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
And that took President Clinton four trips to this town to arrange.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, most of the negotiating was done indirectly in separate, bilateral
meetings between the U.S. team and the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which recessed for the Jewish Sabbath and the Muslim feast
marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, were expected to resume Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I indicated that my definition of progress is going to be where we've
moved forward; where new ideas have gelled. And when I'm ready to report
progress, I will do so,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin at a
briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a long, longstanding dispute,'' added Rubin. ``It is one that is
very emotional and very substantive and carries with it enormous security
implications. We don't expect in a few days for those kind of issues to move
dramatically forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was a lot of expectation in the Middle East last week that the
Shepherdstown negotiations -- the most technical since 1996 -- would plunge
immediately into serious discussions on the four main core issues keeping the
parties apart: demarcation of borders, security arrangements, water rights and
normal, peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the talks got mired in procedural quibbling almost from the start, with
the two sides divided over what to talk about first. Neither side wants to make
a concession without knowing exactly what they are getting in return.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis wanted first to discuss security -- their major concern -- wrap
up that issue and move to another subject. The Syrians refused, saying the root
problem -- Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights -- and the demarcation of
borders should be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
	   A compromise was reached whereby all the four working groups handling the
contentious issues would meet concurrently.
</P>
<P>
	   But by midday Saturday only the security and normal relations committees had
met. Rubin said Friday that the panels on the timetable of Israeli withdrawal
and on water resources would convene before the round ends.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to break the impasse, Clinton on Friday presented Barak and
al-Sharaa with a U.S. working document providing a summary of the issues to be
decided and the differences between the parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin sidestepped questions on whether the document could be a base for an
eventual peace treaty, saying only ``it's a very interesting interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
	   William Quandt, who had taken part in the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David agreement, said the hurdles are surmountable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every negotiation I've been at ... just before the agreement is reached it
looks like it's about to collapse. Always,'' said Quandt, who was on the
National Security Council staff in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are tough issues. They're serious,'' he added. ``But I would be
surprised if either side walks out over a minor issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quandt said that during the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations there were long
periods when there did not seem to be any significant progress.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that in 13 days of talks, Israeli Prime Minister Menachim Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat held sessions the first couple of days with
President Carter that were ``very acrimonious, very unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``After that Carter kept them apart until everything has been agreed upon at
which point they only met when they signed the agreement,'' Quandt said. ``So
it's not unprecedented for things to get off to a slow start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Few face-to-face encounters means the two sides have not had much
opportunity to work on building rapport.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak made an effort at a reception where Clinton was the host Tuesday,
speaking in Arabic to the Syrian delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that following the second face-to-face between Barak and
al-Sharaa that took place Friday, Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright felt that the chemistry has improved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lot of face-to-face give-and-take,'' said Rubin. ``This is not
warm and fuzzy, but it is businesslike and professional and obviously personal
to some extent.''

<HEADLINE> Debates Open Candidates to Scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a whirlwind week of presidential politics, four
televised debates crackled with conflict, humor and policy discussions that
opened the candidates to closer inspection to a public that begins judging them
two weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as many voters started to pay attention, Republican John McCain and
Democrat Al Gore got off to a rocky start. Taxes emerged as the central issue in
the Republican race last week, and the Democrats squawked over health care.
</P>
<P>
	   One debate question raised an emotion-charged dialogue in both parties:
Should gays be allowed to serve openly in the military? Al Gore said yes, and
suggested that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be required to
agree. The Republican candidates protested, as did military brass and some Gore
allies.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president backpedaled Friday night: ``I did not mean to imply that
there should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of
officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was basically the same answer delivered in the debate two days earlier by
Gore's rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore also struggled with a
staff-made controversy when his campaign manager suggested retired Joint Chiefs
Chairman Colin Powell was being used by Republicans who ``would rather take
pictures with black children than feed them.'' Powell, a popular Republican
figure who is black, received a telephone call Friday from the vice president.
Gore would not say whether he apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   No public regrets, either, from John McCain, the chairman of a powerful
Senate committee who spent most of the week explaining why he wrote letters to
federal regulators on behalf of big campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,'' McCain said. ``I
would do the same thing again, almost anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The practice is common in Washington, where many people doing business with
government agencies also donate to lawmakers whose duties include oversight of
those agencies. But McCain, who made political reform the core of his campaign,
may be held to a higher standard by voters.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush sure hopes so. ``I think somebody who makes campaign
financing an issue has got to be consistent and walk the walk,'' the GOP
national front-runner said in New Hampshire, where McCain is courting
independent voters with his good-government platform.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's primary is Feb. 1; the campaign's first votes are cast in
Iowa's caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year rang in the toughest ad produced by one of the presidential
campaigns. Self-financed conservative Steve Forbes, accused of running attack
ads in his failed 1996 bid, aired a spot accusing Bush of breaking a no-tax
pledge as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ad was being shipped to TV stations, Bush promoted his $483 billion
tax-cut plan with a debate-night pledge: ``This is not only no new taxes. This
is tax cuts, so help me God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' good timing did not make up for a bad showing in the debates. His
voice was rarely heard amid the clash between Bush and McCain as they tangled
over taxes and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides blamed the moderator, the format and their own candidate for getting
few words in edgewise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Steve was too much of a gentleman in terms of getting his face in
theirs and getting his message out,'' said Ken Blackwell, his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush flew early in the week to Iowa, where Forbes is threatening his wide
lead in state polls with a strong organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling McCain's tax plan too small, Bush said, ``There is a tax gap in this
campaign.'' Without mentioning Forbes -- champion of the flat tax -- the Texas
governor also was trying to undercut the rival's gains in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain unveils a modest-sized tax cut plan this week, but he is already
calling Bush's package reckless. It benefits the wealthy and spends billions of
dollars that could be better spent bolstering Social Security, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican strategist Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said
McCain is taking a huge gamble criticizing a big tax cut in a GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't tack to the left on taxes, especially with economic
conservatives in New Hampshire. I really think this will hurt him worse than''
the ethical questions, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other GOP contenders -- Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes -- got
valuable exposure to the voting public, though they remain mired in single
digits in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic contest, Gore continued to warn that Bradley's promise to
provide nearly all Americans health insurance would be a disaster. Bradley said
it will not, and pumped $250,000 into a new TV ad to defend his campaign of
``big ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   It got personal. ``I think you're in a Washington bunker,'' Bradley told
Gore in one of their two debates. The high point for Gore came before the
debates, when he picked up the endorsement of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the funniest exchanges, typical of the wounding humor that energized
all four debates, came after Gore said he opposed Bradley's policies but
respected the man.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishing for a compliment for Gore, the moderator asked Bradley, ``Do you
agree?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I agree with what he said,'' replied Bradley, not willing to play nice.
``I think I'm genuinely a good person.''

<HEADLINE> Cleric Says Fight Is Against India  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR ZIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A prominent Muslim cleric whom India freed to
end the Indian Airlines hijacking has backed off his threats against the United
States, saying he is no Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Maulana Masood Azhar partially retreated Friday from comments he made in a
fiery speech two days earlier in Karachi, where he told thousands of people that
they should destroy the United States and India.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want Muslims to unite against Indian terrorism being inflicted on
Kashmiri people,'' Azhar told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from
his hometown of Bawahalpur. ``I am not Osama. I am just fighting for Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said India is the only target in his campaign to free Kashmir, the
mountainous region that is the focus of a decades-long border dispute between
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   India freed Azhar along with Mushtaq Zargar, an Indian Kashmiri, and Ahmed
Umar Saeed Sheikh, a Pakistani-born British citizen, on Dec. 31 in exchange for
155 passengers and crew members aboard the hijacked aircraft in Afghanistan. The
plane was hijacked after it took off from Nepal on Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   The freed prisoners came to Pakistan, while the five hijackers disappeared
in Afghanistan. They were given a 10-hour deadline to leave Afghanistan,
although their whereabouts are not known. India says they are in Pakistan, but
Pakistan denies this.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar said the comments in his earlier speech were taken out of context and
that he had only warned the United States not to involve itself in the dispute
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States accuses bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, of running an
international terrorist network and masterminding the bombings of its embassies
in Africa in August 1998. Bin Laden, who is in Afghanistan, denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar said the United States ``should not interfere in matters which do not
concern it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our struggle is against India,'' he said. ``And fighting to liberate one's
own country is not terrorism. Indians committed a crime by seizing the
Muslim-majority state of Kashmir. We want it back because it is part of
Pakistan. America should have no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
	   He chastised the United States, saying that it imposes a double standard on
Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``India is indulging in massive human rights abuses in Kashmir,'' he said.
``But United States is silent. When we fight back, they call it terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir since their
independence from Britain in 1947. Both countries hold parts of Kashmir and
claim the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Pakistan of sending infiltrators to Indian-held Kashmir, a
charge Pakistan denies. Muslim guerrillas in Kashmir are waging an uprising to
gain independence or to join with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, India released the photographs of several clean-shaven men,
saying they are the hijackers and members of the militant Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen
group, to which Azhar belongs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Their pictures are fake because good Muslims never shave beards. And the
hijackers were staunch Muslims, though they didn't remove their masks when I
asked them to,'' Azhar said.
</P>
<P>
	   Azhar said none of the major Kashmiri militant groups was behind the
hijacking. He speculated that the hijackers may have been members of one of
several smaller groups that have emerged in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Tribe Kids Seek Thai Citizenship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- About 100 colorfully costumed children from
Thailand's northern hill tribes petitioned Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai to grant
them Thai citizenship as part of national Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Their demand underscored the ambiguous legal status of hundreds of thousands
of ethnic hill-tribe people, some of Thailand's poorest, who populate border
regions.
</P>
<P>
	   They may have lived in Thailand for generations but are not recognized as
citizens, often because they are not proficient in the Thai language or because
they live outside normal administrative channels.
</P>
<P>
	   The children who petitioned Chuan on Saturday, members of the Akha tribe,
sang songs in their native language for the premier, who opened his office to
the public as part of Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the first time I have received such request,'' Chuan told
reporters after the meeting. ``I will instruct concerned agencies to do their
best.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the children told Chuan that she had been born in Thailand but was
not considered a citizen, denying her opportunity for education and, in future
years, employment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill-tribe people without citizenship need permission from local government
authorities to leave the district where they reside, cannot own land and cannot
send their children to high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The hill tribes generally live off subsistence agriculture and handouts from
backpacking tourists. Many hill-tribe girls end up in the flesh trade in
Bangkok, where they are often infected with the AIDS virus.

<HEADLINE> Troops: Russia Understating Deaths  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers said Saturday that the
military is understating casualties in Chechnya, hushing up the deaths of scores
of men to avoid a public backlash against the increasingly bloody war.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of interviews, Russian soldiers in Chechnya and the adjoining
region of Ingushetia claimed their units had suffered numerous casualties that
have not been reported. It was not possible to obtain overall figures, but
soldiers in some units said more than half the men in their detachments had been
killed or wounded in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Kavkaz checkpoint near Sleptsovskaya, Interior Ministry soldiers said
Saturday that they see trucks coming from Chechnya every day with dead and
wounded personnel despite official claims of very few casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They would announce that two or three people have been killed, but the
actual number is two or three times higher,'' said one of the soldiers at the
checkpoint, who identified himself only by his first name, Sergei.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can see that because all the corpses go through us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since its Chechen offensive began in September, the military has
stressed that casualties have been low, hoping to avoid public opposition of the
kind provoked by heavy Russian losses in the 1994-96 Chechen war. The military's
strategy is based on heavy air and artillery bombardment of rebel positions,
followed by mopping-up operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent official casualty figures, released Thursday, say 465
Defense and Interior Ministry troops have been killed and 1,583 have been
wounded in Chechnya since fighting began in September. The numbers do not
include any figures for soldiers missing in action or those whose bodies are too
badly disfigured to allow identification.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent analysts and soldiers' rights groups have disputed the numbers
for months, saying the toll is much higher. Accounts by soldiers on the ground
support the claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 115 men who have been guarding a stretch of road in the Grozny
neighborhood of Chernorechye since September, only 58 are left. Some were
wounded, but most were killed, members of the unit said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The company is gone already. And they (the military) keep saying there are
no casualties,'' said Pyotr, a young conscript who refused to give his last
name. He said that another 115-strong company was stationed nearby on Dec. 11,
and that only 17 men were left when it was redeployed on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops faced little resistance as they took control of Chechnya's
lowlands in the autumn, but they have been stalled in their two-week push to
seize Grozny and penetrate into the rebel-held southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grozny area was mostly quiet Saturday, one day after Russian commanders
declared that the bombardment of the shattered capital would be reduced. Weather
also appeared to be a factor in the letup in air and artillery raids, with the
capital shrouded in heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command said the pause in bombardment was announced in part to
allow thousands of civilians who have been trapped in Grozny to escape. However,
no large movements of civilians were reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The military may be using the lull to prepare for a major new drive to take
Grozny, although Russian commanders refused to say anything about their plans.
</P>
<P>
	   There was scattered fighting outside Grozny on Saturday, with the military
claiming it had trapped a group of rebels near the town of Argun, nine miles
east of Grozny, and surrounded more rebels in the southern rebel stronghold of
Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
	   The military said 40 militants had been killed in airstrikes on rebel bases,
and that only one Russian soldier was killed in the fighting, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government on Saturday tried to play down its decision to
replace the two top combat generals in Chechnya. Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev and
Maj. Gen. Vladimir Shamanov were returned Friday to the posts they occupied
before the war, and their deputies took their places.
</P>
<P>
	   Removing combat commanders at the height of the military campaign in
Chechnya suggested government displeasure with their failure to take Grozny or
deal a decisive blow against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   But acting President Vladimir Putin, emerging from an Orthodox Christmas
mass Saturday, said the issue was a technical one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia doesn't throw away such generals as Troshev and Shamanov. There has
been no replacement and no replacement has been planned. It is a technical
question,'' he said, giving no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who built much of his political popularity on tough handling of the
war, is thought to want to wrap up the fighting before presidential elections
March 26.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Carter: Still fighting - in film, books, life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TORONTO (AP) - Rubin "Hurricane" Carter deals with life like he boxed in
the 1960s: fists up, coming at you, "no dancing, no shuffling, no jiving."
<P>
	   That stormy style inspired the nickname synonymous with the man. And his
swarming, straight-ahead approach has been the lone constant in six decades of
contrasts so striking that his survival seems remarkable, his triumph
impossible.
</P>
<P>
	   A juvenile delinquent turned prizefighter who beat a world champion, Carter
was wrongfully convicted of three murders in 1966 and spent 19 years in prison.
Drawing on a burning intensity fueled by anger, he overcame personal demons and
a corrupt and racist criminal justice system to clear his name and regain his
freedom in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Dylan wrote a ballad about "The Hurricane," and Muhammad Ali championed
his cause. And now Norman Jewison ("In the Heat of the Night," "Moonstruck,"
"The Thomas Crown Affair") has told Carter's shattering story in a new movie,
"The Hurricane," starring Denzel Washington as the boxer.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, a new biography has hit bookstores and a 1991 account of
his two-decade legal odyssey has been republished to coincide with the film's
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone at the Victorian house in Toronto where Carter lives and runs
his Association in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted rang constantly during a
recent interview, and with each call, Carter talks loudly into the receiver
about a hectic schedule of interviews, film screenings and an upcoming
appearance at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is more surprised about all the hoopla than the still muscular
62-year-old.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am absolutely flabbergasted that my life has been so full, you know, of
all sorts of things," Carter says in his deliberate, strongly inflected style.
"And yet this is not the ending. This is just the beginning. ... Man, my life is
miraculous. My life is wonderful. I am healthy. I am awake. What more could one
want? I am perfect."
</P>
<P>
	   Those who know him say such language reflects Carter's intensity more so
than any total fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
	   "'The Hurricane' to us is energy and power," says Sam Chaiton, co-author of
"Lazerus and The Hurricane," the 1991 account of how Chaiton and his housemates
took up Carter's cause and helped him overturn his murder rap in a U.S. federal
court in 1985. "He's able to give back to society after having so much taken
from him."
</P>
<P>
	   What exactly did "Hurricane" Carter lose? The chorus of Dylan's song ends
with the line: "One time he could've been the champion of the world." And the
movie shows him stopping then welterweight champion Emile Griffith in the first
round of a non-title bout three years before his 1966 arrest with John Artis for
the triple murder of three whites in a Paterson, N.J., bar.
</P>
<P>
	   He is asked if he ever saw Griffith's later legendary bouts with Nino
Benvenuti, and Carter's normally robust voice shrinks to a whisper.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, I was in prison," he says. "That's gone. Two decades just gone."
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting at his cluttered desk, wearing a blue University of San Diego law
school sweatshirt, dark pants and knee-high dark buckskin boots with a tassled
fringe, Carter constantly leans forward and gestures with his large boxer's
hands while recounting his prison struggles.
</P>
<P>
	   In the film, Washington, portraying Carter, refuses to wear prison clothes
or eat prison food in a protest of his unjust conviction. While stripped of any
ambiguity - the film justifies Carter's stabbing of a white pedophile that
landed him in a juvenile reformatory - it depicts the boxer's personal
transformation during lengthy sessions in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sounding like a middleweight Nelson Mandela, Carter described the thought
process at the time: "Go beyond yourself in these arduous conditions. Don't give
in to your captors. Realize this is an opportunity, instead of a tragedy. It's
an opportunity because now you don't have ... all the trappings of civility. You
have time, you have space on your hands. Use it."
</P>
<P>
	   In his affinity for overstating and understating in the same thought, Carter
attributed his strength and sustenance in prison to "anger, true and utter,
unmitigated anger, anger that the system, that the government, is going to
impose guilt on me when the government knew I was not guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   The current release of James Hirsch's authorized biography, "Hurricane - The
Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter," has sparked another kind of anger. While
the film is based on Carter's jail house book "The 16th Round" and "Lazerus and
The Hurricane," Carter is promoting the Hirsch book while ignoring the
re-release of Chaiton's account written with Terry Swinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaiton and Swinton were two of the 13 Canadians who learned of Carter's
case through Lezra Martin, a Brooklyn, N.Y., youth they helped educate. The
first book Martin ever read in his life was "The 16th Round," and he started a
correspondence with the imprisoned Carter that led to his benefactors'
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   In the film, the Canadians are depicted as three composite characters -
Chaiton, Swinton and Lisa Peters, who later married Carter when he got out of
prison and moved into the group house in Toronto where the Canadians lived.
Carter and Peters now are separated, and he lives with someone else.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirsch's book describes the group house as a different kind of prison for
Carter, who says in the book he felt like a "trophy horse" there but wanted to
pay back the Canadians for the money they spent on his case.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaiton and Swinton called the description of life in the group house
untrue. They said - and Carter agreed - that he would have faced problems
adapting no matter where he lived after prison.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you stay in those conditions for 20 long years, fighting the prison
system tooth and nail every single day, you're going to need a lot of
readjustment when you walk away from there," Carter said. "You're never
completely readjusted. Those things are always there. They're dormant, but
they're there, and if you forget about them, they'll become active."
</P>
<P>
	   Leon Friedman, a Hofstra University law professor who worked on Carter's
case, said he thinks "The Hurricane" has softened a bit but still has a
prizefighter's mentality.
</P>
<P>
	   "He had one focus then - getting out of jail. Now I think he's a little more
mellow," Friedman said. "The intensity is still there. He's still fighting."
</P>
<P>
	   Through his Association in Defense of the Wrongly Convicted, Carter has
helped a handful of people correct legal wrongs. He put up $34,000 in proceeds
from the film for the case of 28-year-old Christopher Bates, who has spent six
years in prison on a murder charge he claims is bogus.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 29, Bates refused to plead guilty to a reduced charge of
manslaughter that would have set him free. He said Carter advised him to fight
the charge instead of accepting guilt in exchange for his release.
</P>
<P>
	   "His nickname, 'The Hurricane,' just suits this guy perfectly," Bates told
The Toronto Star. "He said, 'Don't worry. We're going to take care of this thing
right.' "

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of bills passed by Senate, Assembly die on backburner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Shall builders be required to pay an "impact fee"
to offset the added costs for new classrooms and police officers when the new
residents flood into those new homes?
<P>
	   Perhaps, but the Legislature won't force them to do it in this session.
</P>
<P>
	   Is it fair that lawyers who defend accused killers are allowed to dismiss
more potential jurors than prosecutors are allowed to?
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps not, but the Legislature is not going to change these rules anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Shall troopers and their supervisors be held publicly accountable when
citizens are mistreated and file formal complaints about it?
</P>
<P>
	   Not by any new state law they won't be.
</P>
<P>
	   And is it finally time to revise fair housing laws so rural towns are not
required to provide a quota of affordable units that has no relation to their
sparse populations?
</P>
<P>
	   If so, it will not be done by legislation now.
</P>
<P>
	   All four initiatives were crafted into bills that passed either the Senate
or Assembly last year but which have not been posted for action Monday in the
final session of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   These four and 332 other bills and resolutions will die as the 208th
legislative session draws to an official close Tuesday at noon.
</P>
<P>
	   There are thousands of bills and hundreds of resolutions filed in the past
two years that will expire into so much recycled paper.
</P>
<P>
	   But 336 of these bills and resolutions had gone through the committee
systems and won approval in either the Senate or Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the thousands of bills and resolutions never moved off of the
backburner. Most are minor but some are not.
</P>
<P>
	   By design, action on the multi-billion-dollar school construction and
transportation bills will spill into the new term starting this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Less by design will come the death of a bill to require health insurers to
pay into a reserve that would have been used to pay off $120 million owed to
doctors and hospitals by the bankrupt HIP Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Gun control legislation exists at both extremes, with one bill proposing to
ban all handguns and another bill proposing to let law-abiding citizens carry
concealed weapons wherever they go. Both bills go up in smoke Tuesday at noon -
and are prefiled for reintroduction as new bills on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   No less than 174 bills that passed the Senate are foundering on the Assembly
backburner. Likewise, 162 bills that passed the Assembly remain bottled up in
Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate passed the impact-fee bill in November and the State Police
report bill last May. The Assembly has not acted on them and is not scheduled to
do so Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly in June passed the jury selection bill and fair housing
amendment. The Senate has not acted on them and is not scheduled to do so
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican leaders of the two houses, Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, are sensitive to these points.
They have released lengthy session agendas for their respective houses on
Monday, with the Assembly taking up 43 bills that have already passed the Senate
and the Senate handling 25 bills that have already passed the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Following are other prominent bills scheduled to suffer an anonymous death
this week:
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill eventually requiring handguns to be sold with "smart gun" safety
sensors. The Senate passed it in July.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to permit off-track betting on horse racing. The Senate passed it
in July.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to require insurance coverage for all costs related to Pap smear
tests. The Assembly passed it in June.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to increase the penalty to $250 for parents who allow their
children to miss school. The Senate passed it in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to allow private firms to run cafeterias in county jails. The
Senate passed it in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to have convicted sex offenders sentenced more harshly as repeat
offenders if they had any such convictions as juveniles. The Assembly passed it
last February. Usually juvenile convictions do not count in adult sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to form a "Domestic Violence Victims Fund" with special fees
charged to those convicted of domestic violence charges. The Assembly passed it
in May.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to change drug law so dealers can be prosecuted according to the
number of doses, or "units," they sell rather than by simple weight, which is
misleading for drugs such as LSD or amphetamines. The Assembly passed it last
month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Man Faces Jail for At-Work Dangers  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK WARBIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SODA SPRINGS, Idaho (AP) -- The thoughts are there, somewhere behind Scott
Dominguez's largely expressionless stare.
</P>
<P>
	   So are the words. But only a few get out -- in a kind of muted slow-motion
staccato, syllable by syllable, preceded and often interrupted by stuttered
breaths. It's difficult to listen to, all the more because it clearly is far
more exasperating for him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I pray for myself to get 100 percent better,'' Dominguez said, nostrils
flaring and tears welling up as he struggles to express the frustration of being
trapped for the rest of his life in a body unable to respond to a brain ravaged
by industrial cyanide poisoning.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury already has concluded what happened to him in August 1996 was no
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominguez was only two years out of high school in this southeastern Idaho
town, where many of the 3,200 residents make their living mining rich deposits
of phosphate from the nearby hills or processing it for fertilizer and other
products.
</P>
<P>
	   Working for a small business that extracted silver from the waste produced
by a processing plant, he was trying to earn some money for a future he hoped
would include college.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he was overcome by hydrogen cyanide gas as he cleaned the inside of
a 25,000-gallon storage tank for his employer -- a man already so well known for
scores of environmental and worker safety violations that federal and state
regulators speaking among themselves sometimes called him ``Idaho's walking,
talking Three Mile Island.''
</P>
<P>
	   Allan Elias was convicted in May. Unless U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill
approves his request for a new trial, Elias is expected to be sentenced soon on
federal charges of knowingly exposing Dominguez to cyanide, illegally disposing
of hazardous waste and lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias, 61, faces up to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is the Justice Department's only conviction of an employer for
knowingly exposing a worker to hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the kind of frightening and harrowing tale of abusive conduct by an
employer that you would expect to hear about, if at all, in another part of the
world,'' said David Uhlmann, who helped prosecute Elias.
</P>
<P>
	   Another trial is set for Nov. 6 in state court on a lawsuit filed by
Dominguez and his mother, Jackie Hamp, against Elias; the company he ran,
Evergreen Resources Inc.; and Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp. and Kerr-McGee Chemical
LLC, to which Elias sold Evergreen Resources in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominguez's lawyer, Brent Roche, said the trial could for the first time in
Idaho result in an employer being found liable for an employee's injuries.
Worker's compensation coverage in all other cases has foreclosed legal remedies.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias's lawyer, Craig Jorgensen, did not return repeated calls from The
Associated Press. Elias's listed telephone number was disconnected, and he did
not respond to a message left at his Soda Springs home. So far, Roche said, he
has refused to be deposed for the civil case.
</P>
<P>
	   During his 3 1/2-week trial, Elias relied on a defense of denial. His
silence leaves unexplained the question Dominguez said he most wants to ask:
Why?
</P>
<P>
	   Dominguez was glad to be working for Elias, ``a pretty cool guy'' who always
seemed willing to advance a little cash against his next paycheck.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, there were signs of trouble. Sometimes so much sulfuric acid would
spill onto his clothes while he was unloading it from railroad cars that his
jeans and T-shirt would be eaten through by the end of the day. But Dominguez,
unaware of the safety rules Elias had repeatedly been directed by regulators to
follow, was not about to complain.
</P>
<P>
	   At the age of 20 -- still young and nimble enough to keep a Hacky Sack in
the air for 200 kicks -- he felt invincible.
</P>
<P>
	   Then one day Elias ordered him to clean sludge out of an 11-foot-high,
36-foot-long steel tank that, unbeknownst to Dominguez, contained sodium cyanide
and phosphoric acid. Dominguez was given no protective clothing, breathing gear
or even safety training -- only a broom and a fire hose.
</P>
<P>
	   The chemicals that sloshed together as he washed down the tank's walls
produced the same compound that Nazis used to gas victims of their World War II
death camps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just remember my co-workers saying `You have to breathe,' and I said I
couldn't,'' Dominguez said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was almost an hour before rescuers cut through the steel and got him out.
Experts testified that the damage Dominguez suffered was compounded by treatment
delays caused by Elias's refusal to acknowledge what was in the tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias backdated a safety permit required by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, indicating employees were given safety gear before
entering the tank. He also gave police a false report claiming the safety
equipment was stolen.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias even went so far as to pay $5,000 to have former Gov. Cecil Andrus,
through an intermediary, deliver to federal investigators affidavits that turned
out to contain false information. Andrus said he had no idea, and authorities
confirmed he was never implicated.
</P>
<P>
	   The site of Elias's defunct company in Pocatello is abandoned along with up
to 2,300 tons of cadmium-contaminated waste that the EPA estimates could cost up
to $800,000 to remove. Cleanup of an additional 800 tons of cadmium-contaminated
waste at the Evergreen Resources site is expected to cost more than $364,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias ``is somebody who has demonstrated an uncanny ability to evade
responsibility for his actions through legal maneuvers, force of persuasion and
false assurances to regulators,'' Uhlmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors want Elias's sentence to include almost $6 million in
restitution, enough to cover a lifetime of special care for Dominguez, who has
made more progress than doctors expected but probably has advanced as far as he
ever will.

<HEADLINE> On some shows, TV station displays ads at bottom of screen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Need a break from commercials?
<P>
	   A Rochester television station is leaving no room for viewers to leave the
room during commercial breaks. Fox network affiliate WUHF-TV has begun
displaying small text ads at the bottom of the screen during some of its shows.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the advertisements have run only in the afternoon and early evening.
Called banners, they are already popular on both the Internet and European
sports broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
	   John Galbraith, president of Twin Advertising Inc. in the suburb of
Pittsford, was looking for a novel way to advertise a high-speed Internet
service, and convinced the station to give the ads a trial run.
</P>
<P>
	   WUHF is the first in the country to do so, the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle reported Saturday, quoting unidentified industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
	   "People may hate it, but you've got to try it," Galbraith said. "No one else
is trying it."
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Banks, chairman of the media policy committee at the American
Association of Advertising Agencies, called the idea intriguing but risky.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a viewer, I think it's disruptive," he said. "It's a misguided attempt
to get more revenues."
</P>
<P>
	   WUHF is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, one of the country's largest
broadcast groups, with 59 television stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochester is not being used as a test market for banner ads on other
Sinclair stations, said Matt Kreiner, vice president and general manager at
WUHF.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Constitution Plan Nixed  </HEADLINE>
   By OLIVER TEVES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Yielding to widespread opposition, the president
of the Philippines said Saturday he would suspend one of his administration's
top priorities, removing constitutional restrictions on foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a leader, I must listen,'' President Joseph Estrada said in his annual
report to the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, whose popularity has plunged in recent months, also announced
changes in policies and personnel aimed at rejuvenating his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada had vowed repeatedly not to abandon his goal of amending the
constitution to remove restrictions on foreign ownership of land and key
industries, saying they impede investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But many Filipinos believe that opening up the charter, ratified a year
after the ouster of dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, could endanger its
democratic provisions. Tens of thousands of people protested against the
proposed changes in several demonstrations last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada said his government would now focus instead on short-term economic
measures that would cause ``less cost to national unity.'' That would include,
he said, a shuffle of his top economic Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada confirmed that Trade Secretary Jose Pardo will replace Finance
Secretary Edgardo Espiritu, who resigned this past week. Espiritu, an
experienced banker, helped lead the country's recovery from the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Pardo, who has close ties to business as former president of the Philippine
franchise of 7-Eleven and Burger King but has limited experience in fiscal
policy, will be replaced as trade secretary by House Majority Leader Manuel
Roxas II.
</P>
<P>
	   Roxas, a former investment banker, authored a bill that would open the
retail trade sector to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet reshuffle is widely seen as an effort by Estrada to find new
direction following criticism that his government has failed to develop a
credible blueprint for helping the millions of Filipinos living below the
poverty line, and has not pushed through much-needed economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrada also unveiled a new committee joining the president and economic
advisers that will create and implement economic policies.
</P>
<P>
	   The new economic team faces formidable challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 budget deficit is likely to far surpass the target of $2.1 billion
because of poor revenue collection. As of the end of November, the deficit
already exceeded $2.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Overwhelms S. Africa Hospitals  </HEADLINE>
    By ANDREW SELSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa (AP) -- Doctors scribble notes into patients'
folders while a young man lies nearby on a gurney, dying from AIDS-related
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   His abdomen convulses with gurgling gasps as he struggles to fill his
saturated lungs. The doctors will not transfer him to a bed in the intensive
care unit because of lack of space.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's busy dying," says Dr. Iwan Bekker, sweeping past the youth in Dora
Nginza Hospital. "Sometimes we have to play God."
</P>
<P>
	   The AIDS epidemic is overwhelming South Africa so badly that some public
hospitals are turning people away, limiting treatment and forcing doctors to
make hard decisions about whom to save.
</P>
<P>
	   Looking for desperately needed help from the developed world, the
governments of South Africa and other African states are eagerly awaiting a
speech Monday by Vice President Al Gore to the U.N. Security Council on the
impact of AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   With an estimated 4 million South Africans -- one of every 10 people --
already infected with the AIDS virus, the epidemic poses a huge challenge to the
country's public health system.
</P>
<P>
	   At Hlabisa Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal Province, some patients must sleep on
foam mats underneath beds holding other patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals in the Johannesburg area are trying to stretch their budgets by
limiting lab tests and releasing patients sooner. They are also training
families of AIDS sufferers to care for them -- and prepare for their deaths --
at home.
</P>
<P>
	   In the developed world, debates sometimes arise over whether heroic measures
should keep a critically ill person alive. In state hospitals in South Africa,
as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, such expensive measures are rarely an
option.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't afford to spend money on people who are going to die," said Karen
Michael, a researcher on AIDS at the University of Natal in Durban.
</P>
<P>
	   Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang is trying to recruit all sectors of
society into the fight against AIDS. "The government will never be able to cope
with it alone," she said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Tshabalala-Msimang said the government is considering inviting the private
sector to create a fund to help fight the epidemic. It also plans to step up its
AIDS awareness campaign and the promotion of abstinence or safe sex practices.
</P>
<P>
	   With limited resources, the government can only take limited measures. In
fiscal year 1997, the government spent $3.4 billion on health care for the
nation's 40.5 million people, or less than $85 a person, the statistics office
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unless health funds are increased -- and that would mean taking money away
from housing, education and other strapped programs -- the government can't
afford costly AIDS drugs like AZT.
</P>
<P>
	   But some people say the government must throw its resources into halting the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a 'war cabinet' for AIDS," said the Rev. Barry Hughes-Gibbs, an
Anglican priest who runs AIDS home-care training in a black township near the
capital, Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
	   Public hospitals, which serve 86 percent of black South Africans, are on the
front line in the fight against AIDS, which in sub-Saharan Africa is transmitted
primarily by heterosexual sex.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hospitals are now stretched to capacity," said Michael, the AIDS
researcher. "Staffers are working chronic overtime without overtime pay, and
they're having a flood of patients who are not able to look after themselves.
It's pretty bleak."
</P>
<P>
	   At Dora Nginza Hospital near the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth,
HIV-positive babies will be admitted for treatment only once, then are
restricted to outpatient care, said Bekker, the head of pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
	   He pointed out rooms crowded with HIV-positive babies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a limited budget," Bekker said. "When a baby gets bad, like with
pneumonia, we won't admit it for the second time, but will tell the mother to
take it home and let it die."
</P>
<P>
	   It's a grim policy for Fanizwe, a young mother whose HIV-infected baby has
already been admitted once for pneumonia and released. Infected with the AIDS
virus herself, Fanizwe now faces the prospect of sitting in their shack,
helplessly watching her baby succumb to the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the baby gets sick again, he will be beyond my care," she says, cuddling
the youngster.

<HEADLINE> Metro-North trains to be equipped with black boxes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Metro-North commuter trains are now equipped with
devices similar to the flight data recorders currently used on airliners.
<P>
	   The event recorders register a number of functions on the train, including
speed, brake pressure and signals. Metro-North's equipment also will measure
other data, including heating and cooling functions, distribution of electricity
to train cars and performance of car doors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've used some kind of black box device since 1990, but we just finished
installation of the federally mandated equipment," said Marjorie Anders, a
Metro-North spokeswoman. "We were using it for troubleshooting and will continue
to use it as a maintenance tool in addition."
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad spent $13 million over several years to install the equipment,
Anders said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The devices are required under 1985 federal legislation. The program was
administered by the federal Department of Transportation's Federal Railway
Administration division. Every train contains at least one device, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional technology that will send instant radio communication about
equipment failures to Metro-North fleet managers will be installed throughout
the year, Anders added.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there's an obvious problem on one of your trains, we can spot those
types of things, but this equipment will allow us to learn about less obvious
equipment malfunction that you may not be able to spot instantly," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   James Cameron, vice chairman of the Connecticut Metro North-Shoreline East
Rail Commuter Council, said he and the council were unaware of the black box
project.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pleased to see that Metro-North is using technology to enhance
passenger safety," he said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to stress high tech economy, the elderly in State of State  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman is nearing the end of her
gubernatorial career, but there are still some things she wants to accomplish.
<P>
	   On Tuesday, during her annual State of the State message to lawmakers,
she'll unveil a number of new policy initiatives for the second to last of her
eight years in office, according to her spokesman, Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a growing sentiment that, in the second half of her second term,
it's time to rest on laurels, time to buff the image. We're not looking at it
that way," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not going to be a recitation of where we've been. There are two
more States of the State to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman will focus on four themes in her speech: education, the environment,
the elderly and the economy. McDonough described the goals the governor wants to
accomplish, but declined to detail the means until the governor actually
delivers her speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman wants to enhance New Jersey's reputation as a technology hub by
providing more qualified entry level workers, improving delivery of high tech
products to the marketplace, and taking advantage of computer technology in
cities, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
	   "High technology is the engine of our economic development and the insulator
from future economic downturns," he said. "It will be for the 21st century what
manufacturing was for the early- and mid-20th century."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman will also detail a plan to encourage parental involvement in
schools, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One thing that has become absolutely apparent is that the level of parental
involvement in schools is directly proportional to the quality of the school,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor also wants to improve the quality of New Jersey's teachers and
bolster state initiatives that improve school facilities and build on
curriculum, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the elderly, Whitman will unveil ideas to encourage independent living,
good nutrition and personal security, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor will propose new brownfield redevelopment ideas in urban cores
and emphasize the importance of watershed management and air quality monitoring.
</P>
<P>
	   She will also "offer up a smart growth proposal that has some substantial
teeth in it, that is a significant exercise in planning," her spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Looks Like a Winner  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY RENFREW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Vladimir Putin appears headed for easy victory in Russia's
presidential election, even though he says he'll be too busy as acting president
to campaign and has barely mentioned his platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Even some of the opposition candidates say Putin is unbeatable and they are
just running for appearances' sake in an 11-week campaign that is looking more
like a formality than a test of candidates and ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I imagine that Putin will not have any particular election campaign,''
said Igor Shabdurasulov, deputy chief of the acting president's staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential contest set for March 26 looks to be very different from
recent Russian elections, when candidates savaged each other and tried every
trick and gimmick their strategists could come up with.
</P>
<P>
	   Boris Yeltsin won re-election as president in 1996 only after a frenzied
campaign that included the ailing incumbent stiffly strutting in front of rock
bands to appeal to young voters. Recent elections have been dubbed wars of
``kompromat,'' or compromising materials, because candidates focused on leaking
claims of immorality and criminality against opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike most Russian politicians, Putin is not tainted by corruption
allegations. His unsmiling, stern manner exudes rectitude, appealing to voters
desperate for a strong leader to tackle Russia's problems after years of
stagnation under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
	   Some politicians who were top presidential prospects just a few months ago,
such as former premier Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, are now
considering whether to run at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The three other men who have declared their candidacies stand no chance of
winning, analysts say. They expect Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who
lost to Yeltsin in 1996, to get 25 percent of the vote, and predict liberal
Grigory Yavlinsky and extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky will get about 5
percent each.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If everything stays the same, Vladimir Putin will win,'' Yavlinsky
conceded when he announced his own candidacy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from his strong popularity, Putin has an enormous advantage as the de
facto incumbent. He will get the full support of state-run television networks,
which already portray him daily as a dashing, competent leader and which likely
will be ready to attack any candidate who even looks like he could challenge
Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   Caught by surprise by Yeltsin's Dec. 31 resignation, rival candidates have
very little money and even less time to assemble campaigns. Regional governors
and big businesses will be wary of financing them because a Putin victory seems
inevitable -- and they'll want to stay on his good side and avoid making an
enemy of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the popularity of politicians can evaporate overnight in Russia and
things could go wrong for Putin, most analysts say the only real question is
whether he can win more than 50 percent of the votes and avoid a runoff with the
No. 2 vote-getter.
</P>
<P>
	   Some politicians worry a barely contested election may not be the best thing
for the country's fragile democracy. They say candidates and issues should get a
rigorous testing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there are no other contenders, that means we have no democracy,'' said
Vasily Starodubtsev, governor of Tula Province.
</P>
<P>
	   The election will be viewed as a test of how serious Putin is about his
commitment to continue democratic reforms and safeguard individual rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said he wants a clean election and criticized the Dec. 19
parliamentary elections, in which state TV mercilessly vilified some opposition
leaders. But Putin, who was prime minister, did not voice objections at the
time, and he was one of the main beneficiaries when parties allied to him did
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Russians applaud Putin's calls to revive the country as a global power and
support his tough handling of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Western analysts are wary of Putin, saying they detect an authoritarian
streak in the ex-KGB officer. Others say it is too early to tell, arguing his
intentions will become apparent only when he forms a government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we need to wait and see who's reappointed to the Cabinet and see
what figures emerge before we can really understand what policy directions he's
likely to take,'' said Rani Kronick, an analyst at Control Risks Group Ltd.

   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- Army Spc. Justin R. Fisher, charged as an
accessory to murder in the beating death of a barracks mate rumored to be gay,
pleaded guilty to lesser charges Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher, 26, admitted he lied to Army investigators and obstructed the
investigation when he wiped blood from a baseball bat used by Pvt. Calvin Glover
to kill Pfc. Barry Winchell.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plea agreement, the Army dropped other charges, including
participating as a principal to premeditated murder and acting as an accessory
after the fact.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher, of Lincoln, Neb., was expected to be sentenced Saturday, and he
could face 20 years in prison. His plea as a court-martial was scheduled to
begin.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month Glover, 19, was convicted in a court-martial of premeditated
murder and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Glover killed Winchell as he slept in his cot at Fort Campbell. There had
been a swirl of rumors on the post that Winchell, 21, of Kansas City, Mo., was
gay, and prosecutors said Glover was driven by hatred of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Glover, of Sulphur, Okla., never addressed the allegation that he despised
homosexuals. His attorneys argued that Fisher goaded Glover into the attack.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Leader Visits Dalai Lama  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPAK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- Still recuperating from an eight-day trek across
the Himalayas to escape Chinese-ruled Tibet, a teen-age Buddhist leader was all
smiles Saturday after a visit with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa, wearing a dark brown monk's robe and light orange scarf,
grinned as he walked easily from the gate of the Dalai Lama's house to a yellow
car.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-ager, who arrived unexpectedly at a hotel in this Indian city on
Wednesday, had been described by sources close to the Dalai Lama's
administration as exhausted and suffering from blistered feet and scratched
hands after his journey. He appeared well during the brief moments journalists
saw him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   His defection and that of five followers, including his 24-year-old sister,
a Buddhist nun, cheered Tibetan exiles, embarrassed Beijing and surprised the
Indian government. It is the most significant exodus since the Dalai Lama and
tens of thousands of Tibetans departed their homeland after a failed 1959
uprising against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama's administration-in-exile made its first public comment about
the defection Saturday. It has been quiet on the subject for fear of reprisals
in Tibet and out of consideration for India, which fought a war with China in
1962 but has recently enjoyed progress in trade relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is 14 years old and he has undertaken a long and difficult journey. He
is not talking properly. He is very tired and very restless,'' said Kalong Tashi
Wangdi, minister for religion and culture in the Dalai Lama's administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, monks lined up to present the teen with mustard-yellow wool
shawls, mushrooms and other gifts while the Dalai Lama's guard service and
Indian state police watched closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu religious order, escaped to India by
crossing Nepal on a route followed by most Tibetan refugees, said sources close
to the case who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa eluded his guards at the 800-year-old Tsurphu monastery in
central Tibet by saying he was going on retreat, the sources said. He and a few
followers set out across the mountains on Dec. 28, hiking along rocky paths
lined with thorny bushes.
</P>
<P>
	   Those close to the Dalai Lama's administration said the teen was frustrated
at not being allowed to meet with his teachers. Chinese authorities had
repeatedly denied a visa to his principle teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, who has a
monastery near Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   The escape could prod the Chinese communist leadership to intensify an
already stern four-year campaign to purge Tibetan monasteries of Dalai Lama
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibetan officials said they would talk with the Karmapa next week to discuss
his plans for the future. The only outsider to have met him is a mid-ranking
official from India's foreign ministry, officials in the Dalai Lama's exile
government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's Kagyupa sect, known as the ``Black Hats,'' was once Tibet's
most politically powerful but was supplanted by the Gelugpa school of the Dalai
Lamas 350 years ago. Leaders of the Tibetan sects are revered as the
reincarnations of their predecessors.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. TV Station Running Banner Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A local TV station doesn't have to take a break to
show its commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   WUHF-TV began displaying small text ads across the bottom of the screen
during some of its programs last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fox network affiliate is the first station to tuck banner ads into
television shows between the commercial breaks, the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The station was persuaded to give the ads a trial run by John Galbraith,
president of Twin Advertising Inc., who was looking for a novel way to advertise
a high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
	   "People may hate it, but you've got to try it," Galbraith said. "No one else
is trying it."
</P>
<P>
	   But one advertising expert doesn't like the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a viewer, I think it's disruptive," said Allen Banks, chairman of the
media policy committee at the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   WUHF is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, one of the country's largest
broadcast groups with 59 television stations. Rochester is not being used as a
test market for banner ads on other Sinclair stations, said Matt Kreiner, WUHF's
vice president and general manager.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nike Shirts Are Safe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Nike soccer jerseys pulled from store shelves across Germany
after a television report do not contain a dangerous amount of a toxic
antibacterial chemical, according to a report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Der Spiegel newsmagazine quoted an unnamed expert at Germany's federal
institute for consumer protection who said tests Friday found that the jerseys
posed ``no danger to health,'' and amounts of the chemical were far below risk
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike has said it would investigate whether the yellow-and-black jerseys
contain tributyltin, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for
ships.
</P>
<P>
	   At high levels in humans, experts say TBT is believed to cause neurological
problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver.
</P>
<P>
	   Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an
ideal additive for sports shirts. But British and Dutch tests have shown the
substance to cause mutations in marine snails, and the World Wildlife Fund is
calling for its global ban.
</P>
<P>
	   German public television's consumer show ``Plusminus'' reported a private
lab it commissioned to test clothing items found TBT and similar compounds in
the Nike jerseys and several other products. The items were chosen at random in
German stores, according to the report, which provided no figures on the TBT
levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The soccer jerseys caused the biggest storm because the club, 1997 European
champion Borussia Dortmund, has a big national following.
</P>
<P>
	   Three German department store chains stopped selling the shirts as a
precaution, and the club whose jerseys were tested suspended their sale at its
official fan store.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three other first-division clubs that use Nike jerseys have said
they were asking the company's German headquarters to confirm their equipment
was safe.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Girl Treated at US Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors are hopeful that a 14-year-old Kosovar girl who lost
her legs in a land mine explosion will walk again.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibadete Thaqi, who is being treated at a New York hospital, will be fitted
with temporary prostheses on Monday and will not need further surgery, her
doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She will leave walking without assistance,'' said Dr. David Helfet, head
of the Hospital for Special Surgery's orthopedic trauma service. ``She will
absolutely be walking in three to six months.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ibadete, who arrived in New York last week with her mother, lost both legs
in June after returning to Kosovo following the NATO bombing. She picked up a
bucket of water to help her mother clean the house, and a land mine hidden
inside the pail exploded, tearing both her legs off at the knees.
</P>
<P>
	   A Manhattan real-estate agent organized the financing for the trip and the
hospital is treating her for free.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm happy to be in America,'' she told reporters in English. Speaking
through a translator, she said she hopes to become a doctor.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Urge Progress on Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Saturday
called on President Clinton, currently mediating Israeli-Syrian peace talks, to
push Israeli-Palestinian negotiations forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat made the request after receiving holiday telephone calls from Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who were in Sheperdstown, W.Va., for the
talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   During their phone conversation, Barak and Arafat agreed to meet after the
Palestinian leader returns from a meeting with Clinton in Washington on Jan. 20,
Arafat aide Nabil Abourdeneh told the Palestinian News Agency WAFA.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask President Clinton to exert his efforts to see the implementation of
the agreements signed,'' Arafat said during a speech in Gaza on the occasion of
the Muslim feast of Eid al-Fitr, which began Friday and marks the end of the
holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat renewed his vow to establish a Palestinian state with its capital in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   Abourdeneh said Clinton told Arafat that he remained committed to advancing
the peace process and planned to formulate new ideas with Arafat during their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have expressed concern that negotiations with Syria would
distract Israel and the United States from the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the Palestinians have set a Feb. 13 deadline for completing the
broad outlines of a final peace treaty, which is to resolve issues such as
borders, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem, claimed
by each side as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Hearts of museum organizers heavy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ENFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Organizers of the proposed National Purple Heart
Museum are again under fire, this time for claiming they had the support of
Persian Gulf war commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.
<P>
	   Aside from telling a stranger two years ago that "of course" he would
support a museum for Purple Heart veterans, the twice-decorated Purple Heart
recipient said Friday he has had "zero involvement" with the project.
</P>
<P>
	   "I understand the advantage of using the name. Bit that, to me, is phony,"
Schwarzkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarzkopf denied he was ever a member of the museum's advisory board, as
directors of the National Purple Heart Museum Committee Inc. indicated in their
push for millions of dollars in private donations.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as a formal membership, I don't like to go on boards of directors or
chairmanships if I can't make a personal commitment," Schwarzkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph M. Donahue, the former executive director of the museum, disputed the
general's claim that he had no involvement with the charity.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment. A
telephone message was left for him at his office Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed a critical report this
week, claiming the museum's board of directors had spent $620,000 - $500,000 in
state money and $120,000 in private donations - with only a set of architectural
plans worth about $33,000 to show for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal also said bookkeeping records for the National Purple Heart
Museum Committee Inc. are so incomplete that it is nearly impossible to track
how and when money was spent.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're way out of line here," Charles Alfano, the museum's current
executive director said of Blumenthal's report. "In total, maybe under $20,000
is in question - not hundreds of thousands."
</P>
<P>
	   The committee was formed in 1986 to build a museum dedicated to recipients
of the Purple Heart service award. It received $250,000 in state grant money for
planning and design costs in 1992, and $1 million in 1998 - half of which was
supposed to be matched with private donations.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization also has failed to collect the $18.75 million of private
donations it promised to raise in its 1997 state grant application, Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue left his post as executive director in April, and now works for a
branch of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Blumenthal's investigation, Donahue took a $6,000 private
donation for the museum, kept $500 and funneled the rest to his wife's bank
account in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfano was appointed to his unpaid position in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest cost estimate to build the museum is nearly $19 million, but the
volunteer board of directors now has only a few thousand dollars, including a
$16,000 fund for commemorative bricks, and roughly $850,000 left of a $1 million
grant promised by the state.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Vow Vigorous Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore, debating Saturday for the
second time in four days, promised a vigorous confrontation as the former
senator defends his ``big ideas'' campaign and the vice president his missteps
that angered blacks and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-man battle for the Democratic presidential nomination intensified
less than three weeks before the leadoff precinct caucuses in Iowa, where Gore
leads Bradley in the polls, and less than a month before the primary in New
Hampshire where the contenders are neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think vigorous competition is good for our democracy,'' Gore said,
vowing to draw sharp distinctions with Bradley on issues such as health care,
education and farming policy, which is especially important in Iowa. ``I intend
to get it on the agenda,'' he said of farming.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, a former professional basketball player, said he was relished sharp
exchanges and called the series of debates -- their fifth since the fall --
``exercises in discipline'' and ``kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``People used to come off the bench and give me an elbow to get me off my
game,'' said Bradley. ``All that stuff just rolls off my back.''
</P>
<P>
	   The afternoon debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, and editor
Dennis Ryerson was moderating. The format called for him to pose questions to
the candidates submitted by readers, but the candidates also were given a chance
to question each other.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate, televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, was set in a suburban
public TV station before a carefully selected audience of 300. Questions were
coming from that audience as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates came into the debate on the defensive: Gore mending fences
with Gen. Colin Powell and backpedaling on a sticky question of gays in the
military, and Bill Bradley buying $250,000 worth of TV ad time to justify the
premise of his ``big ideas'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore criticized Bradley agenda, which he said is top-heavy with a massive
health care plan, to Ronald Reagan's for its focus on only ``one or two
things.'' The Bradley campaign responded by putting up a new television ad that
would pelt New Hampshire voters five or six times on Manchester TV and another
five or six times from nearby Boston stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People accuse me of offering big ideas that they say are risky,'' Bradley
says in the ad. ``I say the real risk is not doing the things I've set out to do
in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   It marked the first time that Bradley, in his active ad campaign, used a
spot to respond to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Over in the Gore camp, the vice president spent Friday evening in
damage-control mode, trying to clear up an embarrassment caused by his campaign
manager, and retracting comments he made in a Wednesday debate that he would set
a ``litmus test,'' requiring candidates for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree
with his intention to let gays serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into
the personal political opinions of officers in the U.S. military,'' Gore said in
a hastily called news conference in Iowa after his comments sparked criticism
from former members of the joint chiefs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, when asked if he would make agreement on gays in the military a
litmus test for appointments to the joint chiefs, told the debate moderator it
was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
	   On another sticky matter, Gore stood by his campaign manager Donna Brazile
for saying in a recent interview that Republicans used blacks like General Colin
Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to pose for pictures, but
did not really care about them.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell responded with an angry letter to the Gore campaign that he
distributed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Brazile and Gore separately telephoned Powell. Gore refused to say whether
either of them apologized outright.
</P>
<P>
	   While some worry that the competitive Democratic fight will damage the
party's chances to hold the White House in November, both Gore and Bradley have
dismissed those worries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that people in New Hampshire and Iowa are beginning to pay
attention,'' said Bradley. ``I don't think there's national attention. That
starts after Iowa and New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said, ``A fair debate on the issues is healthy.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Family Planning Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal spending for contraception and other family
planning services in the United States would rise by $35 million, the largest
increase in two decades, under a proposal Saturday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said the program will promote strong children, healthy
families and make abortion less frequent at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said his 2001 budget proposal will
include $35 million more for such services in the United States. The White House
said the money will not pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   It is aimed instead at helping to prevent unwanted pregnancies among poor
women, teen-agers and women with reduced access to health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make
abortion more rare,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase would bring the total administration proposal for
family planning in the United States to $274 million for next year, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would be shared among 4,600 clinics nationwide and would pay for
what the White House called ``the full range of reproductive health services,''
including keeping contraceptives available and affordable. It also would pay for
teen-age counseling including support for educational programs ``that encourage
young people to postpone sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These services make a critical difference in people's lives,'' Clinton
said. The White House said the money will help prevent more than one million
unintended pregnancies a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is seeking $169 million in new money for family planning and
counseling services overseas. That amounts to a 45 percent increase over the
fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am asking Congress to support these funds, and to provide them without
restrictions that hamper the work of family planning organizations, and even bar
them from discussing or debating reproductive health policies,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a deal last year to persuade Congress to release $926 million in
back payments to the United Nations, the administration reluctantly accepted
restrictions on $385 million in federal funds for groups that perform abortions,
or lobby for liberalized abortion laws internationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said then he would try to remove the restrictions, which barred U.S.
money to private family planning groups that perform or promote abortions, even
with their own money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When children are born healthy and mothers and families gain control over
their lives, communities are stronger, economic progress is faster and the
future is brighter for everyone,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> Payment delay forces state to halt anti-tobacco ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey health officials have halted their
"Don't Get Sucked In" anti-smoking campaign because a legal dispute is delaying
the state's first installment in national tobacco settlement money.
<P>
	   The state Department of Health and Senior Services has begun taking down
about 70 billboards and pulling television and radio advertisements educating
young people about the health effects of smoking, The Record of Hackensack
reported in Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   A dispute over plaintiffs' legal fees in the government settlement has
delayed the first installment payment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is scheduled to receive $7.5 billion from tobacco companies over
25 years. It is one of only six states that have not yet received any money from
the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   State health officials had planned to use $7.2 million from the first
settlement payment to expand its existing ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The lease for "Don't Get Sucked In" billboards expired at the end of 1999,
and the state is out of money to continue all but a few of them, said health
department spokesman Tom Breslin. The $2 million in state funding for television
and radio spots and movie trailers also ran out at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-smoking activists criticized the legal dispute that prompted the
suspension of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "An opportunity to warn youth about the dangers of tobacco has been lost
because the settlement has been delayed," said Larry Downs, director of the
anti-tobacco group New Jersey Breathes.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys representing a Passaic County smoker and the family of a Bergen
County woman have filed motions to force the state's attorneys to share legal
fees from the massive settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Attorney General's office has asked state courts to expedite a decision
on the dispute, but no action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The state cannot receive any settlement money until a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is scheduled to receive $247 million from the tobacco settlement
this year. The state has agreed to spend $775 million over 30 years on tobacco
control programs.

    NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The World Health Organization chief warned that
tobacco could take a ghastly toll in developing countries unless nations act
swiftly to control the substance.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco kills half its consumers, and could take 10 million lives annually

	   If countries do not act soon, tobacco will kill more people in the next 30
years than the combined toll from malaria, tuberculosis and child diseases,
Brundtland warned.
</P>
<P>
	   She spoke at a conference on Global Tobacco Control Law, sponsored by the
WHO, which is looking to gather support for a global treaty on tobacco control.
</P>
<P>
	   Brundtland noted that tobacco kills one person every eight seconds -- 4
million preventable deaths annually. But she said health risks from tobacco are
widely underestimated.
</P>
<P>
	   "The tobacco industry subverted science, economics and political processes
to market a lethal and inherently defective product that imposed a massive
burden of disease and death on countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Inaugurating the conference, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said
young Indians make up nearly 17 percent of tobacco addicts and should be denied
access to the substance.
</P>
<P>
	   But Vajpayee said any legal measure to control the consumption of tobacco
must be accompanied by job creation for those who now work in the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
	   India is the third-largest producer of tobacco, with nearly one million
people involved in its cultivation. Some 4.5 million others are engaged in
making bidis, cheap hand-rolled cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tobacco control must be seen to confer the riches of good health, while
advancing the health of economy," Vajpayee said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes 'Renewal' Tax-Relief Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republicans are offering a tax-relief package this
year that will revive a once-failed bill to create ``renewal communities''
through tax incentives, the bill's sponsor said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the sun rises on a new century, we are ready to take the next steps,''
Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said in the weekly Republican radio address. ``For
starters, we will give you much-deserved tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said his bill, one of three main elements of this year's GOP tax-cut
package, will ``help poor neighborhoods become prosperous'' by bringing new jobs
and encouraging savings.
</P>
<P>
	   Other goals of the tax package, Watts said, are elimination of the
``marriage penalty'' and creation of tax-free education savings accounts that
would allow parents to put aside $2,000 annually for each child's education. The
``marriage penalty'' is the additional income tax that many two-income married
couples now have to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, chairman of the House Republican Conference, first proposed the
``American Community Renewal Act'' in 1994. It passed the House but did not make
it through the Republican-controlled Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., revived it in July as President Clinton was
about to go on a tour of poor urban areas to publicize his ``New Market
Initiative'' economic recovery plan for inner cities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Watts said the bill ``offers tax incentives to struggling rural
and urban communities. It will create jobs, encourage savings and help poor
neighborhoods become prosperous. That helps all Americans.''

<HEADLINE> NRC reaffirms sanctions against managers at nuclear plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERFORD, Conn. (AP) - Federal regulators have reaffirmed the decision
to sanction four Millstone nuclear power plant executives for harassment of
workers who raised questions about plant safety.
<P>
	   The Nuclear Regulatory Agency's report released Friday concluded that the
executives discriminated against the employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRC also released to The Day newspaper summaries of the investigations
it conducted into allegations of discrimination and harassment at Millstone.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper first requested the records under the federal Freedom of
Information Act in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents outline examples of worker harassment and raise questions
about whether documents were destroyed as part of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the four men sanctioned Friday remain with Northeast Utilities. Two
of them still hold management positions at Millstone.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric DeBarba, a former vice president at Millstone, received the severest
penalty, a "Level 2" violation. He was not fined.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRC cited him for his role in 1993 in demoting two supervisors who had
sought to address safety problems at the Millstone nuclear plants. DeBarba was
fired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, DeBarba returned to the company, hired as an account manager in
the company's Select Energy Division.
</P>
<P>
	   The other three sanctioned individuals received written reprimands. Among
them is Hollis Risley, who worked directly under DeBarba and was also cited for
his role in the unfair demotion of two supervisors in 1993. Risley is no longer
with NU. He works as a consultant to nuclear utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Also receiving written reprimands were Raymond P. Necci, currently vice
president of engineering services, and Steven A. Sudigala, a manager at
Millstone.
</P>
<P>
	   They were charged with an act of retaliation for the decision to fire an
employee who had raised safety concerns about problems with the system that
detects pipe breaks that, if left unchecked, could lead to a nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally, the NRC Enforcement Office concluded there was not sufficient
evidence of discrimination, a decision that was met by protest from elected
leaders and the public.
</P>
<P>
	   A special review committee concluded that the evidence could support a
finding of discrimination, which in turn led to the NRC's decision to hand down
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Pillittere, a spokesman for NU, said that despite the sanctions, both
Necci and Sudigala have the support and backing of Chief Nuclear Officer Leon J.
Olivier.
</P>
<P>
	   "Based on their recent performance in effectively handling employee issues
and other matters and on reviews of their performance, we believe that they are
now and will continue to be first-rate members of the Millstone team,"
Pillittere said.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Kosovar girl will walk again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Doctors are hopeful that a 14-year-old Kosovar girl who
lost her legs to a land mine will be able to walk again.
<P>
	   Ibadete Thaqi, who is being treated at a New York hospital, will be fitted
with temporary prostheses on Monday and will not need further surgery, her
doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "She will leave walking without assistance," said Dr. David Helfet, head of
the Hospital for Special Surgery's orthopedic trauma service. "She will
absolutely be walking in three to six months."
</P>
<P>
	   Ibadete, who arrived in New York on Thursday with her mother, lost both legs
in June, after returning to Kosovo following the NATO bombing. She picked up a
bucket of water to help her mother clean the house, but a land mine was hidden
inside the pail, and it tore both her legs off at the knees.
</P>
<P>
	   Well-wishers are helping to pay her expenses in New York, and the hospital
is treating her for free.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm happy to be in America," she told reporters in English. Speaking
through a translator, she then said she hopes to become a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Ibadete's new physical therapist says if she works hard, she'll make a good
recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "She is young and obviously fit and keen to get going," said therapist Paddy
Rossbach.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Have Slow First Week  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- The Israelis and Syrians began the week
chugging along the path to peace. A couple of days later they were trotting. At
the end of the week, they were moving on down the track.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the State Department's assessment of five days of talks between the
two longtime foes -- diplomatic-speak for little progress achieved.
</P>
<P>
	   During that period, there were only two face-to-face meetings between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
And that took President Clinton four trips to this town to arrange.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, most of the negotiating was done indirectly in separate, bilateral
meetings between the U.S. team and the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks, which recessed for the Jewish Sabbath and the Muslim feast
marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, were not expected to resume before
Sunday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I indicated that my definition of progress is going to be where we've
moved forward; where new ideas have gelled. And when I'm ready to report
progress, I will do so,'' said State Department spokesman James Rubin at a
briefing Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a long, longstanding dispute,'' added Rubin. ``It is one that is
very emotional and very substantive and carries with it enormous security
implications. We don't expect in a few days for those kind of issues to move
dramatically forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was a lot of expectation in the Middle East last week that the
Shepherdstown negotiations -- the most technical since 1996 -- would plunge
immediately into serious discussions on the four main core issues keeping the
parties apart: demarcation of borders, security arrangements, water rights and
normal, peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the talks got mired in procedural quibbling almost from the start, with
the two sides divided over what to talk about first. Neither side wants to make
a concession without knowing exactly what they are getting in return.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis wanted first to discuss security -- their major concern -- wrap
up that issue and move to another subject. The Syrians refused, saying the root
problem -- Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights -- and the demarcation of
borders should be addressed first.
</P>
<P>
	   A compromise was reached whereby all the four working groups handling the
contentious issues would meet concurrently.
</P>
<P>
	   But by midday Saturday only the security and normal relations committees had
met. Rubin said Friday that the panels on the timetable of Israeli withdrawal
and on water resources would convene before the round ends.
</P>
<P>
	   In an attempt to break the impasse, Clinton on Friday presented Barak and
al-Sharaa with a U.S. working document providing a summary of the issues to be
decided and the differences between the parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin sidestepped questions on whether the document could be a base for an
eventual peace treaty, saying only ``it's a very interesting interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
	   William Quandt, who had taken part in the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations that
led to the 1979 Camp David agreement, said the hurdles are surmountable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every negotiation I've been at ... just before the agreement is reached it
looks like it's about to collapse. Always,'' said Quandt, who was on the
National Security Council staff in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are tough issues. They're serious,'' he added. ``But I would be
surprised if either side walks out over a minor issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quandt said that during the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations there were long
periods when there did not seem to be any significant progress.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that in 13 days of talks, Israeli Prime Minister Menachim Begin and
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat held sessions the first couple of days with
President Carter that were ``very acrimonious, very unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``After that Carter kept them apart until everything has been agreed upon at
which point they only met when they signed the agreement,'' Quandt said. ``So
it's not unprecedented for things to get off to a slow start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Few face-to-face encounters means the two sides have not had much
opportunity to work on building rapport.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak made an effort at a reception where Clinton was the host Tuesday,
speaking in Arabic to the Syrian delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said that following the second face-to-face between Barak and
al-Sharaa that took place Friday, Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright felt that the chemistry has improved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lot of face-to-face give-and-take,'' said Rubin. ``This is not
warm and fuzzy, but it is businesslike and professional and obviously personal
to some extent.''

<HEADLINE> German Party Unsure of Kohl Stance  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORDERSTEDT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's conservatives headed onto the
campaign trail in a northern German state Saturday still confused about their
stance toward Helmut Kohl, the former leader mired in a party finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   While some leaders of Kohl's Christian Democrat party shun him, others
defend as a valuable campaigner the chancellor who presided over the
reunification of Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the Christian Democrats, Germany's main opposition party, ended a
two-day strategy session by declaring themselves united in their desire to clear
up the scandal while also campaigning aggressively for coming elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We haven't won yet, but we're on the right path,'' said party leader
Wolfgang Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders have repeatedly urged Kohl to clear up suspicions surrounding
up to $1 million in cash donations the ex-chancellor accepted in the 1990s and
kept off the party's books, apparently in violation of the law. Kohl has refused
to identify the donors, saying he promised them anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as he doesn't name the names, it's damaging for the Christian
Democrats,'' said one party leader, Heiner Geissler.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl skipped the two-day meeting. But he still cast a shadow here in
Schleswig-Holstein state, where Feb. 27 elections are the first test of voter
reaction to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Volker Ruehe, the party's gubernatorial candidate, has defended his decision
not to have Kohl campaign for him. But the candidate in another state election
in May said he would welcome appearances by Kohl.
</P>
<P>
	   That candidate, Juergen Ruettgers, denied a report suggesting Kohl was
fanning a power struggle by promising to support his campaign in North
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, and pushing him to run for
party chairman. In both states, the Christian Democrats want to wrest power from
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl denied he was pulling strings behind the scenes, calling the report in
Saturday's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper ``freely fabricated.'' But the episode
underlined the party's troubles in extricating itself from its former boss, who
quit as party chairman after his 1998 election defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking to rally party activists and reverse a free fall in opinion polls,
the Christian Democrats launched their campaign in Schleswig-Holstein with an
attack on higher gasoline taxes that took effect Jan. 1. Schroeder opens his
governing party's campaign Sunday in the state capital, Kiel.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Democrat leaders seemed relieved that recent infighting over
whether Kohl should withdraw from politics entirely -- he still is a member of
parliament and honorary party chairman -- subsided ahead of the campaign
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Bavaria's rightist governor Edmund Stoiber, who heads the affiliated,
Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, warned against disunity in the conservative
camp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Weeks of debates about whether the Kohl era is over or not don't lead
anywhere,'' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmates Featured in Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH GREENSPAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Fashion giant Benetton is joining Italy's offensive against the
death penalty with its latest advertising campaign -- piercing portraits of
American death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The posters, which will hit billboards worldwide at the end of January,
feature death-row inmates in prison uniforms staring into the camera over the
words, ``Sentenced to Death.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prisoner's name, date of birth, crime and expected method of execution
follows.
</P>
<P>
	   Photographer Oliviero Toscani, known for socially provocative Benetton ads
that seemingly have little to do with fashion, visited prisons across the United
States over two years to create the series, called ``Looking Death in the
Face.''
</P>
<P>
	   Toscani is now promoting his campaign in the United States, where the number
of executions last year was the highest it has been since 1954. Toscani said he
wanted to foster debate on capital punishment, even at the cost of losing
American customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, that may happen,'' Saturday's English-language ``Italy Daily''
quoted him as saying. ``But as a result of the campaign, we may gain new
customers. If advertising made everyone happy, it would be an act of
hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Italians, longtime opponents of the death penalty, increasingly are
crusading against its use abroad. Over the coming year, Rome's Colosseum is to
be lit up for 48 hours every time a death sentence is commuted anywhere in the
world or a country abolishes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the late 1980s, when Toscani took over the fashion giant's
advertising, Benetton has made headlines with ads addressing such topics as AIDS
and racism -- sometimes at the cost of accusations that it provokes or
sympathizes simply to promote sales.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, AIDS groups in France sued over Benetton ads that showed the words
``HIV positive'' on buttocks and other body parts, calling them ``commercial
exploitation of suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the 1990s, the Roman Catholic Church protested a campaign that
featured models dressed as a priest and a nun kissing, and some human rights
groups condemned ads that showed what was supposed to be the bloodied clothing
of a Bosnian war victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton concedes the ads are meant to increase consumer awareness of the
label -- but says they also are intended to raise awareness on social issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing its death-row campaign, Benetton credited itself with
``tearing down the wall of international indifference.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one answered the phones at Benetton headquarters on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italian-based vendor of trendy sweaters, scarves and other clothing for
men, women and children has retail stores worldwide. Forbes magazine listed the
Luciano Benetton family at No. 111 on its list of billionaires last year, with
$4 billion in wealth.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Interior Secretary Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Former U.S. Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan
Jr. was in stable condition Saturday following a heart attack he suffered
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The 71-year-old Lujan, a former 10-term New Mexico congressman, had a heart
attack Thursday night and underwent surgery at the Heart Hospital of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was more serious than a mild heart attack,'' said Vince McVittie, vice
president of business development for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Jean Lujan, said doctors plan to release her husband early next
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan has suffered from cardiac problems for years. He had a heart attack in
1983 and underwent a triple bypass. In 1996, both he and his brother, Edward,
spent time in the hospital after suffering mild heart attacks just days apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Lujan, a Republican, served 20 years in the U.S. House from the 1st
Congressional District. He retired in 1988. President Bush appointed him
secretary of the Interior Department in 1989, an office he held for four years.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Regulators' Letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Saturday he only was trying to
protect consumers and prod regulators to act when he wrote letters on behalf of
large donors and other companies in his capacity as Commerce Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have acted on one fundamental principal and that is to try to protect
the consumer,'' the GOP presidential contender said while campaigning in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., said most of the 500 letters he has written to regulators
urged them to act on matters concerning telecommunications and airlines that
were languishing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An overwhelming majority of these communications are, 'please act, please
act,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator wrote federal regulators on behalf of more than a dozen
contributors over the past three years, according to hundreds of documents being
made public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The memos show McCain intervened just as forcefully on behalf of companies
that did not give to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in a July 1999 letter to Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard, McCain complained about the delay in transferring a
broadcast license for a Texas radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, an outspoken supporter of campaign finance reform, complained he was
being held to a different standard compared with other members of Congress, most
of whom write federal agencies on behalf of constituents and donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Take a look at what other congressmen and senators do,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that in keeping most of his letters focused getting regulators
to act on matter of public interest, he was adhering to a higher standard than
others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is the standard and am I acting in higher standard? I think so,'' he
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain weighed in on behalf of BellSouth, trying to offer long-distance
service; Ameritech, trying to merge with SBC Communications; America West
airlines, trying to offer airline service out of Flagstaff Airport; and other
corporate givers.
</P>
<P>
	   In one such letter, McCain urged the Federal Communications Commission in
the fall of 1998 to give ``serious consideration'' to BellSouth's request to
offer long-distance service. BellSouth employees are the third-largest
contributor to his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks after Ameritech's chairman held a fund-raiser for him last spring,
McCain sent a stinging letter to federal regulators accusing them of being
unfair toward the phone company's proposed merger with another Bell company.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter accused the commission of ``applying a different, and much
stricter, burden of proof in this merger proceeding than the commission has
applied in evaluating other mergers.''
</P>
<P>
	   It also said, ``This letter expresses no view on the merits of any issues in
this proceeding and is not written to benefit any particular party.''
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were provided to The Associated Press by the Senate Commerce
Committee on Friday. Besides the memos written on behalf of donors, there were
hundreds of letters written in response to individuals, including more than 20
letters referred to the Transportation Department from travel agents upset about
airlines capping their commissions.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Violence Stops on Holiday  </HEADLINE>
   By IRWAN FIRDAUS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Thousands of Muslims left their weapons at home
Saturday as Islamic religious holidays quelled two weeks of bloody
Muslim-Christian fighting in eastern Indonesia's islands.
</P>
<P>
	   Troubled Maluku and North Maluku provinces were quiet as Muslims prayed on
the holiday of Eid al-Fitr and celebrated in the streets under heavy security.
The holiday marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last year the violence started on Eid al-Fitr. Let us hope this year's
celebration means an end to the fighting,'' said Sanusi, a Muslim cleric in
Maluku's capital, Ambon. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite calls for peace for the holiday, Indonesia's military took no
chances. Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers, backed up by armored personnel
carriers, stood guard across the badly damaged town in case fighting broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a year ago, as Muslims celebrated the Eid al-Fitr holiday week, a
minor scuffle in Ambon sparked violent clashes that have left at least 1,800
dead. In the past two weeks alone, officials say hundreds of people have been
killed in pitched battles across the provinces, some 1,600 miles east of
Jakarta, the national capital.
</P>
<P>
	   In Ternate in North Maluku, the site of some of the worst fighting in recent
days, hundreds of people took to the streets Saturday to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even the refugees who have come from other islands are celebrating,'' said
one resident, Maruf Rifai.
</P>
<P>
	   Jakarta was also quiet Saturday following three days of large Muslim
protests. On Friday, about 80,000 Muslim demonstrators threatened to declare a
holy war if the government did not immediately put an end to the sectarian
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maluku provinces were known as the Molaccas or Spice Islands during
Dutch colonial rule. Christians used to have a small majority in the provinces,
but an influx of Muslims from Indonesia's other islands over the past two
decades has changed the religious makeup.

<HEADLINE> Irish Record Shows 1969 Arms Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- Three Northern Ireland legislators appealed to
Ireland for rifles to protect Catholics when sectarian violence erupted in the
British province three decades ago, according to government documents released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislators turned up at the foreign ministry in Dublin on the night of Aug.
30, 1969, to ask for smuggled arms, saying ``a few hundred rifles'' from the
Irish Army could ``easily be lost and would not be missed,'' the records showed.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislators were identified as Paddy Devlin, then of the Northern
Ireland Labor Party, Paddy Kennedy of Republican Labor, and Paddy O'Hanlon, an
independent from County Armagh. Devlin and Kennedy are both dead.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were members of a Northern Ireland assembly which was dismantled
by Britain because of the unrest. A new Northern Ireland Cabinet of Protestants
and Catholics was formed recently under the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The records, released because 30 years have elapsed, said legislators
demanded to see Ireland's then prime minister, Jack Lynch, but were seen instead
by an official of the External Affairs department, now called Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   They told the official that the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland was
under attack, including by the since-disbanded B Specials police unit, and was
in danger of being squeezed into a Catholic ghetto in the Falls Road area of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He (Kennedy) said that soon the whole Catholic population in Belfast would
be concentrated in the Falls Road area and they would be massacred,'' the
documents said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the three men left close to midnight, extra police guards were mounted
at Lynch's residence, the documents said -- implying that the request was
refused.

<HEADLINE> LA May Limit Cops in Anti-Gang Unit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Officers working in police department's anti-gang unit
could be limited to three years on the detail under changes proposed by Chief
Bernard Parks to reform the embattled division.
</P>
<P>
	   The unit has emerged at the center of the worst Los Angeles police
corruption scandal in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, four people have been released from prison, other convictions have
been thrown out and a dozen officers have been removed from active duty amid
allegations that arrests were fabricated and suspects were shot by police
officers for no reason.
</P>
<P>
	   At the center of the probe is the department's Rampart Division and its
Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums, or CRASH, unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the changes detailed Friday is a limit to an officer's time on the
detail to three years. The department is also considering changing the unit's
name and increasing the supervision of anti-gang officers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are making some realignments and some consolidation,'' said Dennis
Zine, vice president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League. ``They are not
calling for the disbandment of police involvement in the gang area.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not abolishing the anti-gang program at all,'' added Sgt. John
Pasquariello, a police spokesman. ``We're making it better and a little more
accountable.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Emigration to Israel Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian emigration to Israel was more than twice as high in
1999 as in the previous year, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Moscow office of the Jewish Agency, which brings Jews to
Israel, 29,534 Russian citizens emigrated to Israel in 1999, up from 13,019 a
year earlier, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The news agency quoted the executive vice president of the Russian Jewish
Congress, Alexander Osovtsov, as saying that the main factors behind the
increase were Russia's 1998 economic crisis and ``general political instability,
(including) the fact that last year's anti-Semitic component was far more in the
center of attention in society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups, although small, have steadily grown bolder
and more visible in Russia in recent years. They have been accused of beating
members of racial minorities, desecrating Jewish cemeteries and bombing
synagogues.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian law bars ``inciting interethnic strife,'' authorities have
rarely tried to punish anti-Semitic statements frequently made by various
political groups.

<HEADLINE> Austria Coalition Return Possible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Three months after inconclusive national elections,
Austria's old coalition partners could form a new government next week, the head
of the conservative party told a leading weekly.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schuessel was quoted by Format magazine as saying that his
conservative People's Party would not turn down the leading Social Democrats if
they are ``ready to do the things which are necessary.'' The conservatives have
long advocated membership in NATO, while the Social Democrats have insisted on
maintaining neutrality.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview is to be published Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservatives have governed with the Social Democrats for 13 years, but
the balance was upset in Oct. 3 elections with the second-place finish of Joerg
Haider's Freedom Party, which ran on an anti-immigrant platform. The Social
Democrats finished first, but didn't have enough support to form a majority
government on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel, whose party finished third, told Format he would not rule out
cooperation with Haider's Freedom Party if talks with the Social Democrats fail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Toward the end of the week, we must see whether it's going to be a go,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Trump Distances Self From Combs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. (AP) -- In his book, possible presidential candidate
Donald Trump credited his ``friendship'' with rap mogul Sean ``Puffy'' Combs for
helping him become more tolerant. Now that Combs faces a gun possession charge,
Trump says they're not very close.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Puffy's a good guy as far as I know, but I don't know him really well,''
Trump said Friday before meetings with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Trump is
considering a presidential run as a Reform party candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   In ``The America We Deserve,'' Trump lists Combs among others who have
helped him learn tolerance. The list also includes boxers Muhammad Ali and Joe
Frazier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Through them, and through more recent friendships with Puffy Combs, Sammy
Sosa and others, I've had the chance to learn firsthand about the diversity of
American culture ...,'' the book says.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and actress-singer girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were arrested after a
Dec. 27 shooting at a New York City night club. Combs and two bodyguards were
charged with illegal gun possession over a weapon allegedly found in the vehicle
they were riding in.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs has vehemently denied owning the gun. A Combs protege, Jamal ``Shyne''
Barrow, was charged with attempted murder in the shooting that wounded three.

absentia by Spanish opera lovers who were angry because he didn't show up for a
concert.
</P>

<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Playing slain Tejano singer Selena in a new musical will
be so demanding it will take two lead performers to keep the show going.
</P>
<P>
	   Texan Rebecca Valadez will alternate with New York-based singer Veronica
Vasquez in the title role of "Selena Forever," which debuts in San Antonio in
March before going on a 30-city tour, and ultimately on to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   Valadez, 21, of San Antonio was a backup singer on the 1998 Janet Jackson
tour.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels fantastic to be a part of this," she told the San Antonio
Express-News. "I feel good about the singing and the dancing, but the acting is
new to me."
</P>
<P>
	   Director Bill Virchis said producers chose two actresses to play Selena as
an adult because of the part's physical demands.
</P>
<P>
	   "The young lady will have to sing 14, 15 songs a night, up to seven or eight
nights a week," Virchis said. "It's unheard of."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Mexican Truck Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican trucks will not be allowed to cross the border
into the United States unless they meet U.S. safety standards, despite the
country's trade alliance, White House officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing a policy in place since 1995, the Department of Transportation
has decided, "because of unresolved safety issues," not to remove restrictions
on trucks crossing the border between Mexico and the United States, White House
spokesman Jim Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Department of Transportation has said it will not let Mexican trucks
cross the border and enter the United States unless it is sure Mexican carriers
are in compliance with American safety regulations," Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Discussions continue between the two governments continue, and there is a
possibility of convening an arbitration panel to review the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which drew the United States,
Canada and Mexico into a new trade alliance, gave Mexican trucks unrestricted
access to the United States, beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But that timetable twice has been pushed back amid pressure from organized
labor in the United States and concerns about the safety of Mexican trucks.
Mexican trucks frequently have been found not to meet U.S. weight, driver and
insurance standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The new date for compliance was Jan. 1, 2000. But Kennedy said many Mexican
trucks still do not meet U.S. safety standards.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 250 members of Congress asked the White House in June to again
delay granting Mexican truckers the unfettered access to the United States
provided by the NAFTA agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   "We write to urge you to maintain U.S.-Mexican border trucking
restrictions," the lawmakers wrote Clinton. "They are essential to our ability
to protect the safety of the traveling public and our commercial drivers."
</P>
<P>
	   They said they wanted current safeguards to "remain firmly in place" until
the two countries agree on safety standards, enforcement programs and adequate
staffing levels for inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico has protested the U.S. reluctance to allow its truckers access,
saying the delays violate NAFTA. The United States has pressed Mexico for more
aggressive truck inspections before the vehicles enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   A report last year by the Transportation Department's inspector general
found inspections for only 17,332 of the 3.5 million trucks entering the United
States from Mexico in fiscal year 1997. Some 44 percent of those vehicles
inspected were taken out of service due to serious safety concerns.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Protests Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case, said
Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the child
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil disobedience
campaign,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The organizers cited a ``more positive course'' in the ongoing custody
battle over the 6-year-old. That included a subpoena issued Friday by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House committee and efforts by
Elian's relatives to attain custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First thing that we want to see soon is that the administration is willing
to allow this process to take the course of family court, and perhaps also we
would like to see the administration more willing to listen to us,'' Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed
Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian
will actually be asked to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one
who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a
pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags
and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
</P>
<P>
	   Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the
child is reunited with his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me. I don't want to go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his
mother, stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States. Two
other adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that
would allow him to seek asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Stefan Savov, a dissident who rose to become the
speaker of Bulgaria's parliament, died Saturday, the national news agency BTA
said. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   BTA did not give the cause of death, but said he had suffered from a
prolonged illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Savov served as speaker from 1991 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Jan. 8, 1924, and graduated from law school in Sofia after World
War II. But he was sent to a labor camp when the communists came to power
because his father had been a government minister in the pro-Nazi government.
</P>
<P>
	   Barred from practicing law because of his background, Savov took
construction jobs after his prison term and worked as a Spanish-language
translator.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989, he helped found the anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces and
became speaker after the party earned a victory in 1991 elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The incumbent speaker of parliament, Yordan Sokolov, praised Savov's
contribution to the ``restoring of democratic traditions in the country's
political life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Savov, a widower, is survived by his son.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Washington Bunker Role  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Debating in Iowa, Vice President Al Gore told
Democratic rival Bill Bradley on Saturday that he's not in a Washington bunker
trying to fend off the scandals of the past, he's on ``the front lines in the
battle for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was an echo of their last debate, in New Hampshire, and Gore delivered
his answer in opening this round. ``I want to start by telling you what we were
doing in that Washington bunker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the administration has delivered new jobs, reformed welfare, and
strengthened the economy, and that his goals as president would produce more
progress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's not a bunker,'' Gore said. ``Those are the front lines in the fight
for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   They went on to argue a familiar topic, health insurance, Bradley again
accusing the vice president of misrepresenting his position by saying it would
undermine Medicare and do away with Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd replace Medicaid with something better,'' Bradley said, accusing Gore
of always conveniently ignoring that.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he wants to come back to Iowa and debate Bradley on agricultural
policy. He rolled out his challenge to twice weekly debates with no more
television ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer?'' he asked Bradley, who ignored it.
</P>
<P>
	   On agriculture, Bradley said family farmers have had no real help, ``no
safety net whatsoever,'' from the current administration. The former New Jersey
senator said he wants policy changes to help small farmers. ``You can talk about
the past, but I want to talk about the future,'' Bradley told Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he could understand Bradley's reluctance to talk about the past,
saying his rival had voted against emergency aid to farmers in midwest floods,
and against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa, demanding
that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified commodities. Europe and
Japan resist those products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy,'' said Gore, who
said ``sound science'' should govern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get
access to markets,'' said Bradley. ``The problem with agriculture in America is
serious, in Iowa it's dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Iowa poll showed the challenge facing Bradley; Gore led him by 21
percentage points in a survey for the Des Moines Register among Democrats who
said they intend to vote in the party caucuses two weeks from Monday.

	   The organizers cited a ``more positive course'' in the ongoing custody
battle over the 6-year-old. That included a subpoena issued Friday by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House committee and efforts by
Elian's relatives to attain custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated they support the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``First thing that we want to see soon is that the administration is willing
to allow this process to take the course of family court, and perhaps also we
would like to see the administration more willing to listen to us,'' Sanchez
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed
Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian
will actually be asked to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one
who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a
pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags
and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
</P>
<P>
	   Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the
child is reunited with his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me. I don't want to go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found on Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his
mother, stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States. Two
other adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that
would allow him to seek asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Family Planning Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal spending for contraception and other family
planning services in the United States would rise by $35 million, the largest
increase in two decades, under a proposal Saturday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said the program will promote strong children, healthy
families and make abortion less frequent at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said his 2001 budget proposal will
include $35 million more for such services in the United States. The White House
said the money will not pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   It is aimed instead at helping to prevent unwanted pregnancies among poor
women, teen-agers and women with reduced access to health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make
abortion more rare,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said money earmarked for international family
planning can be shifted easily to ``abortion-related activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said that ``by choosing these abortionists and abortion lobbyists as
our overseas representatives for family planning, we send a message that the
U.S. is on the side of the abortionists, not the babies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association commended
Clinton. The group's president, Judith Desarno, said the proposal recognizes
``the vital role that family planning plays in preventing unintended pregnancies
and lessening the need for abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase would bring the total administration proposal for
family planning in the United States to $274 million for next year, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would be shared among 4,600 clinics nationwide and would pay for
what the White House called ``the full range of reproductive health services,''
including keeping contraceptives available and affordable. It also would pay for
teen-age counseling including support for educational programs ``that encourage
young people to postpone sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These services make a critical difference in people's lives,'' Clinton
said. The White House said the money will help prevent more than one million
unintended pregnancies a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is seeking $169 million in new money for family planning and
counseling services overseas. That amounts to a 45 percent increase over the
fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am asking Congress to support these funds, and to provide them without
restrictions that hamper the work of family planning organizations, and even bar
them from discussing or debating reproductive health policies,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a deal last year to persuade Congress to release $926 million in
back payments to the United Nations, the administration reluctantly accepted
restrictions on $385 million in federal funds for groups that perform abortions,
or lobby for liberalized abortion laws internationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said then he would try to remove the restrictions, which barred U.S.
money to private family planning groups that perform or promote abortions, even
with their own money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When children are born healthy and mothers and families gain control over
their lives, communities are stronger, economic progress is faster and the
future is brighter for everyone,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> State Police memo reveals racial profiling took place as early as  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey State Police officials knew troopers had
been stopping a disproportionate number of minority motorists more than two
years before the state admitted the practice of racial profiling, according to
an internal memo enclosed in court papers filed on Friday.
<P>
	   The memo, dated Oct. 4, 1996, said a routine internal affairs inspection of
the Moorestown barracks found the percentage of minorities stopped by its
troopers was "dramatically higher" than the rates that had been cited in a
landmark court case earlier that year, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in
Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case, State vs. Pedro Soto, Superior Court Judge Robert E. Francis
ruled that troopers pulled over motorists on the basis of their race between
April 1988 and May 1991 along the New Jersey Turnpike south of Interchange 7A.
</P>
<P>
	   A study introduced during the trial revealed that 35.6 percent of motorists
stopped on that particular stretch of roadway were black. South of Interchange
3, 46 percent of all motorists stopped between 1988 and 1991 were black.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the study concluded that only 15 percent of drivers speeding on
that roadway were black.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the memo did not specify a percentage of minority drivers that had
been stopped, it mentioned that almost five years after the time period covered
in the court case, the rate at which they had been stopped had increased.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo recommended ways to correct the problem, including changing patrol
logs to require troopers to record the race of motorists who were stopped and
incorporating that information in troopers' bi-annual evaluation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers receiving unsatisfactory ratings could be referred to the Internal
Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo, from Internal Affairs Bureau Chief Capt. Richard Touw to Maj.
Michael Fedorko, is part of a series of documents the State Police was ordered
to release to attorneys representing two defendants who are appealing drug
convictions on grounds they were illegally stopped in Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
	   Fedorko, who was later promoted to lieutenant colonel and retired in October
as acting superintendent, told the newspaper he did not remember the memo and
did not know if any of the recommendations were put into place.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked about the memo, Roger Shatzkin, spokesman for Attorney General
John Farmer Jr., said the State Police is now focusing on reforms rather than
past problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking to the future to make things better and make sure to the best
of our ability that this doesn't happen in the future," Shatzkin told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council
of New Jersey, said Friday the memo reinforces his belief that top State Police
officials knew of the problem and denied it.
</P>
<P>
	   "With everything that's come out, no one in leadership positions other than
(former New Jersey State Police Superintendent Carl) Williams has been held
accountable," Jackson said, referring to Gov. Christie Whitman's demand for
Williams' resignation after he made statements suggesting minority groups were
responsible for drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Troops: Russia Understating Deaths  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers said Saturday that the
military is understating casualties in Chechnya, hushing up the deaths of scores
of men to avoid a public backlash against the increasingly bloody war.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of interviews, Russian soldiers in Chechnya and the adjoining
region of Ingushetia claimed their units had suffered numerous casualties that
have not been reported. It was not possible to obtain overall figures, but
soldiers in some units said more than half the men in their detachments had been
killed or wounded in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Kavkaz checkpoint near Sleptsovskaya, Interior Ministry soldiers said
Saturday that they see trucks coming from Chechnya every day with dead and
wounded personnel despite official claims of very few casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They would announce that two or three people have been killed, but the
actual number is two or three times higher,'' said one of the soldiers at the
checkpoint, who identified himself only by his first name, Sergei.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can see that because all the corpses go through us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ever since its Chechen offensive began in September, the military has
stressed that casualties have been low, hoping to avoid public opposition of the
kind provoked by heavy Russian losses in the 1994-96 Chechen war. The military's
strategy is based on heavy air and artillery bombardment of rebel positions,
followed by mopping-up operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent official casualty figures, released Thursday, say 465
Defense and Interior Ministry troops have been killed and 1,583 have been
wounded in Chechnya since fighting began in September. The numbers do not
include any figures for soldiers missing in action or those whose bodies are too
badly disfigured to allow identification.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent analysts and soldiers' rights groups have disputed the numbers
for months, saying the toll is much higher. Accounts by soldiers on the ground
support the claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 115 men who have been guarding a stretch of road in the Grozny
neighborhood of Chernorechye since September, only 58 are left. Some were
wounded, but most were killed, members of the unit said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The company is gone already. And they (the military) keep saying there are
no casualties,'' said Pyotr, a young conscript who refused to give his last
name. He said that another 115-strong company was stationed nearby on Dec. 11,
and that only 17 men were left when it was redeployed on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops faced little resistance as they took control of Chechnya's
lowlands in the autumn, but they have been stalled in their two-week push to
seize Grozny and penetrate into the rebel-held southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grozny area was mostly quiet Saturday, one day after Russian commanders
declared that the bombardment of the shattered capital would be reduced. Weather
also appeared to be a factor in the letup in air and artillery raids, with the
capital shrouded in heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
	   The military command said the pause in bombardment was announced in part to
allow thousands of civilians who have been trapped in Grozny to escape. However,
no large movements of civilians were reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The military may be using the lull to prepare for a major new drive to take
Grozny, although Russian commanders refused to say anything about their plans.
</P>
<P>
	   There was scattered fighting outside Grozny on Saturday, with the military
claiming it had trapped a group of rebels near the town of Argun, nine miles
east of Grozny, and surrounded more rebels in the southern rebel stronghold of
Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
	   The military said 40 militants had been killed in airstrikes on rebel bases,
and that only one Russian soldier was killed in the fighting, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   More clashes were reported in Russian-controlled northern Chechnya. A rebel
band attacked Russian police forces in Gudermes on Friday, wounding one
policeman, and another clash broke out near the nearby village of Dzhalka,
police commander Boris Ostankov said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian government on Saturday tried to play down its decision to
replace the two top combat generals in Chechnya. Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev and
Maj. Gen. Vladimir Shamanov were returned Friday to the posts they occupied
before the war, and their deputies took their places.
</P>
<P>
	   Removing combat commanders at the height of the military campaign in
Chechnya suggested government displeasure with their failure to take Grozny or
deal a decisive blow against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   But acting President Vladimir Putin, emerging from an Orthodox Christmas
mass Saturday, said the issue was a technical one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia doesn't throw away such generals as Troshev and Shamanov. There has
been no replacement and no replacement has been planned. It is a technical
question,'' he said, giving no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin, who built much of his political popularity on tough handling of the
war, is thought to want to wrap up the fighting before presidential elections
March 26.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of bills passed by Senate, Assembly die on backburner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Shall builders be required to pay an "impact fee"
to offset the added costs for new classrooms and police officers when the new
residents flood into those new homes?
<P>
	   Perhaps, but the Legislature won't force them to do it in this session.
</P>
<P>
	   Is it fair that lawyers who defend accused killers are allowed to dismiss
more potential jurors than prosecutors are allowed to?
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps not, but the Legislature is not going to change these rules anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Shall troopers and their supervisors be held publicly accountable when
citizens are mistreated and file formal complaints about it?
</P>
<P>
	   Not by any new state law.
</P>
<P>
	   And is it finally time to revise fair housing laws so rural towns are not
required to provide a quota of affordable units that has no relation to their
sparse populations?
</P>
<P>
	   If so, it will not be done by legislation now.
</P>
<P>
	   All four initiatives were crafted into bills that passed either the Senate
or Assembly last year but have not been posted for action Monday in the final
session of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   These four and 332 other bills and resolutions will die as the 208th
legislative session draws to an official close Tuesday at noon.
</P>
<P>
	   There are thousands of bills and hundreds of resolutions filed in the past
two years that will expire into so much recycled paper.
</P>
<P>
	   But 336 of these bills and resolutions had gone through the committee
systems and won approval in either the Senate or Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the thousands of bills and resolutions never moved off of the
backburner. Most are minor but some are not.
</P>
<P>
	   By design, action on the multi-billion-dollar school construction and
transportation bills will spill into the new term starting this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Less by design will come the death of a bill to require health insurers to
pay into a reserve that would have been used to pay off $120 million owed to
doctors and hospitals by the bankrupt HIP Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Gun control legislation exists at both extremes, with one bill proposing to
ban all handguns and another bill proposing to let law-abiding citizens carry
concealed weapons wherever they go. Both bills go up in smoke Tuesday at noon -
and are prefiled for reintroduction as new bills on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   No less than 174 bills that passed the Senate are foundering on the Assembly
backburner. Likewise, 162 bills that passed the Assembly remain bottled up in
Senate committees.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate passed the impact-fee bill in November and the State Police
report bill last May. The Assembly has not acted on them and is not scheduled to
do so Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Assembly in June passed the jury selection bill and fair housing
amendment. The Senate has not acted on them and is not scheduled to do so
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican leaders of the two houses, Senate President Donald
DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, are sensitive to these points.
They have released lengthy session agendas for their respective houses on
Monday, with the Assembly taking up 43 bills that have already passed the Senate
and the Senate handling 25 bills that have already passed the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   Following are other prominent bills scheduled to suffer an anonymous death
this week:
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill eventually requiring handguns to be sold with "smart gun" safety
sensors. The Senate passed it in July.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to permit off-track betting on horse racing. The Senate passed it
in July.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to require insurance coverage for all costs related to Pap smear
tests. The Assembly passed it in June.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to increase the penalty to $250 for parents who allow their
children to miss school. The Senate passed it in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to allow private firms to run cafeterias in county jails. The
Senate passed it in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to have convicted sex offenders sentenced more harshly as repeat
offenders if they had any such convictions as juveniles. The Assembly passed it
last February. Usually juvenile convictions do not count in adult sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to form a "Domestic Violence Victims Fund" with special fees
charged to those convicted of domestic violence charges. The Assembly passed it
in May.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to change drug law so dealers can be prosecuted according to the
number of doses, or "units," they sell rather than by simple weight, which is
misleading for drugs such as LSD or amphetamines. The Assembly passed it last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to toughen penalties for resisting arrest or quarreling with
police. The Assembly passed it in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to allow police officers who live in New Jersey and work
out-of-state to carry firearms off duty. The Senate passed it last month.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill prohibiting casino owners from donating funds to recall election
campaigns. The Assembly passed it almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to repeal New Jersey's motorcycle helmet law. The Senate passed it
in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to allow nonprofit clubs with liquor licenses to have
"casino-night" fundraisers. The Senate passed it in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   - A bill to move the New Jersey national primary to March. The Assembly
passed it in October 1998.

<HEADLINE> Death Row Inmates Featured in Ads  </HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH GREENSPAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Fashion giant Benetton is joining Italy's offensive against the
death penalty with its latest advertising campaign -- piercing portraits of
American death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The posters, which will hit billboards worldwide at the end of January,
feature death-row inmates in prison uniforms staring into the camera over the
words, ``Sentenced to Death.'' The prisoner's name, date of birth, crime and
expected method of execution follows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How can they do that? How can they do that?'' said Freida Froemsdorf,
whose 35-year-old son, a Missouri state highway patrolman, was gunned down in
1985 by one of the inmates to be featured by Benetton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They shouldn't be doing anything like that -- there should be a law
against it,'' Mrs. Froemsdorf said Saturday when told of the ad campaign in a
telephone interview from her Missouri home.
</P>
<P>
	   Photographer Oliviero Toscani, known for socially provocative Benetton ads
that seemingly have little to do with fashion, visited prisons across the United
States over two years to create the series, called ``Looking Death in the
Face.''
</P>
<P>
	   Toscani is now promoting his campaign in the United States, where the number
of executions last year was the highest it has been since 1954.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the men featured in the ad campaign is Jerome Mallett, who is on
death row in Missouri for James M. Froemsdorf's slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   The trooper had apparently handcuffed Mallett after a driver's license check
revealed he was wanted by authorities in Dallas for armed robbery and a parole
violation. Authorities believe Mallet grabbed Froemsdorf's revolver and then
shot and killed him.
</P>
<P>
	   Another is Leroy Orange, who along with his half-brother was convicted in
1985 of murdering four people, including a 10-year-old boy, after an argument
over drugs. The victims were stabbed and their apartment set on fire in an
effort to conceal the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Both brothers confessed to Chicago police shortly after their arrests.
Later, however, Orange contended police tortured him into confessing, and the
half-brother said he alone committed the crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Toscani said he wanted to foster debate on capital punishment, even at the
cost of losing American customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course, that may happen,'' Saturday's English-language ``Italy Daily''
quoted him as saying. ``But as a result of the campaign, we may gain new
customers. If advertising made everyone happy, it would be an act of
hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Italians, longtime opponents of the death penalty, increasingly are
crusading against its use abroad. Over the coming year, Rome's Colosseum is to
be lit up for 48 hours every time a death sentence is commuted anywhere in the
world or a country abolishes the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the late 1980s, when Toscani took over the fashion giant's
advertising, Benetton has made headlines with ads addressing such topics as AIDS
and racism -- sometimes at the cost of accusations that it provokes or
sympathizes simply to promote sales.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, AIDS groups in France sued over Benetton ads that showed the words
``HIV positive'' on buttocks and other body parts, calling them ``commercial
exploitation of suffering.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the 1990s, the Roman Catholic Church protested a campaign that
featured models dressed as a priest and a nun kissing, and some human rights
groups condemned ads that showed what was supposed to be the bloodied clothing
of a Bosnian war victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton concedes the ads are meant to increase consumer awareness of the
label -- but says they also are intended to raise awareness on social issues.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing its death-row campaign, Benetton credited itself with
``tearing down the wall of international indifference.''
</P>
<P>
	   No one answered the phones at Benetton headquarters on Saturday, and it was
unclear whether any of the inmates were compensated for participating in the ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Italian-based vendor of trendy sweaters, scarves and other clothing for
men, women and children has retail stores worldwide. Forbes magazine listed the
Luciano Benetton family at No. 111 on its list of billionaires last year, with
$4 billion in wealth.

<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Milk and cookies were available Saturday outside the
Iowa Public Television studios while Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore debated
inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The treat was provided by Iowans for Sensible Priorities, which handed out
cookies decorated with a pie chart of defense spending while group members
performed a skit depicting the Pentagon as a ``sacred cow.''
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in a cow suit was carried around on a platform by two men wearing
masks of Al Gore and Bill Bradley, while she was sprinkled with rose petals and
worshipped by others around her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's talk about how the Pentagon (budget) is thought of as untouchable.
We want people to know that if we reduce spending there, we'll have more money
for health care and education,'' said Erica Swanson, who played the cow.
</P>
<P>
	   M.L. Lindon, the woman in the apron handing out the cookies, has attended
scores of political events over the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   Her group advocates cutting defense spending and shifting the money to
social programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   In front of the building was a 25-foot inflatable ear of corn, courtesy of
the group Ozone Action, which is asking candidates to include solutions for
global warming in their environmental platform.
</P>
<P>
	   Five activists from around the country plan to follow politicians across
Iowa until the caucuses on Jan. 24, drawing attention to the effect global
warming may have on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Agriculture is life in Iowa,'' said Kate Simmons, a spokeswoman for the
group. ``God made Iowa to grow corn.''
</P>
<P>
	   The group also plans trips to other early states, such as New Hampshire and
California.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Not all the activists outside the debate were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   John Strong, a Republican from West Des Moines, held in his right hand the
metal skeleton of a blue umbrella, stripped of its fabric. Hanging from the ribs
of the umbrella was a little white sign reading: ``Rebuild Veterans Health
Care.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they keep cutting it back, it will be like this umbrella -- almost
useless,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
	   Strong said he will spend the campaign season pushing for improved benefits
for veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Paul and Erma Joslin, who live across the street from the studios, brought
their 6-year-old grandson, Matthew Joslin, outside to watch as activists chanted
and performed and dancers and cheerleaders streamed past them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's fun,'' Matthew said, though not as much as cartoons.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   An index card was the vice president's prop in the last debate. In this
debate, he turned to real people to make his points against Bradley, the former
senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore scored one of his sharpest points by planting folks in the studio.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to pin Bradley to the ropes on agriculture, an important issue in
this farm state, Gore called on farmer Chris Peterson. ``Could you stand up,
Chris?'' The man stood mute while Gore pointed out that Peterson lost 300 acres
in 1993 flooding.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to Bradley, Gore asked, ``Why did you vote against the disaster
relief for Chris Peterson, when he and thousands of other farmers here in Iowa
needed it?''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, it was an elementary school teacher's turn. Pam Willard stood, a
little fidgety, while Gore introduced her as Des Moines teacher with 29 kids in
her class.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She needs help, not just talk. She needs new resources,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two or three other people Gore had picked up along the campaign trail were
on hand to illustrate issues that did not come up in the end.
</P>
<P>
	   While the surrogates were meant to put an outside-the-Washington-beltway
face on Gore's agenda, the candidates themselves were in full Washington costume
for their fifth televised meeting -- nearly identical dark suits and red ties.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Argue Health Care  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare Iowa
voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal on Saturday. The vice
president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but campaigning on
``the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the last words, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central
in the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,'' the former
New Jersey senator said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a
change?''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education -- a
familiar array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and
Gore revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer''?'' he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage they need.
Bradley said he would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' he said. ''... I reject that kind
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the Democratic debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim
that he'd been down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to
survive scandal and impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to
President Clinton have been a time of the greatest economic progress in American
history.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, and editor Dennis
Ryerson was moderating. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 --
including some the candidates used to demonstrate a point.

<HEADLINE> Homeless man sentenced to 18 years for killing of Hasbrouck Heights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - A homeless man was sentenced on Friday to 18
years in prison for the 1990 stabbing death of a bartender from Hasbrouck
Heights, authorities said.
<P>
	   David Livingstone, 32, must serve at least six years of the sentence handed
down by Superior Court Judge John A. Conte before he is eligible for parole,
said Bergen County Assistant Prosecutor Ike Gazvy.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated manslaughter in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Vernon Joliff was stabbed more than 30 times in his chest
and torso in his apartment on Sept. 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators knew only that Joliff was last seen leaving the Manhattan bar
where he worked with a man named David.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1997, authorities issued a warrant after they matched
fingerprints taken from Joliff's apartment with those taken from Livingstone
after an arrest in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Livingstone was arrested eight days later after he jumped a subway turnstile
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   He told authorities he killed Joliff after the two men fought at Joliff's
apartment. They had met in the bar earlier that evening.

<HEADLINE> Nike Says Shirts Aren't Toxic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Nike soccer jerseys pulled from store shelves across Germany
after a television report do not contain a dangerous amount of a toxic
anti-bacterial chemical, the company said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing preliminary tests conducted by a Hamburg laboratory, Nike said the
jerseys present no danger to people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Consumers and merchants can trust that no damage to health can arise from
this jersey,'' Charlie Denson, general manager for Nike Europe, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Der Spiegel newsmagazine also reported Saturday that an unnamed expert at
the federal institute for consumer protection said the tests found the jerseys
to be safe.
</P>
<P>
	   Three German department store chains stopped selling the shirts after the
television program Plusminus reported tests had turned up amounts of
tributyltin, or TBT, a heavy metal compound used in anti-barnacle paint for
ships. The program said it had commissioned a private lab to conduct the tests
on clothing items chosen at random in German stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Also used to kill bacteria and quell the smell of sweat, TBT would seem an
ideal additive for sports shirts. But at high levels in humans, TBT is believed
to cause neurological problems, damage the immune system and harm the liver,
some experts say. British and Dutch tests have shown the substance to cause
mutations in marine snails and the World Wildlife Fund is calling for a global
ban.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike cited another Hamburg scientist, Michael Braungart, as saying the tests
on sea animals were done with amounts 10 to 20 times higher than what was found
in the shirts and that the tests were not relevant to how the chemical would be
absorbed by the skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Nike said it would work with its suppliers to ensure no illegal substances
were used in its products. The jerseys were sold only in Europe, and stitched
together by a British company.
</P>
<P>
	   The initial report saying the shirts were contaminated caused a scandal in
part because the jerseys are worn by the popular German soccer club Borussia
Dortmund, which won the 1997 European championship. The club suspended sales of
the shirts at its official fan store.

<HEADLINE> Payment delay forces state to halt anti-tobacco ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey health officials have halted their
"Don't Get Sucked In" anti-smoking campaign because a legal dispute is delaying
the state's first installment in national tobacco settlement money.
<P>
	   The state Department of Health and Senior Services has begun taking down
about 70 billboards and pulling television and radio advertisements educating
young people about the health effects of smoking, The Record of Hackensack
reported in Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   A dispute over plaintiffs' legal fees in the government settlement has
delayed the first installment payment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is scheduled to receive $7.5 billion from tobacco companies over
25 years. It is one of only six states that have not yet received any money from
the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   State health officials had planned to use $7.2 million from the first
settlement payment to expand its existing ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The lease for "Don't Get Sucked In" billboards expired at the end of 1999,
and the state is out of money to continue all but a few of them, said health
department spokesman Tom Breslin. The $2 million in state funding for television
and radio spots and movie trailers also ran out at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-smoking activists criticized the legal dispute that prompted the
suspension of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "An opportunity to warn youth about the dangers of tobacco has been lost
because the settlement has been delayed," said Larry Downs, director of the
anti-tobacco group New Jersey Breathes.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys representing a Passaic County smoker and the family of a Bergen
County woman have filed motions to force the state's attorneys to share legal
fees from the massive settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Attorney General's office has asked state courts to expedite a decision
on the dispute, but no action has been taken.
</P>
<P>
	   The state cannot receive any settlement money until a decision is made.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is scheduled to receive $247 million from the tobacco settlement
this year. The state has agreed to spend $775 million over 30 years on tobacco
control programs.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Syrians Hope To Return  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SEVAREID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrian refugees displaced from the Israeli-occupied
Golan Heights celebrated the end of Ramadan on Saturday, visiting relatives and
taking their children for rides on a mini Ferris wheel set up in an empty lot.
</P>
<P>
	   A year from now, they hope, they'll be celebrating the same rituals to end
the Muslim month of fasting but in a different place-- on the land they fled
after Israel captured it during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The Middle East peace
talks in West Virginia have stirred their expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will leave soon and leave everything behind,'' Ahmed Mustafa Diab said
in Wafideen, a camp for displaced people 11 miles east of Damascus.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the war, the 31-year-old Diab's parents lived near Lake Tiberias,
also known as the Sea of Galilee. ``We hope this year, in 2000, we will
return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hope is much harder to come by among the nearly 35,000 Palestinians living
in Jaramana refugee camp, four miles east of Damascus and 16 miles from
Wafideen.
</P>
<P>
	   Their families also come from villages near the lake -- but the area they
came from is now recognized Israeli territory, not occupied land. They fled
homes near Safed, Israel, in 1948. Many say their return is years or generations
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahmoud Saleh, 38, points to the pavement in Jaramana camp and says this is
where he will spend many Ramadans to come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the situation now,'' he said. ``It is politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the 3.5 million Palestinian refugees scattered across Syria,
Lebanon, Jordan, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is one of the issues facing
the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are trying to forge a final peace
accord by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which resumed last month after a freeze of
nearly 4 years, are expected to lead to the return of most, if not all, of the
Golan Heights to Syria. That could mean the Syrian refugees will be going home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli-Palestinian dispute, with a history of stalls and missed
deadlines, is considered the harder problem to resolve.
</P>
<P>
	   Publicly, Palestinian officials are adamant about the right for refugees
from the 1948 and 1967 wars with Israel to return to their old homes. But unlike
those displaced in 1967, the 1948 refugees came from places that are now part of
Israel and will not be included in any future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has indicated he would not object to
Palestinian refugees being resettled in a future Palestinian state. The sheer
numbers, however, would make doing so extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Jaramana residents accuse Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of giving up
too much or looking after only the 1967 refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as Arafat is our leader, he won't accept responsibility for us and
will leave us alone,'' said Khalid Khaldesayn, a 32-year-old Jaramana resident.
``He doesn't think about us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Khaldesayn is affiliated with Fatah Uprising, one of eight Palestinian
groups based in Damascus that have rejected Arafat's peace with Israel. But even
those who support Arafat say they know they won't be leaving Jaramana -- a
sprawl of concrete homes and twisting, narrow alleys -- any time soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Returning is not for me,'' said Abdullah Nimr Taher, a 40-year-old
mechanic. ``It is the second or third generations to come that will return to
their land.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton campaign attacks Giuliani's fund raising methods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign accused Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani Saturday of evading fund-raising limits by using three separate
political committees to support his expected Senate bid.
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, cited a New York Times
report that said Giuliani had raised and spent almost $1 million since March
1998 through two committees that operate under looser restrictions than his
official campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the money given to the two committees - called Solutions America and
Giuliani for New York - came from a group of loyal donors who have also given
the $2,000 legal limit to Giuliani's official Senate campaign committee, the
Times said, citing disclosure records.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor has established a political network of multiple fund-raising
committees and taxpayer resources to finance his Senate campaign, and it must
stop," Wolfson told reporters at a news conference in front of City Hall. "By
law, these committees should have remained separate and apart. But in fact, the
mayor has been operating them as if they were a single political fund-raising
machine, 'Rudy Inc."'
</P>
<P>
	   Solutions America, designed to promote Giuliani's political philosophy,
limits individual donations to $5,000 annually. Giuliani for New York operates
under state rules and allows donors to contribute up to $45,000 each. The two
committees have taken in and spent nearly $1 million since March 1998, records
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal rules bar funds raised by such committees from being used for
federal campaigns. In 1998 and the first half of 1999, Solutions America and
Giuliani for New York helped pay for at least one major Giuliani fund-raiser,
plus rent, salaries and other administrative costs for the mayor's political
operation, according to the Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say that in the second half of 1999, while Giuliani considered and
planned his Senate bid, the committees were used not for that campaign but
primarily to finance advertisements for a referendum to change the City Charter.
Voters rejected the proposal in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Teitelbaum, who heads Giuliani's campaign committee, said all the
mayor's fund raising and spending was "perfectly appropriate and has been
reviewed and analyzed very carefully."
</P>
<P>
	   "This latest attack is a typical example of Clinton-style posturing and
hypocrisy," he continued. "Wolfson is trying to accuse and blame others to
deflect attention from serious campaign finance abuses the Clintons are famous
for."
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks Giuliani has criticized Mrs. Clinton for collecting more
than $360,000 in unregulated donations for a special Democratic party fund set
up for the New York Senate race. About $338,000 of that so-called soft money was
apparently spent on television ads that showed footage of the first lady in New
York and asked voters to "call Hillary."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said the concerns about Giuliani's fund raising methods were real.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Rudy Inc.' has taken in more than $700,000 from donors who reached the
legal contribution limit for a Senate race," he charged. "And 'Rudy Inc.' has
subsidized the mayor's Senate campaign to the tune of over $600,000 by paying
for expenses that should have been assumed by Friends of Giuliani," the mayor's
Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum said Solutions America and Giuliani for New York were both
created more than two years ago, long before the mayor began contemplating a
Senate run.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the mayor told the Times that the two committees' fund raising and
spending had been largely curtailed since last April, when Giuliani formally
notified the Federal Election Commission he was considering a Senate run.
</P>
<P>
	   "Up until late April we could raise and we could spend money without it
being viewed as promoting a Senate campaign because in fact the mayor was
undecided," said John Gross, the mayor's campaign treasurer.
</P>
<P>
	   But some campaign finance experts challenged that interpretation, saying the
unregulated money could not be spent on a Senate campaign at any time,
regardless of when Giuliani notified the FEC that he might run.

<HEADLINE> Patient glut from flu outbreak strains emergency rooms statewide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A raging flu outbreak and a shortage of beds and
staff in some hospitals have combined to tax emergency rooms statewide.
<P>
	   State Heath Depatment officials are reporting a dramatic increase in the
number of flu outbreaks being recorded statewide. Officials have documented 80
outbreaks of flu, compared to 19 this time last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Health officials track flu through the number of outbreaks in long term care
facilities such as nursing homes. This allows them to track the size and
seriousness of an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
	   "Numbers usually rise after the holiday, but this year is worse," Kristine
Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department said. "We've tracked four
times as many outbreaks this year over last."
</P>
<P>
	   The situation has been particularly acute in western New York, Smith said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, hospitals are hiring temporary nurses and warning ambulances
away from crowded emergency rooms because of a sudden influx of patients
stricken with flu and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   The surge in flu-related admissions began the week after Christmas, about a
month earlier than usual. In the last week, some patients have had to wait on
gurneys in emergency rooms for more than a day before beds opened up.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the city's two largest hospitals - Strong Memorial and
Rochester General - issued "code red" warnings to ambulances that they had no
beds open for incoming patients. That triggered a "mega red" declaration under
which the hospitals had to alternate opening every four hours regardless of
their bed status.
</P>
<P>
	   Most hospitals are reopening some of the beds they had closed in recent
years because of falling occupancy.
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo, Mercy Hospital was forced to divert ambulances with all but the
most critical patients to other institutions for long stretches of time almost
daily from late Dec. 23 to midnight Jan. 4. The hospital had no place to put
them.

<P>
	   Officials opened 16 additional beds and on Wednesday expressed confidence
that the problem had been solved.
</P>
<P>
	   But many hospitals continue to experience delays for care.
</P>
<P>
	   During the week Erie County Medical Center reported delays of several hours
in their emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   University Hospital in Syracuse has since Monday been treating about 20
patients a day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen an increase but we've not been forced to call in extra
people," Darryl Geddis, a spokesman for University Hospital, said. "Most of
those who have been hit are among the elderly population or people who are
working in nursing homes or day care centers."
</P>
<P>
	   New York is just one of 16 states reporting an outbreak of influenza,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   Key flu symptoms include a sudden high fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue
and muscle aches. Most people who get flu recover completely in one to two
weeks, but some develop serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses, such
as pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 10 percent and 20 percent of the country's population is laid low
each flu season, and about 200,000 people end up hospitalized. About 20,000
people nationwide die from complications of flu each year.
</P>
<P>
	   Four drugs are available to treat flu victims. In addition to amantadine and
rimantadine, which work only against the more common type A flu strains,
patients can get relief with two new anti-virals, Tamiflu and Relenza, which
work against both type A and type B. However, the new drugs must be taken within
two days of the start of symptoms.

<HEADLINE> Homeless man sentenced to 18 years for killing of Hasbrouck Heights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - A homeless man was sentenced on Friday to 18
years in prison for the 1990 stabbing death of a bartender from Hasbrouck
Heights, authorities said.
<P>
	   David Livingstone, 32, must serve at least six years of the sentence handed
down by Superior Court Judge John A. Conte before he is eligible for parole,
said Bergen County Assistant Prosecutor Ike Gavzy.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated manslaughter in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say Vernon Joliff was stabbed more than 30 times in his chest
and torso in his apartment on Sept. 11, 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators knew only that Joliff was last seen leaving the Manhattan bar
where he worked with a man named David.
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1997, authorities issued a warrant after they matched
fingerprints taken from Joliff's apartment with those taken from Livingstone
after an arrest in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Livingstone was arrested eight days later after he jumped a subway turnstile
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   He told authorities he killed Joliff after the two men fought at Joliff's
apartment. They had met in the bar earlier that evening.

<HEADLINE> Threat Halts Berlin Communist Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Berlin police banned an annual communist demonstration on
Saturday after a man threatened to use a machine gun and hand grenades on the
thousands of expected participants.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the former East German communists received a letter containing
the threat Friday from Olaf Juergen Staps, who was already being sought on arson
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagen Saberschinsky, head of the Berlin police, said Staps was considered
unstable. He said the threat against the demonstration, which had been scheduled
for Sunday, was being taken very seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   Saberschinsky said he held extensive discussions with leaders of the Party
of Democratic Socialism, and they agreed to call off the protest because of the
threat. The party also agreed not to lay a wreath at a socialist memorial,
normally part of the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, about 100,000 people participated in the demonstration held each
year in memory of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, founders of the German
Communist Party who were killed in a failed January 1919 uprising in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   The anniversary of the death of Liebknecht and Luxemburg was an annual
celebration when the communists held power in East Germany. The PDS revived the
demonstrations in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Fonda More 'Spiritual'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A minister who knows Jane Fonda says the Academy
Award-winning actress is seeking a more spiritual life, but won't say if that
was the reason for her separation from husband Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Web site WorldNetDaily.com reported last week that the separation was
partially caused by Fonda's ``embrace of 'born-again' evangelical
Christianity.'' It also reported she was attending Bible study in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Gerald Durley said he doubted that Fonda, 62, was regularly
attending Bible study but that she has ``found a certain sense of peace among
people who've found peace with Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think as she approached her 60th birthday, she began to search for more
meaning,'' Durley told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``I am extremely
impressed with the genuineness and sincerity in her search for spirituality and
wholeness.''
</P>
<P>
	   Durley is pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist Church and former
president of Concerned Black Clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Durley would not comment on the couple's eight-year
marriage, Turner, or the cause of the separation that was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of Turner Broadcasting System officials would not comment on the
Web site report.
</P>
<P>
	   Durley did not return several calls for additional comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, Turner denounced Christianity as being for ``losers.'' He also
insulted Pope John Paul II and told a Polish joke during a 1998 speech. He later
apologized.

<HEADLINE> Debates Open Candidates to Scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a whirlwind week of presidential politics, four
televised debates crackled with conflict, humor and policy discussions that
opened the candidates to closer inspection to a public that begins judging them
two weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
	   Just as many voters started to pay attention, Republican John McCain and
Democrat Al Gore got off to a rocky start. Taxes emerged as the central issue in
the Republican race last week, and the Democrats squawked over health care.
</P>
<P>
	   One debate question raised an emotion-charged dialogue in both parties:
Should gays be allowed to serve openly in the military? Al Gore said yes, and
suggested that his appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff would be required to
agree. The Republican candidates protested, as did military brass and some Gore
allies.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president backpedaled Friday night: ``I did not mean to imply that
there should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinions of
officers in the U.S. military.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was basically the same answer delivered in the debate two days earlier by
Gore's rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. Gore also struggled with a
staff-made controversy when his campaign manager suggested retired Joint Chiefs
Chairman Colin Powell was being used by Republicans who ``would rather take
pictures with black children than feed them.'' Powell, a popular Republican
figure who is black, received a telephone call Friday from the vice president.
Gore would not say whether he apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   No public regrets, either, from John McCain, the chairman of a powerful
Senate committee who spent most of the week explaining why he wrote letters to
federal regulators on behalf of big campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My job is to make the bureaucrats work for the people,'' McCain said. ``I
would do the same thing again, almost anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   The practice is common in Washington, where many people doing business with
government agencies also donate to lawmakers whose duties include oversight of
those agencies. But McCain, who made political reform the core of his campaign,
may be held to a higher standard by voters.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush sure hopes so. ``I think somebody who makes campaign
financing an issue has got to be consistent and walk the walk,'' the GOP
national front-runner said in New Hampshire, where McCain is courting
independent voters with his good-government platform.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire's primary is Feb. 1; the campaign's first votes are cast in
Iowa's caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year rang in the toughest ad produced by one of the presidential
campaigns. Self-financed conservative Steve Forbes, accused of running attack
ads in his failed 1996 bid, aired a spot accusing Bush of breaking a no-tax
pledge as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ad was being shipped to TV stations, Bush promoted his $483 billion
tax-cut plan with a debate-night pledge: ``This is not only no new taxes. This
is tax cuts, so help me God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' good timing did not make up for a bad showing in the debates. His
voice was rarely heard amid the clash between Bush and McCain as they tangled
over taxes and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides blamed the moderator, the format and their own candidate for getting
few words in edgewise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Steve was too much of a gentleman in terms of getting his face in
theirs and getting his message out,'' said Ken Blackwell, his campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush flew early in the week to Iowa, where Forbes is threatening his wide
lead in state polls with a strong organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling McCain's tax plan too small, Bush said, ``There is a tax gap in this
campaign.'' Without mentioning Forbes -- champion of the flat tax -- the Texas
governor also was trying to undercut the rival's gains in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain unveils a modest-sized tax cut plan this week, but he is already
calling Bush's package reckless. It benefits the wealthy and spends billions of
dollars that could be better spent bolstering Social Security, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican strategist Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said
McCain is taking a huge gamble criticizing a big tax cut in a GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't tack to the left on taxes, especially with economic
conservatives in New Hampshire. I really think this will hurt him worse than''
the ethical questions, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other GOP contenders -- Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes -- got
valuable exposure to the voting public, though they remain mired in single
digits in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic contest, Gore continued to warn that Bradley's promise to
provide nearly all Americans health insurance would be a disaster. Bradley said
it will not, and pumped $250,000 into a new TV ad to defend his campaign of
``big ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   It got personal. ``I think you're in a Washington bunker,'' Bradley told
Gore in their first encounter of the week. The vice president replied with his
own war analogy in their second debate Saturday, saying in Iowa that he has been
on ``the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the funniest exchanges, typical of the wounding humor that energized
all four debates, came after Gore said he opposed Bradley's policies but
respected the man.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishing for a compliment for Gore, the moderator asked Bradley in the
earlier debate, ``Do you agree?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I agree with what he said,'' replied Bradley, not willing to play nice.
``I think I'm genuinely a good person.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore, Bush Lead in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has shored up his lead over
former Sen. Bill Bradley among Iowans planning to vote in the Democratic Party
caucuses this month, a new poll indicates. Among Republicans, it found George W.
Bush holding to his solid lead over five other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Des Moines Register's poll of registered voters -- 500 Republicans and
501 Democrats -- found Gore with support of 54 percent, Bradley of 33 percent.
Thirteen percent said they were unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was the favorite of 45 percent of the Republicans polled, down from 49
percent in a similar poll conducted in November, with publisher Steve Forbes
third at 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a national poll released Saturday by Newsweek magazine, Bush held almost
a 5-1 lead over second-place Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Bush's 63 percent to
McCain's 13 percent. Newsweek said the national poll had the Gore-Bradley run
for the Democratic nomination ``up for grabs'': Gore has the support of 50
percent to Bradley's 25 percent, but 25 percent of respondents said they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa poll was based on a random telephone survey of people who said they
definitely or probably will participate in Iowa's leadoff caucuses Jan. 24. It
was conducted Jan. 2-6 by pollsters Selzer &AMP; Co. of Des Moines. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses, held in more than 2,000 locations across the state, launch the
presidential nominating season.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, McCain held third in a statistical three-way tie
with conservative commentator Alan Keyes and activist Gary Bauer. Keyes had 9
percent, McCain 8 percent, Bauer 7 percent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had 5
percent, and 11 percent said they were unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Newsweek national poll, Princeton Research Associates interviewed
753 adults Jan. 6-7, leaving a margin of error at 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll found a decline in the number of voters who felt that ``good people
are being discouraged from running for office by the high cost of campaigns is a
major problem.'' It found 58 percent agreeing with that question, down from 63
percent in an October poll.
</P>
<P>
	   That could cut into McCain's voting bank. He has made campaign finance
reform his major issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also showed that few GOP voters seemed put off by the huge amounts
of campaign money amassed by Bush -- almost $58 million through Sept. 30.
Indeed, 84 percent saw it as a sign of a successful, well-organized candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, however, 47 percent said the money gives Bush an unfair
advantage, and 37 percent worried that he was trying to buy his way into office.

<HEADLINE> Report: EU Balkan Envoy Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The European Union's foreign affairs commissioner is leveling
harsh criticism at the chief EU envoy for Balkan reconstruction, a newsmagazine
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The office of EU foreign affairs commissioner Chris Patten has criticized
Bodo Hombach for having no clear projects to foster the Balkan Stability Pact's
goals, Der Spiegel reported. It cited a memo it obtained from a Dec. 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Spiegel reported that the memo also criticized Hombach for having requested
``excessive'' finances for the job. For this year, the magazine said, Hombach
requested a $234,000 allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo criticized Hombach's finances for budgeting him to travel 225 days
this year -- every working day on the calendar, Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hombach, however, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the memo had not
come from Patten himself, but from someone working in his office. Hombach said
Patten ``didn't criticize my work, but actually the opposite,'' during a meeting
between the two men shortly before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Levi, a spokesman in Hombach's office, said the requested expenses
were in line with what an EU commissioner normally receives.
</P>
<P>
	   Hombach served as Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff before
taking the EU post on Aug. 1. The stability pact was launched in September at a
summit in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Protests Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case,
said Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the
child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil disobedience
campaign,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement. About 100
protesters have been arrested since Thursday, and another protest had been
planned Monday to block access to Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The organizers cited a ``more positive course'' in the ongoing custody
battle over Elian. That included a subpoena issued Friday by Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated support for the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a matter that should be decided on the facts and the law and not
in the political arena,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed
Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian
will actually be asked to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one
who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a
pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags
and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
</P>
<P>
	   Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the
child is reunited with his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me. I don't want to go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a good family,'' Smith said. ``I saw enough and heard enough to
know he wants to stay in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Elian's relatives gave him information that his father may have
known Elian's mother was bringing him to the United States and supported that
decision -- something Gonzalez has denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his mother,
stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States. Two other
adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that
would allow him to seek asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, met with Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday
evening to plead the case that the boy should remain in America at least long
enough to have a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Penelas said Reno told them she would respond ``very, very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite calling off the protests, a pre-planned parade of about 40
tractor-trailer cabs with a police escort coursed through the city Saturday.
Sanchez, who said the caravan was to thank supporters, warned that organizers
would resume the protests if the U.S. government attempted to return the Elian
to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Argue Health Care  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare Iowa
voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal on Saturday. The vice
president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but campaigning on
``the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the last words, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central
in the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,'' the former
New Jersey senator said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a
change?''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education -- a
familiar array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and
Gore revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer''?'' he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage they need.
Bradley said he would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' he said. ''... I reject that kind
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the Democratic debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim
that he'd been down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to
survive scandal and impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to
President Clinton have been a time of the greatest economic progress in American
history.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, and editor Dennis
Ryerson was moderating. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 --
including some the candidates used to demonstrate a point.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders went on to argue a familiar topic, health insurance, Bradley
again accusing the vice president of misrepresenting his position by saying it
would undermine Medicare and do away with Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd replace Medicaid with something better,'' Bradley said, accusing Gore
of always conveniently ignoring that.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he wants to come back to Iowa and debate Bradley on agricultural
policy. He rolled out his challenge to twice weekly debates with no more
television ads.

<HEADLINE> Chess Prodigy Leko Wins Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Hungarian chess prodigy Peter Leko won a challenge
match against a Russian world champion after playing to a draw Saturday in the
fifth game of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   After the 43rd move, Alexander Khalifman, the champion of last year's Las
Vegas world championship, had no other choice but to offer a draw, the
tournament's spokesman Daniel Molnar told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Leko was obviously much better prepared for this tournament, and he
deserved to win,'' the 33-year-old Russian said after the four-hour match.
</P>
<P>
	   Leko, 21, has won two games and tied three in the exhibition tournament.
With one point for each win and half a point for each tie, he leads 3.5-1.5 and
will win regardless of the outcome of the next game.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very glad to have won, that's all I can say at the moment,'' Leko
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two players agreed to play their best in Sunday's match, even though the
tournament victory is no longer at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite being world champion, Khalifman is 28th on FIDE's most recent world
list, while Leko is eighth.
</P>
<P>
	   The tournament is sponsored by the German Westfaelische Ferngas AG. The
winner receives $10,280, and the loser gets $5,140.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile at a meeting in Budapest, European Chess Union officials agreed to
hold the first European men's individual championship in the history of chess,
the state news agency MTI reported. The championship is to be held in Italy in
June 2000, with prize money of $52,643.

<HEADLINE> Anderson Urges Campaign Reform  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former independent presidential candidate John
Anderson said Saturday that the Reform Party should advocate campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, who earned 7 percent of the vote in the 1980 presidential
election, said the Reform Party is adrift and should push for the public
financing of elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the Reform Party, to have any chance at all, has to define
itself much better than they have been able to do,'' Anderson said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``I think it's a party in search not only
of a candidate but even more importantly the predicate for a successful
candidacy has to be a successful platform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson also spoke to about 50 members of the Iowa Citizen Action Network,
an advocacy group that hopes to push campaign finance reform at the Jan. 24
caucuses. The group has signed up 434 activists and hopes to enlist 1,000
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said he still is hoping that the Reform Party will push campaign
finance reform, a key issue for Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The campaign is not over yet. Maybe someone on behalf of the Reform Party
will pick up that issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's name was recently placed on California's ballot of the Reform
Party along with Donald Trump and three lesser-known Reform Party candidates.
Commentator Pat Buchanan announced his Reform Party bid last fall and Trump has
expressed interest in a Reform Party run.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson said the decision to be placed on the California ballot was made
without his efforts. But he could not rule out a possible third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did not initiate the effort. It was done strictly by the chair of the
party,'' Anderson said. ``They were obviously not satisfied that the only name
to this date is Donald Trump. I have not declared a potential candidacy.''

<TEXT>
    	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - A white former Mount Holly councilman has been
sentenced to jail time and probation for his role in a racially charged attack
in a local tavern.
<P>
	   Robert Byham, 40, was sentenced Friday to two years probation and 30 days in
jail on the bias harassment and assault charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Byham, who also is a former Mount Laurel police officer, and white
codefendant Thomas Dillon were convicted for their fight with two black men at
Thirsty's Pub in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Byham was accused of using a racial slur and instigating the fight. He was a
councilman at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Dillon, 36, of Mount Laurel, was sentenced to one year probation and 50
hours of community service after he was found guilty of bias harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was nothing indirect or subtle about this case," Superior Court Judge
Victor Friedman said in sentencing the men. "This case was stark and arrogant."
</P>
<P>
	   Byham vowed to appeal the sentence. He suggested that the prosecutor, James
Ronca, pursued the case for political reasons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Argue Health Care  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare Iowa
voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal on Saturday. The vice
president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but campaigning on
``the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the last words, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central
in the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,'' the former
New Jersey senator said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a
change?''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade. Net farm income in Iowa is projected
at $40.4 billion in 2000, down $7.6 billion from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ``better off'' line echoed a theme used by Republican Ronald
Reagan in his winning, 1980 campaign, which Bradley has said he admires for its
concentration on big-issue proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education -- a
familiar array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and
Gore revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer''?'' he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim that he'd been
down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to survive scandal and
impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to President Clinton have
been a time of the greatest economic progress in American history.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage. Bradley said he
would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate round.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' he said. ''... I reject that kind
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, and editor Dennis
Ryerson was moderating. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 --
including some the candidates used to demonstrate points.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he wants to come back to Iowa and debate Bradley on agricultural
policy. He rolled out his challenge to twice weekly debates with no more
television ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer?'' he asked Bradley, who ignored it.
</P>
<P>
	   On agriculture, Bradley said family farmers have had no real help, ``no
safety net whatsoever,'' from the current administration. The former New Jersey
senator said he wants policy changes to help small farmers. ``You can talk about
the past, but I want to talk about the future,'' Bradley told Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he could understand Bradley's reluctance to talk about the past,
saying his rival had voted against emergency aid to farmers in midwest floods,
and against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa, demanding
that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified commodities. Europe and
Japan resist those products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy,'' said Gore, who
said ``sound science'' should govern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get
access to markets,'' said Bradley. ``The problem with agriculture in America is
serious, in Iowa it's dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Iowa poll showed the challenge facing Bradley; Gore led him by 21
percentage points in a survey for the Des Moines Register among Democrats who
said they intend to vote in the party caucuses two weeks from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to the debate, Gore stopped his motorcade outside a Titan Tire
Corp., to shake hands with picketing steel workers. ``I want to fight for you as
president,'' he told them. ``I need you to fight for me at the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had an eye on labor supporters, too, making of the point by
mentioning twice in the debate that he'd been at a Teamsters' picket line. The
AFL-CIO has endorsed Gore, but the Teamsters have not.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, Bradley appeared on WHO-TV in Des Moines, and said he
disagrees with the government decision to return Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
refugee, to Cuba. ``I thought that the boy should stay in the United States,''
Bradley said. ''... I think the courts should review it. The ideal situation
would be for the boy and his father to be in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father is in Cuba and wants his son back. The controversy over the boy,
whose mother died trying to get to Florida, is a political headache for the
administration. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy
returned, stirring Cuban American demonstrations in Miami and Republican demands
that he stay. Gore says the courts should decide.

<HEADLINE> 6,000 Rally for Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- An army of 6,000 people gathered Saturday under a sea
of red Confederate flags to defend the banner that has flown from the Statehouse
dome for 38 years and thrust the state into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of violence during the rally or along a parade route
that wound from a cemetery holding Confederate dead down the city's Main Street.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's event was the second day of a three-day rally being staged by
supporters of the flag, who say it stands for defiant defense of freedom and
Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   The NAACP says the banner is a symbol of slavery. And at the other end of
Main Street, leaders of the state NAACP met but did not decide to widen economic
sanctions against South Carolina beyond a tourism boycott that started a week
ago. The civil rights organization hopes to force the flag from the Statehouse
dome and its legislative chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the pro-flag rally, a group of ministers carrying a banner that read ``No
King but Jesus,'' followed three bagpipers to lead the procession.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind them were thousands of people, including 92-year-old Alberta Martin
of Elba, Ala., a Confederate widow. About three dozen women dressed in period
costume and widow's black marched next.
</P>
<P>
	   Rank upon rank of Confederate re-enactors followed with muskets shouldered
and bayonets and mess cups at their sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd that followed stretched more than six blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   After the parade, speakers at the Statehouse rally derided the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People as outsiders and agitators.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Arthur Ravenel, R-Mt. Pleasant, said lawmakers cannot cave into the
pressure of outside influences when they return next week for a legislative
session that could be marked by the divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Ravenel said an out-of-state reporter asked him recently, ``Aren't you
people in South Carolina worried about what the people in the rest of the
country think about you?'' The crowd shouted back with a resounding ``No.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flag issue came up in the opening moments of a debate Friday in South
Carolina among Republican presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush said South Carolinians should decide for themselves whether
the flag should fly atop their Statehouse. Earlier, publisher Steve Forbes also
called it a local issue.

<HEADLINE> Ed Board meets to discuss interim chancellor candidates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - With pressure from City Hall mounting, the Board of
Education met Saturday to discuss candidates for interim schools chancellor.
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appeared strongly opposed to the board's leading
choice, Harold Levy, a banking executive with ties to the Democratic Party.
Board members interviewed Levy and two other candidates Friday, and said they
hoped to choose a temporary replacement for ousted former Chancellor Rudy Crew
by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani administration was pressuring board members to back off their
support for Levy, a lawyer for Citicorp and a member of the state Board of
Regents.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's supporters on the board had appeared to be pushing for Joseph
Viteritti, a New York University research professor who has served as a policy
adviser to the mayor. But the cable news channel New York 1 reported Saturday
that Viteritti withdrew his name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   City Hall may try to propose a compromise candidate. Robert Kiley, former
chairman of the Metropolitan Tranportation Authority and current head of the New
York City Partnership, was considered a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, board members interviewed Levy, Viteritti and John Jay Iselin,
who has been president of Channel 13 and Cooper Union for the Advancement of
Science and Art.
</P>
<P>
	   The board reconvened Saturday afternoon to assess the merits of each
candidate. The board has said it's seeking a leader with strong management
skills.
</P>
<P>
	   Members voted to buy out the remainder of Crew's contract. The board will
choose a new chancellor after finding an interim replacement.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Visits Storm-Battered Areas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   USSEL, France (AP) -- President Jacques Chirac visited a wind-battered forest
on Saturday and met with cleanup teams in a central region of France badly hit
by storms that swept through Europe two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the place where I have my roots, and I find it disfigured,'' said
Chirac, who lives in a chateau in the Correze region when he is not at the
Elysee palace in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be dozens and dozens of years before this landscape recovers its
equilibrium and harmony,'' he said at a devastated forest near the town of
Ussel. ``It is an incomparable loss for the people who live here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president met with soldiers and electricity teams working to clear trees
and fix power lines damaged in the two storms.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer than 100,000 French homes were still without power Saturday, the
national electric company EDF said. Most of the affected households were in the
country's central and southwestern regions. Teams from throughout Europe have
helped EDF restore electricity to the 3.4 million French homes that originally
lost power.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety people in France died in storm-related incidents. The violent weather
also uprooted millions of trees from the nation's forests and parks and damaged
historical monuments such as the Notre Dame cathedral and the royal palace at
Versailles.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Gen. Wants Kosovo Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top Yugoslav Army general threatened Saturday
to return to Kosovo, charging that NATO peacekeepers and U.N. officials have
failed to prevent a genocide against Serbs in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia's control over its southern province has been ``only temporarily
suspended,'' Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic was quoted as saying by the official Tanjug
news agency. ``Nobody will take Kosovo away from us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists in Kosovo. After
NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic Albanians
began attacking Serbs as revenge. Thousands of Serbs have fled the province.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Genocide over Serbs and other non-Albanians continues, with daily examples
of incompetence and bias of international forces in carrying out their
obligations,'' Pavkovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   He pledged that the Yugoslav Army will return to the province, but did not
give a time frame.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, the Yugoslav government accused opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic of conspiring with the French intelligence service to try to topple
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Draskovic had several talks with the French intelligence service ... and
in 1999 offered to cooperate with any foreign service for an adequate amount of
money,'' Information Minister Goran Matic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Matic has previously alleged that foreign powers were plotting to oust
Milosevic, but Saturday was the first time he implicated Draskovic, the leader
of the Serbian Renewal Movement, in his allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Matic showed what he said was a taped confession of a Yugoslav national. The
man was arrested for allegedly being a member of a French commando group with
instructions to topple Milosevic by force. The somewhat blurred footage showed
him talking about Draskovic's alleged meetings with a top French official.
</P>
<P>
	   Draskovic aide Predrag Simic dismissed the allegations, which he said were
aimed at undermining a meeting of opposition leaders. The leaders are expected
to forge a joint strategy against Milosevic on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government is trying to divert attention from all the tragedies and
disasters in our country for which they are responsible,'' Simic said.
</P>
<P>
	   French foreign affairs officials declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> French Say Seafood Not Contaminated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREST, France (AP) -- French authorities said Saturday that seafood already
on the market showed no signs of contamination from an oil slick floating off
France's northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, federal food agencies introduced a ban on fishing and oyster
harvesting off the worst-hit shorelines. Many local governments along the
Atlantic had already banned such activities for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, the analyses on shellfish and fish at the consumer level have
shown an absence of contamination,'' a statement from several state food
agencies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of protesters marched Saturday through the streets of the coastal
town of Saint-Nazaire, calling for Franco-Belgian oil company TotalFina to take
more responsibility for the spill, LCI television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``Erika'' tanker, chartered by TotalFina, cracked in half on Dec. 12,
spilling 3 million gallons of heavy oil into the waters off the picturesque
Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has offered to pay $6 million for a part of the clean up. It was
unclear how much the total bill would cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil continued to wash up on land Saturday, and teams were still scraping up
gummy patches from 250 miles of coastline. About 6 million gallons of oil remain
trapped in the two halves of the sunken tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, a governmental food safety watchdog group proposed
several more precautions, including a ban on the sale of salt and seaweed from
the visibly affected coasts.

<HEADLINE> $10,000 Offered for Malaysia Tribe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- A Swiss activist offered $10,000 to help the
nomadic Penan tribe, but the local government refused the aid, calling it a
publicity stunt, the Malaysian news agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno Manser said he had hoped the money would be used to help improve the
living conditions of the Penans, believed to be the world's last nomadic rain
forest tribe, Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penans, which live in the state of Sarawak on Borneo island, fear they
may die out as a result of the industrial revolution, which is making inroads
into their habitat deep in the lush forests.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Sarawak government brushed aside the aid offer, calling it ``just
another publicity stunt,'' the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The shy Penans live off palm, bear and boar and then move on to where the
forest has regenerated for thousands of years. The government wants to bring
them into society's mainstream by offering them homes with running water,
schools and work.
</P>
<P>
	   Manser reportedly offered to help the government run a mobile dental clinic
for the Penans and the Kelabits, another nomadic tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   Manser, a self-proclaimed champion of the Penans, lived with them until he
was arrested in 1987 for anti-logging activities.
</P>
<P>
	   After his deportation, Manser re-entered Sarawak clandestinely. He caused a
stir last year by landing solo in a glider at a construction site near the state
capital, Kuching.

	   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,'' the former
New Jersey senator said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a
change?''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade. Net farm income in Iowa is projected
at $40.4 billion in 2000, down $7.6 billion from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ``better off'' line echoed a theme used by Republican Ronald
Reagan in his winning, 1980 campaign, which Bradley has said he admires for its
concentration on big-issue proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education -- a
familiar array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and
Gore revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer''?'' he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim that he'd been
down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to survive scandal and
impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to President Clinton have
been a time of the greatest economic progress in American history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to start by telling you what we have been doing in that Washington
bunker,'' Gore said, saying the administration has delivered on health reform,
job creation and budget surpluses. The vice president said that as president, he
would deliver on those fronts and more. ``That's not a bunker,'' he said,
``Those are the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage. Bradley said he
would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate,
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' he said. ''... I reject that kind
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, with editor Dennis
Ryerson as moderator. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 --
including some the candidates used to demonstrate points.
</P>
<P>
	   On agriculture, Bradley said family farmers have had no real help, ``no
safety net whatsoever,'' from the current administration. The former New Jersey
senator said he wants policy changes to help small farmers. ``You can talk about
the past, but I want to talk about the future,'' Bradley told Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he could understand Bradley's reluctance to talk about the past,
saying his rival had voted against emergency aid to farmers in midwest floods,
and against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa, demanding
that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified commodities. Europe and
Japan resist those products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy,'' said Gore, who
said ``sound science'' should govern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get
access to markets,'' said Bradley. ``The problem with agriculture in America is
serious, in Iowa it's dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Iowa poll showed the challenge facing Bradley; Gore led him by 21
percentage points in a survey for the Des Moines Register among Democrats who
said they intend to vote in the party caucuses two weeks from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers: Gore 54 percent; Bradley 33 percent. The margin of error was
4.4 percentage points either way.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to the debate, Gore stopped his motorcade outside a Titan Tire
Corp., to shake hands with picketing steel workers. ``I want to fight for you as
president,'' he told them. ``I need you to fight for me at the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had an eye on labor supporters, too, making of the point by
mentioning twice in the debate that he'd been at a Teamsters' picket line. The
AFL-CIO has endorsed Gore, but the Teamsters have not.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, Bradley appeared on WHO-TV in Des Moines, and said he
disagrees with the government decision to return Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
refugee, to Cuba. ``I thought that the boy should stay in the United States,''
Bradley said. ''... I think the courts should review it. The ideal situation
would be for the boy and his father to be in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father is in Cuba and wants his son back. The controversy over the boy,
whose mother died trying to get to Florida, is a political headache for the
administration. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy
returned, stirring Cuban American demonstrations in Miami and Republican demands
that he stay. Gore says the courts should decide.

<HEADLINE> Cleric Charged in US Embassy Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A Muslim cleric from neighboring South Africa has
been charged with threatening to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Harare, a
state-controlled newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The embassy was closed to the public after Mohammed Yesudas, 28, from the
South African city of Durban, allegedly threatened on Christmas Eve to blow up a
vehicle near the mission in Zimbabwe's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Security guards told would-be visitors the embassy was closed until Jan. 4
``for security reasons. Embassy officials could not be reached Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Yesudas was in custody on charges of threatening to commit acts of
terrorism, The Herald reported. If convicted, he faces 10 years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   He is accused of going to the heavily fortified embassy and telling a
Zimbabwean security company employee he was a commando trained in Afghanistan,
and planned to detonate explosives packed in a vehicle at the diplomatic
mission.
</P>
<P>
	   The security guard alerted police after the bizarre conversation, and police
tracked down and apprehended Yesudas on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Security at the two-story U.S. Embassy, overlooking gardens about a mile
from the city center, has been fortified since the American embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania were bombed in 1998. The United States suspects Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi who has been hiding out in Afghanistan, masterminded those attacks, in
which 224 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   A line of concrete blocks prevents vehicles coming within 10 yards of the
U.S. Embassy's outer wall in Harare. A side road has been closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, suspected Iraqi agents blew up the foyer of Harare's Sheraton
International Hotel, injuring three people, as a reprisal for Zimbabwe's
pro-U.S. stance during the Persian Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Democratic Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Excerpts from Saturday's Democratic debate in Johnston, Iowa, among
Democratic presidential candidates Al Gore and Bill Bradley, as transcribed by
the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service:
</P>
<P>
	   On how their proposed health care plans would aid older Americans on fixed
incomes:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: As a part of an overall health care program that I've proposed, I
cover drug costs for senior citizens. After they've paid the first $800, they
pay 25 percent above that. If we make sure they get access to the right drugs
and we pay for them, that will save overall health care costs, because they will
not be put into hospitals or have to pay very much high expenses for doctor
bills.
</P>
<P>
	   So, it makes good sense in a human area. It also makes tremendous sense in
terms of saving money.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I allocate $374 billion over the next 10 years to the Medicare
program. Under Senator Bradley's plan, he doesn't put a penny into Medicare. And
I don't think that's a good approach because I think we need to take care to
protect Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   Under my plan, she would get the cost of her prescription drugs covered.
Under Senator Bradley's plan, she would have a $500 deductible and then $300
premiums, so she wouldn't get a penny of help under Senator Bradley's plan. And
if she gets Medicaid, which does pay prescription drugs, she wouldn't get it
there either because he cancels Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On exports of genetically engineered produce that are being blocked by some
trading partners:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think the most important thing we can do is to use our authority
under the World Trade Organization in order to petition to get access to
markets. When, for example, Europe blocked our beef because of beef hormones, we
went to the WTO. We formed a dispute settlement mechanism. We presented our
case, and they ruled in our favor. There's still delay in the entry of that beef
into Europe, but the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: The key point is we can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm
policy. The decisions on GMOs, as they're referred to, or hormones in livestock
really ought to be based on sound science. Not science controlled by people
working for the companies that profit from these new technologies, but neutral,
dispassionate experts who will give us the best and most accurate conclusions
about their safety. If they are safe, and if they enhance productivity at no
risk, then we ought to be able to use them.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On restoring public trust in government:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I think that we need campaign finance reform in order to restore a
sense of trust and integrity in our government, and that's why I've supported,
for 20 years, full public financing of elections. That's why I don't accept any
PAC contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   And that's why I have suggested that we have twice-weekly debates, and
instead of depending on these 30-second television ads and 60-second television
ads, let's depend on debates like this one. Maybe the next one could be on
agriculture. I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
show: ``Is that your final answer?''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Gore asked Bradley why he voted against disaster relief following Iowa
floods in 1993:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: You know, Al, I think that the premise of your question is wrong.
This is not about the past. This is about the future. This is about what we're
going to do to change the agriculture policy we've had the last eight, 10 years.
The Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The family farmers that I've talked to in this state, who are the backbone
of this agricultural economy, have had no real help. Freedom to Farm (Act)
failed. There was supposed to be a safety net. The administration said they were
going to put a safety net in, and the first year after it passed, no safety net
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, I understand why you don't want to talk about the past, because
in addition to voting against the -- you know, those floods -- they created a
new great lake on the satellite pictures out here. It was a genuine catastrophe,
and most people said, yes, these farmers need help.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On instances when U.S. forces should be used in international military
operations:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: We always retain command of our armed forces. If we're part of an
international alliance, our commander in chief always retains command. I think
that we have to have assurance that military force is the only option that can
really solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   We have to make sure that we've tried everything else. And we have to make
sure that military force, if used, will in fact solve the problem. We ought to
have allies who are ready to go in with us and share the burden.
</P>
<P>
	   We ought to also be absolutely certain that the expected cost is worth what
we are protecting by way of our national security interests.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I don't think that we can be the policeman to the world. I don't
think we have the wisdom or the resources to do that. And that means we're going
to have to move more and more to multilateral forums to resolve this, such as
the United Nations. I personally think the action in East Timor is an example of
how to work right.
</P>
<P>
	   And so I believe that the key thing is to never relinquish control of our
troops, our command, but integrate more fully into a United Nations operation to
deal with these ethnic disputes that are popping up all over the world today. We
can't be involved in all 32 ethnic disputes in the world with our own forces. It
has to be something we do together.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On foreign policy challenges facing the next president:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think the most important challenge for the next president of the
United States in the international arena is maintaining strategic stability that
now exists between China, Japan, Russia, Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   If we have any disruption of that, there'll be another arms race, we'll lose
a lot of momentum that we have going forward. That is the central most important
thing.
</P>
<P>
	   Second, I think we need to take our defense budget and move it more to a
post-Cold War defense budget. We're still locked in the Cold War with a lot of
assumptions and weapon systems that should change to meet the new threats, like
nuclear proliferation, biological and chemical weapons, like cyberwar, terrorism
and threats in the Persian Gulf and in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On defense spending's effects on social programs:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: We have tremendous economic growth driven by technological change
and globalization, innovation, entrepreneurship in the private sector. That is
producing this tremendous surplus. That means we can do more to try to help
community colleges. I've proposed a way to do that -- $2 billion for community
colleges -- because that's where people learn more so that they can earn more
for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
	   And one of the things that strikes me is if you look at what Al wants to
spend money on, he wants to spend $127 billion on defense increases and wants to
spend less than that for education.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, that's not right. First of all, I've presided over the so-called
reinventing government program to downsize our federal bureaucracy, including,
more than any other, the Pentagon and the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
	   But you know, even as we've kept our military strong, we've turned the
biggest deficits into the biggest surpluses in history. And now we have an
opportunity to invest in education and human services. And if you work in the
field of human services, you know how important Medicaid is to the people who
receive those human services.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley on what he calls Gore's ``misrepresentation'' that Bradley's
proposed health-care program would eliminate Medicare without offering a viable
option:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: What we have here is a scare tactic to try to make people say that
what I want to do in terms of replacing Medicaid with something better, so that
40 percent of the people who live in poverty in this country who don't have
Medicaid or any health insurance will have some health insurance, will be afraid
to make this change. I reject that kind of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On education:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think we need a major investment in early education and early
child care. I would get kids ready to learn by doubling the slots in Head Start.
I would then propose adding 600,000 great new teachers to the public schools of
this country over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   So you can look at education in terms of where people live their lives --
and that's the way I look at it -- or you can look at it as if it's some
bureaucratic box that says ``education'' that's unrelated to everything else we
do in our lives. I think it's a different perspective on how we view education
in this country. I have the perspective of life, and I think the vice president
has a perspective that it's a box called education.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On school violence:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: The number one cause of this problem is the need for better parenting,
and that's not a copout. That's a real issue. And we need to help parents with
an increase in the minimum wage, an expansion of the earned income tax credit,
more flexibility to balance work and family and a lot of other measures to help
these working families.
</P>
<P>
	   But now the one thing that all these incidents have in common is that they
involve guns. And that's why I've helped to pass the toughest new gun-control
measure in the last generation. I'm now proposing photo-license IDs for the
purchase of a new handgun, a ban on assault weapons and Saturday night specials
and so-called junk guns, and a policy of zero tolerance in our schools.
</P>
<P>
	   But, frankly, I think beyond guns, we also need to ask for more
self-restraint in the media.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: The first step is commonsense gun control. And by that I mean
registration and licensing of all handguns in America. If we can do that for
automobiles, we ought to be able to do that -- we ought to be able to do that
for handguns. I'm the only person who's called for registration and licensing of
all handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On campaign finance reform:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: Money distorts the democratic process in a fundamental way.
</P>
<P>
	   The rich in this country should be able to buy as many vacations and homes
and cars as they want, but they shouldn't be able to buy our democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   And until we have public financing of elections -- we spend $900 million on
democracy abroad, we ought to be able to spend the same amount of money to
totally take the special interests out of democracy at home. And then our
government will be returned to the people and this woman will believe once again
and trust government to do the right thing most of the time.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, we basically agree on campaign finance reform. We support the
same proposals. I feel like we could make the immediate progress that I talked
about earlier by getting rid of the majority of the campaign finance that goes
into these 30-second TV ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But, you know, I support the McCain-Feingold measure. I support full public
financing of federal elections. I refuse to accept any PAC contributions. I have
the smallest average contributor in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On the ``gender wage gap'':
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I support an equal day's pay for an equal day's work. I support
vigorous enforcement of our laws against discrimination, including affirmative
action, which all the Republicans are attacking today.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think that it is very important that leadership uses affirmative
action to advance, to break through the glass ceilings that are in our country
today.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that appointments should reflect that you see a world without
gender. I think that women in the country today have so much talent burgeoning
into the scene in the corporate sector and slowly in government. I think that
there's an opportunity to unlock enormous potential in our society, so that we
can be as good as we can possibly be.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   On the character of the presidency:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I do think we have a different approach, different experiences, a
different philosophy of what a president should do. I don't think that the
presidency is an academic exercise or a seminar on theories. I think the
presidency has to be a day-to-day, resolute fight for the American people.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidency, when you think about it, is the only position mentioned in
our Constitution where the individual who holds it has a responsibility to fight
not just for some special interest or one particular region or the wealthy or
the connected. He or she has a responsibility to fight for all of the people.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: What leadership is about, I believe, is taking a national problem
-- health care, education -- turning it into a public issue, and then engaging
the idealism of the American people in order to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what FDR did in the 1930s with Social Security. That's what Lyndon
Johnson did with civil rights and Medicare in the 1960s. They didn't say,
``Well, we're just going to cover 20 percent of the people and see how it works
out.'' They said, ``We're going to cover everybody with Social Security,
everybody with Medicare.'' Just like I want to cover everybody with health care.
And when they did that, they made us all better off.

<HEADLINE> Croatia's Presidential Race Begins  </HEADLINE>
   By EUGENE BRCIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Contenders in Croatia's presidential race formally
kicked off their campaigns Saturday, scrambling to meet as many people as
possible before voters head to the polls to pick a successor to the late Franjo
Tudjman.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Mate Granic, considered the favorite in the Jan. 24
presidential race, held a rally in his hometown of Baska Voda, some 190 miles
from the capital, Zagreb. The moderate politician hopes his familiarity as a
longtime foreign minister will help propel him into office.
</P>
<P>
	   His main rival, Drazen Budisa, whose coalition crushed Granic's Croatian
Democratic Union party in recent parliamentary elections, was also getting ready
to hit the campaign trail Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Budisa's double-decker bus will zigzag the claw-shaped country, visiting 100
towns to give voters a chance to meet the man who says he wants to be their
``neighborly president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stipe Mesic, a former Croat representative under the old Yugoslav
presidency, is the only other candidate with a chance of hindering Granic and
Budisa. But Mesic will have a tough time winning exposure in the state-run
media.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman, who led the country to independence in 1991, died midway through
his second term last December following a long bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Croatia's constitution stipulates that a president must be elected within 60
days. Parliament speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, has assumed presidential duties until
a new leader is chosen but will not be running in the upcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> Judge Apologizes for Case Comments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The judge who evoked outrage for suggesting that an
11-year-old girl was partly to blame for being sexually molested apologized for
his comments.
</P>
<P>
	   Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Durke G. Thompson raised the ire of
child advocates and prosecutors when he told the girl's parents that it ``takes
two to tango'' as he sentenced Vladimir Chacon-Bonilla, 23 to serve 18 months in
jail for a second-degree sex offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the girl told police that she had sex with Chacon-Bonilla,
whom she met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, Thompson said, ``I regret if these words have caused
concern and confusion over the seriousness and gravity with which I treated this
matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   State's Attorney Douglas F. Gansler said the sentence was ``more appropriate
for a shoplifter'' and that saying the girl was partly to blame was
inappropriate.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: UNITA Sanctions Tighter Now  </HEADLINE>
   By CASIMIRO SIONA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- The United Nations has made progress in enforcing
international sanctions against the rebel group UNITA, the head of the U.N.
sanctions committee for Angola said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions against UNITA, which has waged a two-decade war against the
Angolan government, are more effective now than ``at any time in the past,''
Robert Fowler said in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
	   Fowler, Canada's ambassador to the United Nations, arrived Saturday in the
Angolan capital, Luanda, for a weeklong visit aimed at examining ways of
tightening the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA in 1993
in an effort to hinder its ability to wage war.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions were expanded in 1998 to include a ban on the group's diamond
exports, estimated to have supplied the rebels with up to $4 billion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Fowler, who has launched a campaign to tighten the sanctions, was to gather
information to present a report at a special Security Council meeting on Angola
later this month. He also was to examine sophisticated new UNITA weaponry
captured by the army, and try to establishing its origin.
</P>
<P>
	   The army said it recently found chemical weapons in a UNITA arms cache in
the central highlands, though it declined to give details. UNITA also purchased
tanks and long-range artillery from Eastern European countries, including
Bulgaria and Ukraine, the army said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fowler was scheduled to hold talks with government officials to discuss how
to choke off UNITA's international diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels resumed battles with the government in December 1998, confirming
long-held suspicions that the sanctions weren't working.
</P>
<P>
	   The resumption of fighting shattered a four-year-old U.N.-brokered peace
accord designed to end a war, which first erupted after Angola gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   UNITA is a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola.

<HEADLINE> Boy, 11, Charged with Raping Girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Prosecutors have charged an 11-year-old boy with raping
an 8-year-old girl in a relative's apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   The middle school student was charged Friday with first-degree sexual
assault of a child. Dane County Juvenile Court Commissioner Jim Olds ordered the
boy held in the juvenile jail pending a plea hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, who has been in foster care, has five prior convictions for theft,
attempted armed robbery, damage to property and other offenses, court records
showed.
</P>
<P>
	   According to allegations filed in Juvenile Court, he was at a relative's
apartment where several children were ``playing house'' while the adult was at
work, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy allegedly took the girl into a bedroom, covered her mouth with his
hand and raped her, Madison police spokesman Dave Gouran said.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl was taken the following day to Meriter Hospital, where officials
alerted police. Detectives arrested the boy at school on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Debate Highlights  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights from Saturday's debate between Democratic presidential candidates
Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley:
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley were asked about what they would do to help Iowa farmers
export their products abroad:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think the most important thing we can do is to use our authority
under the World Trade Organization in order to petition to get access to
markets. When, for example, Europe blocked our beef because of beef hormones, we
went to the WTO. We formed a dispute settlement mechanism. We presented our
case, and they ruled in our favor. There's still delay in the entry of that beef
into Europe, but the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
	   I think we have to continue to push, under the remedies that are available
to us under the World Trade Organization, to get access to markets for our
agricultural goods.
</P>
<P>
	   But we all know that the problem of agriculture in this country is serious.
In Iowa it's dead serious. I've talked to thousands of family farmers over the
last year, and it means we have to change policy. It means we have to get the
antitrust division to get after these large packers that are discriminating
against family farmers. It means that we have to have a conservation reserve
program expanded. It means that we have to provide income supplement to farmers,
based upon the relationship between price and their costs, and it has to go to
them with a cap so it only goes to family farmers and not to big corporate
farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: You know, the key point is we can't let Europe and Japan determine our
farm policy. The decisions on GMOs, as they're referred to, or hormones in
livestock really ought to be based on sound science. Not science controlled by
people working for the companies that profit from these new technologies, but
neutral, dispassionate experts who will give us the best and most accurate
conclusions about their safety. If they are safe, and if they enhance
productivity at no risk, then we ought to be able to use them. ...
</P>
<P>
	   Now with consumer preferences emerging and evolving, at some point, we've
really got to take a hard look and look at our hole cards here. Because we don't
want farmers to be out on a limb and left holding the bag. But the best approach
is to use sound science, make the careful and correct decisions, and not let
Europe and Japan make them for us.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Gore asked Bradley why he voted against disaster relief after the floods in
1993 that devastated many Iowa farmers:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: You know, Al, I think that the premise of your question is wrong.
This is not about the past. This is about the future. This is about what we're
going to do to change the agriculture policy we've had the last eight, 10 years.
The Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The family farmers that I've talked to in this state, who are the backbone
of this agricultural economy, have had no real help. Freedom to Farm (Act)
failed. There was supposed to be a safety net. The administration said they were
going to put a safety net in, and the first year after it passed, no safety net
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked by a Des Moines Register reader when U.S. forces
should be used for international peacekeeping:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I think we have to have a national security interest at stake. I think
that we have to have assurance that military force is the only option that can
really solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   We have to make sure that we've tried everything else. And we have to make
sure that military force, if used, will in fact solve the problem. We ought to
have allies who are ready to go in with us and share the burden.
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I don't think that we can be the policeman to the world. I don't
think we have the wisdom or the resources to do that. And that means we're going
to have to move more and more to multilateral forums to resolve this, such as
the United Nations. I personally think the action in East Timor is an example of
how to work right.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates were asked what would they would do to improve public
schools:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: I think there are other things, too, that are relevant to
education. I think that when a child arrives at the first grade and hasn't had
any health care and is sick, a good health care insurance is education policy as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   I think last year, when 800,000 kids took a gun to school, that sensible gun
control is good education policy as well.
</P>
<P>
	   So, you can look at education in terms of where people live their lives --
and that's the way I look at it -- or you can look at it as if it's some
bureaucratic box that says `education' that's unrelated to everything else we do
in our lives.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Well, you're right that I've made it my top priority for investing in
the future, and I'm proud to have the support of the Iowa teachers for this plan
and for my candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, I came here to Iowa to begin my issues campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley responded to Gore's criticism of his health care plan. Gore said
that under Bradley's plan that many lower-income people would not be able to
afford health care:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: What we have here is a scare tactic to try to make people say that
what I want to do in terms of replacing Medicaid with something better, so that
40 percent of the people who live in poverty in this country who don't have
Medicaid or any health insurance, will have some health insurance, will be
afraid to make this change. I reject that kind of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's response:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: The people that you are training yourself to serve are the ones who
most need a champion. And a president of the United States -- and I think
candidates for president -- need to be willing to fight for those who most need
the help, and the people who are now getting Medicaid. Those who have
Alzheimer's. The disabled. Those who are poor. Those who don't have any option.
They deserve somebody who's willing to fight for them, not just theorize about
them.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore were asked by an Iowa citizen why Americans should care
about the outcome of this election:
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: That's a fundamental question for our democracy. One of the reasons
that I got into this race was try to restore confidence in the collective will
and a belief in public integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   I think that the single most important thing is campaign finance reform ...
until we have public financing of elections -- we spend $900 million on
democracy abroad; we ought to be able to spend the same amount of money to
totally take the special interests out of democracy at home. And then our
government will be returned to the people and this woman will believe once again
and trust government to do the right thing most of the time.
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: Now, the reason I think this question goes beyond campaign finance
reform is that I remember when I came back from Vietnam I was so disillusioned
with the whole notion of politics and public service. I'd watched my dad be
defeated for supporting civil rights so many years ago. I watched Watergate and
all of the mistakes that were being foisted on the American people.
</P>
<P>
	   And here's -- to your questioner, here's what changed my attitude: I saw
people like many of the ones here in this audience who had a full day of work,
and yet they were still willing to roll up their sleeves and go to their town
meetings and caucuses. And they were willing to get deeply involved in making
democracy work.
</P>
<P>
	   The answer to this question must come in part from the person who asked the
question. And a president who leads in that direction can help unlock that
potential to rekindle the spirit of America.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Highlights of Gore and Bradley's closing statements:
</P>
<P>
	   GORE: I want to fight for you and I want to ask you to go to the caucuses on
Jan. 24 at 7 p.m. And when you do, just imagine what it will be like when we
have a nation with high quality health care for all. When we have truly
revolutionary improvements in our public schools with the new teachers and
smaller class size. When we have a safety net for farmers that works. When we
restore a sense of meaning and purpose to the lives of our children. When we are
able to provide the kind of model and leadership here in the United States of
America that causes other nations all around the world to say: ``We want the
kind of freedom that America stands for.''
</P>
<P>
	   BRADLEY: This election's not about experience. We both have experience. It's
about leadership. It's about presidential leadership. ...
</P>
<P>
	   And so, bold leadership is important, and the absence of bold leadership
also has results. For example, let's take agriculture. Al's been hammering me on
my agriculture votes 15 years ago. But I would simply ask the family farmers of
Iowa today, are you better off than you were seven years ago? Or do we need a
change? Do we need to take a step to make things happen?

<HEADLINE> State police investigator disciplined in politically motivated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - The state police has demoted, reassigned and
suspended an investigator who officials said planned a politically motivated
traffic stop days before Election Day.
<P>
	   State police Lt. Jamie Mills said the investigator pleaded guilty to
departmental charges of misconduct and was reassigned to the uniformed road
patrol, transferred from the Albany-area troop to the Hudson Valley, suspended
without pay for a "substantial" period and given a letter of censure, reported
The Daily Gazette of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills wouldn't identify the investigator.
</P>
<P>
	   State police said the investigator received "detailed" information from an
acquaintance outside the state police about George Robertson - a top local
official and ally of Schenectady Mayor Albert Jurczynski who was in the midst of
a bitter reelection campaign. The information, later proved false, claimed
Robertson was driving with a suspended license, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigator relayed the incorrect information to a trooper who saw
Robertson driving and pulled him over on Oct. 26, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson was ticketed for driving with a suspended license, having lapsed
insurance and not wearing a seat belt. The first two charges subsequently were
dropped and the seat belt charge is to be dismissed if Robertson stays out of
trouble for six months.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills said the investigator had engineered the stop at the behest of an
acquaintance, who had it in for Robertson. She did not name the acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a personal friendship  1/8the former investigator 3/8 had with
somebody outside the state police," Mills said. "This person had provided him
with information about Mr. Robertson ... It was a personal agenda on the part of
this investigator's friend."
</P>
<P>
	   Robertson said he knew the stop was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's unfortunate because I think the police power of the state
should not be used in politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurczynski, a Republican, said he believes the state police should reveal
the identities of everyone in the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm pleased that the state police took appropriate action to discipline the
officers involved, but whoever it was that approached the state police, I would
like that information to be made public, whoever that may be," said the mayor,
who is closely allied with GOP Gov. George Pataki. "I would call on the state
police in the name of justice to let the public know who was behind this."
</P>
<P>
	   Jurczynski's opponent, Democrat Gary McCarthy denied any knowledge of the
plan. "I had nothing to do with it. It's the first I'm hearing of this," he said
Friday, referring to the discipline.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore, Bush Lead in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has shored up his lead over
former Sen. Bill Bradley among Iowans planning to vote in the Democratic Party
caucuses this month, a new poll indicates. Among Republicans, it found George W.
Bush holding to his solid lead over five other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Des Moines Register's poll of registered voters -- 500 Republicans and
501 Democrats -- found Gore with support of 54 percent, Bradley of 33 percent.
Thirteen percent said they were unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was the favorite of 45 percent of the Republicans polled, down from 49
percent in a similar poll conducted in November, with publisher Steve Forbes
second at 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a national poll released Saturday by Newsweek magazine, Bush held almost
a 5-1 lead over second-place Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Bush's 63 percent to
McCain's 13 percent. Newsweek said the national poll had the Gore-Bradley run
for the Democratic nomination ``up for grabs'': Gore has the support of 50
percent to Bradley's 25 percent, but 25 percent of respondents said they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa poll was based on a random telephone survey of people who said they
definitely or probably will participate in Iowa's leadoff caucuses Jan. 24. It
was conducted Jan. 2-6 by pollsters Selzer &AMP; Co. of Des Moines. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses, held in more than 2,000 locations across the state, launch the
presidential nominating season.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, McCain held third in a statistical three-way tie
with conservative commentator Alan Keyes and activist Gary Bauer. Keyes had 9
percent, McCain 8 percent, Bauer 7 percent. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, had 5
percent, and 11 percent said they were unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Newsweek national poll, Princeton Research Associates interviewed
753 adults Jan. 6-7, leaving a margin of error at 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll found a decline in the number of voters who felt that ``good people
are being discouraged from running for office by the high cost of campaigns is a
major problem.'' It found 58 percent agreeing with that question, down from 63
percent in an October poll.
</P>
<P>
	   That could cut into McCain's voting bank. He has made campaign finance
reform his major issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also showed that few GOP voters seemed put off by the huge amounts
of campaign money amassed by Bush -- almost $58 million through Sept. 30.
Indeed, 84 percent saw it as a sign of a successful, well-organized candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, however, 47 percent said the money gives Bush an unfair
advantage, and 37 percent worried that he was trying to buy his way into office.

Gore, Bradley Debate Health Care
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare Iowa
voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal today while the vice
president said he is campaigning on "the front lines in the fight for our future
and has "not been hiding in a Washington bunker." The contenders argued about
health care, farm policy, education -- a familiar array after four prior
Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and Gore revived his challenge for
even more debates. He said they should meet twice a week, scrap TV ads, and
debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.

Confederate Flag Rally Draws 6,000
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- An estimated 6,000 people gathered today under a sea
of red Confederate flags to defend the banner that has flown from the Statehouse
dome for 38 years and thrust the state into the national spotlight. Today's
event was the second day of a three-day rally being staged by supporters of the
flag, who say it stands for defiant defense of freedom and Southern heritage.
The NAACP says the banner is a symbol of slavery. And at the other end of Main
Street, leaders of the state NAACP met but did not decide to widen economic
sanctions against South Carolina beyond a tourism boycott that started a week
ago.

Soldier Pleads Guilty in Killing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A soldier pleaded guilty to a reduced charge
today in the killing of a barracks mate, beaten to death in his sleep, who had
been rumored to be gay. Army Spc. Justin R. Fisher, 26, admitted he lied to
military investigators and obstructed the investigation when he wiped blood from
a baseball bat that Pvt. Calvin Glover used to kill Pfc. Barry Winchell. Under a
plea agreement, the Army dropped other charges, including participating as a
principal to premeditated murder and acting as an accessory after the fact.

Cuban-Americans Suspend Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep Elian Gonzalez in the
United States, Cuban-American leaders said today they will temporarily halt
protests against plans to return the child to Cuba. The organizers cited a "more
positive course" in the ongoing custody battle over the 6-year-old. That
includes a subpoena issued by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify
before a House committee and efforts by Elian's relatives to attain custody of
the child. Committee sources said it is unlikely Elian will actually be asked to
appear.

Cleric Charged in U.S. Embassy Threat
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A Muslim cleric from neighboring South Africa has
been charged with threatening to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Harare, a
state-controlled newspaper reported today. The embassy was closed to the public
after Mohammed Yesudas, 28, from the South African city of Durban, allegedly
threatened on Christmas Eve to blow up a vehicle near the mission in Zimbabwe's
capital. Security at the two-story U.S. Embassy, overlooking gardens about a
mile from the city center, has been fortified since the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania were bombed in 1998.

Serb Gen. Threatens Kosovo Return

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top Yugoslav Army general threatened today to
return to Kosovo, charging that NATO peacekeepers and U.N. officials have failed
to prevent a genocide against Serbs in the southern Yugoslav province. Serbia's
control over its southern province has been "only temporarily suspended," Gen.
Nebojsa Pavkovic was quoted as saying by the official Tanjug news agency. Also
today, the Yugoslav government accused opposition leader Vuk Draskovic of
conspiring with the French intelligence service to try to topple Milosevic.

Titans Get Last-Second Win Over Bills
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kevin Dyson sped 75 yards down the left sideline
with a lateral on a kickoff for the winning touchdown with three seconds
remaining today, lifting the Tennessee Titans to a 22-16 playoff victory over
the stunned Buffalo Bills. The Titans had to survive a video review. Buffalo
players, meanwhile, lay strewn on the turf, in shock that they allowed Tennessee
to steal the first playoff game of 2000. It was the first touchdown on a kickoff
return for the Titans since 1988, when they were the Houston Oilers, and Dyson's
first kickoff return ever.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Publisher Nackey Loeb Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Nackey S. Loeb, the former publisher of The
(Manchester) Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News who during the
impeachment scandal ran a headline calling President Clinton ``a disgrace'',
died Saturday morning at her home, the newspaper said. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb had been in failing health due in part to complications associated
with her partial paralysis from a 1977 car accident.
</P>
<P>
	   She retired in May but still maintained an interest in the affairs of the
Manchester newspapers and consulted on the recent endorsement of Steve Forbes in
next month's Republican New Hampshire Primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union Leader is the largest newspaper in the state and the only
statewide daily, and the New Hampshire Sunday News is the largest Sunday paper
in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb and her late husband, William Loeb, bought the newspapers in the
1940s and turned them into two of the nation's most conservative papers. William
Loeb's blunt editorial style and his active involvement in the state's
presidential primaries earned the Union Leader a national reputation that his
wife continued to nurture.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb, born in 1924 to Robert and Margaret Scripps and an heir to the
Scripps Howard publishing fortune, took over as publisher after her husband died
in 1981. During her 18 years at the helm, she pursued a more quiet, but still
forceful approach.
</P>
<P>
	   An editorial signed by Publisher Joseph McQuaid for Sunday's editions said,
``We were lucky to have her because her commitment to maintain an independent
voice caused her to not only hang onto The Union Leader and Sunday News after
William Loeb's death but to invest in their future and to do the hard work of
leading us there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit by Clinton in February, a week after the Senate voted not to
oust him over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, she didn't hesitate to publish a
front-page editorial with the headline: ``Mr. President, you're a disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan called her his
``political godmother,'' and credited her endorsement for his 1996 New Hampshire
primary upset of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She will always be known as the torch bearer for conservative views,''
said Terrence Williams, publisher of The Telegraph in Nashua. ``She certainly
stayed true to that over the years, and she made quite a name for herself doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb also kept the newspapers in step with the changing needs of their
readers. She made the decision to convert the daily newspaper to a morning
publication and was involved in expanding it onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Details on survivors were not available.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Mayor Willie Brown was sworn in to office Saturday,
acknowledging mistakes during his first term and promising to attack
homelessness and skyrocketing living costs during his second.
</P>
<P>
	   California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald George administered the oath
on the steps of City Hall as Brown raised his right hand and rested his left on
a Bible held by his two young granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This election was a very, very tough election,'' said Brown, who was
forced into a runoff with Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, who
announced his candidacy three weeks before the general election. Brown won 60
percent of the vote in the Dec. 14 runoff.
</P>
<P>
	   Ammiano attracted new people to the political process, Brown said, ``and I
hope that their disappointment will not cause them to leave the fray.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 65-year-old mayor listed fixing the municipal transportation system
among his priorities, which also include establishing affordable housing,
ensuring livable wages and cleaning up the streets.

<HEADLINE> Bus, Truck Crash in N.M., 2 Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TINNIE, N.M. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer rig hauling produce slammed into a
church van preparing to enter a cemetery for a funeral Saturday, killing three
people in the van and injuring 10 other people, state police reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The van from the First Baptist Church of Alamogordo was carrying senior
citizens, said Dorothetta Ernest, manager of the Red Cross service center in
nearby Ruidoso.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were slowing to take a left into the cemetery and they were
rear-ended by the semi,'' said state police Lt. Tim Baughman.
</P>
<P>
	   Baughman said he did not know how many people were in the eastbound van.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten people were taken to hospitals in Ruidoso and Roswell, hospital
representatives said. Conditions of the injured were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   The truck was hauling produce from San Simone, Ariz., to Ontario, Canada,
Baughman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The truck driver was among the injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The collision occurred on two-lane U.S. Highway 70 at Tinnie, a farming and
ranching community in a mountain valley about 200 miles southeast of
Albuquerque. The weather was dry and clear, Baughman said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rebel Attack Leaves Two Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Rebels have killed two local workers of a U.S.-based
humanitarian group in southern Sudan, a government group said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another two Sudanese employees of CARE International are missing after the
attack near the town of Bentiu in Unity province, about 500 miles south of
Khartoum, said a statement from the Humanitarian Aid Commission, an aid group
affiliated with the Ministry of Social Planning.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sudan News Agency said the attack occurred on Jan. 2. Neither the agency
nor the aid commission gave the names of the four aid workers. Government forces
in the region have mounted a search for the two missing employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The report could not be confirmed. CARE officials in Sudan could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
	   Christians and animists from southern Sudan have been fighting since 1983
for autonomy from the Arab, Muslim-dominated government in the north. Nearly 2
million people have died in the war and accompanying famine.
</P>
<P>
	   Unity province has been the scene of other attacks on international aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   In May, the co-pilot of a river barge carrying U.N. aid workers was killed
when rebels fired on the barge. Two relief workers were wounded in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Army Spc. Takes Plea Deal in Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- A soldier pleaded guilty to a reduced charge
Saturday in the beating death of a barracks mate who had been rumored to be gay.
</P>
<P>
	   Army Spc. Justin R. Fisher, 26, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher admitted he lied to military investigators and obstructed the
investigation when he wiped blood from a baseball bat that Pvt. Calvin Glover
used to kill Pfc. Barry Winchell, who had been sleeping.
</P>
<P>
	   During sentencing, Fisher wept as he apologized to his family and to the
relatives of the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barry, I hope you can hear me,'' Fisher started. ``I'm sorry for the part
I played in this. I know you are now in a better place. I hope you know that if
I could go back to the morning it happened, I would have changed it all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under a plea agreement, the Army dropped other charges, including
participating as a principal to premeditated murder and acting as an accessory
after the fact.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher's court martial trial had been scheduled to start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Winchell, 21, was killed while he slept in his cot at Fort Campbell. Rumors
had circulated on the post that the soldier from Kansas City, Mo., was gay, and
prosecutors said Glover was driven by hatred of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
	   Glover, 19, of Sulphur, Okla., was convicted of premeditated murder and
sentenced to life in prison. He never addressed the allegation that he despised
homosexuals. His attorneys argued that Fisher goaded Glover into the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing led to criticism by gay-rights groups and by Winchell's parents
of the Pentagon's policy on homosexuals in the military. Under the policy known
as ``don't ask, don't tell,'' gay members of the military can continue to serve
as long as they keep their sexual orientation to themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew Barry could be deployed and come into harm's way for our country.
We never dreamed that he would be killed by labeling, prejudice and hatred at
home,'' his parents, Pat and Wally Kutteles, said after Glover's conviction last
month. '``Don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue' did not protect our son. It won't
protect anyone else's child. This policy must end.''
</P>
<P>
	   During Glover's court-martial, a sergeant testified that complaints that
Winchell was being harassed by other soldiers who suspected he was gay were not
investigated because superiors felt constrained by the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon has said the Defense Department is working
on new training programs to ensure fair enforcement of the policy.

<HEADLINE> Ed Board meets to discuss interim chancellor candidates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - With pressure from City Hall mounting, the Board of
Education met Saturday to discuss candidates for interim schools chancellor.
<P>
	   Board President William Thompson told reporters Saturday that the board will
vote Sunday to elect an interim chancellor. "One way or another there will be a
vote," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Board President also said the board will be interviewing chancellor
candidate Robert Kiley, former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and current head of the New York City Partnership, before Sunday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appeared strongly opposed to the board's leading
choice, Harold Levy, a banking executive with ties to the Democratic Party.
Board members interviewed Levy and two other candidates Friday, and said they
hoped to choose a temporary replacement for ousted former Chancellor Rudy Crew
by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani administration was pressuring board members to back off their
support for Levy, a lawyer for Citicorp and a member of the state Board of
Regents.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's supporters on the board had appeared to be pushing for Joseph
Viteritti, a New York University research professor who has served as a policy
adviser to the mayor. But the cable news channel New York 1 reported Saturday
that Viteritti withdrew his name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   City Hall may try to propose a compromise candidate. Robert Kiley was
considered a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson said he is in directing the process of electing a new chancellor
and that "the mayor is not running the process."
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, board members interviewed Levy, Viteritti and John Jay Iselin,
who has been president of Channel 13 and Cooper Union for the Advancement of
Science and Art.
</P>
<P>
	   The board reconvened Saturday afternoon to assess the merits of each
candidate. The board has said it's seeking a leader with strong management
skills.
</P>
<P>
	   Members voted to buy out the remainder of Crew's contract. The board will
choose a new chancellor after finding an interim replacement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes outlined a
political agenda to the Christian Coalition of Georgia on Saturday that he said
would renew faith and redeem the moral principles of the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   The key lies in life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, in that order, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes made several references to abortion, telling about 300 supporters at
Mount Vernon Baptist Church his first act as president would be to sign a law
banning a form of late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Life begins at conception and should end only in natural death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, the self-financed conservative said: ``When I'm in the
oval office, if a judge is appointed for life, they must respect the sanctity of
life.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Forbes' plan to reduce taxes that drew the loudest applause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything you do is taxed,'' he said. ``It's high time we say push that
line back and keep what you created in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under his 17 percent flat-tax proposal, a family of four would pay no taxes
on the first $36,000 of income. Forbes' platform also includes measures that
would allow parents to decide where to send their children to school, fund
schools through bloc grants and move away from Social Security to individual
retirement accounts.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign accused Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani of evading fund-raising limits by using three separate
political committees to support his expected Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, cited a New York Times
report Saturday that said Giuliani had raised and spent almost $1 million since
March 1998 through two committees that operate under looser restrictions than
his official campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the money given to the committees came from a group of loyal donors
who have also given the $2,000 legal limit to Giuliani's official Senate
campaign committee, the Times said, citing disclosure records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mayor has established a political network of multiple fund-raising
committees and taxpayer resources to finance his Senate campaign, and it must
stop,'' Wolfson told reporters at a news conference in front of City Hall. ``By
law, these committees should have remained separate and apart. But in fact, the
mayor has been operating them as if they were a single political fund-raising
machine, `Rudy Inc.'''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the groups, Solutions America, designed to promote Giuliani's
political philosophy, limits individual donations to $5,000 annually. The other,
Giuliani for New York, operates under state rules that allow donations up to
$45,000. The two committees have taken in and spent nearly $1 million since
March 1998, records said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal rules bar funds raised by such committees from being used for
federal campaigns.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House Republican
Conference, on Saturday invited Al Gore's campaign manager to meet and talk
about GOP efforts to help the urban poor, just days after Watts denounced Donna
Brazile for criticizing black Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the GOP conference, said the invitation to
Brazile wasn't exactly an attempt to ``kiss and make up,'' however.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, she does not know what J.C. and the Republican party are doing
for the African-American community,'' Paulitz said. ``We're reaching out to show
her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brazile got into hot water this past week by saying in an interview that
Republicans such as Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and Watts, R-Okla., would rather have their pictures taken with poor
black children than help feed them.
</P>
<P>
	   Powell responded with an angry letter to the Gore campaign, and Brazile and
Gore separately telephoned the retired general -- although they refused to say
whether either apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said he invited Brazile meet with him to discuss the American
Community Renewal Act, a Republican program that aims to improve the economy and
conditions in cities by offering tax benefits to businesses and home buying
help, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic party has its own urban renewal program, known as ``New
Markets'' initiative, and last year President Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert announced a bipartisan effort to steer investment to the nation's
neediest urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no word on whether any Watts-Brazile meeting will take place.

Troops: Russia Understating Deaths
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Russian soldiers said Saturday that the
military is understating casualties in Chechnya, hushing up the deaths of scores
of men to avoid a public backlash against the increasingly bloody war. In a
series of interviews, Russian soldiers in Chechnya and the adjoining region of
Ingushetia claimed their units had suffered numerous casualties that have not
been reported. It was not possible to obtain overall figures, but soldiers in
some units said more than half the men in their detachments had been killed or
wounded in recent weeks.

Bradley Hits Gore on Agriculture Issue
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley got the last words in today's debate
with Vice-President Al Gore, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central in
the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24. "Al's been hammering me on my
agriculture votes 15 years ago," the former New Jersey senator said. "But I
would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa today, are you better off than you
were seven years ago or do we need a change?" Despite a robust U.S. economy, the
agriculture sector is suffering through its worst downturn in more than a
decade. Net farm income in Iowa is projected at $40.4 billion in 2000, down $7.6
billion from 1999.

	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Mideast peace talks, which recessed for the
Jewish Sabbath and the Muslim feast marking the end of the holy month of
Ramadan, are not expected to start before tomorrow at the earliest, officials
say. The State Department's assessment of the first week of talks basically
indicates that little progress was achieved. During that period, there were only
two face-to-face meetings between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa. And that took President Clinton four trips to

liberty and pursuit of happiness, in that order, he said. Forbes made several
references to abortion, telling about 300 supporters at Mount Vernon Baptist
Church his first act as president would be to sign a law banning a form of
late-term abortion. "Life begins at conception and should end only in natural
death," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Argue Health Care  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare Iowa
voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal on Saturday. The vice
president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but campaigning on
``the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley got the last words, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central
in the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago,'' the former
New Jersey senator said. ``But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a
change?''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade. Net farm income in Iowa is projected
at $40.4 billion in 2000, down $7.6 billion from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's ``better off'' line echoed a theme used by Republican Ronald
Reagan in his winning, 1980 campaign, which Bradley has said he admires for its
concentration on big-issue proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education -- a
familiar array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates -- and
Gore revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer''?'' he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim that he'd been
down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to survive scandal and
impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to President Clinton have
been a time of the greatest economic progress in American history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to start by telling you what we have been doing in that Washington
bunker,'' Gore said, saying the administration has delivered on health reform,
job creation and budget surpluses. The vice president said that as president, he
would deliver on those fronts and more. ``That's not a bunker,'' he said,
``Those are the front lines in the fight for our future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage. Bradley said he
would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate,
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we have here is a scare tactic,'' he said. ''... I reject that kind
of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, with editor Dennis
Ryerson as moderator. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 --
including some the candidates used to demonstrate points.
</P>
<P>
	   On agriculture, Bradley said family farmers have had no real help, ``no
safety net whatsoever,'' from the current administration. The former New Jersey
senator said he wants policy changes to help small farmers. ``You can talk about
the past, but I want to talk about the future,'' Bradley told Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he could understand Bradley's reluctance to talk about the past,
saying his rival had voted against emergency aid to farmers in midwest floods,
and against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa, demanding
that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified commodities. Europe and
Japan resist those products.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy,'' said Gore, who
said ``sound science'' should govern.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get
access to markets,'' said Bradley. ``The problem with agriculture in America is
serious, in Iowa it's dead serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Iowa poll showed the challenge facing Bradley; Gore led him by 21
percentage points in a survey for the Des Moines Register among Democrats who
said they intend to vote in the party caucuses two weeks from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers: Gore 54 percent; Bradley 33 percent. The margin of error was
4.4 percentage points either way.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledged the deficit as he courted potential caucus-goers with a
post-debate lunch of meatballs and pasta. ``Wouldn't it be great to be a part of
something that creates a big surprise?''
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to the debate, Gore stopped his motorcade outside a Titan Tire
Corp., to shake hands with picketing steel workers. ``I want to fight for you as
president,'' he told them. ``I need you to fight for me at the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the debate, Gore appeared with AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard
Trumka before a crowd of 300 cheering union activists along with top officials
of other large unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite occasional differences on trade, Gore has the formal backing of
organized labor, an important tool in organization-based Iowa. ``I'm keenly
aware of the fact that some of you are supporting me despite the fact that we
don't agree on every single issue,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had an eye on labor supporters, too, making of the point by
mentioning twice in the debate that he'd been at a Teamsters' picket line. The
AFL-CIO has endorsed Gore, but the Teamsters have not.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, Bradley appeared on WHO-TV in Des Moines, and said he
disagrees with the government decision to return Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
refugee, to Cuba. ``I thought that the boy should stay in the United States,''
Bradley said. ''... I think the courts should review it. The ideal situation
would be for the boy and his father to be in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father is in Cuba and wants his son back. The controversy over the boy,
whose mother died trying to get to Florida, is a political headache for the
administration. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy
returned, stirring Cuban American demonstrations in Miami and Republican demands
that he stay. Gore says the courts should decide.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Publisher Nackey Loeb Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Nackey S. Loeb, the former publisher of The Union
Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News who during the impeachment scandal ran a
headline calling President Clinton ``a disgrace,'' died Saturday at her home,
the papers said. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb had been in failing health due in part to complications associated
with her partial paralysis from a 1977 car accident.
</P>
<P>
	   She retired in May but still maintained an interest in the affairs of the
Manchester newspapers and consulted on the recent endorsement of Steve Forbes in
next month's Republican New Hampshire Primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union Leader is the largest newspaper in the state and the only
statewide daily, the New Hampshire Sunday News is the largest Sunday paper in
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb and her late husband, William Loeb, bought the newspapers in the
1940s and turned them into two of the nation's most conservative papers. William
Loeb's blunt editorial style and his active involvement in the state's
presidential primaries earned the Union Leader a national reputation that his
wife continued to nurture.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb, born in 1924 to Robert and Margaret Scripps and an heir to the
Scripps Howard publishing fortune, took over as publisher after her husband died
in 1981. During her 18 years at the helm, she pursued a more quiet, but still
forceful approach.
</P>
<P>
	   An editorial signed by Publisher Joseph McQuaid for Sunday's editions said,
``We were lucky to have her because her commitment to maintain an independent
voice caused her to not only hang onto The Union Leader and Sunday News after
William Loeb's death but to invest in their future and to do the hard work of
leading us there.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a visit by Clinton in February, a week after the Senate voted not to
oust him over the Monica Lewinsky scandal, she didn't hesitate to publish a
front-page editorial with the headline: ``Mr. President, you're a disgrace!''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan called her his
``political godmother,'' and credited her endorsement for his 1996 New Hampshire
primary upset of Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front runner in the Republican presidential
race, said that while he and Mrs. Loeb ``did not always agree, her opinions and
influence always helped shape the politics and the independent spirit of the
state of New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``She will always be known as the torch bearer for conservative views,''
said Terrence Williams, publisher of The Telegraph in Nashua. ``She certainly
stayed true to that over the years, and she made quite a name for herself doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb also kept the newspapers in step with the changing needs of their
readers. She made the decision to convert the daily newspaper to a morning
publication and was involved in expanding it onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Details on survivors were not available.

<HEADLINE> SEC Accuses Oil Firms of Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission is accusing
two oil companies and three businesses involved in selling their stock of
deceiving investors in an $8 million oil well scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Petro Resources Corp. of Scottsdale and its president, Samuel McClintock,
and Austral Oil &AMP; Exploration Inc. of Sulphur, La., and its president, Myron
Palermo, are named in the civil suit accusing the group of securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Also named were ITS Consulting Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif.; Integrity
Financial Group of Montreal; and Tritech Investment Group of Laguna Beach,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the complaint, Petro Resources and Austral obtained oil leases
in Oklahoma and Texas and then contracted with ITS Consulting and its president,
Alan B. Baiocchi, to raise money from investors to drill wells.
</P>
<P>
	   Baiocchi and his associates directed the sale of securities "through a
'boiler room' involving unsolicited cold calls and high pressure sales
techniques" and directed similar sales through Integrity and Tritech, the suit
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were promised "fantastic" returns but were not told of the risks
or that most of their money would go to sales commissions, said Don Hoerl,
associate regional director of the SEC office in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal district court in Orange
County, Calif., about $8 million was raised from about 400 investors nationwide
from January 1996 through July 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Palermo denied any wrongdoing and said he used about $750,000 to drill two
new wells and re-enter two previously drilled wells. Only one produced oil.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost a quarter of a million dollars on it, and I can prove that," Palmero
said. "I didn't have anything to do with raising the money. All I did was drill
the wells."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the other companies could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A few investors received a small amount of their investment back, but the
majority lost most of their money, Hoerl said.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of the defendants misrepresented . . . facts to investors or
prospective investors," the suit said. It also said none of the securities,
brokers or dealers was registered with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC wants an injunction to prevent further sales, unspecified civil
fines and the return of money to investors.

<HEADLINE> McCain Defends Regulators' Letters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Saturday he only was trying to
protect consumers and prod regulators to act when he wrote letters on behalf of
large donors and other companies in his capacity as Commerce Committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have acted on one fundamental principle, and that is to try to protect
the consumer,'' the GOP presidential contender said while campaigning in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., said most of the letters he has written to regulators urged
them to act on matters concerning telecommunications and airlines that were
languishing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``An overwhelming majority of these communications are, 'please act, please
act,''' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator wrote federal regulators on behalf of more than a dozen
contributors over the past three years, according to hundreds of documents made
public Saturday by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wrote twice in 1998 to William Kennard, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, with concerns about a lawsuit by broadcast networks
against satellite television distributors.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal district court had issued a preliminary injunction that would mean
the companies could not distribute programing from local stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision would have hurt Echostar Communications Corp., a Littleton,
Col., satellite TV company. The company has donated $18,000 to McCain's
presidential committee, according to campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our concern is that, once deprived of their network programming, consumers
will abandon satellite television service ...'' McCain wrote. He asked the FCC
to look into how many customers would lose network service.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Echostar had visited McCain to voice concerns prior to his
writing the letter, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's motivation in writing was because he believed consumers would
be hurt and that the decision would stymie competition, said Senate Commerce
Committee Republican staff director Mark Buse.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was a life issue at the time, Congress has since passed
legisation allowing satellite services to carry broadcasting by local stations.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain weighed in on behalf of BellSouth, trying to offer long-distance
service; Ameritech, trying to merge with SBC Communications; America West
airlines, trying to offer airline service out of Flagstaff Airport; and other
corporate givers.
</P>
<P>
	   The memos show McCain intervened just as forcefully on behalf of companies
that did not give to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in a July 1999 letter to Kennard, McCain complained about the
delay in transferring a broadcast license for a Texas radio station.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, an outspoken supporter of campaign finance reform, complained he was
being held to a different standard compared with other members of Congress, most
of whom write federal agencies on behalf of constituents and donors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Take a look at what other congressmen and senators do,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said that in keeping most of his letters focused on getting
regulators to act on matter of public interest, he was adhering to a higher
standard than others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What is the standard and am I acting in higher standard? I think so,'' he
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign staff made public over 1,500 pages consisting of letters
to various agencies and responses from 1997 to present. He is also asking
federal agencies to release all correspondence from him dating back to 1983,
when McCain began his career in Washington as a House member.

<HEADLINE> Missiles Found Headed for Libya  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Components of Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical or
biological warheads were illegally smuggled into Britain and seized before their
shipment to Libya, a British customs official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   A Customs and Excise official said crates carrying the missile components
were found at Gatwick Airport, south of London, and were bound for Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
	   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an investigation was
being conducted and that no further details were being immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   According to The Sunday Times newspaper, 32 crates of missile parts were
discovered Nov. 24 in an airport transit shed during a joint investigation by
customs and intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The parts included components of the jet propulsion system for Scuds with a
range of up to 600 miles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paperwork seized along with the crates indicated the shipment originated in
Taiwan and that other crates had already reached Libya, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The news comes just days after Britain sent its first ambassador to Libya in
15 years. Britain pledged to resume full diplomatic relations with Libya in
November after the Libyan government paid unspecified compensation for the 1984
death of a London policewoman, shot by a gunman firing from inside the Libyan
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial flights from Britain resumed after Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan
leader, renounced terrorism and handed over two suspects accused of bombing Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
	   The export of missile technology to Libya remains illegal with a European
Union arms embargo and an international treaty in place.

Bradley Accuses Gore on Health Care
</SUBHEAD>

voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal today. The vice
president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but campaigning on
"the front lines in the fight for our future." Bradley got the last words, and
used them to criticize Gore on an issue central in the farm state that will
register the first Democratic decision of the 2000 presidential campaign, in
party caucuses Jan. 24. "Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years

	   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- In an effort to avoid public backlash against
its military actions in Chechnya, Russia is understating the number of its
soldiers killed in combat, soldiers claimed Saturday. In a series of interviews,
Russian soldiers in Chechnya and the adjoining region of Ingushetia claimed
their units had suffered numerous casualties that have not been reported. It was
not possible to obtain overall figures, but soldiers in some units said more
than half the men in their detachments had been killed or wounded in recent
weeks.

Cuban-Americans Halt Protests

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case,
said today they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the
child to Cuba. "We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil
disobedience campaign," said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement.
About 100 protesters have been arrested since Thursday, and another protest had
been planned Monday to block access to Miami International Airport.

French: Oil Spill Didn't Contaminate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BREST, France (AP) -- French authorities said Saturday that seafood already
on the market showed no signs of contamination from an oil slick floating off
France's northwest coast. Still, federal food agencies introduced a ban on
fishing and oyster harvesting off the worst-hit shorelines. Many local
governments along the Atlantic had already banned such activities for several
days. "So far, the analyses on shellfish and fish at the consumer level have
shown an absence of contamination," a statement from several state food agencies
said.

Critics Announce Best Films of 1999
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Being John Malkovich" and "Topsy-Turvy" were voted the
best films of 1999 by the National Society of Film Critics, the first time in
the organization's 34-year history that there was a tie for the top honor.
"Topsy-Turvy" also won best director honors for Mike Leigh in the voting today.
The movie has garnered the best film and director awards from the New York Film
Critics Circle as well. "Topsy-Turvy" is about a moment late in the careers of
Sir Arthur Sullivan and W.S. Gilbert, pioneers of a singular brand of comic
opera. "Being John Malkovich" is the story of some troubled people who find a
portal into the actor's head.

No. 1 UConn. 74, No. 2 Tennessee 67
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In a game marked by bumping, physical play,
top-ranked Connecticut got a career-high 25 points from sophomore Sue Bird and
beat No. 2 Tennessee 74-67 today. Connecticut (12-0) frustrated Tennessee (11-2)
throughout with its sticky defense and made enough plays at the offensive end to
survive its 27 fouls and 23 turnovers. Svetlana Abrosimova added 14 points and
Shea Ralph scored 13 for Connecticut, which scored the first seven points of the
second half to open a 13-point lead and then continually turned back Tennessee
the rest of the way.

   TINNIE, N.M. (AP) -- A tractor-trailer rig hauling produce slammed into a

<TEXT>
    	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley accused Al Gore of trying to scare
Iowa voters with misrepresentations of his health care proposal on Saturday. The
vice president said he has not been hiding in a Washington bunker but
campaigning on "the front lines in the fight for our future."
<P>
	   Bradley got the last words, and used them to slap Gore on an issue central
in the farm state that will register the first Democratic decision of the 2000
presidential campaign, in party caucuses Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al's been hammering me on my agriculture votes 15 years ago," the former
New Jersey senator said. "But I would simply ask the family farmers of Iowa
today, are you better off than you were seven years ago or do we need a change?"
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a robust U.S. economy, the agriculture sector is suffering through
its worse downturn in more than a decade. Net farm income in Iowa is projected
at $40.4 billion in 2000, down $7.6 billion from 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's "better off" line echoed a theme used by Republican Ronald Reagan
in his winning, 1980 campaign, which Bradley has said he admires for its
concentration on big-issue proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   The contenders argued about health care, farm policy, education - a familiar
array after four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates - and Gore
revived his challenge for even more. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that you have said no, but as they say on that millionaire
television show, is that your final answer"?" he asked. Evidently so, because
Bradley ignored the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had opened the debate with a rebuttal to Bradley's claim that he'd been
down in a Washington bunker in an administration trying to survive scandal and
impeachment. He said his seven years as vice president to President Clinton have
been a time of the greatest economic progress in American history.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to start by telling you what we have been doing in that Washington
bunker," Gore said, saying the administration has delivered on health reform,
job creation and budget surpluses. The vice president said that as president, he
would deliver on those fronts and more. "That's not a bunker," he said, "Those
are the front lines in the fight for our future."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said repeatedly that Bradley's health care proposal would end Medicaid
and leave the needy in Iowa and elsewhere without the coverage. Bradley said he
would replace it with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted Bradley's sharpest retort in a generally placid debate,
</P>
<P>
	   "What we have here is a scare tactic," he said. "... I reject that kind of
politics."
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was sponsored by the Des Moines Register, with editor Dennis
Ryerson as moderator. Televised nationally by CNN and C-Span, it was set in a
suburban public TV station before an invitation-only audience of 300 - including
some the candidates used to demonstrate points.
</P>
<P>
	   On agriculture, Bradley said family farmers have had no real help, "no
safety net whatsoever," from the current administration. The former New Jersey
senator said he wants policy changes to help small farmers. "You can talk about
the past, but I want to talk about the future," Bradley told Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he could understand Bradley's reluctance to talk about the past,
saying his rival had voted against emergency aid to farmers in midwest floods,
and against subsidies for ethanol, a fuel derived from corn.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa, demanding
that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified commodities. Europe and
Japan resist those products.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy," said Gore, who
said "sound science" should govern.
</P>
<P>
	   "The most important thing we can do is use our authority to petition to get
access to markets," said Bradley. "The problem with agriculture in America is
serious, in Iowa it's dead serious."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Iowa poll showed the challenge facing Bradley; Gore led him by 21
percentage points in a survey for the Des Moines Register among Democrats who
said they intend to vote in the party caucuses two weeks from Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers: Gore 54 percent; Bradley 33 percent. The margin of error was
4.4 percentage points either way.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledged the deficit as he courted potential caucus-goers with a
post-debate lunch of meatballs and pasta. "Wouldn't it be great to be a part of
something that creates a big surprise?"
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to the debate, Gore stopped his motorcade outside a Titan Tire
Corp., to shake hands with picketing steel workers. "I want to fight for you as
president," he told them. "I need you to fight for me at the caucuses."
</P>
<P>
	   After the debate, Gore appeared with AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard
Trumka before a crowd of 300 cheering union activists along with top officials
of other large unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite occasional differences on trade, Gore has the formal backing of
organized labor, an important tool in organization-based Iowa. "I'm keenly aware
of the fact that some of you are supporting me despite the fact that we don't
agree on every single issue," said Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had an eye on labor supporters, too, making of the point by
mentioning twice in the debate that he'd been at a Teamsters' picket line. The
AFL-CIO has endorsed Gore, but the Teamsters have not.
</P>
<P>
	   The day before, Bradley appeared on WHO-TV in Des Moines, and said he
disagrees with the government decision to return Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
refugee, to Cuba. "I thought that the boy should stay in the United States,"
Bradley said. "... I think the courts should review it. The ideal situation
would be for the boy and his father to be in the United States."
</P>
<P>
	   The father is in Cuba and wants his son back. The controversy over the boy,
whose mother died trying to get to Florida, is a political headache for the
administration. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the boy
returned, stirring Cuban American demonstrations in Miami and Republican demands
that he stay. Gore says the courts should decide.

Teddy Brenner
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Teddy Brenner, one of boxing's top matchmakers for Madison
Square Garden and then for Top Rank Inc., died Friday of Parkinson's disease. He
was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   While working at Madison Square Garden from 1957 to 1978, Brenner was
instrumental in the development of Joe Frazier. In 1971, he arranged the first
of three heavyweight championship fights between Frazier and Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
	   He also made fights for Roberto Duran, Wilfred Benitez and Alexis Arguello,
turning them into high-profile boxers.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner joined Top Rank in 1980 and arranged the Duran-Davey Moore fight
that sold out the Garden.
Robert Crosby
</P>
<P>
	   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Robert B. Crosby, known as the Boy Governor from North
Platte when he served as Nebraska's chief executive from 1953 to 1955, died
Friday. He was 88 and had suffered from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Crosby, a Republican, was elected to the Legislature in 1941 when he was 29.
Two years later, he was chosen speaker, the youngest state senator up to that
time to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
	   He waived an exemption from the World War II draft that he could have
claimed as a state senator. He volunteered for naval service in 1944.
</P>
<P>
	   While still in the Navy, Crosby was nominated for lieutenant governor, a
move endorsed by the state Republican convention. After his discharge, he won
the 1946 primary and general elections by large margins.
</P>
<P>
	   Crosby was encouraged to run for governor in 1948 and 1950, but did not make
the race until 1952. He was 42 when he became governor and was known as the Boy
Governor.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent decades, he practiced law in Lincoln and was a lobbyist, primarily
on behalf of highway contractors and material suppliers, public power agencies,
and water interests.
Jerome Goldstein
</P>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Jerome Goldstein, who began selling Scott's Liquid Gold
furniture polish from his garage and turned it into a nationally known brand,
died Wednesday. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein developed large-cell lymphoma about seven years ago and was
aggressively fighting the disease until a few weeks ago when his condition
worsened, said his son Mark, who succeeded his father as president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldstein's mother, Ida, acquired the Scott's Liquid Gold business from
door-to-door salesmen in 1951. She bought it for her three boys as something for
them to do, said Mark Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was Jerome Goldstein who began mixing the formula in his mother's
garage and making sales calls with the polish to Colorado mountain towns.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, the company added aerosol air fresheners and in 1991 developed a
line of facial skin-care items containing alpha hydroxy acids.
Nackey Loeb
</P>
<P>
	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Nackey S. Loeb, the former publisher of The Union
Leader and New Hampshire Sunday News who during the impeachment scandal ran a
headline calling President Clinton ``a disgrace,'' died Saturday. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb had been in failing health due in part to complications associated
with her partial paralysis from a 1977 car accident.
</P>
<P>
	   She retired in May but still maintained an interest in the affairs of the
Manchester newspapers and consulted on the recent endorsement of Steve Forbes in
next month's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union Leader is the largest newspaper in the state and the only
statewide daily, and the New Hampshire Sunday News is the largest Sunday paper
in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Loeb and her late husband, William Loeb, bought the newspapers in the
1940s and turned them into two of the nation's most conservative papers. William
Loeb's blunt editorial style and his active involvement in the state's
presidential primaries earned the Union Leader a national reputation that his
wife continued to nurture.
</P>
<P>
	   Details on survivors were not available.
Ronald Patel
</P>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ronald Patel, the Sunday editor of The Philadelphia
Inquirer, died Friday of liver cancer. He was 52.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel was famous around the newsroom for his fiery temper, penchant for
splashy writing and bold headlines, and his dominance of the Sunday paper, which
he revitalized during the paper's circulation wars with the Philadelphia
Bulletin in the 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel's trademark was the ``Sunday strip,'' a news-feature stripped across
the top of the front page that often focused on a person or family as a way of
illustrating a trend.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel, who grew up in Detroit, attended Wayne State University in Detroit
and began his journalism career at the Royal Oak (Mich.) Tribune. He had stints
at Newsday and the Detroit News before arriving in Philadelphia in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He could do everything. He was a good copy editor, a superb designer, and
very fast,'' said Gene Foreman, retired deputy editor at the Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
	   Patel edited the Sunday paper from 1973 to 1986, when he became associate
managing editor for features. He returned to the Sunday paper in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, his mother, a daughter, a stepson, a brother and
a sister.
Arthur Poindexter
</P>
<P>
	   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Retired Col. Arthur Poindexter, a highly
decorated Marine who was held for months as a prisoner during World War II, died
Wednesday of congestive heart failure. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Poindexter was born Feb. 25, 1917, in Madison, Wis. He joined the Marine
Corps at age 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The second lieutenant was assigned to Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean in
1941, where 1,200 civilians were building a Navy air base.
</P>
<P>
	   Wake Island came under siege a day after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. forces battled for 16 days before surrendering on Christmas Day. During
the fight, Poindexter was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in China.
</P>
<P>
	   He was held there in bleak conditions until the end of the war. After being
released, he remained in the Corps until he retired in 1963, after 26 years of
service.
</P>
<P>
	   Poindexter was cited for his gallantry at Wake Island and for meritorious
service in Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving the military, Poindexter earned a master's degree and a
doctorate and taught international relations at California State University,
Long Beach for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
	   He wrote and co-wrote several books and wrote articles published in the
California Social Science Quarterly, American History Illustrated, the Military
Historical Review and Leatherneck Magazine.
Harald Hermann Rossi
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Harald Hermann Rossi, a biophysicist who developed an
innovative use of radiation to track its effects on living things, died Jan. 1
in Upper Nyack. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossi developed what became known as microdosimetry, which measures the
microscopic distributions of energy for different types of radiation. Those
measurements are important factors in radiation therapy and radiation
protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossi designed many instruments now used in radiation measurement, including
the proportional counter, which measures the energy deposited by radiation in
microscopic sites like cells.
Robert McG. Thomas
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert McGill Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times
whose obituaries moved readers to tears and laughter, died from abdominal cancer
Thursday at his family's summer home in Rehoboth Beach, Del. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas began writing obituaries full time in 1995 after serving as a police
reporter, a rewrite man, a society news reporter and a sports writer. He was
credited with using a fresh approach to writing obituaries, finding key details
to illuminate lives that might otherwise have been overlooked or underreported.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the people he chronicled were Johnny Sylvester, who died in 1990, 64
years after he came to fame as a bedridden boy who inspired Babe Ruth; Douglas
``Wrong Way'' Corrigan, who took off from New York for California in 1938, and
landed his small plane in Dublin some 28 hours later; and Edward Lowe, a sawdust
merchant from Cassopolis, Mich., who found a new use for kiln-dried granulated
clay he had been selling as sop for grease spills, a product eventually named
and marketed as Kitty Litter.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Shelbyville, Tenn., Thomas went to Yale University, where he worked
on the student newspaper and flunked out as a result of a decision, he said,
``to major in New York rather than anything academic.''
</P>
<P>
	   After joining the Times as a copyboy in 1959, Thomas spent the next four
decades in a variety of reporting assignments, often prowling police stations
and working the phones in the late hours to produce fast-breaking stories.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife, Joan, two sons, a sister and two grandchildren.
Stefan Savov
</P>
<P>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Stefan Savov, a dissident who rose to become the
speaker of Bulgaria's parliament, died Saturday, the national news agency BTA
said. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   BTA did not give the cause of death, but said he had suffered from a
prolonged illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Savov served as speaker from 1991 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born Jan. 8, 1924, and graduated from law school in Sofia after World
War II. But he was sent to a labor camp when the communists came to power

	   JOHNSTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley and Al Gore argued about health care,
farm policy and education in their debate today -- themes now familiar after
four prior Democratic presidential campaign debates. Gore revived his challenge
to Bradley to hold even more debates. He said they should meet twice a week,
scrap TV ads, and debate next in Iowa on agriculture policy. "I know that you
have said no, but as they say on that millionaire television show, is that your

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A suspected Nazi war criminal on Sunday told an
Australian radio station that he did not participate in mass killings in Latvia
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Never, never, I have done nothing of the kind, I have never participated
in anything like that,'' Konrad Kalejs told Australia's Special Broadcasting

</P>
<P>
	   Latvian-born Kalejs, 86, arrived in Australia on Friday. He fled Britain,
where he had been living, after authorities launched proceedings to deport him
for alleged wartime atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs is accused of belonging to the Arajs Kommando squad responsible for
the death of 30,000 people, mostly Jews, in Latvia during World War II. He has

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Military Denies Coup Rumor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's armed forces said Saturday it had no
intention of seizing power, despite rumors that the military planned a coup to
put an end to the political and economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
	   The military high command issued a statement expressing support for
Ecuador's democratically elected government after a seven-hour meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Radio stations speculated throughout the day that military commanders were
meeting to decide whether to forcibly remove President Jamil Mahuad from office
or join in an alliance with him to shut down Congress, which has blocked many of
his attempted reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The armed forces ``reject any attempt to violate constitutional order,'' the
military statement said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   The show of support came a day after President Clinton phoned the embattled
Mahuad to voice confidence in his ability to resolve the nation's worst economic
crisis since the 1920s. The nation's economy shrank 7 percent and inflation
topped 60 percent last year as Ecuador's currency, the sucre, plummeted.
</P>
<P>
	   Roman Catholic Church leaders on Friday also expressed support for the
government and rejected calls from leftist leaders for Mahuad to step down and
be replaced by a transitional government of church and labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The military called on ``the powers of state, political parties and society
in general to seek solutions to the crisis within the constitutional and
democratic system.''
</P>
<P>
	   Over the last six months, the Harvard-educated Mahuad, a political centrist,
has faced growing calls to resign from political rivals and business and labor
leaders, who accuse him of incompetence in handling Ecuador's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad met all day with his Cabinet, awaiting the results of the military
meeting, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president, who took office in August 1998, has said repeatedly that he
plans to serve out his term, which ends in January 2003.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Protests Suspended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban-American leaders, encouraged by a lawmaker's bid to keep
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the United States while a judge considers his case,
said Saturday they would temporarily halt protests against plans to return the
child to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have called for a cautious, temporary hold of the civil disobedience
campaign,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of Democracy Movement. About 100
protesters have been arrested since Thursday, and another protest had been
planned Monday to block access to Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday evening about 20 supporters gathered outside of the boy's family's
home and chanted ``We want to see Elian!'' and the boy was briefly brought out.
He was expected to attend a Three Kings Day parade Sunday with his Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   In the decision to stop the protests, the organizers cited a ``more positive
course'' in the ongoing custody battle over Elian. That included a subpoena
issued Friday by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., to have the boy testify before a House
committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said last week the boy
should be sent back to Cuba by Jan. 14. President Clinton and Attorney General
Janet Reno have both indicated support for the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a matter that should be decided on the facts and the law and not
in the political arena,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Gerald Ford said Saturday he agrees with President
Clinton's refusal to overturn the order to send Elian back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the best answer is the one that President Clinton has given,''
Ford said.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, chairman of the Committee on Government Reform, said he subpoenaed
Elian to block ``precipitous action'' until Florida courts can address the case.
Committee sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said it is unlikely Elian
will actually be asked to appear.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Elian's father was outraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am the father of Elian and Immigration has said that I am the only one
who can speak for him,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez said. ``Why should it be delayed?
Who is he? He is no one. I am the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, thousands of Cubans packed the grounds at Ciudad Libertad, a
pre-revolutionary military base transformed into a school complex, waving flags
and chanting, ``We will save Elian!''
</P>
<P>
	   Communist officials have called for residents to keep protesting until the
child is reunited with his father on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, which has INS oversight, met with the boy's relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Elian told him in Spanish: ``Help me. I don't want to go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a good family,'' Smith said. ``I saw enough and heard enough to
know he wants to stay in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Elian's relatives gave him information that his father may have
known Elian's mother was bringing him to the United States and supported that
decision -- something Gonzalez has denied.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube after his mother,
stepfather and others drowned attempting to reach the United States. Two other
adults survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the controversy was a petition filed by lawyers Friday asking that
Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, be named his guardian, a position that
would allow him to seek asylum for the boy. Elian's father is now his guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the lawyers nor Elian's relatives would comment before the judge's
ruling, which is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo, accompanied by
one of the family's lawyers, met with Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday
evening to plead the case that the boy should remain in America at least long
enough to have a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Penelas said Reno told them she would respond ``very, very shortly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite calling off the protests, a pre-planned parade of about 40
tractor-trailer cabs with a police escort coursed through the city Saturday.
Sanchez, who said the caravan was to thank supporters, warned that organizers
would resume the protests if the U.S. government attempted to return the Elian
to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Fires Cost California $92 Million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The fires that swept California last summer and
fall cost the state at least $92 million, more than triple the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's emergency reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's top budget writer, Finance Department chief Timothy Gage,
urged the Legislature to approve $62 million as soon as possible to make up the
shortfall, according to internal documents detailing the impact of the fire
season that were reviewed Saturday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   California's 1999 fire season was one of the worst on record, with more than
7,000 wildfires burning at least 275,000 acres. The CDF's air tanker fleet spent
12,100 hours in the sky, 700 hours more than the previous record set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The fires were aggravated by parched conditions and high winds, particularly
in August and October, when firefighters' spending averaged about $1 million
every two days. In those two months alone, President Clinton issued emergency
declarations for nine counties due to fires.
</P>
<P>
	   In Southern California, fire operations normally scaled back during the wet
season in winter and spring were extended into the new year because of the
threat from dry and windy conditions, a move that is costing the state roughly
$1 million a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the costs could be recouped by delaying when firefighters go on
alert and gear up this spring by six weeks, the CDF wrote to Gov. Gray Davis'
budget office. But it added, ``We currently do not have any weather information
indicating this will be possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities estimate the total cost to the state for emergency fire fighting
for the state's fiscal year, July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will reach
$145 million.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators questioning fired nuclear physicist
Wen Ho Lee told him that he'd failed a lie-detector test that he'd actually
fared very well on, The Washington Post reported today. During a long
interrogation, FBI agents pressed Lee to confess passing nuclear weapons secrets
to China. Lee, however, denied that and insisted he was telling the truth and
was never told by his interrogators that polygraph operators had in fact given
him a very high score for honesty. The Post obtained a transcript of the March 7
interrogation, which was recorded by the FBI.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Officers Said Kidnappers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A group of retired Argentine naval officers
have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping children born to political prisoners
during the 1976-83 dictatorship, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Argentine news agency Diarios y Noticias said six officers were arrested
late Friday in the coastal city of Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of Buenos
Aires, while a report in the daily Pagina/12 newspaper said nine former officers
had been detained. The arrests were first made public Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Both reports said the arrests followed a Thursday raid on a naval base in
Mar del Plata, where the military had set up one of several detention centers
during the dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Judge Maria Servini ordered the arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   The former officers are suspected of taking 12 babies from political
prisoners held at the base, the reports said. Several officers are accused of
illegally adopting several of the babies.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal judges in Argentina are investigating whether there was a systematic
plan for the illicit adoption of more than 200 children born to dissidents held
captive during the military's campaign against leftists and political opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's mothers are among at least 9,000 Argentines who vanished
during the ``dirty war.'' Human rights groups say the figure is closer to
30,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was prompted by a report from the Grandmothers of the
Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group that has identified some 60 children born to
dissidents who disappeared during the military regime.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine of the regime's top leaders are being held in the case, including
former Gen. Jorge Videla, the regime's first president, and former navy Chief
Adm. Emilio Massera, both leaders of the military junta that overthrew President
Isabel Peron in 1976 and ruled until 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the senior members of the dictatorship were sentenced to life in
prison in 1985 for human rights abuses. But President Carlos Menem pardoned the
imprisoned leaders, along with all middle- and senior-ranking officers, five
years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The move outraged human rights groups, who have since searched for ways to
bring the former military officials to justice. Charges of child kidnapping are
not covered by the presidential pardon.

<HEADLINE> Buddhist Leader Visits Dalai Lama  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- Still recuperating from an eight-day trek across
the Himalayas to escape Chinese-ruled Tibet, a teen-age Buddhist leader was all
smiles Saturday after a visit with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
	   The 17th Karmapa, wearing a dark brown monk's robe and light orange scarf,
grinned as he walked easily from the gate of the Dalai Lama's house to a yellow
car.
</P>
<P>
	   The teen-ager, who arrived unexpectedly at a hotel in this Indian city on
Wednesday, had been described by sources close to the Dalai Lama's
administration as exhausted and suffering from blistered feet and scratched
hands after his journey. He appeared well during the brief moments journalists
saw him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He left the Dalai Lama's headquarters before dawn on Sunday. His destination
was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   His defection and that of five followers, including his 24-year-old sister,
a Buddhist nun, cheered Tibetan exiles, embarrassed Beijing and surprised the
Indian government. It is the most significant exodus since the Dalai Lama and
tens of thousands of Tibetans departed their homeland after a failed 1959
uprising against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dalai Lama's administration-in-exile made its first public comment about
the defection Saturday. It has been quiet on the subject for fear of reprisals
in Tibet and out of consideration for India, which fought a war with China in
1962 but has recently enjoyed progress in trade relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is 14 years old and he has undertaken a long and difficult journey. He
is not talking properly. He is very tired and very restless,'' said Kalong Tashi
Wangdi, minister for religion and culture in the Dalai Lama's administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, monks lined up to present the teen with mustard-yellow wool
shawls, mushrooms and other gifts while the Dalai Lama's guard service and
Indian state police watched closely.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa, head of the Karma Kagyu religious order, escaped to India by
crossing Nepal on a route followed by most Tibetan refugees, said sources close
to the case who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa eluded his guards at the 800-year-old Tsurphu monastery in
central Tibet by saying he was going on retreat, the sources said. He and a few
followers set out across the mountains on Dec. 28, hiking along rocky paths
lined with thorny bushes.
</P>
<P>
	   Those close to the Dalai Lama's administration said the teen was frustrated
at not being allowed to meet with his teachers. Chinese authorities had
repeatedly denied a visa to his principle teacher, Tai Situ Rinpoche, who has a
monastery near Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
	   The escape could prod the Chinese communist leadership to intensify an
already stern four-year campaign to purge Tibetan monasteries of Dalai Lama
supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Tibetan officials said they would talk with the Karmapa next week to discuss
his plans for the future. The only outsider to have met him is a mid-ranking
official from India's foreign ministry, officials in the Dalai Lama's exile
government said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's Kagyupa sect, known as the ``Black Hats,'' was once Tibet's
most politically powerful but was supplanted by the Gelugpa school of the Dalai
Lamas 350 years ago. Leaders of the Tibetan sects are revered as the
reincarnations of their predecessors.

<HEADLINE> Triplets Born to Grandmother of 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- A 54-year-old mother of eight who has 15 grandchildren
gave birth Saturday to triplets.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcelia Garcia gave birth by Caesarean section to three healthy girls at
about 5 p.m. at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The triplets, who weigh about 4 or 5 pounds each, were born within about
five minutes of each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It went very smoothly. Everything went as planned,'' said Francisco
Garcia, 34, one of Mrs. Garcia's sons.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Arcelia Garcia's eight children arrived in the hospital to be with
their mother.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia plans to return to work as a farmworker as soon as her health
and the babies allow, she said before the births.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved in 1976
to Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, and she has been a U.S.
citizen since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s pregnant with triplets is extremely rare, especially
without the aid of fertility drugs, said Tom Easterling, a maternal and fetal
medicine specialist at the University of Washington Medical Center. Garcia's
pregnancy was natural.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Family Planning Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal spending for contraception and other family
planning services in the United States would rise by $35 million, the largest
increase in two decades, under a proposal Saturday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said the program will promote strong children, healthy
families and make abortion less frequent at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said his 2001 budget proposal will
include $35 million more for such services in the United States. The White House
said the money will not pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   He also reiterated that he will urge Congress this year to lift restrictions
on the family planning money he reluctantly accepted as part of last-minute
negotiations over the 2000 budget adopted last month.
</P>
<P>
	   It is aimed instead at helping to prevent unwanted pregnancies among poor
women, teen-agers and women with reduced access to health care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By making sure women have family planning choices, we are helping to make
abortion more rare,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said money earmarked for international family
planning can be shifted easily to ``abortion-related activities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said that ``by choosing these abortionists and abortion lobbyists as
our overseas representatives for family planning, we send a message that the
U.S. is on the side of the abortionists, not the babies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association commended
Clinton. The group's president, Judith Desarno, said the proposal recognizes
``the vital role that family planning plays in preventing unintended pregnancies
and lessening the need for abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase would bring the total administration proposal for
family planning in the United States to $274 million for next year, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would be shared among 4,600 clinics nationwide and would pay for
what the White House called ``the full range of reproductive health services,''
including keeping contraceptives available and affordable. It also would pay for
teen-age counseling including support for educational programs ``that encourage
young people to postpone sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``These services make a critical difference in people's lives,'' Clinton
said. The White House said the money will help prevent more than one million
unintended pregnancies a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also is seeking $169 million in new money for family planning and
counseling services overseas. That amounts to a 45 percent increase over the
fiscal 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am asking Congress to support these funds, and to provide them without
restrictions that hamper the work of family planning organizations, and even bar
them from discussing or debating reproductive health policies,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of a deal last year to persuade Congress to release $926 million in
back payments to the United Nations, the administration reluctantly accepted
restrictions on $385 million in federal funds for groups that perform abortions,
or lobby for liberalized abortion laws internationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said then he would try to remove the restrictions, which barred U.S.
money to private family planning groups that perform or promote abortions, even
with their own money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When children are born healthy and mothers and families gain control over
their lives, communities are stronger, economic progress is faster and the
future is brighter for everyone,'' the president said.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Indiana 85, Penn St 78  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Kirk Haston scored a career-high 28 points and
outplayed Jarrett Stephens, the Big Ten's top scorer, as No. 10 Indiana beat
Penn State 85-78 Saturday night for its sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Haston, with Larry Richardson, made converted a series of layups to protect
the Hoosiers' narrow lead down the stretch. Haston added 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Guyton had 15 points and Richardson 11 for Indiana (12-1, 2-0 Big Ten),
which shot 57 percent in defeating the Lions for a sixth straight time. Michael
Lewis had eight assists and Jeffrey Newton blocked five shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a brief spurt in the second half, Stephens, the league's top
scorer with 20.2 points per game, never hurt Indiana. Though he grabbed 14
rebounds, he finished with just 14 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Crispin led Penn State (8-5, 0-2) with 24 points and went 11-of-11 from
the line. Titus Ivory added 19, including two 3s with four minutes left to keep
Penn State within 76-70, but they couldn't get closer than five in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana went ahead 48-36 at the start of the second half -- with lots of
help from the Lions, who missed their first four shots and had four turnovers in
the first six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana kept running its usual methodical offense: Guyton drove for a
basket, Haston found a wide-open Newton for a dunk and Newton's 10-footer
rattled in and the Hoosiers had their biggest lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Then Stephens showed up -- briefly. After scoring only seven points in the
first half, Stephens took a pass from Joe Crispin inside for one basket, then
went up strong for a three-point play. Crispin's fall-away 15-footer and
coast-to-coast layup pulled the Lions within five points.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next two minutes, Jon Crispin, Joe's brother, kept it close with
two 3s and a drive past Michael Lewis.
</P>
<P>
	   But Indiana countered time and again with in-the-paint finesse.
</P>
<P>
	   Indiana led by nine early after holding Penn State without a basket for more

Newton inside for a dunk. Newton returned the favor, dishing the ball to Guyton
for two more. A couple of fast-break baskets later, the Hoosiers were up 20-11.

<HEADLINE> No. 9 Kansas 84, Colorado 69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Jeff Boschee scored all 13 of his points in the
second half to spark a comeback that gave No. 9 Kansas an 84-69 victory over
Colorado on Saturday night in the Big 12 opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jayhawks (12-2) overcame an eight-point deficit early in the second
half, outscoring Colorado 18-4 over a six-minute span and then using a 13-0
spurt late in the game to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenny Gregory also had 13 points for Kansas, which beat Colorado the 21st
straight time. Nick Bradford and Eric Chenowith had 11 points each and freshman
Drew Gooden had 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado (9-4) was led by Jamahl Mosley and Kyle Williams, each with 16
points. Nick Mohr added 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas shot only 31 percent in the first half but 59 percent in the second
half to finish at 43 percent. Colorado shot just 27 percent (18-of-67),
including 25 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas, which has won nine straight conference openers, trailed 39-35 at
intermission and was down by eight when Mosley hit two baskets in the first 44
seconds of the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   But Boschee's 3-pointer capped a 7-0 run that cut the deficit to 43-42.
After a rebound layup by Colorado's Richard Fox, Gooden hit a rebound layup of
his own and Boschee another 3-pointer for a 47-45 lead with 15:16 left in the
half. The Jayhawks did not trail again.
</P>
<P>
	   Boschee's short jumper, Chenowith's 12-footer and Nick Collison's bank shot
made it 65-57.
</P>
<P>
	   Boschee, who was 0-for-5 in his scoreless first half, had a 3-pointer and a
fastbreak layup to highlight the Jayhawks' 13 straight points that produced an
82-60 lead with 2:21 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradford's two slams keyed an 8-0 run in the first half, giving Kansas a
four-point lead. The Buffaloes countered with their own 8-0 flurry later in the
half, including two 3-pointers by Mohr, to make it 35-31.

<HEADLINE> Conner Guilty of Illegal Rudder Use  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes won on the
water but lost in the committee room Sunday after having been found guilty of
using an illegal rudder in one of its previous America's Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
	The decision means Stars and Stripes, now in second place in the six-team
semifinals, could have points stripped from its total. That would harm its
chances of being one of the two teams to sail off for the right to face Team New
Zealand for the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne, which leads the standings, beat Le Defi Francais by 1 minute, 16
seconds, the identical time by which Prada beat America True, while Stars and
Stripes had a close encounter with Nippon, winning by only 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	An Australian-built rudder was used on Stars and Stripes in the first race of
the semifinals against Nippon, but was replaced that night and has not been used
since.
</P>
<P>
	The America's Cup arbitration panel ruled Sunday the use of a rudder built in
Australia breached article 19 of the cup protocol, the regulations governing cup
racing.
</P>
<P>
	Those rules require appendages to be built either in the home country -- the
United States for Stars and Stripes -- or the host country, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	Team Dennis Conner had argued the wording of the protocol was loose, and
allowed the challenge to use a rudder built anywhere.
</P>
<P>
	Technically, breaching the protocol also means Stars and Stripes cannot comply
with a requirement that the syndicate challenging for the America's Cup must
sign, declaring it has complied with all the rules for racing.
</P>
<P>
	That means Team Dennis Conner's challenge could be declared invalid, ending
their cup campaign. However, it is widely expected that Conner will be allowed
to stay in the race.

    DENVER (AP) -- Nick Van Exel was 7-of-11 from 3-point range in a 32-point
performance as the Denver Nuggets beat Charlotte for the first time in nine
meetings, 97-92 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Exel, who also had eight assists, was 11-of-20 from the field. Ron

Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   Elden Campbell led Charlotte with 21 points and 14 rebounds, and reserve

Denver on Dec. 3, 1994, have lost five in a row and seven consecutive games on
the road.
</P>
<P>
	   George McCloud's jump shot, two free throws by Mercer,and Van Exel's seventh
3-pointer gave Denver an 89-83 lead. But Brad Miller scored the next five points
to get Charlotte within one at 89-88 with 4:45 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Davis got the Hornets as close as 95-92 with 30 seconds left, but Van
Exel sealed the victory with his 11th field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte took a 76-71 lead into the fourth quarter, but Ron Mercer's jump
shot and LaFrentz's 3-pointer with 7:36 left put the Nuggets ahead 82-81. The
Hornets regained the lead on a basket by Coleman.

<HEADLINE> No. 11 Michigan State 75, Iowa 53  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Morris Peterson scored 20 of his 29 points in the
first half and Mateen Cleaves tied Michigan State's career assist record as the
11th-ranked Spartans whipped Iowa 75-53 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleaves, playing his second game after sitting out 10 weeks following
surgery to his right foot, dished out three assists to tie the mark of 645 set
by Scott Skiles from 1982-86.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleaves also scored three points in 20 minutes off the bench for the
Spartans (11-4, 2-0 Big Ten), whose 20th consecutive conference victory tied
Indiana (1952-53) for the fourth-longest streak in league history. The victory
over Iowa (7-6, 1-1) was Michigan State's sixth straight over the Hawkeyes,
equaling its best run of the series (1977-80).
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson made four 3-pointers in the first 20 minutes as the Spartans
charged to a 37-20 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Oliver scored 21 points and Jacob Jaacks added 16 for Iowa, which fell
victim to a suffocating defense that forced the Hawkeyes into a 5-of-24 shooting
performance, or 20.8 percent, in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The 20 points matched their season low set Dec. 28 against Drake and their
overall point total was the lowest since a 72-58 loss to Stanford in the second
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State scored seven of the first eight points of the second half,
including two straight baskets by Andre Hutson and a 3-pointer by Mike Chappell,
to lead 44-21 with 18:08 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa, which hit just 9-of-21 free throws and shot 39 percent from the field
last Wednesday in a 58-52 victory over Northwestern, again shot horribly. The
Hawkeyes made just 18 of 33 free throws, or 54.5 percent, while shooting 28.1
percent from the field for the game.

<HEADLINE> Triplets Born to Grandmother of 15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- A 54-year-old mother of eight who has 15 grandchildren
gave birth to triplets Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Arcelia Garcia gave birth by Caesarean section to three healthy girls at
Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital. The babies were in the intensive care unit but
were not receiving oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The girls are all in stable condition and doing well,'' said Linda Kraft,
vice president of corporate communications for the hospital. ``The mother is
recovering well and doing well, too.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia was in the 35th week of the 40-week period of a pregnancy, Kraft
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The triplets were born at 4:59 p.m., 5 p.m. and 5:02 p.m., Kraft said. The
first weighed 3 pounds, 7 ounces; the second weighed 5 pounds, 12 1/2 ounces;
the third was 5 pounds, 1 1/2 ounces, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It went very smoothly. Everything went as planned,'' said Francisco
Garcia, 34, one of Mrs. Garcia's sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia plans to return to work as a farmworker as soon as her health
and the babies allow, she said before the births.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved in 1976
to Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, and she has been a U.S.
citizen since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Her eight children went to the hospital to be with her Saturday. But her
husband, Guillermo Garcia, 60 -- also a farmworker -- stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He didn't want to come because he's very emotional ... but he is at home,
he is really happy,'' Francisco Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s pregnant with triplets is extremely rare, especially
without the aid of fertility drugs, said Tom Easterling, a maternal and fetal
medicine specialist at the University of Washington Medical Center. Mrs.
Garcia's pregnancy was natural.

blistered feet and scratched hands after his journey. He appeared well during
