<HEADLINE> UK Government's Economic Approach Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The economic policy of the
British government was challenged again Wednesday as Barratt
Developments, the UK's second biggest private housebuilder, said
that the government was responsible for three major problems
currently facing the housing industry.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, the government's management of the economy, which is
seriously undermining consumer confidence, and secondly, the
government's negative position on home ownership, especially their
lack of support for first-time buyers," the company's chairman,
Frank Eaton, was quoted by a BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, the government has failed to implement a land
availability policy to meet UK housing needs."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, another housebuilder, Redrow, attacked
planning delays, saying there appeared to be "little political
will" at central and government level to address a UK housing
shortage.
</P>
<P>
However, Barratt's announced a 33 percent jump in pre-tax
profits in the six months to June to make a record 93.3 million
pounds (152 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company said market conditions it faced remained favorable
across the UK and in the U.S. where its Southern California
operations also improved their position.
</P>
<P>
"Since the spring, there has been some slowing in the UK
marketplace and overall activity in the Southeast has adjusted to
a more normal and sustainable level," Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
But other UK regions are continuing at a similar level to the
year just ended and the company has no doubt that the underlying
demand for new houses will remain strong, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fans ID Cards to Be Introduced in Hungary Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A compulsory identity card
will be used to control soccer hooliganism in next season,
according to Attila Kovacs, head of the Hungarian Football
Federation (MLSZ) here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The card system would be accompanied by other moves aimed at
increasing security in stadiums and driving hooligans out of the
game, Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
Kovacs said the precise workings of the identity card scheme
had not yet been decided but only fans with the card would be
able to buy tickets or enter stadiums.
</P>
<P>
Hooliganism has been on the rise in Hungary and some of the
worst violence came at the Budapest derby on Saturday between
Ujpest and Ferencvaros.
</P>
<P>
Ferencvaros fans went on the rampage following their team's
2-1 defeat, trashing seating and throwing stones before riot
police intervened with teargas.
</P>
<P>
Fans fought a running battle with police in the streets
surrounding the stadium, smashing cars and shop windows and
hurling road signs at the police.

LONDON -- British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo
Mowlam said Wednesday the Irish Republican Army's arsenal would be
scrapped and progress was being made in implementing the
province's peace deal on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I consider that progress is being made because it's no longer
a question of if decommissioning is going to take place -- it's a
question of when," Mowlam told reporters in Dublin after meeting
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also made clear that she believed the issue would
be solved in the end, just as a peace deal was eventually signed
in April after nearly two years of stop-start talks.
</P>
<P>
"As so often has happened in this process over the months, you
begin to look for momentum and make progress step by step. That is
what's happening," she said. (UK-N.Ireland-Arms)

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Repatriates 16 Foreigners After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen foreigners have
been repatriated following the bombing of U.S. embassy in Tanzania,
local police said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A police officer, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua that some
of the repatriated foreigners are Arabians.
</P>
<P>
"We have pressured them, but... you cannot hold them if you have no
evidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast which took place on August 7 in Dar es Salaam,
the country's capital, killed 11 people including 10 Tanzanians
and one Kenyan and injured more than 70 others.
</P>
<P>
So far, two suspects, including one Tanzanian from Zanzibar, have
been arraigned by a resident magistrate court in Dar es Salaam, facing
charges of murdering 11 people. They will be tried by High Court on
October 5.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the police released on condition three suspects,
including a local businessman, a Tanzanian and an Algerian. The
three people could be detained again if found guilty.

<P>
Earlier, about 30 people were held by the police during the
preliminary investigations of the case, but most of them have been
released after interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The police indicated that other suspects directly involved in the
bombing are still at large outside the country.

ISLAMABAD, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is effectively
playing a reconciliatory role in efforts to remove tension between
Iran and Afghanistan, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National Assembly on Foreign Affairs Abdul Waheed said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Waheed said the meeting
between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami in New York helped to remove misgivings between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Sharif should also pay a visit to Iran, which would
help reduce the tension.
</P>
<P>
Waheed said if the tension between Iran and Afghanistan
escalated it would have disastrous consequences in the region and
in central Asian states as well.
</P>
<P>
He said there were certain elements which were fanning the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Waheed regretted the killing of Iranian diplomats in
Afghanistan. He also said it was satisfying to note that the
Iranian leadership was in realization of the fact that war was not
advantageous to any one.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Turkish Cypriots' Proposal for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
outrightly rejected a proposal from the Turkish Cypriot side for
examining the disputes over property rights in Cyprus which
resulted from the Turkish military intervention in 1974.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement released here Wednesday, Cypriot
government spokesman Christos Stylianides said "there is no
Security Council resolution or decision by the Human Rights Court
which refers to exchange of property, as the Turkish side
proposes."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash proposed Tuesday that an
independent, autonomous commission be set up to identify formulae
and criteria concerning property between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"For a solution to the Cyprus problem there are a number of
elements. One of these is the exchange of property, without this
there can be no agreement," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government believes Denktash's
proposal is part of his efforts to achieve recognition of his
illegal breakaway regime unilaterally declared in northern Cyprus
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
He cited Security Council resolutions and European Court of
Human Rights decision which all call for the refugees' return to
the Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus and enjoyment of their
property.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 Greek Cypriots became refugees after they fled or
were expelled from their towns and villages in the north
following the Turkish invasion. Part of their property was taken
by some 40,000 Turkish Cypriots who fled from south.

MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) was
totally shut down at midnight Wednesday after the breakdown of the
last-ditch reconciliation talks between the management and labor
unions.

During the marathon talks mediated by the Labor Department,
both the management and the Philippine Airlines Employees

<HEADLINE> Debt-ridden Philippine Airlines Closes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The debt-ridden and
strike-crippled Philippine Airlines (PAL) was totally shut down at
midnight Wednesday after 57 years of service, leaving nearly 9,000
employees jobless.
</P>
<P>
The airline, Asia's oldest and the country's largest, closed
shop after the management and labor unions failed to forge an
acceptable arrangement to ensure industrial peace at the troubled
flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute reconciliation talks between the management and
the labor unions broke down as the unions still refused to accept
the management's co-ownership offer to guarantee the company's
industrial peace.
</P>
<P>
During the marathon talks mediated by the labor department,
both the management and the Philippine Airlines Employees
Association (PALEA), the largest trade union in PAL, refused to
give in to each other.
</P>
<P>
PALEA spokesman Avelino Cavili told reporters after the talks
that union leaders still could not accept the management's
co-ownership proposal and the talks reached a deadlock.

members on the ownership-sharing proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the Department of Labor and Employment can not
call any referendum. In that case, we are closed at 12 midnight,"
Estavillo said.
</P>
<P>
Estavillo said the management was unwilling to negotiate
anymore and has already begun paperwork for liquidation of PAL
assets.
</P>
<P>
PAL's management last week decided to close down the company
Wednesday night after PALEA rescinded an earlier agreement and
refused to accept the co-ownership scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the unions would get 20 percent of PAL shares
and three seats in the PAL board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension on their collective bargaining agreements (CBA). Every
employee would receive 60,000 shares worth 300,000 pesos (6,900
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The suspension of CBA was a key requirement for PAL's
rehabilitation plan which has yet to be approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
PAL said earlier that with no fresh capital infusion, it cannot
operate viably in the face of enormous losses amid the harsh
business environment.

LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The UK's troubled drug
development company British Biotech has announced mounting
first-quarter pre-tax losses of 9.2 million pounds (about 15
million U.S. dollars) as it embarks on new leadership, a new
financial plan and more clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
As McCullagh will be replaced by Elliot Goldstein, a senior
executive at SmithKline Beecham, Christopher Hampson, who worked
for chemicals giant ICI from 1956 to 1994, will take over from
John Raisman as chairman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Biotech announced late-stage trials of its
pancreatitis drug Zacutex in a related condition.
</P>
<P>
The company said it had begun a 1,800 patient Phase III study
of the drug's effectiveness on preventing the development of acute
pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to disentangle itself from the controversies of
the past year, McCullagh, who founded the company in 1986, agreed
to stand down this month to end the "uncertainty" created by the
"unfounded" allegations.
</P>
<P>
The company went into trouble with the controversial sacking in
April of its research director Dr. Andy Millar, after his
allegations that Biotech had exaggerated the success of trials for
the anti-cancer drug Marimastat. His claims sparked a collapse of
confidence among investors and a collapse in the firm's share
price.
</P>
<P>
The company said it would seek to build long term value for
shareholders from the company's position as world leader in the
development of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, through the
development of Marimastat.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Two detained staff members of
the Iranian official news agency IRNA were released Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The agency said in a report that its deputy managing director
Mohammad Reza Sadeq and chief editor of social news desk Ali Reza
Khosrawi were released after head of the Foundation for the
Oppressed and Disabled Mohsen Rafiqdoust withdrew his complaint.
</P>
<P>
The two IRNA journalists were detained on Tuesday following
five hours of questioning after Rafiqdoust lodged a complaint
against them in connection with a report on an assassination
attempt on him.
</P>
<P>
IRNA's editors and journalists on Wednesday protested the
detention and called for their "immediate and unconditional
release."
</P>
<P>
On September 13, an unknown gunman opened fire on Rafiqdoust
from a hill overlooking his office at the headquarters of the
foundation, but Rafiqdoust escaped the assassination without any
injury.
</P>
<P>
IRNA's special service reported that the assailant was a
disgruntled war disabled who was not satisfied with the
performance of Rafiqdoust as head of a foundation which is
responsible for taking care of the war disabled.
</P>
<P>
Rafiqdoust lodged a complaint against IRNA about the identity
of his assailant.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within 10 days that some jounalists were
arrested in Iran following the warning of supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei against the tendency of "freedom abuse" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the moderate daily Tous, which was named after an
ancient Iranian city, was banned and some editors of the daily
were detained by the conservative Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
However, the detentions aroused critical reaction from the
Iranian mass media, which believed that the judiciary
misinterpreted Khamenei's remarks.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The right to
development has been universally recognized in the international
community as an inseparable part of the basic human rights,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said Tang, head of the
Chinese delegation to the 53rd General Assembly session. He added
that the declaration has vigorously promoted the advancement and
development of the cause of human rights in the world.
</P>
<P>
The vast numbers of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America
freed themselves from colonial rule, he said, adding that the
South African people rooted out the dark system of apartheid, won
basic political rights and became an equal member in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations for its part passed a series of
international instruments on human rights such as the Declaration
of the Right to Development, further enriching the content of
human right," he said. "The right to development has been
universally recognized in the international community as an
inseparable part of the basic human rights."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, earth-shaking changes have taken place in
China, he said, adding that especially in the past two decades
since the introduction of reform and opening-up, China has
witnessed ever-improved practice of democracy and legal system and
ever-enhanced legal protection of the rights of the people.
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly obvious that the Chinese people now enjoy a
higher degree of freedom and equality than ever before and a much
more colorful and settled life than in the past," Tang said. "The
Chinese government will continue to make unremitting efforts to
advance democracy and strengthen the legal system while developing
the economy so as to better ensure that its people enjoy human
rights to the full."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is active in supporting and
participating in the activities of the United Nations in the field
of human rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along stood for international cooperation in the
field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect
so as to enhance understanding, narrow differences, expand common
ground and strengthen cooperation through dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is ready to engage in dialogue,
exchange and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual

maintain and push the current positive momentum of dialogue and
cooperation so as to promote the furtherance of the world cause of
human rights," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM on Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China had all along
stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons, China stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said that in
the post cold-war period of today, prevention of nuclear
proliferation and endeavor for nuclear disarmament represented a
fervent appeal of the people of all countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that back in 1994, the Chinese government proposed to
the U.N. General Assembly that a comprehensive test ban treaty
should be concluded through negotiations, and furthermore, the
Chinese government had on many occasions called on all the other
nuclear states to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear states and nuclear-free-zones.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said China also proposed to conclude a
convention on no-first-use of nuclear weapons through
negotiations and called for an early negotiation of the Fissile
Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT).
</P>
<P>
Tang said China was active in the negotiations of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and among the first to sign
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Tang reiterated that China would continue to pursue the
policies of unconditional no-first-use of nuclear weapons and
unconditional no use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear states and nuclear-free zones and continue to support
the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to negotiate and conclude
a non-discriminative and verifiable FMCT on the basis of the
agreed mandate.
</P>
<P>
Tang urged countries with the largest nuclear arsenals to
accelerate their nuclear disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope that India and Pakistan would fully
implement the P-5 communique as well as Resolution 1172 of the
Security Council, give up their plans to develop nuclear weapons
and immediately and unconditionally accede to CTBT and the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China has scored
tremendous achievements in its reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese foreign minister, said
here Wednesday at the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly in recent years, thanks to deepened reforms and
strengthened macro-economic regulation, our national economy has
gained a favorable momentum of `high growth and low inflation,'"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Communist Party of China at its 15th
National Congress formulated a blueprint for China's cross-century
development based on the new developments, both domestic and
international, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Tang, head of the Chinese delegation
to the 53rd General Assembly session, to deliver his speech at the
session since he became the Chinese foreign minister early this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We will build on forcefully our political and economic
restructuring and carry forward the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century in an all-round
way," he added.

ATHENS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at public hospitals in
the Greek capital of Athens and Piraeus Wednesday joined their
colleagues in the northern city of Thessaloniki to strike for more
government funding for duty rosters and wage hike.
</P>
<P>
In Thessaloniki, doctors, who began their strike a week ago,
occupied Wednesday morning the offices of the city's Hippocrateion
hospital for three hours, and they plan to occupy the George
Yennimatas hospital and the center for infectious diseases
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The doctors wanted their payment for being on call to be
increased by 60 percent of the daily rostered-on pay as well as
increases for rostered duty pay, a 10 percent increase in starting
wages and bonuses for specialists.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Health Minister Costas Geitonas agreed to increase
spending on duty rosters by 8.0 percent, but such a move failed to
stop doctors from continuing their strike.

<HEADLINE> Oil Producing countries to Continue Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of five
oil producing countries agreed here Wednesday to resume
consultations and cooperation aimed at shoring up oil prices, the
Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a one-day meeting attended by the
oil ministers of Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
and Oman. Among them, Oman is not a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
A statement released after the meeting said the ministers
would continue cooperation among themselves and with other oil
producing countries "to study all options and take the measures
required to improve current prices including further oil
production cuts."
</P>
<P>
It said the oil ministers reviewed the present global oil
market conditions and the efforts made by oil producers to
re-stabilize the markets and raise prices to levels that secure
fair and stable revenues for producers.
</P>
<P>
This matter was discussed "due to its importance for
world economy and the interests of both producers and consumers,"
the ministers said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "noted the continued improvement in abidance to
output cuts by OPEC member states and other oil producing
countries," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival earlier Wednesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan
Zanganeh said that Iran favors further oil output reduction.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh said "everything is possible and negotiable if oil
prices do not rise till next November."
</P>
<P>
Oil prices in the world market plunged sharply in the last few
months to their lowest levels in a decade and fell below the
10-dollar per barrel margin, causing a decline in oil revenues and
forcing oil producing countries to reconsider their further oil
development schemes.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed last June to cut production by 2.6 million
barrels per day and most of them were committed to the oil
reduction.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Recasts, writes through hke092371--Financial Crisis, Labor Dispute Sink Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The debt-ridden Philippine
Airlines (PAL) was totally shut down at midnight Wednesday,
leaving nearly 9,000 employees jobless and sending the government
hurrying to cushion the adverse effects of the closure.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old airline, Asia's oldest and the country's
largest, closed shop after the management and labor unions failed
to forge an acceptable arrangement to ensure industrial peace at
the troubled flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government has started implementing
emergency measures to minimize the economic disruption to be
caused by the closure of PAL whose service has been vital to the
archipelago country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said the government has
received commitments from at least four local airlines to
immediately expand their operations so they can ply the domestic
routes PAL will abandon starting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada told a government television that he
had exhausted all remedies to settle the labor dispute and the
government will accept whatever happens to PAL.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute reconciliation talks between the management and
the labor unions broke down as the unions still refused to accept
the management's co-ownership offer to guarantee the company's
industrial peace.
</P>
<P>
During the marathon talks mediated by the labor department,
both the management and the Philippine Airlines Employees
Association (PALEA), the largest trade union in PAL, refused to
give in to each other.
</P>
<P>
PALEA spokesman Avelino Cavili told reporters after the talks
that union leaders still could not accept the management's
co-ownership proposal and the talks reached a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Senior vice president of PAL Rolando Estavillo said that PALEA
wanted the labor department to hold another referendum among its
members on the ownership-sharing proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the Department of Labor and Employment cannot
call any referendum. In that case, we are closed at 12 midnight,"
Estavillo said.
</P>
<P>
Estavillo said the management was unwilling to negotiate
anymore and has already begun paperwork for liquidation of PAL
assets.
</P>
<P>
PAL's management last week decided to close down the company
Wednesday night after PALEA rescinded an earlier agreement and
refused to accept the co-ownership scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the unions would get 20 percent of PAL shares
and three seats in the PAL board in exchange for a 10-year
suspension on their collective bargaining agreements (CBA). Every
employee would receive 60,000 shares worth 300,000 pesos (6,900
U.S. dollars)
</P>
<P>
The suspension of CBA was a key requirement for PAL's
rehabilitation plan which has yet to be approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
PAL said earlier that with no fresh capital infusion, PAL could
not operate viably in the face of enormous losses amid the harsh
business environment.
</P>
<P>
PAL, which had incurred huge losses over the past 12 years, has
a debt of 2.1 billion dollars. The company's financial situation
worsened following the regional currency crisis last year and a
devastating 22-day pilots' strike this June.
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly ruled out a bailout of the
moribund airline or a takeover of the company.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, Air Philippines and other three smaller
airlines have pledged to upgrade their capacity from 230,000 to
510,000 passengers within the next 25 to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The government is also ready to speed up the entry of other
airlines that will fill in the void left by PAL, particularly the
domestic routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The successful return
of Hong Kong and the upcoming return of Macao will undoubtedly
provide useful inspiration and create favorable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question, a senior Chinese official said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's sacred territory, the
official added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese foreign minister,
was delivering his speech at the 53rd General Assembly session. It
is the first time for Tang, head of the Chinese delegation to the
session, to speak here since he became the Chinese foreign
minister early this year.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, adhere to the basic policy of `peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems,' hold on to President
Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal on developing cross-strait
relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of
the motherland, expand cross-strait exchanges and cooperation in
various fields and resolutely oppose the creation of `independence
of Taiwan,' 'two Chinas' and `one China, one Taiwan' and Taiwan's
attempt to re-enter the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, as a province of China, lacks qualification for the
membership of the United Nations, which groups sovereign states,
and the People's Republic of China is universally recognized as
the solely legitimate representative of the Chinese people as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
"While firmly safeguarding our own sovereignty, we respect the
sovereignty of other countries and vigorously support the efforts
of all countries in the world, and the developing countries in
particular, to defend their state sovereignty," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
had taken a highly responsible attitude following the eruption of
the East Asian financial crisis, China stressed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the
East Asian financial crisis had caused a sharp decline of the
economy in many countries of the region and its negative impact
was still spreading.
</P>
<P>
Tang said this crisis occurred in the overall context of
economic globalization, and its impact was being felt across the
world.
</P>
<P>
Tang said to step up international cooperation and put an early
end to the crisis bore on not only the immediate interests of the
East Asian countries, but also the interests of the international
community as a whole, and especially of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister expressed the hope that those
developed countries with important influence on the region's
economy would shoulder their responsibilities and take active,
resolute and effective measures to make their due contributions to
safeguarding the stability of the financial order and promoting
the recovery and development of the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Tang said proceeding from the overall interests of maintaining
the stability and development of the region, China had made the
decision not to devalue the RMB yuan, for which China had endured
great pressure and paid a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
Tang said despite growing pressure and risk, China's decision
to maintain the stability of RMB would remain unchanged.

BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronics and
electrical engineering group Siemens AG announced Wednesday that
it would set up a special fund of 20 million German marks (12
million U.S. dollars) to provide humanitarian relief to
individuals who were forced to work for the company during World
War II.
</P>
<P>
Siemens said in a statement that the fund would be run by
independent managers and organizations with the payments to be
made quickly.
</P>
<P>
According to Siemens' own account, the company employed about
50,000 people "against their will" in 1944 but the total number
could be even higher.
</P>
<P>
Siemens was the second German company to make payments to
war-time slave laborers after the German carmaker Volkswagen,
which also set up a fund of 20 million marks for the same purpose
about two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A class-action suit against a number of German companies,
including Siemens and Volkswagen, was filed by former slave
laborers last month in the United States to seek compensation.

<HEADLINE> Tang on China's Foreign Policy, World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China's modernization
drive needs a stable international environment of peace and China
will continue to pursue its independent foreign policy of peace,
Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese foreign minister, said here Wednesday at the
53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"This policy is sustained by three pillars: to persist in
independence and keep the initiative, to safeguard world peace,
and to seek common development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"To persist in independence and keep the initiative, we always
put our state sovereignty and national security in the first place
and never develop relations with other countries at the expense of
our own sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In handling international relations, we stick to non-alignment
and do not go in for military blocs and arms race nor engage in
military expansion," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's development will not pose a threat to any other
country, and the so-called "China threat" is entirely unfounded
and fabricated with ulterior motives, he said.
</P>
<P>
On China's role in safeguarding world peace, Tang said, "China
is a staunch force for the maintenance of world peace and regional
stability. It is our consistent view that state-to-state relations
should be handled in a spirit of mutual respect and peaceful
coexistence, transcending the differences in social system and
ideology."
</P>
<P>
Countries should safeguard their own interests and, at the same
time, respect those of others and continuously expand mutually

common interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the existing differences and disputes, it is
necessary to persist in dialogue, not engage in confrontation and
to strive to settle them by peaceful means rather than by
resorting to force or threat of force," he said. "It is essential
to completely reject cold-war mentality, advocate a new security
concept and resolve international and regional security issues
through consensus and participation on an equal footing."
</P>
<P>
"We in China stand for the equality of all countries, big or
small, and accelerated democratization of international
relations," he said. "World affairs should be handled through
consultation by all countries, and no country should impose its
own will on others."

UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government
would, as always, support the Middle East peace process and the
efforts made by the United Nations and the relevant parties to
this end, China said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the Middle East peace process
had been in a stalemate for some time, which had aroused extensive
concern in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Tang said China was of the view that the Arab nations and
Israel should hold negotiations in an earnest and pragmatic manner
so as to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, which
would be not only in the fundamental interests of the Arab and
Israeli people, but also conducive to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope that all the parties concerned in the
Arab-Israeli disputes would take a flexible and pragmatic position
to promote constant progress of the peace negotiations under the
principle of "land for peace" and on the basis of the relevant
U.N. resolutions and the agreements already reached.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said China was following the
developments in the Kosovo region in Yugoslavia with concern, and
it was China's hope that the parties involved would solve the
problem through political dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia should be respected.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the border conflicts between Ethiopia
and Eritrea and the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo were another source of China's concern.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the hope they would be appropriately resolved by
the parties involved through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Over 500,000 Greek Landowners Register Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 500,000 landowners
in Greece had registered their properties under the national land
register program, Greece's Environment, Town Planning and Public
Works Minister Costas Laliotis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the registration rate for areas which are being
catalogued was close to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Greece and neighboring Albania are the only European countries
without a land register which aims to protect public lands from
encroachment as well as provide revenues for the state and create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
To receive a title of ownership to land, applicants should pay
duty of between 10,000 drachmas (about 33 U.S. dollars) and
300,000 drachmas (about 1,000 dollars) in accordance with the
value of the property.
</P>
<P>
The next phase of the project would reportedly involve
properties in 447 local government authorities or 16 percent of
Greece's total urban area, 10 percent of total farm land and 7
percent of other forms of land.

CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Syria has given Lebanese companies a discount of
about 70 percent on the cost of advertizing their products in the
state-controlled Syrian media, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This decision means that Lebanese industrialists, merchants and
heads of tourism, hotel and service companies could advertize in
the Syrian media with less than a third of the cost they had to
pay previously.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese businessmen said the decision gave the expensive
Lebanese products marketing tools to compete with cheaper locally
made Syrian products.
</P>
<P>
In last March, the two countries agreed to abolish customs
duties on locally made products for four years starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Medgulf Strikers, one of the top 10 insurance
companies in Lebanon, has agreed to merge with Arab Universal,
another large firm ultimately by Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's The Daily Star newspaper said that the new company,
valued at 30 million U.S. dollars, would constitute the biggest
insurance group in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have now an estimated 120,000 clients, it
added.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian Minister of Industries Gholamreza Shafei
announced on Wednesday that Iran is now producing pesticide
spraying planes.
</P>
<P>
Iran is among the top 20 countries of the world which are
active in producing these types of planes, he said, but giving no
more information.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran recorded a 2.9 percent growth in its gross
domestic product (GDP) in the past Iranian year (ending on March
20), the official news agency IRNA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) Mohsen Nourbakhsh
announced the figure in a CBI meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the revenue from oil and gas exports showed a 20.5
percent decline in the year compared to the preceding year's
figure, Nourbakhsh said.
</P>
<P>
He put the incomes from oil exports at 15.5 billion
U.S. dollars last Iranian year, showing 19.8 percent decline from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said the share of oil in the government's general incomes
decreased to 41.6 percent in last Iranian year from 57.4 percent in
the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
However, Nourbakhsh said, the speedy growth in tax incomes
compensated the drop in oil incomes.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia should revive its
prerequisites for foreign cooperation if the European Union is
interested in cooperation with Russia, Austrian Finance Minister
Rudolf Edlinger said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Austrian minister Wednesday met with officials
from the Russian government, the Central Bank and the State Duma,
or lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Edlinger told a briefing that the August 17 unilateral actions
of the Russian authorities undermined trust in Russia, so the
restoration of this trust is an important objective.
</P>
<P>
According to him, his meeting with the Russian officials was
focused on the budget, inflation control and forced recovery of
the banking system in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that though Russia has not worked out yet a finalized
anti-crisis program, the West is convinced that "this government
will follow the path for the development of a social market
economy."
</P>
<P>
Edlinger believed that the present Russian government differs
from the previous one in its ability to rely on broad support from
the State Duma. It can count on the approval of tax reforms, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the question whether Russia would get new loans, he said
"the issue of tranches will depend on how market reforms are
carried out."
</P>
<P>
The minister said further aid is a subject for negotiations and
an appropriate budget, tax and social policy is necessary for a
decision.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- It was necessary to
carry out appropriate reform of the United Nations so that it
could better keep abreast of the changing situation and serve its
member states, China said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly, Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said some reform measures and
recommendations proposed by the U.N. secretary-general had been
approved by the General Assembly and were now being put into
practice.
</P>
<P>
Tang said reform of the Security Council had been under intense
discussions and there were still differences among member states,
and China hoped that all parties would adopt a constructive
approach and take an active part in the relevant consultations
with a view to reaching a proper settlement of relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said the reform of the Security
Council bore on the interests of all countries and so required a
democratic style of work and extensive and full consultations, and
all the member states should have equal right to speak on the
question of the reform and their reasonable proposals should be
reflected to the full.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was not a club of rich countries and the
purpose of its reform was not just to meet the concerns of only a
few big countries, said Tang, adding more attention should be
given to the interests and aspirations of the vast numbers of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the reform measures were something of major
significance as they bore on enhancing the role of the Security
Council in maintaining international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The measures should be worked out on the basis of the realities
and in consideration of history, and in order to ensure the
reformed Security Council gain extensive support from the member
states, it was essential to adhere to the principle of consensus,
Tang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Plans Further Cocoa Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has set up a task force
to study production boosting reforms in the cocoa sector, a
report from Accra, capital of Ghana, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The task force of four working groups, installed by Finance
Minister Kwame Peprah, will look at ways of boosting annual
production to around 450,000 tons, the level attained following
independence from Britain in the 1960s, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"It is the task of each (working) group to...suggest
appropriate policy, institutional and investment measures needed
to address and improve Ghana's competitive edge," Peprah said.
</P>
<P>
The task force, chaired by Deputy Finance Minister Victor
Selormey, will deal with production, marketing, processing and
quality, infrastructure and finance, taxation and pricing policy.
</P>
<P>
Ghana started reforming its cocoa sector 10 years ago. Annual
production is between 350,000 and 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"The reforms have often occurred piecemeal at different times
and under different covenants resulting in the implementation of
conflicting policies," Peprah said.
</P>
<P>
Yields per hectare in Ghana are low at 0.2 tons, against 0.3
to 0.5 tons in neighboring Cote d'Iovire, the world's largest
cocoa producer with total production of over one million tons.
</P>
<P>
Production in Ghana is low because farmers lack sufficient
incentives to work their farms and cannot afford inputs, industry
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pesticide shortage were a major factor in the decline of
Ghana's cocoa production during the 1970s and early 1980s, when
production fell below 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's farmers get 56 percent of the FOB (free on board)
price, one of the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The state Cocoa Marketing Board (COCOBOD) has introduced a
credit scheme for farmers to increase pesticide use and plans to
raise the farmgate price to 60 percent of FOB by 2000, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, however, has no intention of liberalizing the sector
completely, unlike Cote d'Ivoire, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has eased state control by allowing private buyers to
take 30 percent of farm purchases. COCOBOD takes the rest and
keeps a monopoly over exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A regional task force
secured several strategic positions in Lesotho by Wednesday
afternoon, but law and order still had to be restored in Maseru,
the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Strategic points secured by Wednesday included Katse Dam and
two military bases, where dissident Lesotho soldiers put up
fierce resistance against peacekeeping soldiers from South Africa
and Botswana, South African Press Association quoted the SANDF
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SANDF said rebel Lesotho soldiers suffered about 20
casualties in skirmishes at the dam on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mopping-up operations continued at Makonyane military base
outside Maseru and the area was being swept for dissidents. Many
weapons, including anti-aircraft guns, were seized at the base.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon soldiers from South Africa and Botswana
also secured the airport at Maseru, but it was not yet in
operation because of staff problems.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to get the airport functioning as soon as
possible," the SANDF said.
</P>
<P>
The radio station in Maseru was being brought back on the air,
and its staff would be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
While the central business district of the capital was safe,
some criminal activity still existed.
</P>
<P>
Retracting earlier reports that nine South Africans were
killed in clashes with rebel Lesotho soldiers, the SANDF said:
"The casuality figure is now confirmed at eight dead and 17
wounded."
</P>
<P>
The task force entered Lesotho in the early hours of Tuesday
under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community
to quell rising unrest over perceived irregularities in the May
23 general elections.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan PMs Open Talks in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of India
and Pakistan met here Wednesday to tackle some of the pressing
issues such as Kashmir and the nuclear race which are affecting
the ties between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued before their luncheon talks in a New
York hotel said Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajipayee and
his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, would discuss all issues
and review developments in South Asia in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
But the most eye-catching are the long-standing dispute over
Kashmir which has recently been intensified and the situation
following the nuclear tests by the two countries in May, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is their second since their nuclear tests induced
international condemnations compounded with demand for their
signing of the nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
They met for the first time during a South Asian Summit in
July. Progress has since been reported in contacts between their
foreign secretaries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans to Increase Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Warned by the Pentagon
leaders about eroding military readiness, U.S. President Bill
Clinton planned to increase the nation's military expenditure by
billions of U.S. dollars by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Defense Secretary William Cohen Tuesday, Clinton
called for immediate relief in the form of a supplemental
appropriation for 1999 to address shortages in spare parts, Navy
recruitment, Army training and other accounts related to the
ability of U.S. forces to conduct operations.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have done much to support readiness, more needs to
be done," Clinton said in the letter, which was disclosed by The
Washington Post and The New York Times Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Post quoted a senior defense official as saying that it was
likely that 1 billion dollars will be added to the 4 billion
dollars already before Congress in the requested increase in the
budget to cover the extended Bosnia mission, Year 2000 computer
fixes and other items.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first major boost in military spending since
Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Congress to balance the federal budget,
fiscal 2000 defense spending is currently scheduled to grow
slightly to 276 billion dollars. The agreement prevents any real
growth in annual defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in Congress say the figure is inadequate on the
heels of a decade of military spending cuts by the world's only
remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials had not worked out the final 2000 budget.
But military officials estimated that the military would need 10
billion dollars to 20 billion dollars annually to shore up
military readiness.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton discussed military readiness and funding
with the nation's top generals and admirals and vowed to ensure
that U.S. armed forces will "dominate the battlefields of the
future."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos said Wednesday afternoon that he looks highly upon his
coming visit to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president said this while meeting with Chinese
Ambassador to Luanda Xiao Sijin at the State House here.
</P>
<P>
President Dos Santos said that he will go to visit China at
the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin as scheduled in
mid-October.
</P>
<P>
The visit is an important event at the crux of the political,
economic and diplomacy development between the two nations, Dos
Santos said, adding that he sincerely hopes his visit will be
successful.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan people and government attach great importance to
the coming visit to the great emerging Asian country, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Dos Santos noted that China has rich experience in
its two decades of reforms with dramatic achievements.
</P>
<P>
Angola especially needs such experience when it is pursuing
peace and starting to reconstruct the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president hopes that during his visit he himself
can see the great change in China and discuss with Chinese
leaders ways to further promote cooperation in diplomacy,
business and trade between the two states.
</P>
<P>
China and Angola established formal relations on January 12,
1983. President Dos Santos paid a visit to China in October 1988
when the two governments signed an agreement on setting up a
mixed committee for cooperation in economy, technology and trade
and another agreement on culture exchange.

<HEADLINE> UK's Tobacco Industry Challenges EU Ad Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest tobacco
companies have begun a legal bid to overturn the European Union's
ban on advertising their products.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law passed last December, cinema and billboard
advertising will be banned after three years and newspaper
advertisements a year after that. All tobacco advertising and
sponsorship of events like Formula One racing will be banned by
the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
British American Tobacco, Gallaher, Imperial and Rothmans say
the European Community has overstretched its legal powers,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
They are arguing that, under the EU's founding treaties, public
health policy is not defined as an area for collective
decision-making between the EU's member states.
</P>
<P>
A separate appeal by the German Government is expected to
follow a similar argument.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco companies launched their action at the High Court
in London on Tuesday and are seeking to have the matter referred
to the European Court.
</P>
<P>
David Swan, chief executive of the Tobacco Manufacturers'
Association, was quoted by local media as saying that "The tobacco
industry, like any other business is entitled to basic legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
"The directive will severely restrict the companies' ability to
tell customers about their products and could even rule out
providing information on tobacco products to adult smokers who
request it," he said. "This is totally unjustified and we will
vigorously challenge the basis on which these restrictions to a
legal product are being introduced."
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 15 European Union member countries voted for the
ban to be introduced. This is the smallest number possible for a
proposal to become law. However, the European Commission says it
is confident it could successfully defend its position.
</P>
<P>
"Our legal advice is that we are on solid ground," Barbara
Nolan, a spokeswoman for the EU's executive body, was quoted as
saying. "We are confident that we can defend any legal challenge
to the directive."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Hopes to Attract More U.S. Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania plans to attract
more American tourists despite the August 7 terrorist attack on
the U.S. embassy here, a Tanzanian tourism official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a successful marketing campaign by the Tanzania
Tourist Board (TTB) in the United States, the number of tourists
from Canada and United States is expected to surpass the targeted
40,000 by the end of this year, said the agency's information
officer, Johnson Manase.
</P>
<P>
Manase said that TTB's publicity campaign prior to the opening
of the American Travel Market Exhibition held in mid-September in
Orlando, U.S., made more Americans know Tanzania's tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Tourism and Natural Resources, Zakia
Meghji, helped to build up the east African country's image by
delivering a televised speech in the United States, said Manase.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition drew nearly 3,000 U.S. travel company owners,
agents and tour operators. Tanzania was represented by 21
companies, most of which are privately owned except the
state-owned TTB.
</P>
<P>
The horrible bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam has
brought people of the two countries even closer, Manase said,
adding that a visit by U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley
last week further cemented the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is high time for Tanzania to make more efforts in
attracting more tourists as Tanzania is endowed with abundant
tourism attractions such as vast wildlife reserves and Mount
Kilimanjaro, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has improved its infrastructures a lot, like the
rehabilitation of the Makuyuni road leading to the world-famous
Ngorongoro Crater. The road was damaged by El Nino-charged
rains.
</P>
<P>
The country has also built more tourist hotels, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The peace prevails in the country is another asset for
tourist business." said the official.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in Tanzania last year reached 359,000 with
10 percent of them from the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Gives Green-Light to Citicorp-Travelers Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve Board
Wednesday approved the mega-merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group
Inc., and the two New York-based companies are renamed as the
Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
The combination could offer consumers one-stop financing
shopping for everything from credit cards and checking to
insurance and investing.
</P>
<P>
The merger which was first announced in April, was passed by a
5-1 vote at a closed meeting of the Fed.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department also gave its green light for the deal
today.
</P>
<P>
"We conducted a thorough investigation. We have closed that
investigation, and we have allowed the transaction to go through,"
said Justice spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
Citicorp is the parent company of Citibank, the world's largest
issuer of credit cards with some 60 million in circulation.
Travelers is an insurance, brokerage and investment banking giant
with operating companies bearing household names such as Solomon
Smith Barney, Primerica Financial Services and Travelers Life &AMP;
Annuity.
</P>
<P>
The merged company would continue to use Travelers trademark
red umbrella as part of its logo.
</P>
<P>
With more than 100 million customers worldwide and assets of
more than 751 billion U.S. dollars, Citigroup would be the largest
financial services firm in the United States, able to cross-market
an unusually broad range of financial services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
The recent wave of corporate mergers has swept not only the
financial sector, but included telecommunications corporations,
auto manufacturers and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
The Citicorp-Travelers deal was billed as the largest
combination of companies ever when it was announced last Spring,
at a value of 70 billion dollars.

WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Up to 100,000 people were
ordered to begin evacuating the exposed Florida Keys island chain
Wednesday before Hurricane Georges lands, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
South Florida was put under a hurricane watch as the storm
moved across open water between Haiti and eastern Cuba, telling
local residents hurricane-force wind of at least 118 kph could
reach the area by late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Georges was barely a hurricane Wednesday with sustained wind
around the center of only 120 kph, making it a Category one storm.
Strengthening was possible and could trigger precautionary
mainland evacuations as early as Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Governor Lawton Chiles declared a state of emergency in central
and southern Florida, allowing the state to use the National
Guard, lift tolls along evacuation routes and purchase emergency
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Elderly residents dependent on electric medical equipment
already had been flown to Sebring in central Florida. And 200
nursing home patients were sent to a Key West immigration center
that would serve as a shelter during the storm.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Remain Firm on Hope for Rates Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Leading European shares
remained firm on Wednesday as investors took heart from
speculation that U.S. interest rates would be cut at next week's
Federal Reserve policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished the day 111.4 points higher at
5214.7, just below its interaday peak of 5219.5 hit just before
close.
</P>
<P>
Key support came from the Dow Jones, which was up 85 points on
growing speculation that the Federal Reserve would ease its key
interest rate at next Tuesday's six-weekly policy deliberations.
</P>
<P>
A leading member of central bank hinted on Tuesday that
monetary policy would be eased and investors were eagerly awaiting
Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Senate banking
committee for clues.
</P>
<P>
The hope is that any Fed move will be rapidly followed by one
from the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The market has rebounded solidly from Monday's finish below
5000 and volume also improved to around 860m shares by close. But
dealers warned of a lack of sustained upward momentum during
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
They said underlying conditions remained volatile, particularly
amid concerns about the stability of financial markets in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares hit session highs as Wall Street
pushed ahead. Encouraging corporate news and a stronger dollar
also helped the market. The Xetra Dax finished 173.73 points
higher at 4722.96.
</P>
<P>
"A recovery like this isn't unusual after strong retreats,"
said an equities analyst at a bank in Berlin. Traders said most of
the gains were due to short position covering and to the effect of
institutional investors buying up stocks at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks got a new lease of life as New York
shares bounced back on interest rate speculation. The Cac 40
closed 75.8 points higher at 3423.78.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Dow's performance helped the market recover
from a mid-session retreat. They said selling in French municipal
services companies Vivendi and Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux over profit
concerns were the main reasons for the retreat. Otherwise, the
market was very calm.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Awards Mandela Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela received the Congressional Gold Medal
Wednesday, becoming the first African awarded the United States'
highest honor.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 80, is the 100th recipient of the congressional medal,
which was first awarded to Washington in 1776 and since bestowed
on the likes of Lincoln, Winston Churchill and Mother Ther.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony on the Capital Hill, Mandela, who had led South
Africa's long struggle against apartheid, said he felt "like the
heavyweight boxing champion of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Though we are long past the blaming of our past for our
problems, it does need to be acknowledged that the imbalance and
inequities bequeathed to us by the history of Africa and South
Africa are beyond our capacity to meet on our own," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They call for a partnership of Africa and the United States,
developing and developed countries bringing about a transfer of
resources," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton followed a long lineup of
lawmakers, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who beseeched
Americans to follow Mandela's example of humility, sacrifice and
kindness in the face of enmity.
</P>
<P>
"No medal, no award, no fortune, nothing we could give him
could possibly compare to the gifts he has given to us and to the
world," Clinton said before presenting the round gold medal
nestled in a green velvet case.
</P>
<P>
"The only gift that is true recompense is to continue his
mission and to live by the power of his profound and wonderful
example," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela grinned and repeatedly gestured for the assembly of
cheering dignitaries to quiet their standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
The Congress approved the legislation awarding the medal in
July, citing that Mandela has "dedicated his entire life to the
abolition of apartheid... and sacrificed his own personal freedom
for the good of everyone."
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the ceremony, Mandela praised
Clinton's efforts to improve race relations in the United States
and bring in blacks, minority groups and the disabled into
government institutions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Signals to Act Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that Fed policy-makers
understood the need to act quickly to contain a worsening global
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks during his testify before the Senate Budget
Committee, showed the prospects of an immediate cut in U.S. rates
and spurred a big rally on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that there was a need to "bring the existing
instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly to
prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating some
very significant further difficulties for all of us."
</P>
<P>
Economists said Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that
the central bank will cut interest rates when policy-makers meet
on September 29.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief noted that his colleagues at the Fed were aware
of the seriousness of the global financial crisis, which began 14
months ago in Asia, has now spread to Russia and is posing a
threat to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"I think we know where we have to go," Greenspan said. "We
don't underestimate the problem."
</P>
<P>
One analyst took Greenspan's comments as a signal to expect an
interest rate drop.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments sparked a huge surge on Wall Street with
the Dow Jones industrial average rising more than 200 points in
late afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that because of the global turmoil, policy
makers around the world have to be "especially sensitive to the
deepening signs of global distress" which he said had entered a
"more virulent phase" with the collapse last month of the Russian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that labor markets in the U.S. economy remain
tight and hourly compensation is continuing to grow more rapidly.
But he said there is no evidence that inflation is getting out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that "looking forward, the restraining
effects of recent developments on the U.S. economy are likely to
intensify."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, repeating remarks he made in September, said the
increasing risks to the U.S. economy had prompted the Fed in
August to change its policy directive from one leaning toward
increasing interest rates to fight inflation to a neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the U.S. law-makers today, "Deteriorating
foreign economies and their spillover to domestic markets have
increased the possibility that the slowdown in growth of the
American economy will be more than sufficient to hold inflation in
check."
</P>
<P>
However, Greenspan sent markets in the opposite direction last
week when in an appearance before the House Banking Committee, he
deflated expectations of coordinated interest rate cuts among the
world's seven largest economies.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Trader With 10 Kg Cocaine Arrested in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian customs has
arrested a 34-year-old Nigerian trader at the Kotoka
International Airport as he attempted to smuggle into the country
10 kilograms of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The Pan African News Agency (PANA) Wednesday quoted Baffour Dwumo,
Acting Head of the Customs Preventive Unit at the airport, as
saying that a preliminary test of the substance the man carried
confirmed that it was cocaine.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the biggest hauls recently seized at the
airport, the official said, stressing that they are always alert
when airlines arrive from the Far East.
</P>
<P>
The intercepted cocaine is worth of 400 million Cedis (about
170,000 U.S. Dollars), PANA said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian trader, identified as Olley Najeen Animashaun but
with a Sierra Leonean passport, Monday arrived from Thailand on
an Ethiopian Airline flight.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested at the second customs check point when he
tried to bribe officials with 550 U.S. Dollars to allow his
passage, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was concealed in false compartments of some bowls
alongside other items including T-shirts, ladies sandals and
children's wear.
</P>
<P>
Animashaun claimed that he was not aware of the contents of
the bowls which were given to him by a Nigerian friend, Akeem
Manoma, in Thailand to Convey to his wife in Accra.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had requested financial assistance from Akeem
to enable him to buy a return ticket to Nigeria after using his
money to buy some items to sell in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Animashaun said Akeem agreed to finance him on condition that
he sent the bowls to his wife whom he was to meet at the airport
in Accra.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he attempted to bribe the officer if he claimed he
had no knowledge of the contents of the bowls, the trader said
that he did so because the customs officer demanded it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GDP Growth Slows Down Sharply in Second-quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
slowed down sharply in the second quarter of this year, putting an
end to a two-year stretch of robust growth, according to a report
released by the Commerce Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a 1.8 percent annual
rate in the second quarter, after shooting up at a 5.5 percent
rate during the first three months of the year, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The revised growth was a bit better than the 1.6 percent rate
estimated a month ago and the initial 1.4 percent estimate of two
months ago. Still, it indicated that the U.S. economy has entered
a new phase of moderate growing following nearly a 4 percent
growth rate through 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The long expansion has reduced the nation's unemployment rate
to near a 28-year low and the recent slowdown hasn't yet greatly
restricted demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that
first-time claims for unemployment fell by 8,000 to a seasonally
adjusted 292,000 last week, the lowest level in five months.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, after-tax corporate profits managed a
weak rebound. They rose 0.6 percent from the quarter before to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Still, that followed back-to-back drops of 1.6 percent in the
first quarter and 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.
Despite the increase in the second-quarter, profits still were 1.2
percent lower than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall slowdown in the second quarter, growth
remained strong in many areas. Consumer spending grew at a 6.1
percent annual rate and housing construction at a 15 percent
rate. Businesses increased investment in new equipment, including
computers at an 18.8 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Government spending rose at a 3.7 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the gross domestic product
accumulating at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.44 trillion
dollars, in current dollars, during the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails U.N. Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday welcomed the
United Nations Security Council resolution on the issue of Kosovo,
Yugoslavia, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a news release that "there is no
reasonable alternative to a peaceful settlement in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution adopted Wednesday calls for a negotiated
settlement of the conflict between official Serb forces and ethnic
Albanians in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
While calling for Kosovo to stay within the Yugoslav
federation, it demands extensive autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry said the U.N. resolution introduced no new
sanctions against Yugoslavia, and gave no green light for the use
of force demanded by some members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Use of force..., especially if it bypasses the U.N. Security
Council, is fraught with dangerous destabilization in the Balkan
region and the whole of Europe," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as permanent member of the Security Council, is still
able to keep developments under control, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana's statement that NATO was ready to start limited air force
operations in Kosovo, Chairman Gennady Seleznyov of the Russian
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said: "If this
happens, Russia will make a strong protest."
</P>
<P>
He said no one has the right to launch air strikes at Kosovo
unless authorized by the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> NATO Agrees to Prepare for Kosovo Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- NATO issued on Thursday an
activation warning for a limited air strike and a phased air
campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The warning allows NATO to enter into a state of increased
level of military preparedness and to identify the assets required
for the planned military actions, said NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana in issuing the warning.
</P>
<P>
Solana said: "The use of force will require further decision
by the North Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
"But the decision is an important political signal of NATO's
readiness to use force if it becomes necessary to do so."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed strong support of the U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been studying various options of the use of force in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo ever since NATO foreign ministers
met in late April.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has carried out an air-borne
drill in Albania in mid-June to demonstrate its capability of
rapid deployment into the region.
</P>
<P>
But NATO stopped short of resorting to force in Kosovo after
Russia warned to veto a U.N. resolution that would give NATO the
mandate to intervene in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been reviewing the situation in Kosovo on a weekly
basis and a U.S. envoy to Kosovo last week briefed NATO diplomats
on the refugee situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 250,000 refugees are now residing in makeshift
shelters in the forests and mountains in Kosovo as winter is
approaching.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Household Income Increases, Poverty Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. household income
rose and poverty rates fell in 1997 for the third year running,
the Census Bureau said while releasing its annual income and
poverty report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 13.3 percent of Americans lived in poverty, down from
13.7 percent in 1996, a decline led by blacks and Hispanics,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor blacks dropped by 600,000 to 9.1 million,
although more than one in four blacks still live in poverty. For
Hispanics, the poverty rate dropped to 27.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Poverty also declined in big cities, from 19.6 percent in 1996
to 18.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eleven percent of white Americans live in poverty. The gap
between the wealthiest and poorest Americans remained the same
between 1996 and 1997. The difference between men's and women's
earnings also kept the same. Women continued to earn 74 cents for
every dollar for men.
</P>
<P>
The median household income for all Americans in 1997 rose 1.9
percent to 37,005 U.S. dollars, not statistically different from
the peak in 1989, before the nation fell into recession.
</P>
<P>
Twelve states saw real median income levels rise while four saw
drops.
</P>
<P>
States seeing rises, using two-year averages, were Alabama,
Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Caroline,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Income
fell in Hawaii, Iowa, Maine and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Alaska had the highest median household income at 50,829
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate dropped in three states, Alabama, Mississippi
and South Carolina but increased in Arkansas and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 35.6 million people lived in poverty. Last year, a
family of four was considered poor if its annual income was 16,400
dollars or less. For a family of three, the poverty threshold was
12,802 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bierhoff to Remain Germany Captain: Ribbeck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- AC Milan striker Oliver
Bierhoff will remain Germany's captain, says new coach Erich
Ribbeck in a newspaper interview released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff was appointed by Berti Vogts before Vogts resigned
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Oliver Bierhoff will stay our captain, he's good at it,"
Ribbeck told daily Bild in an interview released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck will announce on Monday his squad for two European
championship qualifiers away to Turkey and Moldova next month. He
has said he would rely heavily on Bayern Munich players and
recall Lothar Matthaeus.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Bayern libero will take over the number 10
shirt left vacant by Stefan Effenberg, Ribbeck told Bild.
</P>
<P>
Effenberg said on Sunday he was quitting the national team,
just weeks after he ended a four-year absence from the game.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus played with the number 10 on his back in his prime
as Germany's playmaker. He still wears it at Bayern. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Primakov Defines Pressing Tasks of Russian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The new Russian government is
getting down to business to solve the country's key problems,
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said at a cabinet meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov defined his cabinet's most pressing tasks as reviving
the banking system, balancing the budget, and laying a foundation
for paying wages, pensions and allowances on timely basis.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the Interfax news agency, he pledged that
workers and retirees will get their wages and pensions on time
from October on, and begin to get their overdued salaries.
</P>
<P>
The government will also give Russian citizens monthly
subsidies from early 1999 on to ease their suffering from ruble's
devaluation and inflation, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As the administrative measures were "insufficient" to balance
the federal budget, economic measures such as increasing taxes are
likely to be taken, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also indicated that his cabinet will work to reduce the
tax burden on manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Primakov criticized the financial decisions by the Kiriyenko
cabiet on August 17, saying those rashly made decisions had
plunged Russian financial and industrial sectors into chaos.
</P>
<P>
The decisions were not authorized by President Boris Yeltsin,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government: Confederation Not in Line With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Thursday that a proposal put forward by
Turkish Cypriots for a confederation of two states in Cyprus is
not in line with U.N. resolutions and international law.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting in New York on recent statements by Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash's proposal promotes the unity of Cyprus and is in line
with U.N. resolutions on Cyprus, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if Mr. Cem has his own way of interpreting things
or (he) does not know how to read very well known words used in
international law which are common sense," Stylianides said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Denktash's proposal "is contrary to
U.N. resolutions, which is why all permanent members of the
Security Council rejected it."
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the proposal last month, which he claimed as
"the only structure" to safeguard the security, identity and
well-being of Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions on Cyprus call for the establishment of a
bicommunal, bizonal federation with a single international
personality and citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that if the Turkish foreign minister believes
the proposal is in line with U.N. resolutions, he is completely
"irrational," because the resolutions stipulate for Cyprus'
independence, unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Denktash's proposal refers to two protectorates (of Greece
and Turkey) and leads to the division of Cyprus," the spokesman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to help reunify Cyprus
under the bizonal, bicommunal federation formula, but no tangible
results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Hampden Park Soccer Pitch to be on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The soccer pitch at Hampden
Park in Scotland, one of the most famous pieces of soccer real
estate, will be on sale on Sunday for a giveaway price.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Football Association is selling off the pitch
which has carried the stud marks of world soccer's top names,
from Pele to Maradona.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Thursday, fans will be allowed
to cut up a slice of history and take home a square yard (meter)
of turf for just one pound (1.68 U.S. dollars) in a rebuilding
program at the stadium which was once the biggest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The new Hampden Park is slowly taking shape as a 60,000-seat
arena but that will accommodate fewer than half the number of
supporters who were once able to crowd into the stadium.
</P>
<P>
It held the world record attendance of 149,547 for a match
between Scotland and England in 1937, until Rio de Janeiro's
Maracana Stadium overtook it.
</P>
<P>
The following Saturday a British club record was set when
146,433 people watched the Scottish Cup Final between Celtic and
Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
Hampden also gathered in the largest crowd in European club
competition, with more than 134,000 watching Celtic defeat Leeds
United there in the 1970 European Cup semifinals, a record which
is unlikely to be broken.
</P>
<P>
The ground earned its place in football folklore as the venue
of what is widely regarded as the greatest match ever --Real
Madrid's stunning 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960
European Cup Final in which Ferenc Puskas scored four goals and
Alfredo Di Stefano three.
</P>
<P>
It was the place where Franz Beckenbauer captained Bayern
Munich to their third successive European Cup Final triumph -- a
1-0 win over St Etienne in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Hampden also witnessed the emergence on the world stage of a
teenager named Diego Maradona, who in 1979 scored his first goal
for Argentina there.
</P>
<P>
Hampden has acted as the home ground for Scotland's national
team for more than 90 years and the side will return there next
season after an exile of three years for the 40 million pounds
(67.21 million U.S. dollars) revamp, which includes a football
museum and offices for the new Scottish Premier League.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam: Foreign Interference Poses Great Threat to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese defense ministry
said Thursday that foreign interference in the country's internal
affairs constitutes a great threat to its national security.
</P>
<P>
To defend security, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the
ministry said, Vietnam has the right to build military strength
and an army with better weapons, equipment and technologies.
</P>
<P>
While making public Vietnam's defense goals, policies and tasks
in its first white paper released Thursday, the ministry did not
provide details as to the size and budget of the military.
</P>
<P>
"The plots to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs in the
disguise of 'human rights' or 'democracy,' the intrusion into this
country by means of culture and ideology, activities of subversion
and destabilization for the purpose of replacing the current
political and social system, are all great menaces to Vietnam's
security and national defense," it said.
</P>
<P>
As the political situation is stabilized and national defense
maintained after over 10 years of renovation, it said, maintaining
sovereignty, national security and territorial integrity would
still be the "first and most important task."
</P>
<P>
The ministry repeated the Vietnamese government's position that
it would not align with one country against another, nor seek
confrontation and take offensive actions against any other country.
</P>
<P>
The country now needs to create an international environment
favorable to its cause of national construction, economic
development and raising the people's living standards, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu briefed Jospin and the French delegation on the current
economic situation in China.
</P>
<P>
He said China has faced two major challenges since the current
government was seated in March this year -- the financial crisis
engulfing Asia, and the severe summer flooding. But China's
reforms and opening-up process was not affected, nor was
realization of this year's economic goal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on the worldwide financial
situation and voiced agreement over the need for global
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jospin praised China's refusal to devalue the Renminbi and
devotion to maintaining the stability of international currencies.
</P>
<P>
He praised Chinese soldiers and citizens for their dauntless
heroism in battling summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also expressed appreciation for China's continuing to
carry out reform and opening. He noted his deep impression of
great changes which have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the French government values friendship and bilateral
ties, and highly values China's position and role in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
France is fully prepared to join China in building a
comprehensive partnership geared to the 21st century, said Jospin,
adding that continuing bilateral exchanges fully display the
French government's willingness to consolidate the significant
relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Jospin attended a ceremony in which representatives
from the two governments signed a finance protocol, program of
action for developing advanced information technology, an agreement
on the protection of intellectual property rights, and a
cooperative agreement between China's Science and Technology
Ministry and the Electricity de France.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia in Efforts to Move into Information Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday urged his countrymen to adjust and take
advantage of the phenomenal development in information technology
in the country's efforts to move into the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a meeting of the National Information Technology
Council (NITC) here, Mahathir said: "The sudden upsurge of
information and communication technologies is changing the way in
which business is done and industry behaves. We have to adjust and
take advantage of this phenomenal development."
</P>
<P>
In a report presented at the meeting, he said Malaysians will
have to adjust and take advantage of the phenomenal development in
information technology as the country's industrialization strategy
alone is not going to help it achieve a fully-developed nation
status by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the businesses' very success hinges on their
ability to get into shape for the global game of electronic
business.
</P>
<P>
In its effort to move Malaysia into the Information Age, the
NITC has a critical role to play in managing the country's
transformation to a knowledge-rich society, Mahathir said, urging
the NITC to keep in mind the need to preserve and strengthen the
intrinsic Asian values.
</P>
<P>
The key issues to be considered by the NITC over the next few
years are the role of the government and the private and voluntary
sectors, the need to ensure universal access to information, the
development of technological competence and ways to facilitate
electronic commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, he said, one of the most important tasks
is to make sure that the benefits of network computing are made
available to every Malaysian, and to schools, hospitals, clinics
and voluntary organizations as well as businesses.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has made the first important move towards the
Information Age by creating a Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC),
where a fully networked federal government administrative center
-- Putrajaya, will be completed in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Fans Braced for Graham Depart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar
and Leeds counterpart Peter Ridsdale will meet before Saturday's
clash between the sides in a bid to thrash out a deal for George
Graham to switch clubs.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Thursday, Ridsdale does not want
to lose Graham, who has taken the club into the top six in the FA
Premier League and back into Europe.
</P>
<P>
Graham insists he will still be manager of Leeds when they
take on Spurs - but he continues to stonewall questions surro
unding a possible move down south.
</P>
<P>
And it looks likely the former Arsenal boss, who still has a
home in Hampstead, north London, will be in the manager's chair
at White Hart Lane next week.
</P>
<P>
Spurs' director of football David Pleat has admitted the Lon
doners are "in dialogue" with Leeds - and Sugar and Ridsdale are
expected to discuss a two million pounds compensation package
which would avoid lengthy legal action.
</P>
<P>
After leading Tottenham to a 3-2 victory over Brentford on
Wednesday night, Pleat said he had sat in on a board meeting
during which directors discussed "the toilets, the pies, match
programs and, yes, the manager".
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale said: "If Alan Sugar came to me and said `we will
give you x amount of pounds to talk to George Graham' then I wou
ld put that to the board.
</P>
<P>
"This would be considered and, if necessary, the situation
would be presented to George Graham for his opinion. But this is
purely hypothetical at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Ridsdale told the Yorkshire Post that Sugar had behaved like a
"perfect gentleman" and he said he was looking forward to having
lunch with him on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese offcial Wu Yi
has called on customs departments to educate staffers
of the need to curb internal corruption in order to ensure the
success of the ongoing anti-smuggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
State councillor Wu issued the call during a national
conference on combating corruption amongst custom officers. The
conference was held in Beijing on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.
</P>
<P>
Participants discussed a case of the customs department under
the Futian Bonded Zone Customs Office in east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged customs departments to fully implement the ongoing
anti-smuggling drive launched by the central leadership in order
to effectively reduce smuggling.
</P>
<P>
She said the campaign has greatly improved domestic markets of
petroleum products, edible oils, chemical fertilizers and chemical
fibers.
</P>
<P>
Wu thanked customs departments for their contribution to the
battle against smuggling, but pointed out that problems still
exist in some departments with unscrupulous staffers who abuse their
official power for personal gain from smugglers.
</P>
<P>
The customs sector should improve internal management, said Wu,
adding that individuals abetting smuggling must severely be
punished.
</P>
<P>
Customs departments should adopt democratic practice in order
to eradicate corrupt behavior, said Wu.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Junior Partner Warns Against Grand Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The small Free Democratic Party
(FDP) in German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition Thursday
warned its big partners against allying with the main opposition
party -- the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
With national election three days away, FDP leader Wolfgang
Gerhardt told reporters in Bonn any possible grand coalition with
the SPD would only benefit the latter.
</P>
<P>
Germany is governed by a coalition of three parties --
the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Christian Social Union
(CSU) and the FDP. The coalition ruled the former West Germany
from October 1982 through unification.
</P>
<P>
Gerhardt's warning came after Kohl said Wednesday for the first
time that it was possible in theory for the country's two largest
political parties, his CDU and the SPD to form a grand coalition
government after the election.
</P>
<P>
Although Kohl said he was still against such an idea and would
not take part in such a coalition, his younger allies in the CDU
are less unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
The SPD was currently in a "strategic quandary" because of
voters' concern about their possible alliance with the ecologist
Greens party, Gerhardt said, adding that Kohl's CDU should not
help the SPD out of the dilemma by discussing a grand coalition.
</P>
<P>
The grand coalition option is at the center of political
considerations now in Bonn because many polling institutes predict
that as the election race tends to be a extremely tight one at its
final stage, it is likely that neither the CDU nor the SPD would
be able to muster a majority in parliament even in alliance with
their respective partners, the FDP and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's challenger, the SPD chancellor candidate Gerhard
Schroeder has never ruled out the possibility of such a grand
coalition. Analysts believe that it is a strategy of Schroeder to
reassure middle-of-the-road voters alarmed by the Greens' radical
demands such as a call to triple the gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
The biggest victims of a grand coalition between the CDU and
SPD would be the FDP, which has been in every German government for
nearly 30 years, as well as the Greens, who are hoping to come to
power in Bonn for the first time as the junior partner in a
so-call "Red-Green Coalition" with the SPD.

<HEADLINE> Burtenshaw Fined after 'Bungs' Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Arsenal chief scout
Steve Burtenshaw was fined by the Football Association on
Thursday for accepting an illegal payment as part of a transfer
deal.
</P>
<P>
Burtenshaw, now chief scout at First Division Queen's Park Ran
gers, was fined 7,500 pounds and ordered to pay 2,500 pounds
costs after admitting misconduct at a hearing last week.
</P>
<P>
He received 35,000 pounds from football agent Rune Hauge
following Danish midfielder John Jensen's move from Brondby to
Arsenal six years ago.
</P>
<P>
But his solicitors claim the fine is "unduly severe" and they
are considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
An FA statement said: "The payment was a contravention of FA
rules and was a clear conflict of interest with his club.
</P>
<P>
"It was accepted by the commission that the payment was not
solicited by Burtenshaw. However, the payment of back-handers to
management, with or without their knowledge, is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Burtenshaw told the hearing he had made a careless error of
judgment and was deeply sorry.
</P>
<P>
And his solicitors, Burton Copeland, said the FA statement did
not reflect the agreed facts that Burtenshaw had at no time
expected to receive any payment for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Their statement said: "Mr. Burtenshaw volunteered the
information both to Arsenal when the inquiries were first made
and to the relevant authorities which led to the bringing of the
proceedings. He has co-operated fully with the all the various
inquiries over the years."
</P>
<P>
Former Arsenal manager George Graham, now in charge at Leeds, s
erved a one-year ban from the game as part of the so-called
'bungs' (unauthorized payment) inquiry.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry by the FA into the transfers of Dane Jensen and
Norwegian Pal Lydersen to Arsenal found Graham guilty of
accepting 425,000 pounds in illegal payments.

<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's four largest
commercial banks are actively assisting the efforts of
flood-ravaged provinces to restore normal life and industrial
production.
</P>
<P>
The banks -- Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China (BOC) and China
Construction Bank (CCB) -- are the country's only four state-owned
commercial banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
ICBC has granted 2.2 billion yuan in loans for various projects
in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has dispatched a high-ranking fact-finding team, led by
the BOC President Wang Xuebing, to Hunan and Hubei provinces,
areas suffering the greatest devastation during summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has pledged to loan 7.65 billion yuan for restoration
projects in the two provinces, and will provide additional funds
for infrastructure construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The ABC, on the other hand, has focused helping homeless
villagers rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Hubei Branch of the CCB has granted loans of over 700
million yuan to local flood victims. The CCB's Beijing
headquarters is currently considering a plan to allow branches in
other flood-ravaged provinces to grant additional loans totalling
700 million yuan.

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian Arab Investment Bank earned 1 million dinars
(1.4 million U.S. dollars) in profits during the first 6 months of

<HEADLINE> FA Cup Final Replays Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The replay rule of English FA
Cup came to an end since this season.
</P>
<P>
This season's final at Wembley will be the first to be decided
on penalties -- the first time in the competition's 127-year
history, if the match fails to produce a winner after 90 minutes
plus extra time.
</P>
<P>
The move brings the FA Cup final into line with all other
major football tournaments, including major European competitions
and the World Cup final.
</P>
<P>
There have been 14 replays needed in the previous 117 finals,
the most recent five years ago when Arsenal beat Sheffield
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said on Thursday: "It has become
clear over recent years that fans going to Wembley would prefer
to have a decision, for better or worse, on the day. There is
also the issue of fixture congestion."
</P>
<P>
The European Champions League final takes place just four days
after this season's FA Cup final on May 22, and it is possible
that Arsenal or Manchester United could be involved in both.
</P>
<P>
Football Supporters Association chairman Graham Bean applauded
the change, saying that "common sense" had prevailed.
</P>
<P>
He added: "There is some tradition in having a cup replay but
in this day and age you have to look at the cost of traveling
down to Wembley and paying for tickets.
</P>
<P>
"We all want our clubs to do well in Europe, irrespective of
which club we support, and anything to help them has to be
welcomed."

<HEADLINE> X Newcastle Manager Dalglish Blasts' Attack Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Newcastle manager
Kenny Dalglish hit out Thursday at claims that he was attacked by
fans after traveling to Rotherham to watch his son play for the
Magpies' reserves
</P>
<P>
Dalglish senior was at Millmoor on Tuesday night to see son
Paul score his side's second goal in a 4-0 Pontin's League win.
</P>
<P>
But he vehemently denied press reports that first he and then
his car were attacked by United supporters as he left the ground
after the game.
</P>
<P>
"Media reports suggesting I was attacked at Rotherham by
Newcastle or any other fans are false," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Having gone to watch my son play and having left the ground
without any problems, I am shocked and angry about the reports."
</P>
<P>
"The situation demands that the media informs its readers of
the truth and apologizes to Newcastle, Rotherham and both clubs'
fans as well as to my family."
</P>
<P>
Dalglish parted company with Newcastle United on August 27
after 19 months in charge at St James's Park and is currently
fighting a compensation battle with his former employers.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Hong
Kong and Guangdong province reached consensus on six items of
cooperation between the two sides at the second meeting of the
Hong Kong/Guangdong Cooperation Joint Conference held here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations are led by Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Vice
Governor Wang Qishan of the Guangdong Provincial Government
respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides reached agreement on linking
up the information networks between HK and Guangdong; improving
the management of land crossings; cooperation between the two
sides in boosting tourism; furthering cross-boundary cooperation
on environmental protection; improving the business environment

</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to set up an exclusive electronic network
between HKSAR Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government.
Both governments can browse information and exchange electronic
mails on the exclusive network.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong/Guangdong expert group on information technology
has been set up by the two sides to coordinate the project and
monitor the progress. This group will further study and draw up
plans for cooperation over information technology.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to implement two measures to improve the
management of land crossings and to ease the growing
cross-boundary traffic flow -- extending the opening hours of the
existing four land crossings and allowing goods vehicles to freely
select the crossing points for entry and exit by phases.
</P>
<P>
An expert group has been set up to study ways to further
enhance cooperation between the two sides in promoting tourism.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The two sides acknowledged that the two governments attached
importance to environmental protection and expressed their
determination to enhance cooperation in this area.

the Deep Bay, Mirs Bay and Pearl River Delta Region.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to examine ways to better the business
environment for Hong Kong businessmen with investment in
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to examine ways to promote technological
cooperation. A brainstorming group is expected to be set up to
explore areas for long-term items of cooperation for discussion by
the Joint Conference.
</P>

The conference unanimously came to the view that under the
principle of "One Country, Two Systems" and mutual benefit, the
two sides can, on the basis of the present cooperation, seek a
broader and higher level of cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A rare dialogue among
partists from Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macao was launched
with the opening of an arts exhibition at the Hong Kong University
of Science and Technology here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Lingnan School of Chinese painting has exerted a great
influence on the development of arts in these four cities. Yet,
while sharing the same artistic heritage, artists from these
neighboring cities have seldom sought dialogue with each other,"
said Wong Shu Kit, one of the curators of the exchange program.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a free exchange of ideas will inspire exciting
new development in the Lingnan region," he added. Lingnan is a
geographical term denoting the South China area.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the month-long exchange program is an
exhibition of paintings and installation art by 12 artists from
the cities, with diverse background including traditional Chinese
painting, sculpture and contemporary installation arts. The theme
of the exhibition is "Four Sides."
</P>
<P>
In addition, a series of art talks, seminars and open forums
will be organized each Saturday through October to coincide with
the exhibition.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Any Form of International Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China opposes any form of
international terrorism, the use of terrorist acts for political
purposes and violent acts carried out by any state, organization
or individual in violation of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
this afternoon in a statement outlining China's stance on
international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China also steadfastly opposes interference in
the internal affairs of any country, infringements of national
sovereignty and invasions of any nation under the pretext of
opposing terrorism. Zhu labeled such activities as "violations of
international law."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has consistently advocated the
enhancement of state-to-state cooperation and has at the same time
adopted effective counterterrorism measures, said Zhu, adding that
"all countries should fulfill their international obligations."
</P>
<P>
The international community should extend the greatest possible
efforts to trace the source and social factors contributing to
international terrorism in order to "gradually reduce and
eventually uproot the scourge of terrorism," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Counterterrorism cooperation should be based on the principles
of mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and
noninterference in the internal affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China has extended great effort to combat
international terrorism and has signed many related international
agreements. He added that China has joined Interpol and
participated in negotiations the UN Special Counterterrorism
Commission has conducted concerning terrorist bombings and nuclear
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
China has also formulated relevant domestic laws designed to
provide legal guarantees for preventing and combating terrorism,
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is fully prepared to join other nations in
the battle to eventually eliminate terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Leader Rejects Broad-Based Government Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Taliban leader Mulla Umar
has said Afghans have never accepted any government forcibly
imposed on them from abroad during the course of history.
</P>
<P>
Umar made the remarks in the Afghan city of Kandahar in
response to a six plus two meeting (six neighboring countries of
Afghanistan plus the U.S. and Russia) in New York, according to a
report reaching here Thursday from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The six plus two meeting has decided to send a mission to the
region to assess the possibilities of the formation of a
broad-based government in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Umar was quoted as saying that Afghanistan has its own
religion, culture and social traditions and has the right to form
its own government.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taliban have checked the killing and lawlessness
in Afghanistan but even then are not being recognized by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Umar said that the United Nations does not recognize them but
expects pursuance of international norms and laws from them.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting in New York was aimed at defusing
tension between Iran and the Taliban. But Umar said that he wants
reply to the points he has raised.
</P>
<P>
If these points are not taken into consideration, they would be
left with no other option but to render sacrifice and fight for
their rights, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Creeps Higher in Quiet Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
a little ground Thursday in lackluster trading as investors
focused on other markets.
</P>
<P>
The local currency climbed back above the 58.00 U.S. cents mark
in late overnight offshore trade and held onto the key level on
the day.
</P>
<P>
It finished the local session at 58.15 from 57.70 late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the domestic unit had a quiet day
and traded between 58.05 and 58.30.
</P>
<P>
In offshore trading overnight the local currency suffered at
the hands of a stronger U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
IBJ Australia senior foreign exchange trader Darrin Stewart
said the Australian dollar did not shadow movements in the
Japanese yen, as had been the pattern of late.
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought that maybe the Aussie would have been a
little more closely linked to the yen, but today it hasn't
really."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen lost ground against the U.S. dollar, which
closed at 136.58 yen up from 136.15 previously. The U.S. dollar
was also at 1.6833 German marks from 1.6818.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 79.43 yen, from 78.75, and 0.9786
German marks, from 0.9708.

<P>
CHANGSHA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Over six million people in
central China's Hunan Province are now fighting a severe drought
which hit the province's central and southern areas in June.
</P>
<P>
While record floods devastated parts of Hunan Province in July
and August, drought was plaguing six of its prefectures and cities,
affecting some 0.7 million hectares of farm land, and affecting the
drinking-water supply of 1.25 million people.
</P>
<P>
"We call on people to combat the drought with the same spirit
demonstrated in the anti-flood campaign a month ago," a provincial
official said.
</P>
<P>
At present, tens of thousands of government officials of
severely affected Chenzhou and Shaoyang have been mobilized to the
anti-drought front line.
</P>
<P>
Solving the drinking-water problem has been given priority, and
local people are busy drilling wells and water channels.
</P>
<P>
Provincial calls for concerted efforts since the drought began
are expected to continue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Report Says Population Under Control (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to control
population growth have proven successful, with a population that
is 200 million less than what it could have been had nothing been
done, according to the State Statistical Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
A SSB report says that population changes have helped improve
the national strength and people's living standard and provide a
favorable environment for the opening and reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
In the 30 years between the founding of China and the late
1980s, China's birth rate remained at above 30 per thousand and it
was not until the 1980s that it fell to around 20 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The large population and high growth rate had been a heavy
burden and have seriously hampered economic and social development
and had a negative effect on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, the fast economic and social development has
helped change people's ideas about children, and the population
growth rate has fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, China had 1.236 billion people, with a
birth rate of 16.57 per thousand and a natural growth rate of
10.06 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The family planning has, to some degree, eased the pressure on
clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, medicine,
resources, environment, and in other areas.

<HEADLINE> New Towns to Be Reconstructed for Flood Victims  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's post-flood
reconstruction would not be mere duplication, but will be carried
out with scientific and rational planning, according to Chen
Weibang, general planner of China's Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that a large number of small towns with adequate
transportation, water and drainage facilities are planned for the
flood victims.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council has said the towns should be built while
considering the harnessing of rivers and using of land to prevent
any future floods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that this year's floods caused economic
losses of 160 billion yuan (about 20 billion U.S. dollars) and
destroyed nearly five million houses.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that in spite of these great losses, the
reconstruction drive will provide a golden chance for township
construction in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Suspends Bank Branch Applications Processing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines is suspending for three months the processing of bank
branch applications following a review of the existing bank
branching policies and guidelines, Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the measure took effect Thursday following the
approval of the Monetary Board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, Singson said, is currently reviewing the bank
branching policies and guidelines for rural banks, thrift banks
and commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the review is to avoid over-branching and help
encourage mergers, consolidations and buy-ins especially for banks
with many branches, he said.
</P>
<P>
The review is also aimed at curbing the practice of some small
banks in opening up several branches and then folding up later on,
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Since the liberalization of bank branching several years ago,
there has been an "explosion" of new branches in the Philippines.
Four small banks have already shut down in the country since the
outbreak of the currency crisis last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has been encouraging banks to merger in order
to survive the prolonged financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> New Towns to Be Constructed for Flood Victims (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Development Planning Commission official Liu Fuyuan
said the Chinese economy is facing a surplus of rural laborers and
overproduction in the cities. To solve the problems, the most
efficient method is to speed up township construction and upgrade
living standards for the 900 million Chinese rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale township construction in the flooded areas was
undertaken in some part of east China's Anhui Province in 1991,
when floods destroyed three million houses.
</P>
<P>
For the post-flood reconstruction, the Anhui provincial
government reorganized the scattered population into small towns,
and within three months, 500,000 flood victims were
resettled. This reconstruction project was cited for an award by
the United Nations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The restruction plan estimates that at least 50-
million-square-meters of housing will be built, bringing a
market demand of 25 billion yuan (about 3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Shulian, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that upgrading rural areas will expand domestic
demand, especially in the rural market.
</P>
<P>
So far, reconstruction plans for Hubei, Heilongjiang and other
flood-stricken provinces have already been drafted. Some places,
such as the city of Daqing in Heilongjiang Province, have already
begun reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Floodwaters Uncover Mammoth Fossils In Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Some mammoth fossils from the
Neolithic Age were recently discovered in the suburbs of the city
of Qiqihar in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province in a deep
groove that was worn down by floodwaters of the Nenjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Li Liankui, a farmer who found the fossils, explained that last
month he happened to see a long white object sticking out of the
gully when he was looking after his cattles on nearby grassland.
</P>
<P>
The fossils are three meters long and were identified as a
fossilized mammoth trunk. Archaeologists from the Gannan Culture
and Relics Administration say they believe that the mammoth was 9
meters long and 6 meters tall and weighed 6 to 7 tons.
</P>
<P>
Farmers also found 10 other fossils of mammoths and a
rhinoceros that included rib, leg and shoulder blade bones.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say the fossils show that a large number of
animals lived in the western part of what is now Heilongjiang from
12,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth is a relative of the modern elephant that lived in
cold regions.

<P>
From 1952 to 1978, China's GDP grew 4.7-fold, but per capita
GDP rose only 180 percent, but in the past two decades the GDP
increased 4.4 times and per capita GDP 3.7 times.
</P>
<P>
Average per-capita grain yields also increased from 319 kg in
1978 to 398 kg in 1997, and improvements in the standard of living
have meant health condition changes, with the death rate down to
6.5 per thousand, and the average life expectancy up to 70.83,
three years more than in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Family planning has also helped education. In the early 1980s,
22.8 percent of the people were illiterate or semi-literate, but
by 1997 the figure was down to 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
From 1982 to 1997, the number of people with a higher education
rose from six per thousand to 25, and the number of people with
senior and junior middle school educations was also up by a big
margin.
</P>
<P>
In 1982 the number of ethnic minorities was 67.3 million, or
5.93 percent of the total population, while in 1995 it rose to
108.46 million, 8.98 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Every year, China adds some 20 million people for a net growth
of some 11 million, and further efforts should be made to ease the
pressure on social and economic development caused by the huge
population.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Stress Development Aid at UN General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will stress the
issues of overseas development aid and south-south cooperation at
the ongoing 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly, a Foreign
Ministry official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Foreign Secretary Shyam Anand Suman told a press
conference that Nepal will focus on the overseas development aid
provided by the developed countries to the least developed and
land-locked countries like Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He said the developed countries should contribute 0.07 percent
of their gross domestic product (GDP) as aid to the least
developed countries and 0.15 percent of their GDP to the
land-locked countries.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will also stress south-south cooperation at the U.N.
General Assembly, he said, adding that during the 12th Summit of
the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) early this month in South Africa,
Vietnam, Brazil and Malaysia had proposed specific programs in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
At the NAM summit, Nepal also focused on overseas development
aid and south-south cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We will also raise the issues of debt relief, peace,
development and disarmament including small arms disarmament,"
Suman said.
</P>
<P>
Environment protection and human rights will also be Nepal's
concerns at the U.N. General Assembly, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said his country supports the proposal of limited expansion
of permanent and non-permanent membership of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
And Nepal lays emphasis on U.N. reform and restructuring which
includes the reduction of its budget and staff, but it should not
affect the land-locked countries and the least developed
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Water Resources Shailaja
Acharya is scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly on behalf
of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
But she has canceled an agreed ensuing official visit to Canada
and four members of parliament have been dropped from the
delegation because of domestic political developments, Suman told
the press. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and other minor opposition parties
Wednesday registered a motion at the Parliament Secretariat
against Speaker of Lower House Ram Chandra Poudel.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the role played by the speaker in passing the
Local Autonomy Bill last week in the house was against the
parliamentary democratic system.
</P>
<P>
When the opposition MPs were voicing their protest against the
bill, Speaker Poudel, who is from the ruling Nepali Congress,
conducted voice voting on the bill and declared that it had been
passed by the house.
</P>
<P>
It takes one week for the motion to be mature before the house
can discuss it, and a two-third majority is needed in the house to
force its speaker out of power.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Nepali Congress and its ruling partner the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) registered a
similar motion against Deputy Speaker Lila Shrestha Subba who is
from the CPN-UML.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Reiterates Cross-Straits Political Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive vice
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), today reiterated China's stance on a mainland
visit by Lee Teng-hui, the current leader of Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, President Jiang Zemin said that leaders of
Taiwan authorities were welcome to visit the mainland in a proper
capacity and noted the possibility of a reciprocal visit to
Taiwan, according to the ARATS leader. Tang made the comments in
response to a question concerning Lee's pledge to undertake a
so-called "journey of peace" to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a Lee visit to the mainland is of course a
matter of politics, and stressed that any such visit should be
preceded by political talks between ARATS and the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that ARATS-SEF meetings over the years have fully
demonstrated the difficulty in negotiating practical issues in the
absence of political talks. He stressed that negotiations on
practical issues often involve judicial jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Political disparity constitutes the key issue in the
cross-Straits question, said Tang, adding that the reasonable way to
settle the question in accordance with the development of the
cross-Straits relations to hold political talks between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that ARATS and SEF will be able to find
common ground for political talks through mutual exchanges,
and noted that all topics which will be helpful for achieving
peaceful reunification and the development of cross-Straits
relations are open to discussion.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Keep Troops at Afghan Border: Iranian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran will keep its troops
at its eastern border with Afghanistan, "as long as it feels
insecure," Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi Akhundazdeh said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference, "Our troops would
remain there to safeguard our national integrity against growing
cross-border drug trafficking, but their posture will remain
defensive."
</P>
<P>
He said some 400 Iranian security troops, including a senior
commander, have been killed in clashes with drug traffickers at
the Iran-Afghan border over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Iran's heavy troop deployment at its eastern border was aimed
at deterring drug trafficking activities, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iran's military exercises along its border with
Afghanistan, Akhundazdeh said these maneuvers were an annual
feature to mark anniversary of Iraq's invasion against Iran after
the success of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the state of Pak-Iran relations in the
backdrop of recent developments in Afghanistan, he said he felt
saddened that events in Afghanistan and consequent developments
had a spill over on the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed the hope that "with the sincere and
genuine efforts by the leaders of both sides this spill over can
be contained."
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the recent meeting of Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and Iranian President Sayed Muhammad Khatami
in New York and called for follow-up efforts in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Akhundzadeh urged Pakistan, which recognized Taliban, to
influence the Taliban administration to return the bodies of
remaining slain Iranian diplomats and release more than 40 Iranian
drivers taken prisoner by its forces.
</P>
<P>
He called for a dialogue between the warring factions in
Afghanistan to settle the lingering crisis. "Uzbeks, Tajiks,
Hazaras and Pushtuns (in Afghanistan) should sit together and
settle their differences," he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about U.S. policy towards Afghanistan,
the Iranian diplomat said, "As far as Iran is concerned, it was
meant to create problems for us."
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of conflicting economic
interests of different countries in the region which led to
instability in Afghanistan. "It is always outside interference in
our region which causes disturbance," he said without elaborating.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Buhe, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
today that law-enforcement inspections of the Agriculture Law over
the past five years have increased Chinese farmers' awareness of
the need to protect their rights and interests in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The inspections have provided a basis for changing the
fundamental status of agriculture as part of the nation's economy
and preserving the sanctity of law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee's Agriculture Law inspection teams
for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Yunnan, Jiangsu and
Guangdong provinces held a second meeting today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Buhe told them that the law-enforcement inspection is helpful
for improving the Agriculture Law in accordance with the changing
situation and said that it must reflect problems discovered during
the inspection.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors should express their opinions and suggestions about
applying the Agriculture Law, agriculture investment, land
contracts, and establishing an agricultural protection mechanism
in accordance with the market economy, he noted.

<HEADLINE> British Law Week In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese will get a chance to
see how Westerners deal with a criminal case at a trial staged as
part of British Law Week from October 6 to 10, whose purpose is to
increase comprehensive legal exchanges between Britain and China,
according to Stephen Forbes, second secretary of the British
Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
Forbes told a press conference here today that the case being
brought to trial will be a robbery and that it will be presided
over by Lord Justice Otton, with two leading British QCs as the
defence and prosecution counsel. The jury will be made up of
senior Chinese members of the legal professional.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be broadcast by Chinese television and a
that panel discussion will follow the trial.
</P>
<P>
British Law Weeks have been held in France and Spain, but this
one is the first foreign law week to be held in China.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Chinese and British lawyers, judges, legislators
and academics will come together for four days of discussions. The
group is led by the Court Appeal Judge the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice
Otton and includes senior barristers, solicitors, academics, human
rights experts, representatives of British NGOs and other
practitioners of the law.

<P>
The Week features discussions on issues of current interest to

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Allows Some NLD Members to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar authorities have
allowed seven members of the National League for Democracy (NLD)
to return home in the last two days after "housing" them for
several weeks at the state guest houses, according to a government
statement issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The authorities had also allowed an 85-year-old senior member
of the party to return home on September 14.
</P>
<P>
The official information sheet said more NLD members, who are
still "housed" at the guest houses, will be permitted to return
home in coming weeks after "discussions" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here Thursday by the NLD, a
total of 921 NLD members including 200 parliament
representatives-elect and 721 organizers have been detained by the
authorities since May 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
The NLD denied that the authorities had discussions with its
detained members, saying that they were, in fact, "interrogated."
</P>
<P>
Concerning the detention of some NLD members recently, the
government said it has no wish to "house" them for any longer than
necessary, and they will soon be home if the NLD leaders
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday last week, the NLD unilaterally formed a 10-member
Committee Representing the People's Parliament Elected in the
1990 General Election to arrange for the convening of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
A People's Parliament was also formed on the same day with a
chairman elected.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected the formation, saying it will
continue to govern the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Reading Habits Tend To Be Diverse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Some changes in Chinese
reading habits since 1978 show greater diversification, according
to a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The study, done by CAS's National Conditions Research Group, is
the first of the kind since the founding of new China in 1949. It
involved officials, people in bookstores, and ordinary folk and
found that books before 1978 were thought to be monotonous and
concentrated mainly on the works of Chairman Mao, revolutionary
literature encouraged by the government, and the Chinese classics.
</P>
<P>
The government and Chinese cultural traditions played a major
role in readers' lives at that time.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of books was a common story in the past, but what
people worry about now is how to choose from so many books on the
shelves, says Dr. Kang Xiaoguang, a member of the National
Conditions Research Group who is in charge of the study.
</P>
<P>
With the growth in the number of books came diversification and
an improvement in quality since 1978. The study found that the
influence of the Chinese classics has declined since 1978 and that
the impact of foreign literature, which was popular at the
beginning of China's reforms started to decline in the early
1990s. The revolutionary literature represented by Lu Xun, which
had a dominant role in readers' lives 20 years ago, has gradually
been replaced by non-revolutionary literature.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted, however, that the influence of Deng
Xiaoping's selected works has gone up steadily since 1978. During
the late 1980s, the influence of how-to books and economics began
to increase rapidly. Books on religion, biographies, and books
like "China Can Say No" and "Looking At China With the Third Eye"
have had a special impact on readers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that to many readers, what they read is no
longer a "political problem". "Over the past 20 years, reading has
become a personal matter in China," Kang says.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Chinese readers and publishers have
gradually matured over the past 20 years and that the market
economy gives readers more choices.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Start Post-Flood Rehabilitation Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said here Thursday that the post-flood
rehabilitation work would start in the country next month.
</P>
<P>
Some 170 million taka (3.62 million U.S. dollars) has been
earmarked for housing, 215.6 million taka (4.59 million dollars)
for agricultural rehabilitation, and 640 million taka (13.62
million dollars) for sinking tubewells across the country, Hasina
told reporters at the International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
New agricultural loans would be given to the affected farmers
before realizing the previous ones, to help them recoup the losses
caused by the floods, the prime minister said while exchanging
views with and seeking suggestions from journalists on measures to
tackle problems faced by the government following the floods.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, she said the buying capacity of the
people in the rural areas has been reduced, "but when the
food-for-work and the rehabilitation activities start, people
would get back their purchasing capacity."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the deaths caused by diarrhea, Hasina said some
322,000 people have been affected by the disease and 336 of them
have died, adding that the government is aware of the situation
and has taken measures to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
The government has instructed the construction of government
buildings at the thana (township) level on raised lands which
could be used as relief centers during calamities, and there would
be a pond in every ward for storing drinking water, she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina ruled out the possibility of price hike of food grains
in the country after the floods. "Under the prevailing situation,
there is no possibility of price hike of food grains in the
country," she said.
</P>
<P>
The price of rice went up a little following rumors about the
food stock, but it was handled properly by the government,
according to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The government has now a food stock of 647,000 tons, and the
private sector has imported 1.5 million tons to meet the
requirements of food, she said.
</P>
<P>
She warned that stern measures would be taken against those
found misusing the relief materials.
</P>
<P>
The protracted floods which started hitting the country in
early July affected directly and indirectly about half of the
country's 127 million people, with nearly 30 million of them hit
seriously, leaving more than 1,000 people dead and inflicting a
preliminary estimated loss of about 3.4 billion dollars.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. company of Cargill
has recently established a factory with an annual capacity of
250,000 tons of fodder in Zhenjiang, east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Cargill, which has moved its headquarters from Hong Kong to
Shanghai, mainly processes and sells agricultural products and
food and is involved in financial businesses. Last year the
company had global sales of 51 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dan Huber, president of Cargill Asia-Pacific, says that the
company has been doing business in China since 1972, after
President Nixon's visit. It sells grain, oil-bearing seeds, cotton
and fertilizer to China and buys iron and corn. From 1996 to 1997,
its trade with China amounted to one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Huber says that, because of the impact of the Asian financial
crisis, food sales in the latter half of 1997 dropped 15 to 20
percent and the fodder business also suffered losses.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed optimism about the Chinese market, and
explained that better products and promoting the development of
China's agriculture are two goals of the company.

<HEADLINE> Media Impartiality, Focus of Attention in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Media impartiality has been
the focal point of attention of Australia's media groups Thursday
as Australia's election campaign entered its final 9 days.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the competing major political parties, including
Prime Minister John Howard, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer and
Opposition leader Kim Beazley, faced questions from journalists
about the favorable comments by media barons about the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Packer, owner of the nation's largest commercial
television network Nine Network and dozens of magazines, and Don
McDonald, chairman of the state-funded Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC), praised the prime minister Wednesday at a
fund-raising lunch attended by the prime minister and some
business barons.
</P>
<P>
Kim Beazley, leader of the Australian Labor Party, Thursday
dismissed the media magnate's endorsement of Howard as
insignificant, while Treasurer Peter Costello said the remarks
were unlikely to translate into favorable media coverage.
</P>
<P>
Packer said Howard deserved re-election as prime minister and
attacked the opposition party, saying the Australian Labor Party
needed to be in opposition for a few more years.
</P>
<P>
Packer, who was given free digital spectrum for his network by
the government this year, needs the support of the federal
government to change some regulations that prevent him from
acquiring the nation's two leading newspapers The Sydney Morning
Herald and The Age while controlling the Nine Network.
</P>
<P>
McDonald, a Howard government appointee, said at the beginning
of the lunch that Howard was a man of high courage, decency and
true humility.
</P>
<P>
His glowing comment sparked a protest Thursday by some ABC
employees.
</P>
<P>
Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) staff at the ABC
headquarters in Sydney walked off the job for three hours in
protest against McDonald's public endorsement of Prime Minister
John Howard.
</P>
<P>
The ABC chairman's comment came as a surprise as the prime
minister a week ago accused the ABC of bias against his coalition.
</P>
<P>
Recent media coverage by the nation's leading national
newspapers, including The Australian owned by Rupert Murdoch, has
been critical of the Labor Party's policies.

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China has developed new
technology that it says will greatly improve quality and
reliability and cut cost of internet services that use
telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
Chinese told the Study Group 7 meeting of the International
Telecommunications Union's standardization department in Beijing
about using an optical cable network.
</P>
<P>
Herb Bertine, chairman of the Study Group 7, said that he is
surprised to see that China has been developing this technology
and equipment and that the technology is unique.
</P>
<P>
It combines the advantages of PPP and ATM technology that is
now widely used to connect the Internet with telecommunications
networks, with a performance to cost ratio many times higher than
that of existing technology.
</P>
<P>
The Wuhan Academy of Post and Telecommunications is developing
the technology and equipment. The academy's Yu Shaohu says that
since China has the largest optical cable network in the world,
the technology will greatly expand Internet use here.
</P>
<P>
China now has 120 million telephone lines. The figure is
expected to be 180 million by 2000. And, there are more than a
million Internet users in China.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that if the technology gets ITU approval, it will
create a new telecommunications technology and equipment
market.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Unrest Imminent in Nigeria over Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An industrial unrest seems
imminent in Lagos and Osun states following the insistence of the
states' civil servants on the 5,200 Naira (about 60 U.S. Dollars)
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Industrial Union (COIU) issued a seven-day
ultimatum to Lagos state government to implement the new minimum
wage in a statement released at the end of an emergency meeting
Wednesday, The Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
COIU Chairman Ayodele Akele warned that the state civil
servants would not accept anything less than the 5,200 Naira wage
taking effect from September 1 or the state government would face
an industrial unrest.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lagos State Administrator Mohammed Marwa said the
state requires about 10.2 billion Naira (about 113 million U.S.
Dollars) yearly to implement the new minimum wages, saying the
state may find it difficult to shoulder the extra burden.
</P>
<P>
The COIU leaders said they regretted the remarks made by the
administrator and issued the seven-day ultimatum with effect from
Thursday or September 24.
</P>
<P>
Their counterparts in Osun State are also insisting on the
5,200 Naira minimum wage against the 2,800 (32.3 U.S. Dollars)
Naira which the state government is proposing to pay.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Nigerian Federal Government approved a
pay rise package for civil servants with the monthly minimum wage
at 5,200 Naira.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said in a circular to all ministries
and government bodies that the pay rise was only for civil
servants working for the Federal government, while workers of
State governments have to negotiate with their respective
employers for necessary adjustment.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's suspension from the
Commonwealth will not be lifted until a democratic civilian
government is in place next year, Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth Chief Emeka Anyaoku has said.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku made the comments in London Wednesday, shortly after a
meeting with visiting Nigerian military leader General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, who is on his way to the U.N. General Assembly in New
York.
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting as excellent and very productive,
adding that Nigeria and the Commonwealth are working toward
normalizing relations between them.
</P>
<P>
He said the Commonwealth had already begun talks with the
Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) on assistance to the
latter for the organization of elections under Nigeria's
transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
According to the new transition program announced by Abubakar,
Nigeria's military will hand over power to an elected civilian
government on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said there were moves not only in the Commonwealth,
but also across Europe, to lift sanctions imposed on Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In his own remarks after the meeting, Abubakar expressed the
hope that the Commonwealth will eventually re-admit Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said the Commonwealth was already playing a significant
role in the transition program and was looking into ways of
participating in the development of Nigeria's economy.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar attended a reception for British businessmen later
Wednesday before leaving for New York.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's membership was suspended from the Commonwealth in
1995 after the then government of late General Sani Abacha
executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists
on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
International sanctions, including the ban of top military
government officials from overseas visits, were also imposed on
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> India Be Accepted as Nuclear Weapons State: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An Indian senior official
said Thursday that the core issue for India to accept any formal
measure to restrain its nuclear capabilities was its acceptance as
a nuclear weapons state by the nuclear weapons powers.
</P>
<P>
Giving a lecture on "India, Europe and Non-Proliferation" at
Jawahrlal Nehru University here, Jasjit Singh, director of the
Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses (IDSA), said that as
India was unlikely to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) or any fissile material cut-off treaty, a protocol to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) can be attached where
countries like India will commit to the obligations of the NPT but
as a state for nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
After India conducted five underground nuclear tests in May
this year, the world community has time and again urged India to
stop nuclear weapons development program and sign CTBT without any
condition.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee Wednesday said that
India would sign CTBT only its conditions are met. India is
reported to have asked four conditions for the signing of CTBT:
recognizing India's nuclear status, lifting economic sanctions,
keeping its minimum nuclear deterrence and transfer of advanced
dual use of technology.

<HEADLINE> Symposium On Fish Utilization Opens In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24,(Xinhua) -- A three-day symposium on
"Fish Utilization in the Asia-Pacific Region" opened in Beijing
today to discuss technology and consider recommendations for
future fishery research and development.
</P>
<P>
This is another meeting since the 1978 symposium in the
Philippines for the Asia Pacific Fishing Commission to discuss
this topic.
</P>
<P>
Fish have long been a traditional part of the diet in the Asia
Pacific Region and the fishing industry there has had developed
drapidly in the past years.
</P>
<P>
But since 1989, there have been declines in the fish supply,
and, what is worse, serious economic losses in catches and
processing. To protect the food supply and healthy fishing
development, the APFIC has decided that a symposium was a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
The APFIC is an affiliate of the Food and Agriculture
Organization. Some 100 People from 39 countries and regions are
participating in the Beijing session.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Police said Thursday no
illegal assemblies by supporters of sacked Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim in the capital city or elsewhere in the
country would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Police will take stern action against those who try to mount
illegal assemblies in the capital city or elsewhere in the
country, Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor told a press
conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have issued a directive that there would be no assemblies

through the Internet urging people to assemble at Dataran Merdeka
(Independence Square) here on September 28 (Monday) to show
support for Anwar who was sacked from the cabinet on September 2
and expelled from the ruling United Malays National Organization
(UMNO) on September 4.
</P>
<P>
September 28 was declared by the government as a public holiday
in celebration of the overwhelming success of the 16th
Commonwealth Games held in the country from September 11 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was arrested Sunday night by police after leading an
alleged illegal procession from the National Mosque here that day
and is currently detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA)
for threatening national security.
</P>
<P>
On Anwar's whereabouts, Abdul Rahim said Anwar is safe under
police custody.

He said Anwar would get a fair trial as required by the
country's judicial system and Anwar's lawyers would be allowed to
see him in due time.
</P>
<P>
He said Anwar would be charged in the open court soon over the
allegations arising from the book "50 Dalil Mengapa Anwar Tidak
Boleh Jadi PM" ("50 reasons why Anwar cannot become PM").
</P>
<P>
Anwar has been implicated in at least two sexual offenses when
two men last Saturday confessed in court that they had allowed
themselves to be sodomized by Anwar, an offense under the Penal

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Camerounian government has
reiterated its commitment to peaceful settlement of the crisis
over the disputed Bakassi Peninsula, according a report of The
Post Express Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement was issued Wednesday in capital Yaounde following
allegations by Nigeria that Cameroun has begun a massive
deployment of troops in the disputed areas despite efforts by the
International Court of Justice at the Hague to resolve the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Cameroun denied the allegations as
"untrue" and categorically stated that there was "no build-up of
Camerounian troops in the said zone."
</P>
<P>
The Camerounian government reaffirmed its willingness and
determination to work for the maintenance of peace between
Cameroun and Nigeria, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Nigerian Defense Headquarters issued a
statement accusing Cameroun of deploying troops to the disputed
areas along its border with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed for several times in the
last few years at Bakassi Peninsula in the Guinea Gulf in West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Defense Headquarters alleged that five Nigerian
soldiers, 20 women and 18 children had been injured in the
clashes in April and about 15 fishermen were taken hostage by
Camerounian troops.
</P>
<P>
According to former Defense spokesman Colonel Godwin Ugbo,
despite Camerounian President Paul Biya's denial that his army
had attacked Nigerian army position in the disputed areas,
Camerounian gendarmes have opened new fronts at some border towns
in Borno State, the local newspapers said.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Global Monitoring Circle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China is pushing ahead with
plans to build the world's first global ground-based meridian
circle to forecast conditions for satellite launches, manned space
shuttles and airplane and ship navigation.
</P>
<P>
Wei Fengsi, a researcher at the Space Science and Application
Center attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said today
that "the meridian circle will monitor sun storms, geomagnetic
storms and electromagnetic radiation."
</P>
<P>
He said the building of the network is aimed at avoiding
satellite launch failures, satellite malfunctions and inaccurate
plane navigation.
</P>
<P>
As part of a future space development strategy, China will be
the first to build a chain of ground stations along a span of 120
degrees east longitude which will later form a global meridian
circle with monitoring stations along 60 degrees west longitude
built by the U.S. and Canada, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
China has so far built some 20 well-equipped ground monitoring
stations and seven related labs along the 120 degrees east
longitude, according to Wei.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, China plans to send the world most advanced solar
telescope into space orbit. The telescope is being jointly
developed by China and Germany with an investment of 500 million
yuan (60.2 million U.S. dollars) to forecast and monitor solar
activity.
</P>
<P>
Shao Liqin, a senior official with the Ministry of Science and
Technology, said the central government has approved the
"meridian chain project" and has promised to pump 180 million yuan
(about 21.7 million U.S. dollars) into it. The project is expected
to be completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States, Canada, Japan, Russia,
Australia, France and other countries have expressed their
willingness to cooperate with China in this endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The State Natural Science Fund will offer 5 million yuan (about
602,000 U.S. dollars) to support research on the relationship
between space conditions and their consequences on earth.
</P>
<P>
"China is the only place in the world where a meridian circle
linking to the western hemisphere can be formed for effective
monitoring of space conditions, because most of the areas covered
by other longitude circles are oceans," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"After receiving forecast of dangerous conditions, preventive
measures can be taken, such as orbit readjustments for satellites,
the postponement of space walks for astronauts, and alterations of
telecommunications channels in order to minimize losses," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiji, an expert on aerospace, said 40 percent of China's
satellite failures are caused by catastrophic space conditions,
including wind shear at high altitudes. Economic losses can be
greatly reduced and accident rates can be lowered if more data
about space conditions are collected beforehand, he added.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has
announced a revised secretariat structure to meet the demands of
the 21st century, a press release from the U.N. body said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring which streamlines ESCAP's programs structure
is the final phase of the reform process that began in January
1996, to comply with the overall U.N. reforms effort and the
provisions of a Commission resolution, ESCAP Secretary-General
Adrianus Mooy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the revised secretariat structure came into immediate
effect, while some have been slated for January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The secretariat restructuring aims to conform to the crux of
the reform exercise... and enable ESCAP to respond more
effectively to the evolving economic and social needs of members
and associate members through multi-disciplinary and intersectoral
action," Mooy said.
</P>
<P>
The reorganization has been welcomed by many member states, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the regional commissions like ESCAP offer the
possibility of greatly improving the overall efficiency of the
U.N., it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded at a
Jerusalem bus stop during rush hours Thursday morning, injuring
an Israeli soldier and wrecking the stop's shelter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the explosive device, weighing about one
kilogram and possibly triggered by a timer, went off at about
8:00 am (local time) near the campus of the Hebrew University,
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the explosion, Israeli police and bomb squad
rushed to the scene and sealed the area, which is adjacent
to the West Bank. Police investigation team conducted searches
while the bomb squad combed the scene for other possible bombs.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier sitting at the bus stop was lightly
hurt in the head when the bomb went off, the police said.
</P>
<P>
A white car with Palestinian license plates was seen leaving
the scene and was stopped at a nearby Israeli army roadblock and
the car driver was detained for questioning, the police added.
</P>
<P>
The police also used helicopters to search for suspects,
particularly the cars with Palestinian license plates.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred during the high alert period imposed by
the Israeli security forces two weeks ago following bomb treats
by Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (hamas) against the
Israelis. Hamas wants to avenge the killing of two Hamas members
earlier this month near Hebron by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's bomb was relatively small and the bus stop was
located in an outlying neighborhood of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mao Zedong's Native Place Become Well-off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the city of
Xiangtan in Hunan Province, near Mao Zedong's home are the first
group of people in Hunan to give shape to Mao's well-known line
"making the sun and the moon take on a new look", even though the
province is still underdeveloped as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial rural development department, in the
past two decades, Xiangtan has led the province in developing its
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
One of these farmers is Tang Qilin. Sitting in a well-furnished
home, with a color TV, a washing-machine and a motorcycle, Tang
can hardly believe his eyes when he sees these things that have
come in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly make ends meet just a few years ago," says
Tang, but "thanks to the government's market-oriented economic
reform, we're now allowed to make money from whatever is
marketable." So he set up a pig farm in 1992 and now earns 200,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, rural parts of Xiangtan produced over 35.8 billion
yuan in industrial and agricultural output, compared with 1.1
billion yuan in 1984. Per-capita income of local farmers was seven
times the 1984 figure at 2,532 yuan, 442 yuan more than the
national figure.
</P>
<P>
Township industries have grown in Xiangtan and produce 30
billion yuan worth of goods annually, compared with 372 million
yuan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey made by the department shows that more than 85
percent of Xiangtan's rural residents are enjoying a relatively
comfortable life in terms of income, material and cultural life,
life expectancy, environment and social security.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in
Tokyo Thursday as investors bought back shares on euphoria which
spilled into the Tokyo market from overseas stock markets over a
possible cut in U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 415.97 points, or 3.02
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 14,205.78. The Tokyo
market was closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rose 27.84 points or 2.65 percent to
1,078.01.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the major section fell to an estimated 450 million
shares from Tuesday's 511.83 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Steel maker NKK was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders hailed fresh hints left by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan of lower U.S. interest rates and some
predict it could happen as early as next week during a meeting of
the Federal Open Markets Committee, the policy arm of the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts see this as a plus because it means the United
States is serious about preventing the world financial crisis from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,342 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
exceeded losers 871 to 290, with 133 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Back Army Presence in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's members of
Parliament Wednesday expressed overwhelming support for the
continued deployment of Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) in
eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They made the decision when debating on President Yoweri
Museveni's speech addressed to the legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
The MPs also supported the president's diplomatic efforts for
a negotiated settlement to the deepening crisis in the war-torn
country, the New Vision daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The debate was reportedly adjourned prematurely after an MP
alleged that more than 1,000 UPDF troops had been taken prisoner
in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
This allegation was immediately rebutted by Major General
Mugisha Muntu and Minister of State for Defense Steven Kavuma.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused of fomenting and backing the Tutsi-led
rebellion in Congo since its eruption on August 2. It admitted
military presence in eastern Congo, but said it is to safeguard
Uganda's national security.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government said it has never been directly
involved in the conflict between Congolese rebels and government
troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
When addressing parliament on the situation in Congo (K) last
week, President Museveni said UPDF troops will remain there till
their national interests are not threatened.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Analyst Says Silting Not Main Reason For Summer's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A veteran water conservation
specialist believes that this summer's serious flood problems on
the Yangtze River were caused more by the reduced amount of water
diversion areas than by silting.
</P>
<P>
Water levels on many sections of the middle and lower reaches
of the Yangtze were much higher than 44 years ago and many
specialists think that this was the result of silting.
</P>
<P>
But, Hong Qingyu, formerly Chief Engineer of the Yangtze River
Water Conservation Committee, sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
According to him, amounts of floodwater this summer were less
than that in 1954, and only parts of the main course of the
Yangtze were more silted, while most sections were normal.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the high water levels were mainly the result of
a decrease in the amount of diverted water. In 1954, a total of
102.3 billion cubic meters of water were diverted from the lower
and middle reaches, compared with only 10 billion cubic meters
this summer, he explains. Because there was more water in the
river, the water levels were higher.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the high water levels is that more water was
being drained into the river to prevent waterlogging than in
1954. This was the result of improved drainage ability, Hong
points out.

LOS ANGELES, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Prices of silver and
other precious metals rose sharply Wednesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, following U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's
hints of lowering interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Silver for December delivery rose 15.3 cents, or 3.1 percent,
to 5.043 U.S. dollars an ounce; December gold rose 2 dollars to
292.50 dollars an ounce. October platinum rose 2.20 dollars to
355.50 dollars an ounce; December palladium rose 2.25 dollars to
281 dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
December high-grade steel rose 1.4 cents to 75.05 cents a
pound. Copper futures also went up.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, testifying before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee,
said that there was a need to "bring the existing instabilities to
a level of stability reasonably shortly to prevent the contagion
from really spilling over and creating some very significant
further difficulties for all of us."
</P>
<P>
Economists say Greenspan's comments were a strong signal that
Fed is considering taking actions to keep the American economy
strong in the face of a global economic crisis, and that the
central bank will cut interest rates when policy-makers meet next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say that cutting interest rates could spur
home, auto and big-ticket sales, in which silver, platinum,
palladium and copper play key roles.

ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines

</P>
<P>
According to the publication, EAL's net profit has risen by

percent increase from the previous year.

passenger transport went up by 4.2 percent in 1997, while revenue

<HEADLINE> Study: Death Rate From Heart Disease Falls In U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A study released here
Wednesday said the risk of dying from heart disease dropped
remarkably in the United States in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by a group of researchers led by Wayne
Rosamoun of the University of North Carolina and published on the
latest issue of New England Journal of Medicine, looked at
statistics from regions of North Carolina, Mississippi, Minnesota
and Maryland between 1987 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The study said that the deaths from heart disease fell 28
percent among men and 31 percent among women during the seven
years.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the one-third drop of death rate in the United
States in recent years may be due largely to improvements in
treatment of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
More people are taking drugs to control their cholesterol or
blood pressure, and more patients recognize the early warning
signs of heart attacks and get to hospitals, said Dr. Valentin
Fuster, president of the American Heart Association, adding that
the trend is toward overall improvement.
</P>
<P>
Heart attack is the leading cause of death in developed
countries. About 40 percent of all deaths in the United States
were due to heart disease in the past 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Teenager Kournikova to Play Sanchez Vicario in Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian teenager Anna
Kournikova eliminated Wang Shi-ting of Chinese Taipei in straight
sets on Thursday, setting her quarterfinal clash against Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario in the Princess Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Russian, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals
last season, surged to her victory with ease by scoring 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario, who paced Spain to beat Switzerland in the
Fed Cup last weekend, enjoyed her upperhands from the beginning
to seal the competition 6-0, 6-4 against Elena Likhovtseva of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, who won the first set in 16 minutes, was broken in
her first serve to go down 0-2 in the second set, but rallied to
win the third and never faced a single break point throughout the
50-minute match.
</P>
<P>
The Russian teenager took every chance to charge to the net
and stunned the top player from Chinese Taipei with lightning
shots.
</P>
<P>
Regarding her next opponent, Kournikova was eager to avenge
her first defeat to Sanchez Vicario in the US Open fourth round
after beating her three times in a row on clay and hard court to
hold a 3-1 record.
</P>
<P>
"I've beaten her before on the same surface, so it doesn't
make any difference, but of course, I try to learn from mistakes
I did before. I just try to go out there, play my game and be
aggressive," said Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
For Sanchez Vicario, it was the first match since playing her
singles and doubles matches in beating Switzerland 3-2 in Geneva
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It was very humid, so it was hard to hold the racket for a
while and swing a lot, but I'm happy with the way I played after
a long flight from Europe, not having so much time to recover,"
said the top seed, who needed 57 minutes to beat Likhovtseva.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shanghai GM Gets Huge Loan From Financial Consortium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A financial consortium
consisting of 39 Chinese and foreign banks signed an agreement
early this week to grant 821 million U.S. dollars in loans to
support the development of the automotive industry in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used to build Shanghai General Motors Co.
(SGMC), a joint venture between the Shanghai Automobile Corp. and
General Motors of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The loan has lower financial charges than loans offered to
similar domestic projects, includes unsecured limited recourse
financing, and involves little risk, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the largest of its kind among commercial banks
in China, demonstrates Shanghai's ability to raise capital on both
the domestic and international market.
</P>
<P>
SGMC has registered capital of 700 million U.S. dollars, and
with this loan from the financial consortium, SGMC has now raised
enough money to complete its construction.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Schlais, President of GM China, expressed hopes that this
agreement will help SGMC develop into a world-class company.
</P>
<P>
SGMC, the largest-ever Sino-U.S. project, was established at
the beginning of last year in Shanghai's Pudong New Area. Its
first product, a Buick automobile, is scheduled to come off the
assembly line by the end of this year, and massive production is
expected to begin next April.

Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), arrived here on
an official goodwill visit to New Zealand after a successful visit
to Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech at the airport upon his arrival at the

visit "the homeland of Rewi Alley, a great son of New Zealand and
a friend of the Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and New Zealand peoples enjoy a long-standing and
traditional friendship. The friendly relations of the two
countries have developed smoothly especially since the
establishment of the diplomatic ties. The two countries have
consistently deepened their exchange and cooperation in the
political, economic, trade, science and technology and cultural
fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
 Committee, noted that maintaining and promoting Sino-New Zealand
friendship is in the interest of the two peoples and conducive to
peace, stability and economic development in the Asian-Pacific
region and in the world at large.

<HEADLINE> French Troops May Replace Norwegian Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- With less than three months to
go before the Norwegian peace keepers depart from south Lebanon,
the Lebanese government is trying to persuade France to send
troops to replace them.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian government announced earlier this year that it
would be pulling its 625 troops out of south Lebanon in December
this year due to problems in attracting new recruits.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have been proposed as potential replacements,
including India, Nigeria, Ukraine and France.
</P>
<P>
An officer of the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) told
the Daily Star published on Thursday that Lebanon prefers French
troops to replace the outgoing Norwegians despite Indian
willingness to take part in the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has close ties with French
President Jacques Chirac and supports the growing role played by
Paris in the Middle East peace process, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The officer said there was also an economic consideration in
choosing peacekeeping troops for the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Some residents from Ibl es-Saqi, where the Norwegian battalion
headquarters is located, have reportedly asked Hariri to choose a
European country because their troops tend to be better paid and
have more spending power than their third world counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The residents have apparently warned the prime minister that
an economic downturn could prompt a mass exodus from the area if a
poorer nation replaces the Norwegians.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of local traders have a lucrative income from selling
all kinds of goods to UNIFIL troops.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL was established in 1978 after Israel's
first invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to help restore the Lebanese government's
authority over the southern part of the country and confirm the
Israeli withdrawal from the area.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.

<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National)
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish political circles were shaken Wednesday after an
alleged telephone conversation between State Minister Eyup Asik
and mafia boss Alaatin Cakici under arrest was broadcast on a
private television.
</P>
<P>
Asik, a ruling Motherland Party member, denied the charges,
saying that the conversation was "assembled." Opposition parties
demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals Wednesday upheld a
sentence of a 10-month imprisonment for Istanbul Mayor Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, which might end the political life of the
pro-Islamic politician.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan was found guilty by the State Security Court in
Diyarbakir in April "for inciting hatred based on religious
differences" in a speech.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli
said on Wednesday that Turkey is willing to improve its ties with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the relations would not be bettered unless
Damascus stops supporting the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
which seek independence in the southeast of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mao Zedong's Home Place Become Better Off (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The changes have been attributed to the move from the
decades-old planned economy to a market one. Farmers at Shaoshan,
where Mao was born on December 26, 1893, have developed a
diversified economy in accordance with market demands rather than
blindly growing rice and raising pigs as planned by the government.
</P>
<P>
The village has become a tourist resort in addition to a
memorial of the Communist-led revolution. Historic relics have
been restored and stone tablets with inscriptions of Mao's poetry
put up by villagers.
</P>
<P>
The village has attracted more than 14 million visitors from
all over, and in 1996, had an income of 100 million yuan, compared
with less than 60,000 yuan in the early 80s. Average annual
per-capita income is 5,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
One unusual story is that of Shi Yinglian, who began running a
tannery eight years ago, lost 700,000 yuan in the first year owing
to lack of experience, and then finally succeeded after working
hard and learning more about technology, management and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Her factory now has 66 million yuan in output value and 2
million yuan in profits every year.
</P>
<P>
However, life for farmers in Xiangtan is still far from
luxurious, one city official points out, and a greater effort
needs to be made to have a more efficient rural economy in the
near future.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- One of the major Asian Games
sports complexes may not be finished in time and alternate sites
for events may have to be found, local organizers said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, chairman of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said the liquidity
problems of the main contractor may prevent the company from
finishing the Muang Thong Thani complex in time for the Games
slated from December 6 to 20.
</P>
<P>
The committee will decide on Friday whether to move some of
the sports elsewhere. A statement from the committee said plans
had called for seven sports to be staged at the complex, which is
about 80 percent completed.
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea how to help," Bhichai was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Preparation for the games have been plagued by other problems
including political interference, alleged corruption and outright
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee threatened
several times to award Asia's biggest sports event to other
countries, but the Thais argued that all would be ready by the
opening day.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 athletes from 43 countries and regions are
expected to compete in the Games.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Mao Zedong's Native Place Become Well-off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the city of
Xiangtan in Hunan Province, near Mao Zedong's home are the first
group of people in Hunan to give shape to Mao's well-known line
"making the sun and the moon take on a new look", even though the
province is still underdeveloped as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial rural development department, in the
past two decades, Xiangtan has led the province in developing its
rural economy.
</P>
<P>
One of these farmers is Tang Qilin. Sitting in a well-furnished
home, with a color TV, a washing-machine and a motorcycle, Tang
can hardly believe his eyes when he sees these things that have
come in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly make ends meet just a few years ago," says
Tang, but "Thanks to the government's market-oriented economic
reform, we're now allowed to make money from whatever is
marketable." So he set up a pig farm in 1992
</P>
<P>
In 1997, rural parts of Xiangtan produced over 35.8 billion
yuan in industrial and agricultural output, compared with 1.1
billion yuan in 1984. Per-capita income of local farmers was seven
times the 1984 figure at 2,532 yuan, 442 yuan more than the
national figure.
</P>
<P>
Township industries have grown in Xiangtan and produce 30
billion yuan worth of goods annually, compared with 372 million
yuan in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Raise Banks Reserves: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines said Thursday it will be forced to raise reserved
requirements for banks if the local currency, the peso, continues
to depreciate.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson in
reaction to reports that the monetary system plans to introduce a
monetary measure that will sap up the excess liquidity in the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he discussed the proposed measure with members of
the Monetary Board during a meeting Monday in order to cushion the
impact of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) row. PAL owes the local
banks some 9 billion pesos (202 million U.S. dollars), of which 7
billion pesos (157 million dollars) is fully collateralized.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there is indeed an excess liquidity in the
banking system and that the only best solution to ward off
speculative activities would be to raise the banks' reserved
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Singson, however, declined to specify the amount of reserved
requirements to be imposed as this might create panic among
speculators.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that excess liquidity is taking place because the
number of people borrowing money from the banks has been minimized
due to high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the peso came under attack when the negotiations
between the management of PAL and the striking workers bogged down
anew causing market volatility.
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing right now is to closely monitor the
performance of the peso against the dollar," Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Restoration of UNITA Members' Positions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
reinstated a splinter group of the opposition UNITA movement in
the national reconciliation and unity government as from
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued Wednesday night said that the
decision was made in consideration of the fact "that the new
leadership of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) has expressed their political attitude for the continued
peace process in the country."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos has removed
UNITA members, Marco Samondo as Minister of Geology and Mineral,
and Aurelio Joao Evangelista, as Deputy Minister of Social
Communication, for their continued loyalty to UNITA leader, Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the government suspended UNITA members'
positions in the reconciliation and unity government for UNITA's
delay in implementing the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol group of
part of its armed forces, refusing to hand over four cities to
government administration and reluctance to move its headquarters
to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
A group of UNITA members in the government vowed to depose
Savimbi and set up a UNITA Renovation Committee, saying they
will stick to the peace process as stipulated by the 1994
Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Then Luanda cut off its ties with UNITA and recognizes the
UNITA Renovation Committee as the only partner to talk with in
the future.
</P>
<P>
But a recent resolution passed by the Security Council of the
United Nations has urged the Angolan government to continue its
peace talks with UNITA and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan also
demanded the government resume UNITA members' positions in the
reconciliation government.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-funded Firms Encouraged to Increase Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, China's
economic powerhouse and largest exporter, is encouraging
overseas-backed enterprises to increase their exports in a bid to
fulfill its projected export goals.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Xu Deli announced some newly adopted favorable
policies for export-oriented foreign-funded businesses at a
meeting early this week, citing 322 excellent overseas-backed
firms including such multinationals as General Electric, DuPont,
Matsushita and Epson.
</P>
<P>
The new policies include cutting land-use taxes for the 322
listed businesses by 10 percent, imposing a low fee-levying
standard, with overseas-funded enterprises able to refuse to pay
any fee above the standard, and requiring customs to make things
more convenient for any overseas-funded firm exporting more than
10 million U.S. dollars worth of goods annually.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, Guangdong had trade contacts with over 70
countries and regions, involving nearly 200,000 investment
contracts worth 198.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The vice-governor said that Guangdong's 70,000 overseas-funded
enterprises play a decisive role in helping reach its exports goal
of expanding 10 to 15 percent this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Water
Resources, Irrigation and Flood Control Ministry has chalked out a
post-flood rehabilitation plan involving 12.48 billion taka (265.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.5 billion taka (74.5 million dollars) will be
required for a short-term program while 7.78 billion taka (165.5
million dollars) will be needed for a long-term one, in addition
to the 1.2 billion taka (25.5 million dollars) required for the
rehabilitation of some flood-damaged roads, The Independent daily
Thursday quoted a ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a perspective plan," he said. "It is a plan for
rehabilitation of the damaged infrastructure including
embankments, sluice gates, bridges, culverts, protection walls,
roads and groynes."
</P>
<P>
Due to the over-two-month-long floods, a total of 178
kilometers of embankments were totally damaged, while partial
damage was done to 1,586 kilometers of embankments in different
parts of the country.

The assessment of the water resources ministry would be
submitted to the donors for their appraisal so as to provide
necessary help for the rehabilitation projects, he said.

The donors, particularly the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank, have shown keen interest in financing the
rehabilitation programs, he added.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Flock to Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region is emerging as a new haven for foreign investment in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
In the first two days of the '98 Ningxia Trade Fair which took
place between September 18 and 22, a dozen overseas companies
invested in over 20 projects with local partners, involving 170
million U.S. dollars, which is 60 percent of the total overseas
investment Ningxia has attracted over the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure and agricultural projects were most favored by
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
David Su, China head of the U.S.-based China Direct Inc., said
investors were mainly lured by Ningxia's rich natural resources
and preferential policies, such as five years exemption from duty
fees for solely overseas-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
His company has decided to invest 105 million U.S. dollars to
build two power plants with local partners.
</P>
<P>
The power plants will use local low-grade coal that is usually
discarded in large heaps, and this will also help clean up the
local environment.
</P>
<P>
The Eikem Group, one of the largest industrial enterprises in
Norway, plans to inject about 300 million yuan (36.14 million
U.S. dollars) into Ningxia over the next four to five years to
develop carbon-based products.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong investors will help build the first expressway in
Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The Chines government has decided to accelerate economic
development in the vast western region of the country where ther
are rich natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
A series of preferential policies have been worked out to this
end.

<HEADLINE> Burkina Faso, Ghana to Foster Military Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Burkina Faso have
said there is need for the two neighbors to foster military
cooperation among Africa countries to help solved conflicts on
the continent, Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Burkinese Defense Minister Milogo-De Albert, who led a
six-man military delegation to Accra#,Ghana's capital, agreed
Wednesday with his Ghanaian counterpart Iddrisu Mahama that most
of the conflicts plaguing the continent could have been resolved
long ago if African governments exchanged programs through their
military institutions.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, including Colonel Ibrahim Traore, Burkinese
Chief of Defense Staff (CDS), arrived in the country Tuesday for
a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Burkinese delegation will hold discussions with their
Ghanaian counterparts on bilateral issues to help strengthen the
long-standing friendly relations between Ghana and Burkina Faso
which dates back to 1984.
</P>
<P>
Albert said following the visit to Ghana by President Blaise
Campaore, there was the need for a follow-up to enable the two
countries to discuss "areas where we can organize our military
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Ouagadougou is particularly interested in the training of
military officers in the two sister countries for common
operations and hoped both nations will start this through
exchange programs for other African countries to emulate.
</P>
<P>
The Burkinese defense minister suggested that one way by
which African governments can help bring lasting peace onto the
continent is by inculcating the principle of unity in their youth
through exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
"If our children are trained together in the same colleges,
it will be difficult for them to fight one another."
</P>
<P>
Welcoming his Burkinese counterpart, Alhaji Iddrisu expressed
concern about the lack of confidence and trust among African
governments, and hoped with strengthened joint commissions for
cooperation African governments will eliminate those fears.

<HEADLINE> East China Reinforcing Dykes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu
Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses and a region
threatened by Yangtze River floods, plans to reinforce its major
dykes this winter and next spring.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Zheng Silin said his government will put
this task at the top of the agenda for 1999 to ensure completion
of the project before the next flood season.
</P>
<P>
Government investment in water control projects will be raised
from the previous 2.5 billion yuan to 3.5 billion yuan, and
additional funds will be raised through various channels,
including state bonds and bank loans, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
The project includes building 700 kilometers of river
revetments and 348 kilometers of breakwaters.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu now has 1,500 kilometers of river dykes, and the
provincial government plans to allocate 2.5 billion yuan to
fortify and heighten them over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jiangsu reinforced 635 kilometers of embankments,
built 335 kilometers of stone slopes, and repaired 256 dangerous
culvert water gates. These measures are believed to have reduced
flood-related losses by 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center at the mouth of
the Yangtze River, has three-year plan to consolidate its
dykes and seawalls so they can also withstand rare typhoons.
</P>
<P>
This reinforcement plan will cost an estimated 700 million
yuan and is scheduled to be completed before June, 2001.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's C. Bank Rejects Cutting Cash Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) has turned down a request by small banks, threatened with a
run by depositors, to reduce the cash ratio requirement currently
at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the request, CBK said it could not operate a
different regime for small and big banks, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cash ratio refers to the amount of money that banks must
deposit with the CBK from the deposits collected from the public
where it stays without earning interest. It is one of the tools
that CBK uses to check money supply.
</P>
<P>
Three commercial banks -- Reliance Bank, Trust Bank and
Bullion Bank -- have been put under statutory management by CBK
in the past two weeks, causing a panic among small and medium
sized banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, representatives of 20 small commercial banks
came together to start a fund to assist any of the members that
may face a liquidity crisis.
</P>
<P>
They also said at a meeting with CBK this week that they
agreed with CBK over the need to raise the share capital or to
merge to strengthen the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The banks, led by Manu Chandaria, a leading industrialist, is
now seeking CBK's guidance on the modalities of managing the fund
and possibilities of additional help from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, a survey showed that most banks were cautiously
optimistic about their future.
</P>
<P>
Some banks were also taking steps to avoid panic withdrawals
by depositors by putting a ceiling on the amount of money that
depositors can withdraw at any one time.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 55 banks and financial institutions in
this east African country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia will offer 180 million
U.S. dollars next year to help Ukraine build two nuclear power
stations, Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma has announced here.
</P>
<P>
He told local reporters that during his talks with Russian
leaders in Moscow on September 18 and 19, Russia agreed to set
aside 180 million dollars from its next year's budget to fund the
building of the Rovno station and the Khmelynitsky station.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Ukraine would go ahead with the projects with
the cooperation from Russia, no matter whether the European Bank
of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would extend its promised
fund of 750 million dollars to the stations.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, the Group of Seven and the European Union signed
an agreement with Ukraine in Moscow on shutting down the Chernobyl
station, one of whose reactors exploded in April 1986, killing and
wounding thousands of people with its leaked radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries promised to fund the building of the two
new nuclear power stations in exchange for the shutdown of the
Chernobyl station.
</P>
<P>
The two stations are near completion, but building has stopped
because of shortage of Western fund.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see the Russian move to offer aid to Ukraine while
itself is suffering an economic crisis as a friendly gesture to
its neighbor.

<HEADLINE> TV Ranks First As News Source in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide survey reveals
that TV has become the most important news source in China,
followed by newspapers and radio, according to today's
Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey was jointly conducted by China Central Television
(CCTV) and 16 provincial and city-level TV stations, the third
such sample survey taken, the others having been conducted in 1987
and 1992.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,066 people above the age of 13 answered the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Result show that China now has 1.094 billion television
viewers, the largest group in the world, with 317 million TV sets
in all, both color and black-and-white.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents on average can receive 15 different channels,
and in some major cities more than 20, while rural farmers usually
have access to 6 channels. Some 34.5 percent of Chinese families
now have cable television.
</P>
<P>
Most of people surveyed said they are interested in news report
more than entertainment programs. "We want to know what is
happening at home and abroad and get a better understanding of
state principles and polices," one said.
</P>
<P>
Serial plays and programs related to law and sports have their
own relatively stable viewer groups, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It also found the average Chinese spends two hours and 11
minutes watching TV each day, and they usually watch longer
on weekends.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Minister to Contest Sri Lankan Presidential Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A former powerful minister in
the previous government, Sirisena Cooray, has expressed his
intention to contest Sri Lanka's next presidential election as an
independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
The election is due in two years' time, but it may be held
earlier if the present incumbent, Chandrika Kumaratunga, so
decides.
</P>
<P>
Cooray said at a meeting of his supporters here recently that
he will contest the election as an independent candidate and he
will win. he said running for president as an independent would be
better than representing a political party.
</P>
<P>
Several former MPs and former municipal councilors from the now
main opposition party United National Party (UNP) were also
present at the meeting, UNP sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the UNP, of which he was a member, had urged
him to take up full-time politics, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Cooray said he would not let them down.
</P>
<P>
While he does not seek positions he is very keen on pushing
forward the policies initiated by former President Ranasighe
Premadasa, he said. And that is why he is keen on returning to
politics.
</P>
<P>
Former President Premadasa was killed in a powerful bomb blast
by Tamil rebels on May 1, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Assembly In Session in Siem Reap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The 122 new lawmakers,
along with diplomats and some dignitaries, attended the opening
ceremony of the new National Assembly in Siem Reap Thursday at the
residence of King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister and Vice-President of Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) Hun Sen, Prince Ranariddh of the Funcinpec party, and
Sam Rainsy of the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) all attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia held a National Assembly election on July
26. Thirty-nine political parties, 19 more than in the
UN-administered election in 1993, were vying for 122 parliamentary
seats and the right to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
The previous National Assembly of 120 members was elected five
years ago and its tenure expired on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's Assembly is a unicameral body with at least 120
members who are elected every five years by universal direct adult
suffrage. The current Assembly members will be sworn in later at
Angkor Wat, the famous ancient Khmer temple.
</P>
<P>
The ruling CPP of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen won 64 seats in
the election, followed by Prince Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party with
43 seats and Sam Rainsy's self named SRP with 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
A coalition is necessary because, while the CPP has a majority
in parliament, it lacks the two-thirds needed to form a government
of its own.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition Funcinpec party and its ally, the SRP, which
won the remainder of the seats, had boycotted the election results
and the Assembly, claiming there was serious election fraud and
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk stepped in to defuse the crisis when weeks of
opposition anti-Hun Sen protests in the capital erupted into
violence.

<HEADLINE> IMF Calls for India's Medium-Term Fiscal Adjustment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has asked India to launch a medium-term fiscal
adjustment program at both central and state levels and initiate
steps to revive investment and growth.
</P>
<P>
"Reviving the fiscal reform process would help lower real
interest rates, improve debt dynamics, create room for meeting
essential social and infrastructure spending and reduce the drag
on growth," the IMF Executive Board said in its assessment of the
Indian economy.
</P>
<P>
Unproductive expenditures must be cut by curtailing subsidies,
reducing public sector employment and improving cost recovery and
public expenditure management, the paper The Observer of Business
and Politics Thursday quoted the IMF as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IMF cautioned against the Indian government's strategy of
orienting fiscal and monetary policies toward supporting domestic
demand as it could further strain macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern about the lack of any perceptible fiscal
adjustment by various states in India, the IMF stressed that the
states would need to intensify and broaden efforts to lower
deficits and also improve the composition of spending.

<HEADLINE> Italian Senators Hail Great Changes in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tibetans enjoy broad religious
freedom and their living standards have been raised considerably,
an Italian parliamentary delegation said here at the Senate on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The five-member delegation, which ended a 10-day visit last
month, were announcing the findings of their report on their
experiences in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"From what we saw and heard, we can say some Westerners' worry
about Tibet is groundless," said delegation leader Senator Renzo
Gubert.
</P>
<P>
Great changes had taken place since 1959 with industry
developing steadily and construction of highways, airports,
hospitals and schools, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetans enjoy total religious freedom and we saw many people
going to the monasteries without restrictions." he said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet enjoyed more autonomy than other provinces, and about 70
percent of the administrators were Tibetans, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was baseless to say Tibet was now dominated by the Han
people, he argued.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government strongly opposed Tibetan independence,
he noted, but it always kept its doors open to dialogue with
the religious leader, the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"Our delegation is the third of its kind from European
countries which have visited Tibet, this very fact shows that the
Chinese government is open on the issue of Tibet. They welcome
foreigners to Tibet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Delegation member Senator Roberto Lasagna said that their
observations could help them avoid making a wrong judgement on
China.
</P>
<P>
They knew the belief that the Chinese government invaded Tibet
in 1959 was wrong, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Tibetan culture was well protected and it was
absolutely untrue that Tibetan culture had suffered irreparable
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Lasagna, a physician by profession, also noted that traditional
Tibetan medicine was also well protected and patients had freedom
to choose whether they used traditional or western medicine.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks to Congressional Hispanic Caucus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton got a warm expression of support from the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton received two extended standing ovations Wednesday night
when he addressed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's
annual black-tie gala at a Washington hotel.
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for that warm welcome," Clinton said. "But as happy
as I am -- and grateful -- for the reception you gave me, that's
not what this is about. It's about you and your children."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's speech came just two days after his videotaped grand
jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky investigation was televised
and four days after he received a similar warm welcome at the
annual dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
In his address Clinton offered his views on issues of
importance to Hispanics such as bilingual education, immigration,
a minimum wage increase, the use of sampling in the 2000 census, a
referendum on statehood or independence for Puerto Rico and using
the projected budget surplus for preserving Social Security
instead of cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
The dinner culminated a two-day legislative conference in which
members of the caucus addressed many of the issues Clinton
mentioned in his speech. The president said the Hispanic caucus
deserved a large share of the credit for many of his
administration's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the caucus "for being my friend, for standing with
me on sunny days and in strong winds." Vice President Al Gore also
addressed the group.

security reports that sketches of the plant had been found with

</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the National Water Supply Board S. B. Boyagane

No outsider had access to these, he noted.

It was reported that the rebels had purchased sewerage maps
from board employees at exorbitant rates.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the board has drawn up a security dragnet in
consultation with the security establishment.
</P>
<P>
A sophisticated electronic surveillance radio system have been
installed in 17 sewerage pumping stations in Colombo city which
are electronically linked to the vital security installation,
Boyagane said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Relaxes Rules on Export With Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Lao customs
officials have agreed to ease third-party export procedures to
help boost trade between the two countries, the newspaper Bangkok
Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To ease procedures and expedite trade, officials agreed to cut
the number of product categories requiring prior approval and
screening for re-export from five to two.
</P>
<P>
Cigarette and liquor will continue to require special
examination and documentation for reshipment. Electric goods, gold
and watches have been removed from the list.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, goods worth 9.86 billion baht
(246.5 million U.S. dollars) were re-exported to Laos through
Thailand last year, an increase of 15 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of this year, goods exported through
Thailand to Laos totaled 6.86 billion baht (171.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials said such trade is expected to increase in the
future. Most goods sent to Laos through Thailand originate from
other countries in the region, such as Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said special examination is needed to ensure
that goods coming into the country for reshipment are actually
re-exported to Laos, rather than consumed by the local market and
thus result in a loss of tax revenue for both countries.
</P>
<P>
As the two countries agreed, Lao officials will issue
certificates of landing to Thai custom officials once goods enter
Laos.

<HEADLINE> Western China Faces Fourth Development Opportunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Western China is expecting
its fourth opportunity for development, with attention focused on
developing a knowledge-based economy with the cooperation of
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Michel Oksenberg, a Chinese affairs specialist and professor at
Stanford University, made this remark at a symposium on
Sino-U.S. Intellectual Property Rights and Economic Development in
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that though the development of China's coastal areas is
important, history has demonstrated that the coastal area
cannot independently guarantee the prosperity, stability and
unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
The western regions of China have played a very important role
in the development of the country ever since the Warring States
Period (475 B.C.-221 B.C).
</P>
<P>
He said western China has witnessed three strategic
developments during the 20th century: the first in the 1940s when
military industries were set up in the southwest and northwest,
enabling China to win the War of Resistance Against Japan; the
second occurred during the first Five-Year Plan period
(1953-1957) when China shifted many important industries to inland
areas; and the third was the relocation of many national defence
enterprises into inland areas in the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
Oksenberg has been studying China since the 1960s and has
written books including "China: The Convulsive Society," "China
and America: Past and Future," "Policy Making in China: Leaders,
Structure, and Process" and "China's Participation in the IMF,
the World Bank, and GATT: Toward a Global Economic Order."
</P>
<P>
He said China now is making greater efforts to develop the
western part of the country. What is different from the previous
three developments is that China now aims to make its development
a part of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
He said economic growth and development still have a way to go,
and that foreign trade, foreign investment and foreign
technological transfer stimulated China's economic growth, which
has been faster in the coastal areas than the inland areas. An the
inland areas have developed faster than the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, China's inland areas have many
advantages such as a profound traditional culture, rich natural
resources and higher bank savings deposits. So there is every
reason for the world to have confidence in the development of
western China, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Implement CTBT Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced Wednesday that his government
has tabled legislation to implement the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The legislation, called the CTBT Implementation Act, will allow
Canada to maintain its leadership in nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament issues by being among the first to ratify the treaty,
according to a government news release.
</P>
<P>
"The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty establishes a global
norm against nuclear testing for all nations, even those that may
not immediately join," Axworthy was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by Canada in September 1996, recognizes that
halting all nuclear test explosions is an effective measure to
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The new act authorizes Canadian government departments, such as
foreign affairs and international trade institutions, to carry out
tasks required under the treaty, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
The act prohibits persons from causing, encouraging or
participating in a nuclear weapon test explosion or any other
nuclear explosion for purposes of developing nuclear weapons.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- American special envoy to
the Balkans Robert Gelbard said Wednesday in Banjaluka that the
new leader in Bosnia-Herzegovina must observe the Dayton Peace
Agreement seriously to maintain peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said after talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina President
Biljana Plavssich and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik that the
U.S. will make great efforts to safeguard the country's integrity.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was ready to cooperate in the general election with
moderate presidency candidate Zzivko Radissich, Gelbard said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. would run into trouble with hardline
candidate Nikola Poplassen, the prospective president, he said,
urging that Poplassen must implement the Dayton Peace Agreement
seriously and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

VIENNA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party
Chairman Gennady Zyuganov said here Wednesday that stability in
Europe also depends on Russia's stability.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has sought ways to resolve its political
crisis, but the financial and social situation is still very
serious.
</P>
<P>
Some persons are critical of the military autocracy in Russia.
Zyuganov said the military dictatorship would not only cause the
disintegration of Russia, but could also bring disaster upon
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia needs new policies which will be in keeping with the
aspirations of people and the country's interest.
</P>
<P>
It is of significance that Russia expand economic and trade
relations with Western countries, especially now that winter is
coming. The party chairman said the winter season would be a
hungry winter for most parts of Russia. He asked Austria to
provide some economic help.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov arrived here Wednesday for a brief visit. He met with
the president of the Austrian National Council, Heinz Fischer, and
Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Promotes Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is an agro-based
country with its agricultural production contributing 36 percent
of the national gross domestic product (GDP) and 35 percent of the
export.
</P>
<P>
About 11.51 million people or 62.68 percent of the total
employees in the country's productive sectors are engaged in
agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
As the agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country's
economy, the government has been taking various measures to boost
the sector's development.
</P>
<P>
As increase of investment is vital for agricultural
development, the government has been investing more in the sector
over the years.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, the total
agricultural investment in the 1997-98 fiscal year, which ended in
March, amounted to 116 million U.S. dollars, 36 million dollars
more than the previous year and 107 million dollars more than the
previous five years.
</P>
<P>
The government disbursed agricultural loans of 1.75 billion
dollars to farmers in the year, rising by 100 million dollars over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To enable farmers to grow in time the state-needed seasonal
industrial crops, the government also gives advance payment to the
farmers every year.
</P>
<P>
The government also has introduced foreign investment into the
sector since opening the country's door to the outside world in
late 1988, getting 14.35 million dollars by the end of June this
year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has expanded cultivated land with sown area under crops
reaching 12.51 million hectares in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
189,540 hectares more than the previous year. In this respect, the
country also leased out a total of 14,692 hectares of land to 108
private enterprises in the year, increasing by 8,297 hectares over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To ensure harvest in agriculture, Myanmar has increased
building of irrigation facilities which are vital for
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 such facilities including dams and reservoirs
have been built since 1988, irrigating nearly 546,750 hectares.
</P>
<P>
To give farmers incentives in farming, the government has
raised purchasing prices for their agricultural products
especially paddy, one of the four main crops in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In the two decades between the 1950s and the 1960s, the price
of paddy remained at 60 dollars per 100 baskets (2,090 kilograms).
The price began rising in the 1970s, reaching 150 dollars and has
kept on soaring in the last few years, to the present 250 dollars.
</P>
<P>
On technical cultivation, the government pays special attention
to research on high quality yield of crops, carrying out
experiment on local and foreign quality seeds. Other related
techniques are also disseminated to farmers.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Myanmar began in April implementation of a
five-year seed bank project in Yezin, central Pyinmana, with the
aid of Japan under the two countries' technical cooperation
program.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also cooperating with foreign countries in the
development of its agriculture sector. It reached agreement with
neighboring India on the exchange of quality strains and sending
of Myanmar trainees to research centers and universities in India
and of delegations for the development of agricultural techniques.
</P>
<P>
To mechanize its agriculture, Myanmar has been encouraging
farmers to widely use both locally-produced and imported
agricultural implements, establishing so far 23 model mechanized
agricultural villages in the country.
</P>
<P>
To boost mechanization, the country's manufacturing sector is
also giving first priority to the production of farm machinery
and equipment, designating agricultural implements as one of the
14 first-priority goods for import.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the measures taken, Myanmar's agriculture grew by 2.9
percent in output value in the 1997-98 fiscal year despite flash
floods and drought during the fiscal year in some areas. The
country's paddy production in the year was 17.3 million tons, up
from 14.8 million tons in the 1992-93 fiscal year.

WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong and U.S. President Bill Clinton met at the White
House on Wednesday, focusing on the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
They discussed capital controls and the situation in Indonesia,
one of the Asian countries suffering from the financial meltdown
that began in Thailand in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We focused on the Asian financial crisis that's on everybody's
mind," Goh told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He warned other countries in the region against following
Malaysia's decision to impose capital controls, saying this was a
short-term solution.
</P>
<P>
"There's a danger some countries may begin to have capital
controls. Malaysia has started and others may follow suit if the
Malaysian way of managing the economic problems succeeds in the
short-term," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
"The danger is whether the short-term management of a problem
becomes long term. We discussed all that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Goh said he and Clinton also discussed the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting scheduled for November
in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Chess Players Leave for Olympiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Xie
Jun spearheaded the Chinese chess delegation to compete in the
33rd Chess Olympiad slated for September 26 in Elista, Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation was to leave here Thursday for the
biennial chess gala which saw the first men's tournament
inaugurated in 1927 and the women's edition initiated 30 years
later.
</P>
<P>
The four-member Chinese women delegation fields in the same
squad that won the silver medal in the last Olympiad, which
includes, apart from women's world champion Xie Jun, twice world
junior champion Zhu Cheng, candidate for world champion
challenger Wang Pin and Universiade champion Wang Lei.
</P>
<P>
Although they lag behind reigning champion Georgia and third
place finisher Russia in ranking points, the Chinese women
players still aim to snatch the world title by vowing to play to
their best.
</P>
<P>
In the men's tournament, China dispatches its youngest squad
since its first attendance in 1978 with an average age of 24 for
the Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men squad has three international grand masters
Peng Xiaomin, Zhang Zhong and Ye Jiangchuan who also serves as
coach of former world champion Xie Jun, two international masters
Wu Wenjin and Yu Shaoteng and master Wang Rui.
</P>
<P>
Among the Chinese men players, Wu Wenjin, Yu Shaoteng and Wang
Rui will make their debuts in the coming Olympiad, hoping to
fully display their witts and gutts to achieve satisfactory
scores in the world chess arena.
</P>
<P>
The Chess Olympiad is the highest and largest international
meet chaired by the International Chess Federation, with the
registration of competitors from 122 countries and regions for
the showcase of the year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say China's Flooding Caused By Worsening Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say that
the catastrophic flooding in China this summer was caused by
global climate changes and damage to the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The excessive felling of trees along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River for the past several decades has led to soil erosion
in the area along the river and can be blamed for the flooding of
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, a natural reservoir for the Yangtze River in
Hunan Province, has become 40 percent smaller since the 1950s as a
result of silting, and government officials and researchers
believe that it's high time for China to put more emphasis on
environmental protection after having studied the flood-ravaged
areas.
</P>
<P>
Yangtze River Resources Committee researchers say that another
important factor is global climate changes, for which humans are
responsible.
</P>
<P>
As global industrialization speeds up, air pollution becomes
worse and the greenhouse effect, solar activities, and ozone layer
impairment have caused more frequent El Nino and La Nina
occurrences, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Chao Jiping, a Chinese Academy of Sciences oceanographer, says
that China's devastating floods were closely related to these
phenomena. Last year's El Nino was the strongest of this century,
and high barometric pressure from subtropical areas moved westward
into China instead of leaving for the south early this spring,
bringing extra precipitation in southern China.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the lowest water level on the Yangtze River,
near Wuhan in January, was 3.47 metres higher than the average,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
In July, the La Nina phenomenon came immediately after El Nino,
preventing the high barometric pressure zone from moving
northward, and bringing additional precipitation.
</P>
<P>
China is affected by Pacific monsoons, and the plateau in
southwestern China keeps away climate moderations from the Indian
Ocean, making China a victim of global climate changes, scientists
say.

<HEADLINE> Transit Passengers to Be Allowed Outside Bangkok Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- From October 1, 1998, transit
passengers eligible for visa-free entry and visa-on-arrival will
be able to travel out of Bangkok Airport for up to 12 hours,
according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
The passengers will be exempted from paying the 500-baht
(12.5-U.S. dollar) passenger service charge when they check in for
their onward connecting flight, said TAT in a press release
available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to yield a bonanza of at least 1 billion
baht (25 million dollars) a year to the government treasury if
each transit traveler spends only 500 baht during their stopover.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a total of 2,147,567 passengers changed flights at
Bangkok's Don Muang International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Though most of them catch onward flights within a few hours, a
sizable number transit for six hours or more, which is normally
enough for them to take a quick tour of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Thai Travel Agents has outlined several tour
programs for transfer tourists to enjoy, such as shopping tour,
scenic city guide or health and beauty tours.
</P>
<P>
The procedures for transit passengers to go out of the airport
are also easy, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
They need only to fill a Passenger Service Charge Exempt
Requesting Form at service units and present it with their
passport, airline ticket and completed arrival/departure card, to
obtain an official stamp before passing immigration at arrival
points.
</P>
<P>
These documents should be kept and presented again upon the
passengers' departure.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Economic Growth to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's economy will only see a
1.7 percent growth rate this year, down from the earlier forecast
of 2.3 percent, a leading research institute predicted on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Prometeia Research Institute was more pessimistic about
growth figures in gross domestic product (GDP) for 1999, revising
its pre-summer forecast of a 2.6 percent increase in GDP to 2.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Prometeia figures, which will be officially released early
next week, represent the most pessimistic estimates so far but
follow the heels of other GDP forecast revisions.
</P>
<P>
On September 9, Prime Minister Romano Prodi issued a government
forecast indicating a two percent increase in GDP, compared to the
2.5 percent contained in the government's three-year Economic and
Financial Planning Document released in the spring.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the employer's association, Confindustria,
revised its forecast down from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the most gloomy forecast up until Prometeia's was issued by
the retailers' association, Confcommercio, which put growth at 1.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has been attributed to the impact of the Asian and
Russian economic crises.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House and Senate
negotiators on Wednesday approved a 250.5-billion-U.S.-dollar
defense spending plan, which is smaller than what President Bill
Clinton and some Republican lawmakers had called for.
</P>
<P>
The spending approved by the lawmakers is 2.8 billion dollars
above the current levels but 485 million dollars below a White
House request.
</P>
<P>
The approval was made after a closed session to work out
differences between House and Senate defense spending plans for
the new fiscal year that starts October 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill -- which accounts for about 15 percent of the
total federal spending -- 70.6 billion dollars would be provided
for military personnel, including a 3.6 percent pay raise; 84
billion dollars for operations and maintenance; and 48.5 billion
dollars for purchasing new weapons and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, President Clinton asked Congress to give the
Pentagon an extra one billion dollars next year to cover spare
parts shortages and other readiness problems and to bolster
long-term budgets to update weapons and keep top-quality personnel.
</P>
<P>
Congress, before adjourning for the year in early October, is
expected to act on legislation to cover unforeseen military
expenses, such as 1.9 billion dollars for peacekeeping operations
in Bosnia and more than one billion dollars for Year 2000 military
computers fixes.
</P>
<P>
The full House and Senate will vote on the plan before Congress
adjourns.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economy to Recover in 2000, Predicts IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The crisis hit Asian economy
should begin to recover in 2000 or 2001, International Monetary
Fund chief Michel Camdessus predicted here Wednesday,
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, the managing director of the IMF, told French radio
that for several Asian countries, excluding Japan, "the worst has
passed".
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth would already have begun to recover if we had
not had a crisis at the heart of the crisis, which is the Japanese
crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Japan was set for recovery in the second half of next year, but
its economy was likely to shrink by 2.5 percent or more this year,
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said Europe is likely to grow slightly less quickly
in 1999 than this year, with an average growth rate of two to
three percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven (G7) countries should play the role of the
engine of world growth because the United States and Europe were
doing well when the rest of the world was in trouble, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turning specifically to Russia, he said the IMF would support
Moscow only if the new Russian cabinet led by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov restored the ruble and budget to health and
restructured frozen domestic debt in a "civilized" way for
creditors.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has suspended all its loan programs, worth 12.5 billion
U.S. dollars this year alone, to Russia until the new government
explains how it plans to steer the country out of the acute
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The IMF was established in December 1945 to promote
international monetary cooperation, to facilitate the expansion
and balanced growth of international trade and promote stability
in foreign trade.

STOCKHOLM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Prime Minister
Goran Persson said Wednesday his minority government will form a
new coalition after winning the support of the Left Party and the
Greens to continue in power.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday
with Birger Schlaug, chairman of the Greens, and Gudrum Schyman,
chairman of the Left Party.
</P>
<P>
He said they had agreed that only a government led by the
Social Democratic Party would be firmly founded in light of the
line-up in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Persson said he was happy with the cooperative attitude of the
two parties and and hoped the cooperation would be a long-term one
during its future four-year mandate.
</P>
<P>
Schlaug and Schyman also expressed their satisfaction with the
talks, saying they were willing to have long-term cooperation with
the minority party.
</P>
<P>
The three sides are expected to continue talks on the country's
economic policies, employment, allocation policies, environment
protection and equal rights for men and women.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's general elections, Persson's Social Democratic
Party remained the largest party in the country with 36.5 percent
of votes and 131 seats in the parliament, but posted its worst
election result in the history of the party.

TAPACHULA, Mexico, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said Wednesday that continuous heavy rains have so
far caused 185 deaths in the southern province of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, visiting Chiapas for the sixth time in the last two

<P>
He said 18 shelters operating in seven municipalities were now
receiving some 5,000 flood victims.
</P>

In order to prevent the spread of dengue and malaria in the
affected areas, a sanitary alert will remain in place until
conditions return to normal, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president, who described the area as a "priority" for the
government, denied reported charges that the administration tried
to conceal the actual numbers of missing or dead in the disaster.

HELSINKI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A Finnish Foreign Ministry

his post, the ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two diplomats at the Russian embassy in Helsinki, who are
believed to be the recipients of the unspecified documents, left
Finland at the end of the summer. One left voluntarily and the

In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed "bewilderment

<HEADLINE> Angry Kersee Attacks FloJo Drug Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The cause of former
Olympic champion Florence Griffith Joyner's death remains a
mystery, and the cause of her record-setting performances in 1988
continues to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office has not completed its
autopsy. More tests could take days or weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
"We unfortunately have no idea why Florence left us," said Bob
Kersee, Griffith Joyner's brother-in-law and former coach.
</P>
<P>
Kersee angrily attacked rumors and speculation that Griffith
Joyner's triumphs at the 1988 Seoul Olympics were aided by
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been anything proven by anybody that Florence
ever used anything illegal to improve her performance," he said.
"It's never been proven by anybody that any athlete I've ever
coached has used illegal drugs."
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is that people who are jealous spread
rumors. Nowadays, you don't have to have any facts for someone to
print bad things about you. In the sporting world, unfortunately,
athletes and organizations play the game of, 'If I can't beat you
one way, then I'm going to beat you the other way.'"
</P>
<P>
Kersee is married to Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
the sister of Al Joyner, Griffith Joyner's husband. Kersee said
the family continues to be mystified by the sudden death of
Griffith Joyner, 38, who apparently died in her sleep Monday
morning. "There were no signs whatsoever that Florence was ill,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Eager to See Psychiatric Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nevada boxing authorities
have given the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson a list of
three facilities where he must undergo a psychiatric examination
and have set a deadline of Monday for the doctors to submit r
eports on Tyson's mental state.
</P>
<P>
If Tyson is cleared by the doctors, the Nevada Athletic
Commission is expected to give the former heavyweight champion a
new boxing license on October 3.
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to go see doctors, but he's eager to get his
license back," Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson gets his choice of being examined at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston or
C.F. Menninger Memorial Hospital in Topeka, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The examination was ordered by the commission following
Saturday's six-hour hearing on Tyson's request for returning to
the ring.
</P>
<P>
The commission sent a letter to Tyson and his advisers, saying
the team of doctors evaluating him must include a psychologist, a
psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist. The boxer must be given
comprehensive neuropsychological testing as well as an MRL of the
brain and a complete drug screen.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the commission wants the doctors who evaluate
Tyson to look at videotape of his fight against Holyfield as well
as from post-fight interviews and license reinstatement hearings
in New Jersey and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
Finkel said he was trying to find out which of the three
facilities do all the testing required by the commission and
whether he could get three doctors to come to Las Vegas on
October 3 to be questioned by the commission.
</P>
<P>
If Tyson regains his license, he would like to fight a ranked
opponent, a stronger fighter then Peter McNeeley, Tyson's first
comeback rival after released from prison in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"You want credibility in the person he fights," Finkel said.
"We're looking for a rated opponent."
</P>
<P>
If Tyson is allowed to return to the ring, he is expected to
fight in late November or early December in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Finkel predicted the fight will be bigger than Tyson's
comeback against McNeeley, in which he got a 25 million dollars
purse. However, the money was split in half by payments he had
to make to promoter Don King and his co-managers.

<P>
TIANJIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Economic and
Technological Development Zone, four kilometers from the port of
Tianjin, has become a popular investment site and an economic
powerhouse in this north China port city.
</P>
<P>
The zone, founded 14 years ago on a stretch of salt marshes, is
now home to 3,026 overseas-financed businesses involving a total
investment of over 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,800 overseas-backed companies are now operational, said
Pi Qiansheng, head of the management committee for the Tianjin
Economic and Technological Zone.
</P>
<P>
A number of multinational corporations including Motorola, Coca
Cola, Samsung, and Novo Nordisk have been expanding their
operations in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Motorola of the United States, which has already pumped 1.1
billion U.S. dollars into the zone, will expand production
there by increasing its investment to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Pi attributed the growing appeal of the development zone to an
improved investment environment, adherence to standard
international practices, and full use of the privileges bestowed
for piloting the socialist market economy.

<HEADLINE> Farmer-Operated Inns Springing Up in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nowadays foreign travelers no
longer worry about where to pass a warm night in the countryside
of the Tibet Autonomous Region as hundreds of inns run by local
farmers are now springing up everywhere.
</P>
<P>
These small hotels have attracted a great many foreigners
with their pure Tibetan style and good service.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet has charming scenery and this Tibetan inn is very
comfortable," says an Australian visitor to Tibet, who is staying
at the Khahu Inn run by Tsethri, a local farmer in Tingri County.
</P>
<P>
Tsethri and his family used to lead a poor farming life. But
his fate changed after he got a bank loan of 25,000 yuan and
opened a three-room inn nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tsethri opened his small hotel on the roadside of the
Sino-Nepalese Highway, the so-called "golden tourism route"
linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
With the number of tourists going to Tibet increasing every
year, Tsethri's business is becoming booming, and his inn
now has 15 rooms and 44 beds.
</P>
<P>
"More than 1,000 foreigners stay at our hotel every year,"
Tsethri's mother Nyma says with a broad smile, adding that they
have paid off their loan. Their yearly earnings from the hotel
is now 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
For Pemba from Quxia Village in Pasum Township the hotel
business has brought his family greater income to go along with
their earnings from farming and cattle and sheep raising.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Pemba earns more than 20,000 yuan from the hotel
which stands along the very road leading to Mount Qomolangma
(Everest). "In the past, we led a poor life at the foot of
Qomolangma," he recalls.
</P>
<P>
Pemba's family now lives in a two-story house equipped with a
solar heater, a refrigerator and color TV.
</P>
<P>
More Tibetan farmers are taking advantage of the flourishing
tourism industry, and currently, there are 300 to 400 country inns
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Tibet received 82,000 foreign
tourists last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nigerian Leader to Pursue Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton urged visiting Nigerian leader Abdulsalami Abubakar on
Wednesday to continue his country's transition to democracy, a
U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Abubakar met for about 30 minutes at the White
House, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The president expressed his support for General Abubakar's
efforts. He stressed how important Nigeria's transition to
democracy is for all of Africa," the U.S. official said. "This is
a moment that must be seized."
</P>
<P>
After Nigeria's late dictator Sani Abacha died in June,
Abubakar and Nigeria's ruling generals created a commission to
oversee preparations for a return to civilian rule next May.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Washington had no current plans to lift its military and other
sanctions on Nigeria, but he suggested the issue would be under
consideration as Nigeria moved toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
"It is something we need to review as appropriate in the
context of this transition," the official said. "We are not at a
decision point currently."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the Clinton-Abubakar meeting, the
White House hinted it might offer closer ties to Nigeria if the
African country carried out democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The president expressed his strong appreciation for the
efforts of General Abubakar to progress toward a new era of
democracy, respect for human rights, and stability, which will
lead to further expansion of our bilateral relations," it said.
</P>
<P>
After Abacha seized power in 1993, Washington imposed a series
of sanctions on Lagos, which included limiting military sales,
banning direct air links, and restricting visas for senior
Nigerian officials.

<HEADLINE> International Conference On Vehicle Theft Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The international conference on
"Insurance Fraud, Theft and the Illegal Traffic in Motor Vehicles"
concluded here on Wednesday with agreements on broader cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The conference, convened on Monday, reached agreements on
building closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities,
insurance companies and other relevant bodies and organizations at
the national and international levels in various countries.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 20 European countries, the United States and
Canada decided to organize similar international conference on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Concluding recommendations show the conference approved the
initiative of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry, which also received
the support of Interpol, for the second international forum to be
held again in Sofia in the second half of September 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to recommendations, customs authorities and auto
manufacturers should make more thorough presentations at the next
conference.
</P>
<P>
Interpol's database will be expanded by attracting other
participating countries and their investigative agencies.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommends conventions, agreements and other
accords to create uniform legislation throughout different
countries in the fight against auto insurance fraud, theft and
illegal trafficking in motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The conference was useful because of the opportunity it
provided to establish contacts with colleagues in European
countries. These personal contacts will facilitate future
operations, a Bulgarian participant and representative of the
Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Interpol has more than 1.1 million stolen cars registered as of
September 1, according to Interpol Secretary-General Raymond
Kendall, who was also a participant in the conference.
</P>
<P>
Most of the stolen cars originated in Germany, followed by
several East European countries. Bulgaria is the sixth on the
list. The country has become one of the channels for transiting
and selling cars stolen from Western Europe to the markets of the
former Soviet Union and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, Bulgarian authorities arrested three car-theft
rings and 38 criminal groups. About 687 stolen cars were found and
20 luxury cars from Canada were also confiscated, said
Kendall.

<P>
With a planned area of 33 square kilometers, the Tianjin
Economic and Technological Development Zone is the largest
development zone in the country.
</P>
<P>
The zone has so far invested 7 billion yuan for infrastructure
construction on 40 square kilometers of reclaimed land, 22 of
which are inside the development zone and the remainder in the
Hangu and Xiqing districts and Wuqing County. Also, 30 billion
yuan has been invested in fixed assets on the reclaimed land where
buildings with a combined floor space of three million square
meters have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the four major industries of electronics,
bio-pharmaceuticals, precision machinery, and foodstuffs, the
Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone consists of
many industrial parks, and it has been expanding at an average
annual economic growth rate of 60 percent, according to Pi.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Special Economic Zones Office of the State
Council also shows that the Tianjin Zone has led the country's 32
state-level development zones in 14 major economic indicators
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the zone produced 8.84 billion
yuan in gross domestic product (GDP), produced 24.85 billion yuan
worth of industrial goods, exported commodities valued at 1.04
billion U.S. dollars and generated 1.33 billion yuan in tax
revenue, Pi said.
</P>
<P>
Pi added that by the year 2000, the development zone, 45 kilometers
from the city of Tianjin proper, will have a contractual inflow of
11 billion U.S. dollars in overseas investment, and 25 billion yuan
in domestic investment. By then, it will be able to produce 117
billion yuan worth of manufactured goods and generate 43 billion
yuan of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Wins 30th Confidence Vote in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government won its
30th confidence vote in parliament Wednesday, forcing through tax
collection reforms it sees essential to realize the revenue in the
1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The reforms involve a tightening up of the tax collection
system, which, according to the government's draft budget, will
garner four trillion lire (2.35 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco said the confidence vote was
necessary to get the reforms in place in time to bear fruit in the
1999 accounts.
</P>
<P>
"There was not enough time for the law to return to the lower
house", he said in a speech before the vote in the Senate.
Normally the measures would have had a second reading in both
houses before being passed into law.
</P>
<P>
Visco said the planned changes in tax collection procedures
were "an important part of the wider reform of the fiscal system,"
which he had been pursuing since the center-left government of
Romano Prodi came to power.
</P>
<P>
"This measure, which is tied to the budget, accelerates tax
collection rather than introducing new taxes", he added.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in several years the government's budget
bill for 1999, which aims to squeeze an extra 13.5 trillion lire
(7.94 billion dollars) out of state accounts, contains no new
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The government won the confidence vote with 160 in favour and
99 against. There was a clean divide between parties supporting
the government on the one side and the opposition on the other.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 600,000
Colombian state employees Wednesday started a nationwide two-day
strike to protest against the government's economic policies and

<HEADLINE> Apples, Money-earner For Northern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Apples have become the leading
money-earner for Shaanxi Province, bringing 8 billion yuan (963.8
million US dollars) a year to the loess plateau of northern China.
</P>
<P>
The province has 533,000 hectares of apple trees, making it
China's second largest apple-grower, after Shandong
Province. Large-scale apple tree planting started in the mid-1980s
and has fundamentally changed the life of farmers who for
generations relied on small-scale grain production on barren land.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tianlai, a 62-year-old farmer, got enough money from his
0.4 hectare orchard to build a three-story house and put thousands
of yuan in banks, and he is just one of the farmers in the arid,
hilly area north of the Wei River who were able to get away from
poverty when the area became a major apple producer.
</P>
<P>
The over 27 million farmers in Shaanxi farmers get an average
of 157 yuan from apples, and the per capita profits of farmers
near the Wei is as high as 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
One apple storage and transport company has 10 million yuan in
assets and caters to the international market, providing 50
million kilograms of apples a year, and one apple juice company
has an annual output of 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, fresh apples were worth 6.1 billion yuan, apple storage
1.2 billion yuan, and packing and processing 600 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese International Scores in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese international Fan
Zhiyi, who joined the English club Crystal Palace this summer,
scored his first goal in three matches, helping the club beat
Bury 2-1 Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Clinton Morrison went from hero to zero with a goal
at either end as Palace failed to elbow a way into the third
round of the English League Worthington Cup.
</P>
<P>
Crystal Palace lost the second round first leg 3-0 to Bury,
which advanced with an aggregate score of 4-2.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, a 19-year-old local boy making his first start for
the club and only his seventh appearance, gave them a dream
opening in the eighth minute.
</P>
<P>
Hayden Mullins threaded the ball out to the right of the Bury
area from where the youngster cut in to finish superbly with a
shot across and into the goal.
</P>
<P>
Morrison's joy lasted only 17 minutes. Palace's Rob Matthews
sent over a long swerving corner which the defending striker
sliced into his own net.
</P>
<P>
At the 77th minute, Chinese midfielder Fan Zhiyi shot from 10
yards, which made the score at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese player Sun Jihai, who also plays for Crystal
Palace, was sidelined due to ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
Premier league Southampton's unhappy start to the season
gathered pace on the day when they were dumped out of the English
League Cup by second division Fulham.
</P>
<P>
Southampton, bottom of the league, had former England defender
Carlton Palmer sent off as they stumbled to a 1-0 defeat in the
home leg of their second round tie.
</P>
<P>
Dirk Lehmann earned Fulham a 2-1 aggregate win with a strike
after just 10 minutes. Palmer was shown the red card after
clashing with Lehmann in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
The three other premier league sides in action made it through
to the third round but Tottenham and Everton did not have things
all their own way.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham started badly against third division Brentford,
falling behind to an Andy Scott goal after just 52 seconds to
make the aggregate score 3-3.
</P>
<P>
Allan Nielsen settled the premier league side's nerves with a
24th minute equaliser, central defender Sol Campbell put them 2-1
ahead on the night with a diving header in the 46th minute and
Chris Armstrong added a third after seven minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Owusu scored a second for Brentford in the 74th minute
but Spurs held on to win 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Everton, reduced to 10 men in the 70th minute of their home
leg against Huddersfield, fell behind after just 44 seconds
against the first division leaders. Marcus Stewart put
Huddersfield 2-1 ahead on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Everton equalised through Frenchman Olivier Dacourt's 25-meter
free kick in the 29th minute and Marco Materazzi put them 3-2
ahead on aggregate three minutes before halftime.
</P>
<P>
But they faced a difficult final 20 minutes after Materazzi
was dismissed for an off-the-ball incident.
</P>
<P>
A 27th minute Paulo Wanchope goal gave premier league Derby a
1-0 away win over second division Manchester City and a 2-1
aggregate triumph.
</P>
<P>
Holders Chelsea enter the competition in the next round.

Most older software was written with two-digit date fields that
are likely to read the "00" in 2000 as "1900" and therefore, fail
to make correct calculations. Companies and government agencies
worldwide have been scrambling to fix such software or to scrap it
altogether and implement new systems.

With less than 500 days left to the year 2000, EDS said, people
need to be working together to address this issue. "This tool
(Vendor 2000) will allow many to jump start compliance efforts
whether it be governments, businesses or consumers," it said.
</P>
<P>
At an EDS press conference Monday, John Koshinen, chairman of
U.S. President's Council on Year 2000, said: "Information and the
exchange of information is a critical part of being able to
remediate Y2K problems worldwide." The Council will have a link
from its Web site to the Vendor 2000 site within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
EDS is not the only company to launch such a Web site. A newly
launched "Y2K today" service is designed to provide current news,
opinions and analysis as well as status reports and strategies for
year 2000 progress and compliance.
</P>
<P>
Both this and EDS sites are intended to provide a forum for
discussions. Vendor 2000 will allow users of various products to
post comments regarding testing procedures and implementation of
products.

EDS, which employs 110,000 people, serves clients in 45
countries and reported revenues of 15.2 billion U.S. dollars in

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Winter Olympics Budget to be Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organizing Committee
of the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics will reveal its 1
billion-plus US dollars budget on Thursday, according to a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The committee's board of trustees is expected to vote on the
proposed spending package during a meeting schedulted for October
8. SLOC's executive board was given a preview of the 45-volume
budget plan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Putting on the Olympics is a very large project," SLOC
chairman Robert Garff, a local car dealer and former state
legislator, said after Wednesday's meeting. "I think the
executive board was impressed with the depth of the work by the
staff."
</P>
<P>
Following earlier budget sessions with SLOC's budget
committee, Alan Layton, committee chairman and head of a
construction company, said: "We're not putting on a country fair
and we're not planning the Normandy invasion. But it's a lot
closer to the Normandy invasion."
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake spending plan covers 42 functions, such as
medical services or security, 200-plus projects, like the torch
relay, 400 subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as three
planting.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, taxpayers have already been docked
59 million US dollars to build Olympic venues.
</P>
<P>
Constructions are going on at Utah Winter Sports Park, the
speedskating oval in Kearns and the cross-country and biathlon
courses at Wasatch Mountain State Park.
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget includes repayment of the 59 million
dollars and sets aside a 40 million dollars endowment to pay for
site operations after the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
The first budget organizers drafted was in 1989 for 400
million dollars and the latest revision in 1996 ranged from 920
million to 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The earlier budget predicted SLOC would gain 920 million
dollars from television rights, corporate sponsorships and ticket
sales. The estimated value of donated goods and services ranged
from 266 million to 336 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the 1998 Winter Games in Japan said they broke
even on their 956 million dollars budget.

<HEADLINE> Flo-Jo Family Gets Angry with Drug Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The sudden death of
Florence Griffith Joyner caused speculation that the former
Olympic champion may have used performance enhancing drugs, but
her family denied angryly that she took any drugs.
</P>
<P>
"How would you feel if someone was spreading false rumors
about you and your daughter had to read about this?" Bob Kersee,
Griffith Joyner's former coach, said Tuesday. Griffith Joyner was
the mother of a 7-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who blazed down the track to set a fabulous
world record of 10.49 seconds in the 100 meters, and created
another world record in the 200 meters at Seoul Olympics in 1988,
died early Monday in her sleep at age of 38.
</P>
<P>
Autopsy tests were continuing. Greg Foster, a three-time world
champion in the 110-meter hurdles, said he was told by her family
that Griffith Joyner died of a heart problem.
</P>
<P>
Although she never failed a drug test, accusations that she
used performance-enhancing drugs had been leveled against her in
the past. Her surprising death renewed such talks.
</P>
<P>
In belgium the chairman of the International Olympic
Committee's medical commission said today that the sprinter was
subjected to rigorous examination at the 1988 games and passed
every test.
</P>
<P>
"So there should not be the slightest suspicion," Prince
Alexandre de Merode said. "Let her rest in peace. The issue is
closed."
</P>
<P>
Her sister-in-law, Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
urged everyone to wait for the autopsy findings and said it was
inappropriate to speculate.
</P>
<P>
Bob Kersee said Griffith Joyner had no history of heart
troubles. "She only suffered from exercise-induced asthma and
migraine headaches."
</P>
<P>
In 1989, U.S. sprinter Darrell Robinson said in the German
magazine Stern that he bought banned growth hormones for Griffith
Joyner. Robinson was paid 25,000 US dollars for his interview
with the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner had denied Robinson's charge, calling him a
"compulsive, crazy, lying lunatic."
</P>
<P>
Arne Ljungqvist, vice president of the International Amateur
Athletics Federation and the organization's top anti-drug
official, said it would be unfair to speculate about Griffith
Joyner and performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
"It's very unfortunate for sport if one is accused of doping
just for being an extremely good athlete," he said.
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

MADRID, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Spain defeated Russia 1-0 in
a soccer friendly in Granada on Wednesday, awarding Jose Antonio
Camacho his first victory in his first outing as coach of the
national squad.
</P>
<P>
Bittor Alkiza scored the lone goal in the 39th minute with a
curving left foot shot from outside the box.
</P>
<P>
Camacho had included seven changes in the squad with three new
faces, including Alkiza in an aim to wipe out the sad memories as
Spain was recently defeated by Cyprus 3-2 and kicked out of the
first round in the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Against a capacity stadium, the Russians failed to take full
advantage when defender Sergi Barjuan was sent off in the 26th
minute for a bungled block in front of the Spanish goal.
</P>
<P>
A diving save from Santiago Canizares prevented Alexander
Mostovoi from converting the penalty.

Down to 10 men, Spain sealed the final scoreline when Alkiza
scored six minutes before the break.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Kosovo Issue Internal Matter of FRY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- "China has always been
of the view that the question of Kosovo is an internal matter of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)" and "the question of
Kosovo should and can only be solved by the Yugoslavian people
themselves," a senior Chinese diplomat said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the remarks at the formal consultations by the
Security Council on a draft resolution on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"An ultimate solution can only be chosen by the Yugoslavian
people themselves," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the position of the Government of FRY for a
settlement of the Kosovo issue through unconditional dialogue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Kosovo region is now stabilizing, and
there is no large-scale armed conflict, still less than any
escalation of the conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of FRY has also taken a series of positive
measures to encourage the refugees to return home and provide
facilities for humanitarian relief of work," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "at the same time, we are gravely
concerned about the act," as pointed out in the September 4 report
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, "of blocking the return of
refugees for political purposes and prolonging the humanitarian
crisis so as to keep the attention of the international community
in this region."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the international community should look at
the current situation in Kosovo as it really is and evaluating
the positive efforts by the Government of FRY in an objective
and just manner," he said, "We do not see the situation in
Kosovo as a threat to international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to reiterate here that many countries in the FRY
region are multi-ethnic," he said, "If the Security Council is to
get involved in a dispute without the request from countries
concerned, or go even further as to unfairly apply pressure on or
threaten actions against the government of the country concerned,
it will create a bad precedent and have wider negative
implications."
</P>
<P>
On the draft resolution, Qin said that it "has not taken into
full consideration in Kosovo and the legitimate rights of FRY
within its sphere of sovereignty, and has invoked Chapter 7 of
the U.N. Charter all too indiscreetly to threaten FRY."
</P>
<P>
"This will not help bring about a fundamental settlement of
the Kosovo issue," he said, "It may, on the contrary, reinforce
the separatist and terrorist forces in the region and intensify
the tension there."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "the Chinese delegation can not support the draft
resolution before us and will abstain," Qin added.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, a province of Serbia within the FRY, where ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's 2 million
people, seek independence from Yugoslavia. The conflict broke
out in February this year.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan to talk on Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan on
Wednesday agreed to resume their peace dialogue on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a statement issued after a meeting
between Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif at a New York hotel.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of government agreed during their luncheon talks
that their foreign secretaries would open talks on a number of
issues, including Jammu and Kashmir in Islamabad October 15-18,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They reaffirmed their common belief that an environment of
durable peace and security was in the supreme interest of both
India and Pakistan, and of the region as a whole," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed that the peaceful settlement of all outstanding
issues, including Jammu and Kashmir was essential for this
purpose," it added.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee and Sharif are also said to be willing to talk about
the disarmament issue after their countries' nuclear tests in May.
The tests drew international condemnations and a call for their
signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told reporters on his way to New York to attend the
53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly that India would sign
the CTBT as a nuclear weapon power only its conditions are
fulfilled, but he did not specify the conditions.
</P>
<P>
India has firmly rejected deadlines the United States has been
trying to set for New Delhi to sign CTBT by attempting to link it
to President Bill Clinton's visit to India, Press Trust of India
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is scheduled to speak at the U.N. session on Thursday,
a day after Sharif did.
</P>
<P>
Sharif told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that
Pakistan is prepared to adhere to the CTBT before the Conference
of States Parties to the CTBT is held in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
"However, Pakistan's adherence to the Treaty will take place
only in conditions free from coercion or pressure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told Clinton on Monday that Pakistan had no objection in
principle to signing the CTBT but wanted the United States to
waive economic sanctions first.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Ceasefire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council
on Wednesday adopted a resolution on Kosovo issue, threatening
with "further action and additional measures to maintain or
restore peace and stability in the region." China abstained from
voting.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is taken for the first time under Chapter 7 of
the U.N. Charter, which makes compliance mandatory. The resolution
said that "The deterioration of the situation in Kosovo, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), constitutes a threat to
peace and security in the region."
</P>
<P>
Shortly before his abstention from voting, Qin Huansun, Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, said that the
draft resolution, which failed to take into full consideration the
situation in Kosovo and the legitimate rights of FRY within its
sphere of sovereignty, will not help bring about a fundamental
settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"It may, on the contrary, reinforce the separatist and
terrorist forces in the region and intensify the tension there,"
said the Chinese envoy, who said the Kosovo issue is an internal
matter of the FRY, and the international community should
refrain from involvement into the question.
</P>
<P>
"If the Security Council is to get involved in a dispute
without the request from countries concerned, or go even further
as to unfairly apply pressure on or threaten actions against the
government of the country concerned, it will create a bad
precedent and have wider negative implications," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called upon all parties, groups and individuals
to "immediately cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire in
Kosovo, which would enhance the prospects for a meaningful
dialogue between the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership and reduce the risks
of a humanitarian catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged the FRY authorities and the Kosovo
Albanian leadership "to enter immediately into a meaningful
dialogue without preconditions and with international involvement,
and to a clear timetable, leading to an end of the crisis and to a
negotiated political solution to the issue of Kosovo, and welcomes
the current efforts aimed at facilitating such a dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called for an end to all action by the
security forces affecting the civilian population and order the
withdrawal of security units used for civilian repression.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, reiterating the commitment of all Security
Council to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY,
endorsed the steps taken to establish effective international
monitoring of the situation in Kosovo, a province in Serbia of the
FRY.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided, if necessary, to "consider
further action and additional measures to maintain or restore
peace and stability in the region," according to the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is seen giving green lights to the NATO, which
has hammered out a contingency plans in response to what it said
the deteriorating situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with an area of more than 100,000 square kilometers and
a population of 2 million, is a province in Serbia of the FRY.
Ethnic Albanians, making up 90 percent of the province's
population, have demanded independence of Kosovo. The conflict
broke out in February this year in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Everton Signs Tranmere Goalkeeper at Record Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Everton set a British record
fee for a goalkeeper after signing Tranmere's 19-year-old Steve
Simonsen at a price of 3.3 million pounds (about 5.5 million U.S.
dollars) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The England under-21 keeper's switch across the Mersey River
from first division Tranmere to Goodison Park -- with Graham
Allen going the other way as part of the deal -- breaks the
previous record of 2.25 million pounds (3.78 million U.S.
dollars) when Nigel Martyn moved from Crystal Palace to Leeds in
July 1996.
</P>
<P>
"It is a dream move for me. It is a big club and the players
here are brilliant," said Simonsen, who was born in South
Shields, north-east England and who won't be 20 until next April
3.
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of top class internationals and hopefully we
will be a team that can get up amongst the top dogs in the
Premier league", Simonsen said on Everton's Clubcall.
</P>
<P>
Simonsen's arrival is sure to put pressure on current Everton
No. 1 Thomas Myhre. But Simonsen believes it will be difficult
to dislodge the Norwegian international.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Thomas has been brilliant since he came to the club
and he will be great competition. I think he is looking forward
to it as much as I am."
</P>
<P>
The move represents a meteroric rise for the player who was
Tranmere's third choice keeper at the start of last season.
</P>
<P>
After breaking into the team last November, Simonsen kept his
place until the end of the season and kept seven clean sheets in
cup and league matches between December and January. He has been
capped Under-18 and Under-21 level by England.

<HEADLINE> Crystal Palace Sets Sights on Sheringham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- English First Division club
Crystal Palace chairman Mark Goldberg confirmed Wednesday his
interest in buying England striker Teddy Sheringham.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg is determined to reverse Palace's dismal performance
in the First Division, with last Saturday's 4-0 defeat at
Barnsley leaving them with just seven points from seven league
games.
</P>
<P>
Despite more than half a dozen new signings over the summer,
Goldberg is prepared to fund even more purchases in the wake of
the recent sales of Hermann Hreidarsson and Neil Shipperley.
</P>
<P>
He is also understood to be open to offers for utility player
Paul Warhurst and Italian striker Michele Padovano.
</P>
<P>
Sheringham, who faces a tough time behind Dwight Yorke, Andy
Cole, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer and Paul Scholes at United is thought
to be top of Goldberg's list.
</P>
<P>
Palace hopes that United will be willing to sell him, with
reports indicating that a fee of 3.5 million pounds could be
involved.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg has also been linked with possible moves for
Portsmouth striker John Aloisi and Queens Park Rangers forward
Kevin Gallen, though he also has his sights set firmly on Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Palace chairman and coach Terry Venebles both flew to
watch one target in action on Wednesday, missing the second leg
of the Eagles' Worthington Cup clash with Bury.
</P>
<P>
"We're not prepared to sit back after the recent defeats,"
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
"Action is what is required and action is what is being
intended right now.
</P>
<P>
"Terry and I are out looking this week at players with a view
to rebuilding our squad.
</P>
<P>
"Teddy Sheringham is one of those targets," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes Pakistan's Intention of Signing CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday welcomed Pakistan's
intention of signing the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the 53rd Session of the General Assembly,
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's Prime Minister, announced that
his country was prepared to adhere to the CTBT before the
Conference of States Parties to the Treaty scheduled to be held in
September 1999. But he set the condition that Pakistan's adherence
to the Treaty would take place only when it was free from coercion
or pressure.
</P>
<P>
"I have consistently urged India and Pakistan to sign the
Treaty and join the negotiations to ban the production of
missile material for nuclear weapons and halt the deployment of
nuclear weapons. The Government of Pakistan is to be commended
for heeding the concern of the international community," Annan
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement is particularly gratifying since tomorrow
is the second anniversary of the opening for signature of the
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty at United Nations
Headquarters in New York, an important milestone in the history
of efforts to end the nuclear arms race and to achieve nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Treaty had been signed by 150 states and
ratified by 21, including two nuclear-weapon states, and 44
states with nuclear power were needed to ratify the Treaty in
order for it to enter into force.
</P>
<P>
"With Pakistan's signature, 42 of those states will have
signed. India and Democratic People's Republic of Korea have
not. Of those 42 states, 10 have ratified the Treaty, " the U.N.
Secretary-General added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The hostage crisis in the
Greek capital of Athens ended later Wednesday night with eight
people being injured, including three in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
When police launched an assault on the Romanian criminal at
large who held four hostages as of early Wednesday evening, the
Romanian man booby-trapped a handgrenade inside the woman
hostage's underwear and unleashed the pin just before pushing her
at oncoming police commandos.
</P>
<P>
The escaped Romanian convict, a woman hostage and a police
officer were seriously injured in the blast while five other
police officers were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year Soren Matei, who earlier this month in Athens took
a policeman hostage for eight hours after fleeing from police, was
reported on Wednesday as holding two men and two women at an
apartment off Acharnon street in central Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian man had demanded 500,000 U.S. dollars for his
escape and for the release of the hostages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Panel Approves Alternate AIDS Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Senate committee on
Wednesday approved a legislation that would enable hemophiliacs
who contracted AIDS before the government acted to safeguard the
blood supply to get 100,000 U.S. dollars as compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Human Resources Committee also approved an
alternate bill that would add compensation for other people who
contracted the virus through blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
The money would go to the AIDS victims themselves, or their
survivors if they have died.
</P>
<P>
The government began safeguarding the blood supply in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
In May, the House approved legislation to aid 7,200
hemophiliacs. But the Senate panel included some 10,000
transfusion victims.
</P>
<P>
Hemophiliacs fear that expanding the bill will make it too
controversial to pass in the remaining weeks before Congress
adjourns early October. They suggest Congress should come back and
compensate transfusion victims next year.
</P>
<P>
Considering that Congress will not take up the same issue again
next year, the Senate committee approved the alternate measure,
which would authorize funding for both groups. However
hemophiliacs would apply for the money six months before
transfusion victims could submit applications.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Crown
Prince Abdullah arrived here on Wednesday for a week-long visit
that will focus on tensions in the Gulf region and the impact of
low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The prince was welcomed at Andrews Air Force Base near
Washington by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah will meet with President Bill Clinton at the White
House on Thursday and other administration officials in the coming
days on what a State Department official called a "get-to-know-you
visit."
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials were expected to press him for the latest status
of a Saudi investigation into the June 1996 truck bomb at the
Khobar Towers compound housing U.S. forces near Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
The impact of low world oil prices on future Saudi purchasing
is likely to be raised at the meetings. This could have a serious
impact for the United States, which is the largest exporter of
goods to the Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah began a world tour last week with visits to
Britain and France. It is the first major trip to the West since
1987 for the prince, who has travelled little outside his region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer and an important
U.S. ally, played a key role in the coalition that drove invading
Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But, like other regional states, it has been reluctant to take
an aggressive stand against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is scheduled to meet with Gore, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Deputy
Secretary of Defense John Hamre, other administration officials as
well as congressional leaders.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Backs SADC Intervention in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe said Wednesday
that it fully supported the joint military intervention by South
Africa and Botswana to restore peace and stability in Lesotho,
according to a report from Harare, capital of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The office of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said in a
statement that Zimbabwe, as one of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries and a member of the SADC
task force on Lesotho, could not accept a situation where a
constitutionally-elected government was made to operate at the
instructions of the army.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the statement stressed, the army should give
allegiance to the government.
</P>
<P>
At request of the Lesotho cabinet, troops from South Africa
and Botswana have crossed into Lesotho since Tuesday to restore
law and order to the internal conflict which had threatened peace
and stability there.
</P>
<P>
"Any military attack to undermine a sovereign government is
viewed by all of us in SADC and the OAU (Organization of African
Unity) as rebellious and therefore as matter of great concern
requiring immediate redress wherever it occurs," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Developments in Lesotho during the past week had clearly shown
that law and order had broken down irretrievably and the
situation needed urgent intervention.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to pledge full support to the government of Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and therefore to our joint SADC force
which is currently helping to secure the tenure of that
legitimate government," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been in tense situation following the opposition's
refusal to accept the May 23 general elections which they claimed
were rigged by Mosisili's government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties insisted that the results of the
general elections allegedly rigged by the ruling party must be
annulled.

LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- British police said on
Wednesday they have arrested seven men thought to be linked to
Islamic groups in an anti-terrorist operation.
</P>
<P>
The operation was a joint one between specialist police
officers from Special Branch and MI5, the domestic military
intelligence arm.
</P>
<P>
The seven men, some of whom Egyptians and one Saudi, were
picked up at separate addresses in north-west and west London
early Wednesday morning, a police spokeswoman said. An eighth
address, a business premises, was also searched.
</P>
<P>
The men, arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, were
believed to have links with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian
terrorist currently in hiding, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Last month Britain rushed through tough anti-terrorist
legislation in the wake of a huge car bomb in the Northern Irish
town of Omagh, in which 29 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Under the new laws, conspiring to commit terrorist crimes
abroad while in Britain will become an offence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Bankruptcy Overhaul Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Wednesday
voted 97-1 to overwhelmingly pass the major legislation to
overhaul the bankruptcy laws which would make it harder for people
to slip away from their debts payment.
</P>
<P>
With credit card companies pushing for drastic changes, a more
stringent bill passed the House in June on a 306-118 vote.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration supports some changes in bankruptcy
laws but has said it cannot back the House-passed bill in its
current form. With only a few weeks remaining in the session,
lawmakers have to compete the time for reconciling the two
versions and sending a bill to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers are alarmed by a sharp rising tide of personal
bankruptcies amid a strong economy. But several senators insisted
that the credit card companies, which aggressively solicit
customers, should be also blamed for mounting consumer debt.
</P>
<P>
Unpaid credit card debt is now estimated at 40 billion U.S.
dollars, and companies say they are being forced to charge higher
interest rates that hurt consumers who handle credit responsibly.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong economy, the number of Americans filing
personal bankruptcies last year jumped to 1.3 million, up more
than 300 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate versions would make it more difficult
for people to simply file court papers and erase their bills. The
House measure would introduce a "means" test for people filing for
bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
It would require people who earn at least the median U.S.
income, about 51,000 dollars annually, to file for financial
reorganization under Chapter 13, subject to a court-ordered
repayment plan, if they can pay back 20 percent of their debt
within five years.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate bill would give some discretion in the matter to
the bankruptcy judge, who would have to consider a debtor's
ability to repay. A Chapter 13 reorganization generally would be
required if the debtor could pay back 30 percent or more.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Cites Problems in Proposed Lockerbie Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday that there are still three snags
in the resolution of the Lockerbie bombing trial.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of a visit to Washington,
Mandela said progress was being made toward an arrangement for the
suspects to be tried in the Netherlands and that Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi was cooperating.
</P>
<P>
An American-British proposal unveiled on August 24 said that
the suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people, would be tried in the
Netherlands by Scottish judges.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Gaddafi was objecting to a request that he
guarantee to make available any Libyans who were called as
witnesses in the trial.
</P>
<P>
"I know of no system of jurisprudence anywhere in the world
where the accused is required to produce witnesses for the
prosecution," Mandela said, saying this is the first problem.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he supported Gaddafi's objection to British
suggestions that if the men were found guilty and sentenced to
prison terms they would serve those sentences in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he could see no logic in this and added that as
Britain and Libya have no diplomatic relations, the Libyans would
have no recourse if they were ill-treated in prison.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Mandela also expressed his objection to the plan that
was the trial will be held in a former American military base. It
was essential to establish that no U.S. troops would be present,
he said, adding he had raised this with President Bill Clinton
during his stay in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"If there is even one American soldier it is going to create
problems. I hope that matter will be resolved, because President
Gaddafi is cooperating," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader said he had been working with Saudi
King Fahd, though their diplomats in Washington, to try to resolve
the issue.
