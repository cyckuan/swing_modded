<HEADLINE> India Enters Second Round Qualifier of Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indian team was secured
to enter the second-round qualifier of the Uber Cup Women's Team
World Championship after its second victory over Australia in the
preliminary Group A on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Indians, headed by Commonwealth Games silver medalist
Aparna Popat, won the match 5-0 on their home court of the Indira
Gandhi Indoor Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Having outplayed Singapore 4-1 on Sunday, India has firmly
clinched one of the two qualifying berths of the 4-team Group A.
</P>
<P>
In another Group A match this afternoon, Singapore won a
straight 5-0 victory against Sri Lanka, which also lost to
Australia 1-4 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday's clash between Singapore and Australia will
decide which of the two goes into the second round. If the Indian
team keeps its current momentum and beats Sri Lanka on Tuesday to
grab the first place of the preliminary group, it will be placed
in Group X in the second round qualifier, which is believed to be
a very tough group with strong contenders like Indonesia, Chinese
Taipei and Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Singapore-Australia match will then go to
Group Y and play against the Republic of Korea, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, situation remains unclear in the Thomas Cup Men's
Team World Championship first-stage qualifying, which has two
preliminary groups with 7 teams to play.
</P>
<P>
In Group A, Mauritius has won two consecutive victories,
beating Sri Lanka 3-2 on Sunday and Nepal 5-0 on Monday. Thailand
came right on the heels of the Mauritians after triumphing over
Nepal 5-0 on Sunday and Sri Lanka on Monday (score 4-0 by press
time).
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Tuesday Thai-Mauritian clash will go to the
second round qualifier Group X and confront China, Chinese Taipei
and Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
In Group B, Australia and Singapore, beating Iran 4-1 and 5-0
respectively, will be engaged in a fierce fighting on Tuesday for
the only chance to advance to the second-round qualifier and meet
the DPRK Korea, Japan and India in Group Y.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas and Uber Cup qualifiers here will finish on
February 20.

<HEADLINE> PFA Supports Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Professional
Footballers Association has backed the introduction of the 10-yard
rule in a bid to curb the rise of aggressive dissent towards
officials.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA, said the recent
adoption of a more lenient approach by referees has improved the
quality of games but is now being abused by players.
</P>
<P>
His comments come after another controversial weekend of
football.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea's match against Wimbledon, Tottenham Spurs' clash with
Leeds and Newcastle's victory over Manchester United all descended
into ugly scenes which left officials struggling to keep control.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a suggestion that maybe we should be
considering instant penalties on the pitch," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate referees are being more conciliatory but there
has been a backlash this weekend and we need to look at how to
deal with that."
</P>
<P>
"One good suggestion of how to deal with dissent and
encroachment is the 10-yard rule where you move the ball forward
and that has been a proven success in rugby."
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of England is already piloting the
rule,which penalises players who argue by allowing the referee to
advance a free-kick by 10 yards, and has called on FIFA to
consider it in international fixtures.
</P>
<P>
Taylor insisted that football was a contact sport and that
aggression was part of the game but conceded more needed to be
done to penalise players who over-stepped the mark.
</P>
<P>
"We need a proper disciplinary system to make sure bad
behaviour is counter-productive.
</P>
<P>
"Managers are under a great deal of pressure and may turn a
blind eye to things so it is up to the football authorities to try
and get penalties which will act as deterrents.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see refs pushed around," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association is expected to take action over the
most recent spate of violent outbursts.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's post-match brawl at Stamford Bridge was arguably the
worst incident with Dons skipper Robbie Earle claiming "There was
more action in the tunnel than in the recent Mike Tyson fight."
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wise and Wimbledon defender Kenny Cunningham had a
heated verbal exchange just before the final whistle and the pair
continued their argument down the tunnel after the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
The row apparently erupted into a mass brawl involving 16
players, including Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli, which was
witnessed by referee Peter Jones.
</P>
<P>
The FA are now awaiting his report on the incident before
deciding whether to take any action.
</P>
<P>
The on-pitch brawl between Leeds and Tottenham players,
following a late Lee Bowyer tackle on Stephen Clemence, is also
expected to come under the FA microscope.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United's players once again failed to keep their
cool as they slumped to defeat at St James Park.
</P>
<P>
Skipper Roy Keane was booked for dissent and was eventually
dismissed, Jaap Stam squared up a linesman and Newcastle captain
Alan Shearer questioned referee Stephen Lodge numerous times.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Seeks Approval for Attacking Lebanese Villages Harboring Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army will ask for
government's approval to fire back Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas
hidden in villages, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz
revealed he will submit his policy-changing plan to Wednesday's
session of the inner-circle security cabinet, which is scheduled to
evaluate the latest flare-ups in the Israeli-controlled security
zone in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The general accused Hezbollah of frequently violating the 1996
Grapes of Wrath understandings by opening fire from villages, which
had killed seven IDF soldiers since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985,
claiming to protect Israel's northern towns from cross-border
guerrilla attacks. For years, Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
and other groups have been fighting to oust Israel and its allies
from the zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understandings were reached between Israel and
Hezbollah after a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon in 1996, which
killed 200 Lebanese civilians. The truce agreement prohibit attacks
on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz pointed out that Hezbollah had escalated its activities in
the security zone in recent weeks, firing at least 50 anti-tank
missiles, four of which directly hit IDF's outposts and led to
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz warned that once his plan gets cabinet's permission, the
IDF will adopt the new retaliation policy as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, returning fire against Hezbollah inside the
villages will depend on circumstances and the IDF will be ordered
to strike cautiously to minimize civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff expressed the hope that the new policy will
prevent villagers in South Lebanon from allowing Hezbollah to
exploit their homes as covers for the guerrillas' firing positions.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz's suggestion was another indicator showing that Israel
wants to abolish the Grapes of Wrath understandings, after Israel
Air Force's reprisal raids on Lebanese civilian infrastructure
sites last week.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli right-wing politicians had urged the government to
allow the IDF to act on the basis of operational imperatives, and
not in line with the understandings, which they said have lost
their relevance and are only favoring Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
A emergency session of the Grapes of Wrath monitoring committee
was held last Friday, discuss the tense situation in South Lebanon
and calling for both sides' commitment to the truce agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli team walked out of the session after
receiving reports that another Israeli soldier was killed by
Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Stresses U.N.'s Role in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein on Tuesday called on the United Nations to play a major
role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during a meeting with visiting U.N. Special
Coordinator for the Middle East Terry Larsen, Jordan's official
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The king stressed that the U.N. must play a significant role to
perpetuate peace and to solve problems confronting the region,
particularly the refugee issue, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan has housed over 1 million Palestinian
refugees, who had fled their homes during successive Middle East
wars, and the government said the refugees have the rights to
return to their homeland or ask for compensations from parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Larsen paid tribute to Jordan's key role under the
leadership of Abdullah in promoting peace, security and stability
in the region, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Abdullah said Jordan firmly supported the
Palestinians in their efforts to regain their legitimate rights
under U.N. resolutions, and their lands occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his support for Syria and Lebanon on their
fragile peace tracks with Israel, according to Petra.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors after it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the
second Arab country following Egypt to strike a peace deal with the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Italy Pledges to Make Moves on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An Italian pledge to make "
appropriate moves" to help overcome the current stall in the
Mideast peace process was one of the key points in talks Tuesday
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Italian Prime
Minister Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released later, D'Alema voiced
concern over the impasse and warned that failure to make progress
would "seriously prejudice the credibility of the commitments"
made by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Agreements between Israel and the Palestinians in Sharm el
Sheik last September were to have gone into effect two days ago,
and the final agreement completing the peace process is supposed
to be achieved by September 13.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Arafat was "particularly alarmed" by Israel
's suspension of the negotiations and the failure to find an
understanding on the agreements that should have gone into effect
on February 13.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major threats to the continuity of the negotiations
is the (Israeli) policy of settlements, which are continuing
despite Israel's pledges to the contrary," the communique quoted
Arafat as saying.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also told Arafat that, together with the EU and the
United States, Italy will act in support of the peace process in
all appropriate forums, in order to achieve a "just and lasting"
peace in the Middle East "within the agreed deadlines."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Arafat's visit also confirmed the "
quality" of Italo-Palestinian relations and testified to Italian
interest and involvement in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also voiced Palestinian recognition for Italian support
for the peace process.

<HEADLINE> EU Decides on Action Against Germany on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Tuesday decided to start legal actions against Germany for its not
lifting the ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, decided at its Strasbourg meeting that Germany had not met
the commission decision on lifting the embargo on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Germany was given until March 17 to respond to the commission's
formal complaint before being sued by the commission in front of
the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
David Byrne, European commission in charge of health and
consumer protection, said after the commission meeting that the
commission could avoid a legal confrontation if Germany complied
quickly with the commission decision.
</P>
<P>
If the commission does not get a satisfactory response by that
time from Germany, it may decide to send the country a formal
request to have the violation brought to an end or decide to take
Germany to court.
</P>
<P>
The commission decided last August to lift the ban on British
beef exports after the mad-cow disease had contaminated the beef
products in the country but lifted the ban after Britain took
measures to control the disease from spreading to new herds of
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The European Union already took France to the European Court of
Justice for not complying with the commission decision to lift the
ban on British beef. The commission sued France in the court in
January.

<HEADLINE> EU Considers Action Against U.S. Steel Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said
Tuesday that it was considering taking actions within the World
Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States over its move
to impose punitive tariffs on steel imports.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that it was studying the U.S. steel case
carefully and was examining a possible request for WTO dispute
settlement.
</P>
<P>
It added that it would request consultations with the U.S.
authorities over the issue as an immediate step.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced last Friday two measures
restricting imports into his country of steel wire rod and welded
steel line pipe.
</P>
<P>
The United States will introduce a three-year quota of 1.58
million net tons on imports of steel wire rod with the quota level
increasing 2 percent each year but imports exceeding the quota
will be subject to an additional import duty of 10 percent in the
first year, 7.5 percent in the second year and 5 percent in the
third year.
</P>
<P>
An additional import duty of up to 19 percent will be levied on
imports of welded steel line pipe exceeding the 9,000-ton quota in
the first year. The punitive tariffs will be 15 percent for the
second year and 11 percent for the third year.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the U.S. safeguard measures would
affect the main European Union producers of these products in
several member countries including Germany, Britain, France, Italy
Spain and Greece.

<HEADLINE> EU Enjoys Trade Surplus With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union exported
more goods to than it imported from the United States in 1998,
Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
Community said that the 15-nation bloc exported to the United
States goods worth 160 billion euro (155 billion U.S. dollars)
while it imported from that country goods worth 151 billion euro(
146 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The union thus enjoyed a trade surplus of 9 billion euro (8.7
billion dollars). It had a trade deficit of 0.4 billion euro(0.38
billion dollars) with the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, both exports to and imports from the United
States registered strong growths, with exports up by 55 percent
and imports up by 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the EU's largest trading partner,
accounting for more than one fifth of the union's total extra-EU
trade. The EU is the second largest trading partner of the United
States, just behind Canada.
</P>
<P>
EU exports account for 22 percent of the U.S. exports and 18
percent of the country's imports.
</P>
<P>
Among EU member states, Germany was the largest exporter to the
United States in 1998, followed by Britain which was the largest
importer of U.S. goods in the same year.
</P>
<P>
More than half of U.S.-bound EU goods were machinery and
vehicles. Road vehicles, aircraft and engines and motors put
together accounted for nearly a quarter of EU exports to the North
American country.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft, engines and motors made up 18 percent of EU imports
from the United States while computers and electrical machinery
each accounted for a further 8 percent of imports.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Imposes Huge Fine Against CDU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 15 (Xinhua)--Germany's conservative Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) will be fined 41 million marks (20 million
U.S. dollars) for its illegal party funding practice, the
parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse announced Tuesday in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The fine, the largest punishment against any party in the 50-
year history of Germany, was imposed for CDU's undeclared 18-
million-mark spending in last year's Hesse state election.
</P>
<P>
Under Thierse's decision, the CDU must at first return 35
million marks to state before 20, March. The parliament also
canceled its campaign support for the CDU of 5.5 million marks.
</P>
<P>
And the sum would be further raised if more details about CDU'
s slush funds in Kohl era were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"There are still many questions to be clarified in Kohl's
affair," Thierse told a Berlin press conference.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, the former CDU Chancellor who had served for 16 years,
has admitted that he accepted 2 million marks illegal cash
donation. But Kohl still refuses to point out who gave him the
money because his "promise of honor."
</P>
<P>
The CDU, though complaining an excessive fine would "endanger
its existence," said it would not challenge parliament's decision.
</P>
<P>
"It is a hard day for the CDU, but the party will accept an
appropriate punishment for its illegal financial practice! We don'
t deserve any sympathy," said Angela Merkel, general secretary of
the CDU.
</P>
<P>
The Party has set up an account for the fine and canceled some
projects, including a national congress, she said.

<HEADLINE> IRA Pulls Out of Decommissioning Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The move appeared to be a major blow to Northern Ireland's
peace process and reflected republican anger with a British
decision last week to suspend Northern Ireland's home-rule
assembly because the IRA failed to give any clear commitment to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
The IRA blamed the Unionists and the British government for the
move.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Tuesday, IRA said the suspension of
the Northern Ireland Assembly and the return to direct rule had
prompted its decision.
</P>
<P>
It said it was withdrawing its representative to the
disarmament commission and all of its proposals on weapons to date.
</P>
<P>
It also said those who made the political process conditional
on decommissioning had caused a crisis in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said he
was "disappointed at the IRA's decision because I believe this is
a time when all channels need to be kept open".
</P>
<P>
"What was on the table had real potential and people will be
sad that it could not be worked on and developed in the way needed,
" Mandelson said in a statement.

<P>
OTTAWA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Thomson Corp. (TOC-T)
is expecting to complete the sale of more than 100 newspapers in
both Canada and the United States by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement reaching here Tuesday, TOC-T President Richard
Harrington said that the company intends to concentrate its
operations as "a global provider of information and solutions for
businesses and professionals."
</P>
<P>
The sale involves 55 daily and 75 non-daily newspapers in
Canada and the United States. An exception is the company's
flagship daily newspaper, the Globe and Mail, which was Canada's
only national newspaper until the National Post was launched in

last year, while about half of the company's revenue of 6 billion
dollars came from electronic services.
</P>
<P>
The TOC-T president saw a rise to 80 percent in the services

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Tuesday announced "the successful completion" of the U.N. Mission
in the Central African Republic (MINURCA), saying that the world
body will continue to support the people and the Government of the
African country in their peace-building efforts.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in a statement by a U.N. spokesman for
the U.N. Secretary-General, issued here Tuesday, who said, "Today
marks the successful completion of the United Nations Mission in
the Central African Republic" (CAR).
</P>
<P>
The remaining U.N. peace-keepers left the CAR Tuesday under a
Security Council decision.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the United Nations mission in the CAR once
again demonstrates how much can be achieved by peace-keeping
operations in Africa and elsewhere with the cooperation and
political will of the parties, their commitment to peace and
national reconciliation, a clear mandate, appropriate resources,
and the strong and consistent support of the international
community," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
MINURCA, set up in April 1998, and its predecessor which was
called the Inter-African Force in the CAR (MISAB), "have done much
to restore peace and security in the CAR and to create conditions
conducive to the successful conduct of national elections, the
restructuring of the security forces, the training of the national
police and gendarmerie and the launching of major economic and
social reforms in the country," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan "expresses his deep
appreciation to Member States, in particular those in and outside
the region, that provided military and police personnel to this
peace-keeping mission, as well as the United Nations offices,
programs and agencies, the Friends of the CAR and all others who
worked tirelessly to ensure the successful implementation of
MINURCA's mandate," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Though much has been achieved in the CAR over the past two
years, many more challenges remain," the statement said. "The
United Nations will continue to assist the people and the
Government of the CAR through a Peace-Building Office (BONUCA),
which is taking over from MINURCA."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General urges all parties concerned in the CAR
to work together in a spirit of cooperation and national unity in
order to complete the ongoing reforms, pursuant to the Bangui
Agreements and the National Reconciliation Pact," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"These reforms should continue to aim at consolidating peace,
democratic institutions and socioeconomic recovery and be based on
the respect for human rights and the rule of law," the statement
said. "The Secretary-General appeals to the international
community to continue to provide the CAR with generous assistance
in support of these important goals."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council officially authorized the end of the U.N.
peace-keeping mission in the CAR and the establishment of BONUCA
to help the government consolidate peace.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous soldiers have staged three major rebellions since
1996 against President Arge-Felix Patasse, whose election in 1993
ended more than a decade of army rule.
</P>
<P>
1993, some 1,350 peace-keeping troops replaced French soldiers
helping to enforce a peace agreement between political and ethnic
opponents in the country. By late last month, an estimated 430
soldiers from Egypt, Cote D'Ivoire, Senegal and Gabon remained.

<HEADLINE> Russia Prepares Decisive Strike on Rebels in Mountainous Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops are regrouping
in the foothills of south Chechnya, preparing a decisive strike
over the rebel bases in deeper mountains, the Kremlin's main
Chechnya spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told the press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Judging from intercepted radio exchanges, the rebels may try to
break out from Chechnya to Dagestan, Georgia and Azerbaijan, he
said.
</P>
<P>
An operation to reveal and eliminate individual rebel groupings
still continues in Grozny. Mines are being removed and the rubble
is being cleared away in the city, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Chechnya's snowcapped southern mountains resounded to
the thunder of bomb and rocket attacks as Russian forces pounded
remaining Chechen rebel redoubts, Russian media said. A ranking
Russian general vowed Monday to slice into rebel positions layer
by layer, ''as if they were a cake.''
</P>
<P>
the Russian military said, cited by the Interfax news agency,
that its aviation flew more than 70 combat missions in the last 24
hours, hitting rebels in the key Argun and Vedeno gorges, where up
to 8,000 guerrillas are believed to be holed up.
</P>
<P>
But there were no reports of Russia launching an all-out
assault on the two gorges, a move which cost it dearly during the
1994-1996 Chechen war. Russian acting President Vladimir Putin
told reporters in Moscow that saving soldier lives was a priority.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven mountain climbers, among
them four Russians and three British citizens, were killed by a
snowslide in the North Caucasus, reported the Russian Emergency
Situation Ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The climbers were caught in a sudden avalanche during their
ascent of the 4,700- meter Mount Uzhba in the Kabardino-Balkaria
range four days ago. There is virtually no chance for any one to
have survived, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A 70-member rescue team has found five bodies of the victims.
Now the search for the others, two British citizens, continues
despite snow and bitter cold.
</P>
<P>
The names of the dead are Mikhail Zaporozhsky, party leader;
Igor Terekhov; Gennady Ashurov; Sergei Berezhnoi; Mark Rine (the
United Kingdom).
</P>
<P>
Chief of the ministry's "Elbrus" search and rescue service
Boris Tilov told reporters that another group of mountain climbers
caught in the mountains by cold and snowy weather was discovered
on the top of the Uzhba glacier. Four of them, all from Moscow's
Shcholkovo district, suffered frostbite and another identified as
Sergei Sergeyev died. They were brought down to the foothills on
Monday and are now receiving intensive medical aid.

<HEADLINE> More S. Africans Take Job Creation as National Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Forty-one percent of
South Africans consider job creation the most important national
priority for the next 10 years, followed by crime prevention (31
percent) and the provision of better services (seven percent), a
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Perceptions of national priorities differ by race, according to
the latest survey conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council
(HSRC).
</P>
<P>
For example, 62 percent of whites and 44 percent of Indians
have considered fighting crime as the top priority, compared to
black and colored respondents, at 46 percent and 38 percent
respectively, who perceived job creation as the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey conducted almost a year earlier, crime
prevention was considered the most important priority for all
South Africans, followed by job creation.
</P>
<P>
"This change may have resulted from the continued concern
about unemployment and the non-compromising stance that the
Ministry of Safety and Security has taken against criminals after
the national elections in June," said Victor Ramaema, researcher
at the HSRC.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramaema, the high level of significance that the
majority of blacks attach to job creation may stem from the fact
that this sector of the population -- neglected under the previous
government -- experienced high levels of unemployment or low
income.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the distribution of wealth in the country
may serve to explain why more whites and Indians raised concern
over crime than over jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
While respondents from the age group 45 years and over felt
that controlling national crime should be the national priority,
the younger age groups thought job creation should be government's
top priority during the next 10 years, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the 1996 national census, high unemployment
occurs predominantly among persons in the 20- to 44-year-old age
group, and this may explain why younger people attach a higher
priority to job creation," Ramaema said.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Seeks Harmony With Business Circles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday met government ministers and representatives
from business, labor and agriculture behind closed doors in Cape
Town to seek harmony with business circles.
</P>
<P>
The president's office said the participants discussed the
proposed introduction of inflation targeting, but it did not give
any details about the targeting.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a statement that the two-hour meeting was
part of an ongoing strategy to build relationships within the
economic community.
</P>
<P>
The talks were said to be cordial, constructive and fruitful,
and center around the question of inflation targeting which was
expected to be introduced by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in his
Budget speech next week.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said his government valued the input made by labor and
business as well as the different agricultural sectors in the
inflation targeting discussion.
</P>
<P>
The president was accompanied by Manuel and Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin, as well as the ministers of agriculture,
minerals and energy, public enterprises, public service and
administration, and the minister in the office of the president.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni and his deputy Gill Marcus
also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the parties stressed the need for further
discussion between all role-players in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference of South Africa Trade Union has over the past
week voiced its objection to inflation targeting over concerns
that it could entrench wage restraints and delay closing the wage
gap created by apartheid.

NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 85,000 households are
headed by children in Rwanda, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>

91 percent of these households are orphans.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these families have both of their parents in prison,"
the report noted, adding that "a rising number of these children
have been orphaned because of the death of their parents due to
AIDS."
</P>
<P>
Some survive without regular meals, adequate clothing or
acceptable housing. Some have been chased from the houses of their

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Has to Revert to British-authored Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- As the Tuesday results of the
referendum on the draft constitution show that Zimbabweans have
rejected it, Zimbabwe has to use the British-authored Lancaster
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede announced in Harare Tuesday
that the " No" votes won the victory in the first referendum in
the southern African country. According to the results, 697,754
people voting against the document and 578,210 supporting it.
</P>
<P>
"The results speak for themselves. As far as we are concerned,
we have done it,"  the registrar-general said.
</P>
<P>
About 53.2 percent of the 1.3 million people who participated
in the two- day historic referendum held at the weekend rejected
the draft constitution and about 44.1 percent supported it.
</P>
<P>
The victory by those against the document by more than 100,000
votes means that Zimbabwe has to revert to the British-style
constitution which was crafted in 1979 as a transitional
compromise for warring parties.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of the rural constituencies recorded more
votes for the home-grown constitution, they were not able to
reduce the gap which had been created by the urban constituencies.
</P>
<P>
In the capital Harare alone, the "No" votes were 227,171
against 78,149 " Yes" while in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, 90,422 people voted against the draft constitution
and 27,727 for it.
</P>
<P>
This was contrary to predictions made by analysts, opposition
political parties and opposition National Constitutional Assembly,
who believed that the referendum would be decided by the rural
people who comprise the majority of the five million eligible
voters.
</P>
<P>
The analysts had said the rural population loyal to the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party
was likely to vote in favor of the draft constitution in line with
the government and party campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Only 23.6 percent of the 5.5 million Zimbabweans who were
eligible to vote participated in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, Constitutional Commission spokesman Jonathan Moyo
argued that the results of the referendum are not an indicator of
possible trends in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in
April.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Ruling Party's Relaxation Blamed for Referendum Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said Tuesday that the draft constitution
was rejected because the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) did not campaign seriously for its
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution was turned down by 697,754 "No" votes
against 578, 210 "Yes" in the weekend referendum.
</P>
<P>
The result came as a shock to Zanu-PF leadership and
Zimbabweans in general who expected the ruling party's will to
carry the day as has been custom since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said the party did not even have agents at polling
stations and its elections directorate was not functional during
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition had taken advantage of Zanu-PF's
relaxation to organize people and confuse them into voting against
the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
The minister alleged that the opposition and some whites paid
unemployed youths and their domestic workers to vote "No".
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said most whites in the country voted against the
draft and some of those he spoke to did not even read the
document.
</P>
<P>
The party would plan its way forward and see how to get over
"this temporary setback," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the rejection to the public anger at the
diesel shortages and the prevailing economic hardship, and that
could spell doom for the ruling party in the parliamentary
elections in April.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Russia agreed on
Tuesday to expand bilateral cooperation in the fields of culture,
arts, education and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
An executive program for the Kuwaiti-Russian Cultural and
Scientific Agreement for 2000-2002 was signed here by Secretary
General of the Kuwaiti National Council for Culture, Art and
Letters, Mohammed Al-Rumeihi and the Russian ambassador to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the exchanges of visits of music,
theater, folklore groups and experts, sports teams, as well as
cooperation in the tourism and media fields, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to boost cooperation in organizing
exhibitions in the domains of publication, library and museum.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Al-Rumeihi expressed hope that
the agreement would promote the cultural relations between the two
countries to a wider horizon of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Russian ambassador said that Moscow is keen on
carrying out the agreement, "as the bilateral cultural relations
are currently in a state of standstill."

the sea near Kuwait's two islands in the Gulf, said an army
official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official called on people and fishermen not to approach the

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The White House is expected
to propose a new Internet-security center following a meeting
Tuesday between President Clinton and high-tech executives, The
Wall Street Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
The Cyber-National Information Center, to be known as Cyber-NIC,
will be a place where companies "can work together to address
cybersecurity problems and crises," according to a planning
document.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the White House is asking its science adviser,
Neal Lane, to take the lead in establishing a think tank supported
by both the public and private sectors to consider cybersecurity
issues.
</P>
<P>
The modest steps reflect the lack of consensus to last week's
incidents, in which numerous Web sites were brought down after
being bombarded with meaningless data packets, The Wall Street
Journal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some industry representatives have been concerned that federal
law-enforcement agencies may use the attacks to pressure companies
to take security steps that are either costly or otherwise
unpopular with Internet users.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Find Nicotine-Alcohol Linkage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have for
the first time found what they term as "a convincing linkage"
between smoking and drinking.
</P>
<P>
Rats would increase their alcohol consumption by 30 percent
once injected with nicotine amounting to from 10 to 15 cigarettes,
according to the Center for Addition and Mental Health in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The center reports Tuesday in a journal called Alcoholism:
Clinical and Experimental Research that there is a feedback loop
between nicotine and alcohol, a linkage of key to lock in a brain
biochemical mechanism.
</P>
<P>
To prove a suspicion that nicotine may have a role in cases
where 90 percent of problem drinkers also smoke, a research team
of the center tried a chemical to turn off what they believe to be
"the nicotine receptros" in the brains of rats.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the rats trained to drink alcohol lost their
interest in alcohol with their consumption dropping by 40 percent,
as compared with other rats with active nicotine receptors.
</P>
<P>
The study indicates that a better result may yield from
treating alcoholism and smoking together.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was followed by The Insider and The Cider House Rules, each
with seven nominations, and box office hit The Sixth Sense with
six.
</P>
<P>
American Beauty's other nominations were for screenwriter Alan
Ball for best original screenplay, as well as for cinematography,
film editing and original score.
</P>
<P>
The nominations were announced in a early morning ceremony by
actor Dustin Hoffman at the Academy headquarters in Los Angeles.
The Oscars will be presented March 26 from the Shrine Auditorium
in Los Angeles and broadcast on ABC-TV.
</P>
<P>
Some critics wondered whether American Beauty's skewed story,
complete with a pot-smoking dad and a pistol-packing mom, might be
a little too much for voters.
</P>
<P>
Nominees in most of the 23 categories were chosen by specific
branches of the Academy's 5,300 members, such as actors, directors
and film editors. Some nominations, including documentaries and
foreign-language films, were selected by special screening
committees, while all Academy members were allowed to cast votes
for best-picture nominees.

The full Academy membership is eligible to vote in all
categories for the awards themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
January's performance, much stronger than many analysts'
forecast, followed a 0.4 percent increase in December, the same as
originally reported a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, operating capacity was 81.6 percent in January, up
from 81.1 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Generally, an operating capacity of 84 percent would alarm
economists, indicating that factories just can't produce fast
enough, which could lead to price increases.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the National Association of Purchasing
Management reported that the price of raw materials for
manufacturing climbed to a five-year high in January, raising
fears of inflation.
</P>
<P>
In January, output for both manufacturing and mining increased
about 1 percent. The output at utilities was up 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> France to Move Ashes of Composer Into Pantheon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The French government will move
the ashes of 19th century music composer Hector Berlioz into the
Pantheon, the temple dedicated to some of the greatest French
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Catherine Trautmann said the ceremony of
moving the ashes of Berlioz into the temple will be held in 2003,
which falls on the 200th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
The most well known work composed by Berlioz is "La Symphonie
Fantastique."
</P>
<P>
The government kept secret to the last minute the decision on
who will be the next to be enshrined in the Pantheon. An article
published by the daily Le Figaro on Tuesday considered the
impressionist master painter Claude Monet as the most likely.
</P>
<P>
The last Frenchman whose ashes were moved into the Pantheon in
1996 was novelist and former Gaullist minister Andre Malraux.
</P>
<P>
"President Jacques Chirac made the decision that Berlioz would
be the first French composer to rest in the Pantheon," said
Tautmann.
</P>
<P>
The tomb of Berlioz, who died in 1869 in Paris at the age of 66,
is now in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris.

PARIS -- French troops serving in the United Nations
multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR) have discovered
a terrorist strategy to launch urban guerrilla warfare in the
northern Kosovo city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French military sources in
Kosovo as saying on Tuesday that French troops seized on Monday in
the southern part Kosovska Mitrovica a large quantity of arms,
including 10 rocket launchers, more than 80 grenades and thousands
of ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the Kosovska Mitrovica is inhabited by
ethnic Albanians, while the northern part is exclusively populated
by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Tension rose abruptly along the diving line of the city, the
river Ibar, after two Serbs were killed in an attack upon a bus of
the U.N. High Commission for Refugees on February 2 and a grenade
attack was made against a Serb bar on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jean-Philippe Bernard, commander of the French
motorized infantry brigade in charge of security in the city, said

MOSCOW -- The Russia's Central Election Commission (CEC)
Tuesday approved Acting President Vladimir Putin's registration as

The commission, which has so far registered two of the 15
candidates, unanimously voted for Putin's application and said he
had provided the necessary documents including half a million
supporters' signatures and evidence of income and property.
</P>
<P>
"Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin is now an official
presidential candidate," said a CEC spokesman after the voting for
registering Putin on Tuesday.

BRUSSELS -- The European Union (EU) said on Tuesday that it is
still considering ways to help alleviate problems related to the
cyanide spill in Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The earliest decision is expected later this week when European
Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom returned from a fact-
finding trip to the two countries affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, was scheduled to discuss the cyanide spill, according to a
commission spokesman. He quoted Commission President Romano Prodi
as saying that the commission deemed it important to discuss the
incident so as to consider how best to coordinate efforts when
disaster of this type occurs in the future.
</P>
<P>
What the commission fears most is not the cyanide spill but
rather problems aggravated by heavy metals such as lead and
mercury that remain in the polluted area for much longer lengths
of time.
</P>
<P>
The European Union can also help the Romanians and Hungarians
evaluate the actual damage caused by the cyanide spill which
occurred on January 30 when a dam at a gold mining firm overflowed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Economy to Rise Nine Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is expected to
maintain a nine percent economic growth rate this year, according
to the Shanghai Municipal Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Li Liangyuan, director in charge of the commission, said today
the city's total industrial output value will rise 8.5 percent
this year, with the total sales of retailed commodities to
increase by eight percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The official made the announcement at the closing ceremony of
the third session of Shanghai's 11th People's Congress today.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's total export volume will reach 20 billion US dollars
this year. Three billion U.S. dollars from overseas in investment
is expected to flow into Shanghai this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite these forecasts, Shanghai needs to take tough measures
to deal with loss-making state-owned enterprises and a far from
perfect market investment and financing system.
</P>
<P>
Li said that most state investment will be diverted into high-
tech sectors, pillar industries and urban infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will lower the prices of some commodities and services
such as automobile taxes, extra fees charged for installing
telephone and mobile phone services and renting houses and
apartments.

<HEADLINE> BEA to Spin New Web in Cyberbanking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li said that the BEA aims to, in three years' time, have
between 15 to 20 percent of its customers use cyberbanking and
those customers account for 20 to 25 percent of the retail bill
payments and 30 to 40 percent of retail broking transactions
through cybertrading.
</P>
<P>
The five-year target is set as having 60 percent of the
customers use automated means for transactions and more than 40
percent of transaction volume take place through Internet mode.
</P>
<P>
Li envisaged the possibilities of separate listings of
cyberbanking and cybertrading, which he said could allow the BEA
to extract greater value from the use of Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
BEA, the first bank in the Special Administrative Region of
Hong Kong to introduce on-line share trading and on-line bank
accounts through cyber banking and cyber trading services, has
attracted nearly 100,000 new customers to these services, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"More than half of them came to us from other banks and
institutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our cyberbanking services allow our customers to carry out
their banking needs over Internet, or mobile phones or terminals
in public places," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li summarized the major benefits of the cyberbanking as the
significant reduction of transaction cost and better targeting
customers by analyzing their behavior.
</P>
<P>
However, bank branches would not become things of the past even
if cyberbanking is fully developed because some customers,
especially the elderly people, still prefer to talk to a bank
manager, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The BEA will also develop the call center into a strong
business and telemarketing unit to complement the bank branches
and Internet platform in supporting full range of retail banking
products and customer services, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to have 30 percent of application for mortgage,
personal loans, insurance and other services process by our call
center within the next three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed interest in acquisition, saying that "the average
banks in Hong Kong will become less profitable as competition of
banking industry intensifies" and "if future opportunity arises,
we will be interested in further building market shares in this
way."

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a regular
press conference today that China's stance against all forms of
computer crimes and bad behaviors "is clear as ever."
</P>
<P>
Recently, a number of U.S. websites and Japanese government

service providers suffered great losses and the normal operation
of subscribers were also seriously affected," he said, adding that
the Chinese government has noticed the occurrence of massive
hacker assault.

<P>
He described "net economy" one of the major factors
contributing to the sustained growth of the economy. "Network

Outer space belongs to all of mankind, therefore all countries
have the equal right to explore and use outer space for peaceful
purposes, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that it should be noted that attempts, plans and
actions by a single country to seek military and strategic
advantages in outer space exist and are being further developed.
</P>
<P>
If this is not prohibited, he added, it is likely that weapons
will be employed in outer space in the near future, which could
lead to a multilateral arms race in space.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- It was reported that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has
decided to postpone his visit to the United States that was to have
taken place at the end of this month, basically due to the
constitutional amendment talks to start in Parliament this week.
</P>
<P>
As the 1982 constitution does not allow for a second term for
incumbent presidents, the amendment would open the way for Demirel
for a second term in office.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- The undersea construction of the Blue Stream Project, which
will transfer natural gas from Russia to Turkey via Black Sea
Pipeline, has started.
</P>
<P>
The construction is being managed by the Blue Stream Pipeline
Company. French, japanese and Russian companies are also
participating in the project.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police detained 945 illegal immigrants over the last
three weeks as they attempted to cross the borders into Greece and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants, including Afghans, romanians, Pakistanis,
Lebanese, Palestinians, Iraqis, Iranians and nationals of several
African countries, were intercepted in villages along the Turco-
Greek and Turco-Bulgarian borders.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people, mostly from the Mideast and Asia, pay
Turkish smugglers to try to reach prosperous European Union
countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Proposes to Join EU's Rapid Deployment Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has decided to put
forward a proposal to join the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) of the
European Union, to be set up in 2003, Turkish Daily News reported
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the RDF was initiated at the EU Helsinki
summit last December. The summit adopted a basic target that the EU
member countries should keep ready a 60,000-strong RDF, composed of
15 brigades as of the year 2003 and is able to be sent to a crisis
region in 60 days.
</P>
<P>
The EU is known to be dedicated to developing its own defense
capability. The RDF will constitute an important step on the way to
the formation of a European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI),
independent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The new European defense system, which insists that the
decision-making process will be in the hands of EU members, has
raised concern among non-EU NATO members, including Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has voiced its readiness to play a role in European
defense since it was granted EU candidacy at the Helsinki summit.
But the EU said it will be unrealistic to accept that Turkey and
other five non-EU NATO allies play a decision-making role in such
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which still faces a long road to full EU membership, is
worrying about being excluded from European defense arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., fearing the new European defense system will weaken
NATO, has claimed support for Turkey's efforts to join in the ESDI.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Ankara's proposal to take part in the RDF aims to
promote its efforts to be accepted in the ESDI.

NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Indo-U.S. relations
encompassed a wide spectrum of issues and were not tied to any
single subject, an External Affairs Ministry spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>

both sides to further deepen bilateral relations, adding that "
there are a host of issues where we have overlapping interests."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans have rejected the
draft constitution with 697,754 people voting against the document
and 578,210 supporting it, results of the constitutional
referendum showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zimbabwe News Agency, the victory by those
against the document by more than 100,000 votes means that
Zimbabwe has to use the British authored Lancaster Constitution,
which was crafted in 1979 as a transitional compromise for warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans for the first time since independence in 1980 voted
in such a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
The draft supreme law proposes the retention of an executive
president who shares power with a prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Other highlights include the return to a two-chamber Parliament
 consisting of a National Assembly and a Senate and the
introduction of proportional representation in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The draft also seeks to put to rest the contentious land issue
by giving the government the right to acquire land for
resettlement without paying compensation, except for improvements
on the holdings.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the proposed constitution were arguing that the
president would still have too much power and that the draft
ignored the wishes of the people.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the draft have been urging people to vote "yes"
because the proposed supreme law gives them sovereignty and the
opportunity to break away from the colonial past.
</P>
<P>
The referendum has assumed racial connotations with white
Zimbabweans turning out in unusually large numbers last seen in
the 1980 general elections, media here said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch to Work With Britons on Soccer Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch police has promised
to work closely with their British counterpart in their fight
against soccer hooligans at the coming European soccer
championship.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Justice Ministry confirmed on Tuesday that the two
countries are signing a cooperation protocol through Dutch Justice
Minister Benk Korthals and British Home Secretary Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands and Britain are to exchange information on
soccer hooligans who have been convicted of offenses committed
before, during or after soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
The two countries hope that the exchange of information will
help prevent any repetition of trouble in the coming European
championship. The cooperation in the fight against soccer
hooligans will continue after the championship which will be co-
hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium between June and July.
</P>
<P>
Korthals and Dutch Interior Minister Bram Peper are to fly to
Berlin on Wednesday to forge a similar cooperation with Germany,
ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain
signed on Monday in London an agreement on police cooperation
against soccer hooligans during the European championship.
</P>
<P>
Some British soccer fans have been the headaches of soccer
match organizers as they repeatedly caused trouble before, during

</P>
<P>
At the 1998 World Cup tournament in France, British fans fought
with supporters of other participating teams and thus caused
trouble for local authorities in several of the host cities.

<HEADLINE> HK Voters Urged to Register for Legislature Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR)'s Secretary for Home Affairs, David
Lan, today urged Hong Kong eligible voters to register for the
upcoming second legislative councils election and cast their
sacred votes for Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Lan made the appeal at a new year cocktail reception held in
the name of the HKSAR Home Affairs Department and attended by
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and more than 2,800 guests
from all walks of life in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Lan said the year 2000 is important
to Hong Kong since the second legislative council elections are to
be held in September, which fully embodies the spirit of the Basic
Law and honors the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy".
</P>
<P>
Lan hoped more eligible voters would get registered in the
legislative elections and cast their sacred votes for their future.
</P>
<P>
The turnout of the first legislative elections, which was held
in 1998, reached a historic high of 53 percent, Lan said, adding
that he hoped Hong Kong voters could continue to support the
elections and actively involve in the September elections.
</P>
<P>
Lan said though Hong Kong has suffered from the Asian financial
crisis in the past two years, thanks to Hong Kong people's hard
work, the Hong Kong economy now regains growth and the employment
prospect is improving and the Hong Kong society is still full of
energy.
</P>
<P>
As long as Hong Kong people continue to work hard, the Hong
Kong economy will further recover, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti, Sudanese Leaders Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah held talks on Tuesday with visiting Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir on means of enhancing bilateral ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed a number of issues of common
concern, said Kuwaiti Minister of Emiri Diwan Affairs Sheikh Nasser
Mohammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah following the meeting, without giving
further details.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier local media reports, the Kuwaiti-Sudanese
talks were expected to cover ways of promoting the newly-restored
relations and resuming financial and investment opportunities in
Sudan, as well as the issue of Kuwaiti nationals alleged held in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze its diplomatic ties with Sudan over Khartoum's
perceived support for Iraq during the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two Arab countries were normalized after
Sudan's Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail reopened the Sudanese
Embassy in Kuwait last July.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that Bashir also planned to inform the Kuwaiti
leaders on the political development in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir dissolved Sudan's parliament and declared a three-month
state of emergency last December, as a result of power struggle
with Hassan al-Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
secretary general of the ruling National Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese president is expected to end his three-day visit
here on Wednesday. His next stop is Qatar.

<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- An Omani official expressed Oman's support for
retaining the current reduction in oil output by the states in and
outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Omani Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, Mohammed al-Ramhi,
said that his country backed keeping the ongoing production cuts in
a bid to maintain the upward trend in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's oil ministers are to meet in March to discuss whether
these reductions could be continued, the report added.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product (GDP) would
gain 6 percent in 2000 in terms of the current price thanks to the
upward oil price trend and the economic reforms adopted by the
government, a local banking survey pointed out.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi-American Bank study said there are rising opportunities
for Saudi's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) this
year and launch of the economic opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
In view of the rising oil price, Saudi raised its GDP growth
target for this year to 2 percent in real terms and 6 percent in
nominal terms.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Social Impacts of Globalization Addressed  at UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his keynote speech, Director-General of the International
Labor Organization (ILO) Juan Somavia urged governments to deliver
certainty to people through secure and reasonable employment in
this globalized world and policy makers should be sensitive to the
effect of policies on people.
</P>
<P>
The ILO chief said that at present the markets are producing
uncertainties and globalization has produced so wide a level of
anxiety that even people in the mainstream, namely the middle
class, are feeling insecure.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the solution for this is "secure and decent
employment," which means work can provide the ability to educate
children and have a stable family life, a reasonable level of
security and health care as well as a pension after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Somavia's speech triggered a debate on more labor-related
issues, particularly the marginalized participants of the global
workforce -- women and children.
</P>
<P>
Speakers, including representatives from international, non-
governmental and governmental organizations, noted that gains and
advances in women's employment must be balanced against negative
effects.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that most of the rapid employment growth was
initiated by short-term, "footloose" companies which gave very
little protection to female labors.
</P>
<P>
Participants advocated implementing action programs for women
to gain access to and bargain effectively in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Despite debate on the labor issue, globalization and trade
prevailed in the speeches by representatives of regional
organizations and governments.
</P>
<P>
Gerrit Ybema, minister for foreign trade of the Netherlands,
said that developing countries should not be obliged to bear the
sole responsibility for their development.
</P>
<P>
In stead, he said, developed countries and multilateral
institutions have to respond adequately to the needs of the
developing countries that want to integrate into the globalizing
world economy.
</P>
<P>
Lindiwe Hendricks, deputy minister of trade and industry of
South Africa, said globalization is binding our societies and
destinies even more closely and this is relevant to the principle
that development is a shared international responsibility.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the objective of the new round of trade
negotiations must be to address the imbalances.
</P>
<P>
He called for greater transparency in the decision-making
processes of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to help overcome
the flaws of the trading agency.
</P>
<P>
Han Duck-soo, South Korea's minister of trade, said that UNCTAD
should continue to focus its resources and future efforts on
addressing trade and development issues and on promoting openness
in the global market.
</P>
<P>
He suggested UNCTAD work more closely with WTO to sustain and
further promote open trade.
</P>
<P>
Han said that UNCTAD could generate more active discussions on
how developing countries should continue to carry out market-
friendly reforms.
</P>
<P>
Najma Heptulla, president of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)
, presented a declaration adopted by her organization, saying that
mechanisms should be built to guard against a backlash of
globalization and ensure that the benefit of it is widely shared.
</P>
<P>
As for the world trade, she said, under no circumstances should
we allow the improvements in labor and environmental standards and
the respect for human rights to penalize developing countries and
restrict their access to markets.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Approves New Population Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
announced a new population policy Tuesday aimed at population
stabilization by the year 2045 with the continuation of two-child
norm and a proposed freeze on number of seats in the parliament at
the current level.
</P>
<P>
The policy, approved by the cabinet today, outlined 16
promotional and motivational measures for adoption of the small
family norm, Health Minister N. T. Shanmugam told the media after
the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The measures include community level incentives, family welfare
linked with health insurance schemes for families below poverty
line who undergo sterilization after two children, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
A new national commission on population, to be headed by Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, would review the implementation of
the "National Population 2000", Shanmugam said.
</P>
<P>
With an intention to help states "fearlessly pursue" the
population, the government proposed to freeze the number of seats
in Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, at the current level
of 545, which is based on the national census carried in 1971.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the policy were divided into three categories,
the first of which is to meet the "unmet" needs for contraception,
health care infrastructure, health personnel and integrated
service delivery.
</P>
<P>
The "medium term objectives" are to bring the total fertility
rate to replacement levels -- two children per couple -- by the
year 2010 by a vigorous implementation of inter-sectoral
strategies.
</P>
<P>
The long-term objective is to achieve a stable population by
2045, at a level which the government believed will be consistent
with the requirements of economic growth, social development and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The proposed National Commission on Population would include
chief ministers of all states and union territories, central
health minister and other high-ranking officials at other
ministries and departments concerned as well as reputed
demographers, public health professionals and non-governmental
organizations, Shanmugam said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Offering Loan to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Tuesday that South Africa
had not offered a 800 million rand (about 133 million US dollars)
loan to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zuma told South African Press Association in Cape Town: "At the
moment there is no loan that has been made to Zimbabwe by South
Africa."
</P>
<P>
On whether the loan issue had been discussed or whether
Zimbabwe had requested financial assistance from South Africa, she
repeated: "They have not asked for a loan."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zuma admitted that in-depth talks were continuing
between several ministers of the two countries after President
Thabo Mbeki and his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe held
talks on bilateral ties in Harare last week.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is facing a huge fuel and electricity crisis due to
its long- time involvement in the civil war of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. South Africa was worried about the
situation in Zimbabwe, fearing the crisis may even affect the
peace and stability in Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some reports earlier this week said Mbeki had offered the
above- mentioned loan to Mugabe's government for buying fuel from
South African companies.

SEOUL, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Tuesday declared its
first official case of brain death for use as an organ donor after

</P>
<P>
With an agreement with the decedent's parents, the medical
center will use his organs for transplant.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case of brain death in South Korea, since the
implementation of a revised law on organ transplants. The
decedent's organs will be transplanted to patients in Seoul,

ULAN BATOR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Over half a million farm
animals have died as the result of heavy snow and a shortage of
fodder in 11 Mongolian provinces, the State Emergency Commission

BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General George
Robertson will meet acting Russian President Vladimir Putin during
his two-day visit to Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A NATO statement confirmed that the NATO chief is scheduled to
meet Putin after meeting Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The visit was seen here as a possible prelude to the thaw of
NATO-Russia relations that were frozen after the western military
alliance started its air strike campaign against Yugoslavia over
Kosovo last March without heeding the opposition of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
The then Russian prime minister called off his scheduled visit
to Washington while halfway to the United States. Moscow then
recalled its permanent representatives stationed in the NATO
headquarters for weekly consultations with the Cold War foe.
</P>

NATO and Russia forged a new relationship after the two sides

<HEADLINE> EU to Decide on Money Aid on Cyanide Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
on Tuesday that it is still considering ways to help alleviate
problems related to the cyanide spill in Romania and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The earliest decision is expected later this week when European
Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom returned from a fact-
finding trip to the two countries affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
union, was scheduled to discuss the cyanide spill, according to a
commission spokesman. He quoted Commission President Romano Prodi
as saying that the commission deemed it important to discuss the
incident so as to consider how best to coordinate efforts when
disaster of this type occurs in the future.
</P>
<P>
What the commission fears most is not the cyanide spill but
rather problems aggravated by heavy metals such as lead and
mercury that remain in the polluted area for much longer lengths
of time.
</P>
<P>
The European Union can also help the Romanians and Hungarians
evaluate the actual damage caused by the cyanide spill which
occurred on January 30 when a dam at a gold mining firm overflowed.
</P>
<P>
One commission spokesperson said there is no emergency fund
allocated to deal with disasters, but it is possible to use some
of the cohesion money to cope with the environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Both Romania and Hungary are seeking EU membership, and they
often receive cohesion funds to improve their infrastructure and
economy.
</P>
<P>
The cyanide spill originated in the northwestern section of
Romania where the dam at the Baia Mare gold mine overflowed and
caused cyanide to pour into streams that then flowed into the Risa
River, a tributary of the Danube.
</P>
<P>
A cyanide solution is used to separate gold ore from
surrounding rocks.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Continues to Fall in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in the UK fell below
the government's predicted target last month, according to
official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics reported the underlying rate,
which excludes mortgage interest payments and is used by the Bank
of England to set interest rates, fell to 2.1 percent from 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the reduction in the rate of inflation is due
mainly to home loan costs, which were also falling this time last
year as interest rates fell.
</P>
<P>
The figure will heighten demand from business and unions for
interest rates to be left unchanged after last week's rise, the
fourth in six months.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's base rate, which sets the trend for
interest rates throughout the economy, now stands at 6 percent.

<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health Secretary
Alberto Romualdez vowed Tuesday to eradicate leprosy in the
country before the yearend, assuring that there is even enough "
free available drugs" for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said the Health Department is preparing the Leprosy
Control Week from February 21 to 25 to address leprosy cases even
in small islands.
</P>
<P>
He noted in a statement that treatment for minor leprosy would
only take less than 6 months while 12 months for the serious ones.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez added that leprosy patients are not required to take
a vacation during their medication.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said that through the help of the World Health
Organization, the Philippines has reduced leprosy prevalence rate
at the national level to less than one case per 10,000 population
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Records by the Health Department showed that 7,005 Filipinos
were registered leprosy patients in 1998 while an average number
of new cases detected annually is 4000.
</P>
<P>
A person may acquire leprosy through prolonged, close contact
with an infected patient. The risk of acquiring the disease,
however, is minimal because of people's natural immunity.

LUANDA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Brazilian State
of Rio de Janeiro has apologized to the Angolan government for
arbitrary detention of dozens of Angolan nationals by the
Brazilian Federal Police, official news agency Angop reported here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan General Consul in Rio de Janeiro Ismael Diogo da Silva
has received the letter of apology, which recognized that the
Brazilian police were racist and excessive in arresting the
Angolans in the favela town of Nova Holanda, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Rio Anthoni Garotinho also acknowledged that there
was a mistake on the part of the police who made their judgement
based on some unfounded accusations that the Angolans were
involved in narcotic trafficking in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
There was also a rumor that the Angolans had taught the
drug-trafficking groups in the favela town how to exercise
guerrilla tactics.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 Angolans were detained last week by the Brazilian
Federal Police in Rio de Janeiro during a raid on Nova Holanda
involving 1,000 policemen.
</P>
<P>
The detention followed armed clashes between rival drug bands.
As a result of the accident, some Angolan citizens lost their jobs

respect their rights and dignity at all times, regardless of race,
ethnicity, gender, religion, culture, language or sexual
orientation."
</P>

his left arm in an English premier league match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Yes. He'll recover. He has always had very good healing powers,
" his agent Mel Stein said on Tuesday. "I suspect it's not going
to take more than four to six weeks for him to be back again."
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, whose career has been plagued by injuries, was hurt
shortly before halftime during the 4-0 defeat by Aston Villa when
he stuck out his arm to try to get past Villa midfielder George
Boateng.
</P>
<P>
Unluckily for Gascoigne, who often uses his arms and elbows to
muscle his way past an opponent, his arm collided with Boateng's
head and he left the field in tears before being taken to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The incident evoked memories of another self-inflicted injury
during Gascoigne's career when he wrecked his knee playing for
Tottenham Hotspur in the 1991 F.A. Cup Final after a reckless
challenge on Forest defender Gary Charles.
</P>
<P>
That injury, and a subsequent later fall which inflamed the
original injury, put him out of soccer for a year before a move to
Lazio in Italy where he later broke a leg in training.
</P>
<P>
This latest injury could well hasten Gascoigne's move from
Middlesbrough -- especially if they continue to slide down the
premier league table and end up in the first division next season.
</P>
<P>
He has previously been linked with a move to a club in the
United States.

<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Urban dwellers in Beijing now
have more living space, as the per capita housing area reached 15.
4 sq m at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Liu Qi said at today's session of the municipal People's
Congress that another eight million sq m of housing to be

<P>
The local government will carry on the protection of cultural
ruins and areas with long-time development during the course of
renovating ancient buildings, trying to preserve the historic
integrity of these areas, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The reform in housing funding has inspired the citizens to buy
their houses and apartments.
</P>
<P>
To improve people's living conditions, the city government
spent 35.39 billion yuan (about 4.33 billion U.S. dollars) to
build another 15.20 million sq m of housing, an increase of 40
percent over 1998, and with 1.22 million sq m being low-cost
apartment buildings.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Ezer Weizman will not be indicted over his ties
with French businessman Edouard Seroussi, who gave the president a
cash gift and allegedly maintained business ties with him, State
Attorney Edna Arbel indicated Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although he appeared relieved to hear Arbel's words, Weizman
refused to comment on whether or not he plans to resign when the
investigation is over. He has repeatedly said that he will await
Arbel's report before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Buoyed by the opinion of Arbel that he would not be indicted,
Weizman resumed his full working schedule Monday, dealing with 25
requests for amnesty and reducing the sentences of individuals
serving life terms.
</P>
<P>
The Seroussi affair had led to Weizman's decision to set aside
all the plans for an early retirement. After consultation with his
family and close aides, he reportedly decided to remain in office
until at least the end of the year and, if his health permits, he
will serve out his full term until the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak Monday reiterated his pledge to
pull Israeli troops out of southern Lebanon by July, even if no
agreement is reached with Syria. Meanwhile, United States President
Bill Clinton said there are some difficulties in the Middle East
peace process but he is optimistic regarding chance for a
settlement between Israel and Syria and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak laid out his priorities Monday on the diplomatic front
for the upcoming months: peace with Lebanon and Syria on top with
the Palestinians track taking a back seat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to members of his One Israel faction in the parliament,
Barak said the battle today is over Lebanon and on the nature of
the arrangement with Syria, and after that it will be about the
nature of the arrangements with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unwilling to Guarantee Turkey on JSF Workshare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- As Turkey seeks to upgrade its
status in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) the U.S. is to develop,
Washington has stated that it could not guarantee any workshare for
Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News on tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was a great disappointment to Ankara. The U.S., however,
said that Turkish industrialists should convince their U.S.
partners to let them take a piece of the project.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which is currently participating as a "Foreign Military
Sales Major Participant" in the JDF program, has expressed interest
in entering into a cooperative agreement with the U.S. as a partner
in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase of the
project.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Defense Industries Undersecretariat, in cooperation
with the U.S. companies competing in the JSF project, held a two-
day meeting on February 14-15 in Ankara to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from the JSF program briefed the participants
Monday that "the U.S. government cannot make any commitment to
countries concerning workshare. This is something to be done from
industry to industry."
</P>
<P>
Turkey wants to replace its oldest batch of 160 F-16s, which
will come to the end of their service lives around 2015, with the
JSF. The to-be-developed 21st century fighter plane is among the U.
S. major programs for modernizing combat aircraft.
</P>
<P>
JSF development is expected to begin in 2001, with first
deliveries planned for 2007-2010. The JSF will also replace F-4s,
F-5s and F-18s.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia with Moderate Foreign Debts: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's foreign debts
accounted for 59 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by
the end of September last year, which was at a moderate level by a
World Bank ruling, Deputy Finance Minister Shafie Mohamed Salleh
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the World Bank ruling, a country was categorized as a
country with moderate debts if its debts amounted to between 48
and 80 percent of its GDP. If a country's debts are below 48
percent it is considered a country with low debts and if the debts
exceed 80 percent of the GDP then it is a nation with high debts,
he told the House of Representatives here during Question Time.
</P>
<P>
He told the House that up to the end of September, Malaysia's
total external debts amounted to 165.6 billion ringgit (about 43.
578 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, private sector debts amounted to 90.1 billion
ringgit (about 23.71 billion dollars) and public sector debts were
75.5 billion ringgit (about 19.868 billion dollars), according to
the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that to overcome the country's external debt problem,
the government had made prepayments on a selective basis, thus not
only reducing the external debts, but also bringing down debt
servicing charges.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is always monitoring developments in the
international financial market and looking for opportunities to
get new loans with better conditions to pay off existing debts.
</P>
<P>
Private sector bodies intending to borrow more than 5 million
ringgit (about 1.315 million dollars) from external sources are
required to get approval from Bank Negara (State Bank), he said,
adding approval will only be given if the loans are to finance
productive activities or strategic products and for purposes of
investment which will generate adequate foreign exchange to pay
off the loan.

<HEADLINE> Asia to Play Key Role in Nuclear Disarmament: U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Asia can and must play a
crucial role in building support for the global norm of nuclear
disarmament, said a U.N. disarmament official here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the future of the global nuclear disarmament
and non-proliferation regimes can be influenced by developments in
Asia, said Jayantha Dhanapala, under-secretary-general for
disarmament affairs of the United Nations at a regional
disarmament meeting that began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is a region of both extraordinary possibilities and
extraordinary risks " in nuclear non-proliferation, said Dhanapala
in his opening address at the 12th Regional Disarmament Meeting in
Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala told the meeting that while global military
expenditures declined during the past decade, Asia, which houses
the largest population in the world, saw an increase of 27 percent
in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the leaders of the region must place nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation high on their list of priorities,
Dhanapala said.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala also stressed the importance of public understanding
and participation in the strive for nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation.

<HEADLINE> ILO Chief on Social Implications of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Governments should deliver
certainty to people through secure and reasonable employment in
this globalized world and policy makers should be sensitive to the
effect of policies on people, chief of the U.N. labor agency said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Somavia, director general of the International Labor
Organization (ILO), discussed the social implication of
globalization at the interactive debate during the 10th session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
At present the markets are producing uncertainties and
globalization has produced a much wider level of anxiety, Somavia
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said this is not inevitable as the policies that
accompanied the information revolution are man-made and so can be
changed.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the solution for this is secure and decent
employment, which means work which provides the ability to educate
children, a stable family life, a reasonable level of security and
health care, adequate working and a pension after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Economic and social policy should be considered in conjunction,
he said, describing as "not true" the belief that if people got
the economy right the society would fall into place.
</P>
<P>
The interactive discussion at the UNCTAD X focused on labor
issues and marginalized participants of the global workforce --
women and children.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from governments and international and non-
governmental organizations noted that rapid employment growth was
mostly initiated by short-term, "footloose" companies that gave
little protection to women's labor, and that the global economy
must be more supportive of issues of women's work.

<P>
On the occasion, he also rejected the canvassing from some
people of making Nigeria a confederation or setting up such
institutions as the " Sovereign National Conference."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot have sovereignty within a sovereignty. And Nigeria's
 sovereignty is now reposed in the executive, legislative and to
some extent the judicial arms of the government... so if anybody
wants anything outside that, as we have it now, it will be
unconstitutional."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Assured of Environmental Safety in Plane Retrieval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has been assured that the retrieval work of a Sudanese cargo plane
which plunged into Lake Victoria early this month will not pose
danger to the environment, the Guardian newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's Aviation, a London-based company supervising the
up-hill task which began last Saturday to salvage the ill-fated
craft, has assured Tanzania Airports Authority that there would
not be any environmental damage during the retrieval of the
damaged aircraft.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts to pull out the cargo plane which plunged in
Tanzania's northwest Mwanza Region hit a snag on Monday after
water entered the Boeing 707 broken fuselage Sunday night, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Water washed into the plane after it was hit by strong waves,
Mwanza Airport Manager Deogratias Malongo was quoted as
confirming.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the plane, owned by Trans Arabian Air
Transport of Khartoum, Sudan, had about 3,000 liters of fuel in
its tanks when it crash-landed on the lake.
</P>
<P>
The plane submerged on February 3 about 100 meters from the
shores of Lake Victoria, the largest in Africa, about three
kilometers from Mwanza Airport runaway.
</P>
<P>
All five crew members escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the plane, which plunged 50 meters into the water,
would be pulled onto a flat terrain, some two kilometers from the
lake, where the fuel would be pumped out of the plane's tanks.
</P>
<P>
The removal exercise would be done carefully to ensure that the
fuel would not be spilled into the lake, they said.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-eight percent of Zambian
 Tuberculosis (TB) patients in the 20-40 age group are found HIV
positive, according to a report by the Post newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Danish Association for International
Co-operation 1999 country program review as saying that the urban
areas of Zambia are more affected by the TB problem.
</P>
<P>
In the rural setting, the HIV/AIDS rate is in the range of
11-14 percent, higher than the 10 percent HIV country prevalence
level recommended by the World Bank, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the review, HIV prevalence is over 28 percent in
Zambian urban centers and 13.6 percent in the countryside, with an
estimated 19.7 percent of the entire adult population having been
infected.
</P>
<P>
"The high rate of HIV infection in the urban areas is
particularly important because of Zambia's large urban
population," it said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Central Statistics Office, the review said more
than 1.5 million Zambians are expected to die of HIV/AIDS by the
next 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Continue Import of Used Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday assured that the government would not ban the
importation of used vehicles, according to a report by This Day
newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president offered the assurance at a forum organized to
deliberate on the problems of the nation's automobile industry in
the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He said the present administration could not consider an
outright ban because Nigerians have been so impoverished that only
very few could buy new cars.
</P>
<P>
While the government is unsatisfied with the current 90:10
ratio of used to new cars imported into the country, it could not
consider an outright ban on such used cars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo noted that given the crucial role of road
transportation to the nation's economy and the country's
rapidly-growing population, it is very important for Nigeria to
develop its local vehicle assembly and manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
While the government fully subscribed to the ideals of global
trade liberalization, it did not intend to abandon the nation's
infant industries to stronger foreign interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the Nigerian government would offer
all necessary assistance and protection to Peugeot Automobiles
Nigeria Limited and Anambra Motor Manufacturing Company, which are
the only survivors out of the six vehicle assembly plants
established in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is encouraged by the decision of Daimler
Crysler to make Nigeria the company's assembling and manufacturing
center of trucks and buses in Africa as well as the current
interest shown by Honda and Volvo.
</P>
<P>
He urged investors in automobile assembly in the country to
look beyond Nigeria to the entire Economic Community of West
African States market for potential outlets for their products.

Laboratory analysis has shown that the amount of cholera
bacteria in the river is at an unsafe level, the coordinator was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maleko said that a campaign has been launched to warn residents
against drinking unboiled water from the river.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 250 kilograms of chlorine, a chemical used
in treating water, have been sent to several districts in the
capital city and will be sprinkled in shallow wells.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is a major threat to Tanzanians. Official statistics
show that Tanzania has been worse affected by the disease in the
past three years than any other country in Africa, with over
50,000 cases and more than 3, 000 deaths reported.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is transmitted by poor hygiene from one person to
another, or people can pick it up from dirty water or the soil
clinging to vegetables.

<HEADLINE> WWF Calls for Immediate Government Action on Toxic Spill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Wild Fund for Nature
(WWF) has urged Romania and Hungary to take immediate actions on
the pollution of a catastrophic toxic spill into rivers in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We've experienced enough delays already," said WWF Hungary
Conservation director Gyorgy Gado. "The time for the two
governments to act is now, not next week, and not next month."
</P>
<P>
The WWF urged the governments of the two countries not to
underestimate the seriousness of the spill and to provide full
support to specialists in both countries, enabling them to assess
the environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
According to the WWF, the spill, which reached the Danube in
Yugoslavia Monday, originated in Baia Mare, north-western Romania,
after a dam of a tailing lagoon owned by an Australia, Romania
joint ventured gold mine broke up on January 30.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 cubic meters of toxic sludge contaminated with
cyanides and heavy metals spilled into the Lapus and Somes rivers,
and reached the Hungarian border several days later.
</P>
<P>
The spill killed all aquatic life in Hungary's upper Tisza
river, endangering people living on the river banks, the WWF said.
</P>
<P>
"We first need to move quickly to properly assess the level of
the damage, secondly implement a recovery plan, and thirdly start
looking at what needs to be done to prevent similar accidents in
future," said Gado.
</P>
<P>
The upper Tisza is an extremely diverse freshwater ecosystem.
Of the 29 species of protected fish in Hungary, 19 of them can be
found in this stretch of the river, said the WWF.
</P>
<P>
So far over 100 tons of dead fish have been collected from the
river's surface, but many more are believed to be lying on the
river bottom. In addition to those species directly affected by
the toxic spill, there is a secondary danger to all species which
feed on anything living in the river, including birds, for example
the white-tailed sea eagle.
</P>
<P>
"This spill has, in practical terms, eradicated all life from a
stretch of up to 400 kilometers of the Tisza river," added Gado. "
We won't know the real extent of the damage until an evaluation
can be carried out in spring, but we know already that the
rehabilitation of the river will take decades. The sooner we can
fully assess the impact of the spill, the sooner we will know what
it will take to recover what has been lost."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WWF said that it called on the European
Commission last week to follow up recommendations made last year
for preventing similar accidents within the European Union.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Discover Terrorist Strategy in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- French troops serving in the
United Nations multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR)
have discovered a terrorist strategy to launch urban guerrilla
warfare in the northern Kosovo city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French military sources in
Kosovo as saying on Tuesday that French troops seized on Monday in
the southern part Kosovska Mitrovica a large quantity of arms,
including 10 rocket launchers, more than 80 grenades and thousands
of ammunitions.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the Kosovska Mitrovica is inhabited by
ethnic Albanians, while the northern part is exclusively populated
by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Tension rose abruptly along the diving line of the city, the
river Ibar, after two Serbs were killed in an attack upon a bus of
the U.N. High Commission for Refugees on February 2 and a grenade
attack was made against a Serb bar on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jean-Philippe Bernard, commander of the French
motorized infantry brigade in charge of security in the city, said
on Tuesday that KFOR is faced with the threat of urban guerrilla
warfare.
</P>
<P>
General Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, commander of KFOR's
Multinational Brigade of North, said the French troops were
particularly targeted by snipers who have the objective of ``
shooting to kill.''
</P>
<P>
Two French soldiers were injured on Sunday by snipers in
Kosovka Mitrovica in the first attack against KFOR in Kosovo since
the multinational force entered the Yugoslav province on June 12.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian sniper was killed and five injured by French troops
in the shoot-out which lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
French officers said that the attackers apparently had
professional military training and experience as they were good at
shooting while running.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Le Monde on Monday, the U.N. Civil
Administrator in Kosovo Bernard Kouchner accused ``extremists'' of
trying to sabotage the peace process in the province.

<HEADLINE> French Impressionist Painter Likely to Join Pantheon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The French impressionist painter
Claude Monet is likely to be the next Frenchman to join Pantheon,
the temple dedicated to the greatest citizens of France, according
to the daily Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro said that rumors have been spreading among French
high circles that the ashes of Monet would be transferred to
Pantheon, because he is not only the founder of the impressionist
school, but also a man who stood up for justice.
</P>
<P>
Like Victor Hugo and Emile Zola, both of whom are enshrined in
the Pantheon, Monet also went into exile for a period of time
because of discontent with the political situation at home, said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Monet left France for Britain in 1899 to protest the
persecution of Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus and writer Zola
by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1840 in Paris, Monet died in the small village of
Giverny, Normandy, in 1924. His best known paintings are "
Sleeping Nympheas."

<HEADLINE> Putin Approved as Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Russia's Central Election
Commission (CEC) Tuesday approved Acting President Vladimir
Putin's registration as a candidate for the presidential election
due in late March, which he enters as the most hot favorite.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which has so far registered two of the 15
candidates, unanimously voted for Putin's application and said he
had provided the necessary documents including half a million
supporters' signatures and evidence of income and property.
</P>
<P>
"Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin is now an official
presidential candidate," said a CEC spokesman after the voting for
registering Putin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Putin's income and property statement is correct and accurate,
as those of his family members are, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Only 3,689 of 250,000 signatures in the acting president's
support were invalidated for various reasons in a random check, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The CEC is also due to examine the candidature of Aman Tuleyev,
the communist governor of Siberia's Kemerovo region.
</P>
<P>
Putin took over as the head of state after Boris Yeltsin's New
Year's Eve resignation and has a big lead over his rivals, based
mostly on his uncompromising stand against Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
A weekend opinion poll gave him 48 percent, short of the 50
percent needed for outright victory on the first ballot, with his
main rival, Communist Party chairman Gennady Zyuganov, a distant
second on 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Others in the field have little chance to win. Some
politicians who might once have harbored presidential ambitions
have pledged support to Putin.
</P>
<P>
Only Zyuganov and Social Democrat Alexei Podberyozkin have
been registered so far. Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's file is
to be examined on Thursday. Also to be considered within the next
week is liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky.

<HEADLINE> China Launches New Drive to Protect Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China formally kicked off a
publicity campaign today to raise public awareness of the need to
protect the country's forests and green areas.
</P>
<P>
Themed "Protect the Green Space and Care for the Forest", the
drive will focus on environmental protection in western regions of
the country in line with the state's strategy of developing the
west.
</P>
<P>
Initiated last July, the promotional event has already held a
series of activities associated with afforestation, forest
protection and erosion control, which were well-received by the
general public.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said that the drive
should be long-term as it is important and has proved successful.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government recently placed unprecedented emphasis
on forest and ecological environmental protection in face of
declining forest coverage and serious soil erosion. It has made a
series of major decisions in this regard and earmarked more
funding than before.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the campaign's opening ceremony, Vice-Chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee Zhao Nanqi said that many problems
still exist in China's forest protection, citing the most
egregious as the lack of enthusiasm for environmental protection
among the general public and some local officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that forest and ecological environmental protection
needs the support of all of society, and the media can play an
important role in providing universal coverage of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The drive was sponsored by CPPCC's Subcommittee on Human
Resources and Environment, the National Afforestation Committee,
the State Administration of Forestry, the State Administration of
Radio, Film and Television and the China Afforestation Fund.

<HEADLINE> China Standardizes Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China took a major step
forward to standardize its treasury bond issuance market by
selecting 66 financial institutions to undertake the sales of all
T-bonds to be issued this year.
</P>
<P>
This groundbreaking move has changed the Chinese government's
practice of selecting different institutions for separate issuance
of T-bonds each year.
</P>
<P>
The 66 institutions signing contracts with the Ministry of
Finance today include commercial banks, Rural Credit Cooperative
Unions, insurance companies and securities companies.
</P>
<P>
They qualified for membership in the group selling T-bonds for
2000 after undergoing government scrutiny of capital, finance, T-
bond sales and trade of bonds.
</P>
<P>
A press official with the Ministry of Finance said that the
establishment of the group to sell T-bonds laid a solid foundation
for standardizing T-bond issuance and marks a major step forward
in this regard.

</P>
<P>
Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy Secretary of State, will lead the U.
S. delegation to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On recently-found hackers in U.S. and Japanese websites, Zhu
said that China's stance against all forms of computer crimes and
bad behaviors "is clear as ever."
</P>
<P>
"network service providers suffered great losses and the normal
operation of subscribers were also seriously affected," he said,
adding that the Chinese government has noticed the occurrence of
massive hacker assault.
</P>
<P>
He described "net economy" one of the major factors
contributing to the sustained growth of the economy. "Network
security, under such circumstances, is of great importance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that in the amendment to China's Criminal Law,
articles were added to stipulate the criminal punishment terms
against computer crimes. In a regulation issued by the Ministry of
Public Security and approved by the State Council on computer
network security, there are also provisions prohibiting any
individual or unit from illegally accessing others' network,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The facts clearly demonstrate that "the Chinese government and
relevant departments have taken firm action to protect the safety
of the computer network," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Internet is yet to "take off" in China, he said, a good
environment is "more than necessary" for the sound development of
the business.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Outer space belongs to all of
mankind, therefore all countries have the equal right to explore
and use outer space for peaceful purposes, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at a press conference today, Zhu said
that it should be noted that attempts, plans and actions by a
single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer
space exist and are being further developed.
</P>
<P>
If this is not prohibited, he added, it is likely that weapons
will be employed in outer space in the near future, which could
lead to a multilateral arms race in space.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is realistic and urgent for the international
community to take measures to prevent the further development of
such a situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called "Sino-Russian joint opposition to an arms
race in outer space", Zhu said that it is inaccurate to say that,
because countries in addition to China and Russia also oppose an
arms race in space.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 54th General Assembly of the United Nations
overwhelmingly passed a resolution on the prevention of an arms
race in outer space, with 162 countries voting in favor of the
resolution, reflecting the common aspiration of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, as the only
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, should make a new
contribution to the conclusion of international legal articles on
the prevention of arms race in outer space, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the G8 summit to be held in Japan this July, Zhu
said China believes that the Group of Eight (G8) can play a bigger
role in North-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China hopes the G8 will play an even more active role in
enhancing international cooperation, promoting stability and
economic development, and narrowing the gap between the South and
the North, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
China has always advocated that consultation, coordination and
decision-making on global issues should have wide representation,
he added. "The G8 should listen to other countries' opinions,
especially those from the developing countries," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> S'pore for Giving More Opportunities to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries should be
able to leapfrog the development process by developing a niche in
the production chain and by providing the right basics, a senior
Singaporean official said here Tuesday at a United Nations meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ow Chin Hock, minister of state for foreign affairs of
Singapore,made the point in a general debate at the 10th session
of the U.N.Conference on Trade and Development which opened here
on February 12.
</P>
<P>
"In the pursuit of freer competition, developing countries
have accepted more stringent conditions of multilateral trading
rules,but ironically they are left with fewer options and economic
choices particularly in pursuing a policy of infant industry
protection by the state," Ow said.
</P>
<P>
And the fast pace of change, prompted by globalization and the
advance in information and telecommunication technology, has
severely limited the choice of economic instruments of change, and
drastically shortened the response time needed for adjustment, Ow
said.
</P>
<P>
Those countries which are unwilling and unequipped to be
plugged into the international economic system have to face the
risk of being further marginalized, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Globalization may also lead to a economic paradox for
developing economies, Ow said, noting that while the importance of
the nation state has shrunk, the role of the government has become
increasingly vital in bringing about the legal foundations, the
social infrastructure and the macroeconomic policy for investment
and growth as well as preparing the citizenry for change, the
Singaporean minister said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the dilemma, developing countries now have fewer
economic choices and development options and have to face a
systemic crisis, that is, how to pull themselves out of this
dilemma and pursue a sustainable growth path in a stable and
conducive international environment.
</P>
<P>
Ow called for setting up a rules-based multilateral trading
system to provide a stable and predictable international
environment where even the smallest countries are protected from
discrimination and unilateral actions.
</P>
<P>
In the new millennium, the minister concluded, the question for
both developing countries and developed countries is not whether
one can opt out but whether a constructive and meaningful way
could be found to ensure that globalization does not award the
winners only, but that the weak and the vulnerable are also given
opportunities to compete and to benefit from the process.

<HEADLINE> World Lawmakers Against Linking Trade With Other Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's Parliamentarians
agree that labor, environmental and human rights issues should not
be linked to trade to restrict market access of developing
countries, Najma Heptullas, President of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union (IPU), said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark when presenting the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) a
declaration adopted by the IPU at a meeting held beforehand.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 members from over 50 parliaments agreed in
consensus that under no circumstances should the world allow
improvements in labor and environmental standards as well as
respect for human rights to penalize developing countries and
restrict their access to markets.
</P>
<P>
The declaration voiced concern of parliamentarians of the world
on globalization, saying it creates new opportunities for economic
achievement but also generate some ill effects.
</P>
<P>
The legislators said that mechanisms should be built to ensure
that the benefits of globalization are widely shared among the
peoples of the world, and between developed and developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also called for more transparency in international
relations,saying there are too many hidden agendas now.
</P>
<P>
As for the world finance for the poorer countries, the
parliamentarians said in their declaration that some practical
measures should be taken, such as wiping out the external debt
more extensively and increasing the levels of official development
assistance flows.
</P>
<P>
Heptullas said the declaration serves as a call on parliaments
and their members to become more closely involved in the
international processes relating to trade, finance and development.
</P>
<P>
Legislators are convinced that "greater parliamentary
involvement can only be beneficial to development," she added.

<HEADLINE> EU Starts Accession Talks With Six More Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union started
enlargement negotiations Tuesday with six more countries on their
bid to join the western bloc.
</P>
<P>
The six countries are Malta, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Bulgaria. The six have thus joined Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus in the accession
process, raising to 12 the number of countries formally
negotiating EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The European Union heads of state decided last December to
invite the six countries to enter enlargement negotiations. They
also made Turkey a formal candidate country for membership
although excluding it from serious talks for now.
</P>
<P>
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia and
Cyprus started their accession talks almost two years ago with the
15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks, the EU is scheduled to present to the
six countries its general negotiating framework while the
candidate countries are expected to outline their own general
approach for the accession negotiations.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson will arrive in Moscow Tuesday evening for a working
visit, the first meeting of a high-ranking NATO official with
Russian leaders after the Kremlin froze ties with the alliance
last year.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Robertson is expected to hold talks with Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev,
said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Yakovenko
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that a meeting between Russian Acting
President Vladimir Putin and Robertson is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Russia "views the upcoming talks as an opportunity to
undertake a substantive joint analysis of the problems that have
complicated Russia-NATO relations over the past year, and to
exchange ideas on ways of putting them back on the track of
constructive cooperation," Yakovenko said.
</P>
<P>
Angered by NATO's eastward enlargement, Moscow froze relations
last March when the Atlantic alliance began an 11-week bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Prevention of Arms Race in Outer Space Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Outer space belongs to all of
mankind, therefore all countries have the equal right to explore
and use outer space for peaceful purposes, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question at a press conference this afternoon,
Zhu said that it should be noted that attempts, plans and actions
by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in
outer space exist and are being further developed.
</P>
<P>
If this is not prohibited, he added, it is likely that weapons
will be employed in outer space in the near future, which could
lead to a multilateral arms race in space.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is realistic and urgent for the international
community to take measures to prevent the further development of
such a situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the so-called "Sino-Russian joint opposition to an arms
race in outer space", Zhu said that it is inaccurate to say that,
because countries in addition to China and Russia also oppose an
arms race in space.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 54th General Assembly of the United Nations
overwhelmingly passed a resolution on the prevention of an arms
race in outer space, with 162 countries voting in favor of the
resolution, reflecting the common aspiration of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, as the only
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, should make a new
contribution to the conclusion of international legal articles on
the prevention of arms race in outer space, he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Reform Banking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam this year will make
efforts to improve the quality of operations in its banking
industry by implementing 12 banking reform projects to rearrange
the banking system, supervision and the inspection mechanism, the
Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Six projects will concentrate on rearrangement of the banking
system, namely to readjust the operation of banking businesses,
rearrange joint stock commercial banks, strengthen state-owned
commercial banks, establish banks specializing in preferential
loan provision, set up a company to handle debts, and equitize a
number of companies under the Gem and Gold Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Vietnam has in recent years cooperated with
local authorities to start rearranging joint stock commercial
banks and plans to continue the work in the upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
In order to make a basic change in credit quality and reduce
the rate of overdue debts, the banking industry of the country has
restructured unprofitable debts of all state-owned commercial and
joint stock banks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
A special bank to provide loans under state social policies
will be soon built and put into operation in order to clarify the
role of commercial banks and raise their business efficiency in
the capital market.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Co-operate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) has urged African countries to
co-operate and build necessary infrastructure to sustain their
domestic economies, a Zambian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Individually, African economies could not sustain themselves
and they must integrate to build necessary infrastructure such as
transport and communication , EAC director of programs Samba Jack
was quoted by the Post newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that African states must provide good governance as
a necessary framework for private sector and civil society
participation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECA deputy executive secretary Lalla Ben Barka noted
that with the southern African region being adversely affected by
the HIV/AIDS scourge, there is need for integration and pooling of
resources for sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Barka led a team of ECA officials to Zambia last week to review
the commission's work in southern Africa in the past two years,
particularly the work of the Sub-Regional Development Center for
Southern Africa, which aims to foster regional integration and
promote international co-operation for Africa's development.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Afforestation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
increase the area and reserve of forests this year despite a
global trend of shrinking forest resources, a top Chinese
afforestation official said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Administration of Forestry,
said that China's forest reserve has continuously increased over
the past years.
</P>
<P>
He called this a "historic achievement," because the logging
industry turned out 2.2 billion cubic meters of wood in the same
period of time.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the country will focus on key afforestation
projects in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow
rivers. These projects will play a major role in helping the
country reach a turning point in its long-term strategy to develop
the west.
</P>
<P>
The country will continue to rein in desertification of lands
in the western parts of China by planting trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
It will also accelerate the establishment of natural forest
reserves in the northeast and Inner Mongolia in the north, reduce
logging and put a strict limit on the output of the logging
industry.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the country will develop a number of afforestation
bases to produce fast-growing trees, raw materials and valuable
building materials.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country will continue to fine-tune the legal
system and use advanced technology to protect forests and wildlife.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Intensifies Fight Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will continue
intensifying the fight against smuggling, although the smuggling
and trade frauds appeared to decrease in 1999 on a national scale
in the country.
</P>
<P>
This trend was reported at a conference held by the Vietnamese
government in Ho Chi Minh City on Monday under the chairmanship of
Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, according to Vietnam's
official news agency VNA.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the police force, the customs service and the market
control force of the country discovered 110,175 cases of smuggling,
trade frauds, transportation and stocking of illicit commodities
and other illegal business activities.
</P>
<P>
The seized goods were worth an estimated 950 billion Vietnamese
dong (roughly 68 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, a number of locations in central provinces of the
country are still "hot spots."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Dung told the conference that the
Vietnamese government is determined to strengthen its efforts to
combat these illegal activities in 2000 as one way to assist
domestic production.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the fight should be considered a regular task
which requires close coordination among Party organizations,
agencies and authorities at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the conference, including representatives of
relevant ministries, agencies and local areas, focused their
discussion on measures to intensify the battle against smuggling,
trade frauds and fake goods in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) Tuesday raised alert level
of Mayon volcano from level 2 to level 3 following the volcano's
apparent build-up of activity.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs said in a bulletin that alert level 3 means that
an eruption is likely if the present trend of relatively high
volcanic unrest is sustained.
</P>
<P>
However, the Phivolcs stressed, no further areas are
recommended for evacuation other than in the previously delineated
6-kilometer-danger zone around the volcano in the central
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
During this stage of unrest the existing danger zones should be
evacuated at all times and no visits should be made in these areas
until further notice, said the Phivolcs.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs also reminded residents beyond but near the danger
zones to be extra alert and aware of loose debris that may be
dislodged from the summit and upper slopes of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
The 2,462-meter Mayon volcano has erupted at least 40 times
since 1616. Mayon last erupted in February 1993 and killed 77
people.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Farm Output Forecast to Drop 17 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Poor prices for grain and
cotton have cut summer crop plantings in Australia, with
production expected to be down 17 percent to 3.99 million tons,
the country's official commodities forecaster said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its February crop report, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) again revised down its
forecast for summer crop plantings.
</P>
<P>
"The area planted to summer crops in 1999-2000 has fallen
sharply to 1.4 million hectares because of the relatively poor
price outlook for grain and cotton," ABARE's Executive Director
Brian Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
That's down 18 percent on last year's summer plantings of 1.7
million hectares, and also down slightly on the 1.5 million
hectares ABARE projected in November.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the harvest is also forecast to drop substantially.
</P>
<P>
"Total summer crop production in 1999-2000 is estimated to be
17 percent lower than the record 1998-99 crop," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
"Areas planted to the two main summer crops, sorghum and cotton,
have been reduced and are estimated to produce 1.3 million tons
and one million tons respectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ABARE now estimates the summer crop harvest at 3.99 million
tons, compared with last year's 4.80 million tons.
</P>
<P>
This depends on further rains in some key growing areas, but
the official outlook for the next two months is for above average
rains across the grain belt of the New South Wales state, the
southeast Queensland state and the Western Australia state.
</P>
<P>
"If this rainfall is received, summer crops should have a
favorable growing season and 2000-2001 winter crops should have
adequate soil moisture for planting in most regions," the ABARE
said.

<HEADLINE> Drowning Toll in Zimbabwe Hits 153 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and thirteen
Zimbabweans have drowned countrywide during the past six weeks,
bringing the season's death toll to 153, the daily Herald
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted police spokesman Chief superintendent Wayne
Bvudzijena as saying on Monday it is sad that people continued to
die after disregarding simple safety precautions.
</P>
<P>
Bvudzijena called on people to avoid crossing flooded rivers,
saying no journey was worth risking life for.
</P>
<P>
"Venturing into flooded rivers can end up in tragedy," he
warned. "when you are trapped on one side of the river, seek
shelter there and only cross when it is safe to do so."
</P>
<P>
He urged parents and guardians, especially those living near
rivers, dams and wells, to watch over their children.
</P>
<P>
"Children must also be monitored because they do not usually
know the dangers of water," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on primary and high school authorities to ensure that
school children receive basic swimming training at schools.
</P>
<P>
Drowning cases in Zimbabwe have been on the increase in recent
years, with 320 cases reported during the previous rainy season
and 290 in 1997.

LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has

<HEADLINE> Trucks Reach All-Time High in U.S. Registered Vehicle Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Trucks now account for
more than 39 percent of all 1999 registered vehicles in the United
States, an all-time record, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
While trucks traditionally have lasted longer than cars, due to
lower scrappage rates, the primary driver of its growth has been
the boom in new light truck sales -- which currently account for
nearly 49 percent of the light vehicle market in the United States,
said the report from the Polk Company, a U.S. firm that delivers
intelligence to the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Of the almost 210 million vehicles in operation in 1999, 39.4
percent were trucks. In 1994, trucks accounted for 35.4 percent of
all registered vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Polk's figures also show that the average growth rate of trucks
in the 1990s was 4.5 percent, compared with 0.3 percent of cars.
</P>
<P>
"Because we have reached the average of one vehicle for every
adult, it is likely that vehicles in operation will continue to
grow at lower rate in the future," Polk said.
</P>
<P>
Polk's analysis also found that, although trucks have been the
key to growth in the U.S. overall vehicle market, cars have shown
the greatest improvement in durability. In fact, car scrappage
rates have dropped 40 percent in the last 30 years, from 9.5
percent in 1970 to 5.7 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> China's Stance against Computer Crimes Clear: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao told a regular press conference here today
that China's stance against all forms of computer crimes and bad
behaviors "is clear as ever."
</P>
<P>
Recently, a number of U.S. websites and Japanese government
websites were severely attacked by hackers, in which "network
service providers suffered great losses and the normal operation
of subscribers were also seriously affected," he said, adding that
the Chinese government has noticed the occurrence of massive
hacker assault.
</P>
<P>
He described "net economy" one of the major factors
contributing to the sustained growth of the economy. "Network
security, under such circumstances, were of great importance," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that in the amendment to China's Criminal Law,
articles were added to stipulate the criminal punishment terms
against computer crimes. In a regulation issued by the Ministry of
Public Security and approved by the State Council on computer
network security, there are also provisions prohibiting any
individual or unit for illegally accessing into others' network,
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The facts clearly demonstrate that "the Chinese government and
relevant departments have taken firm action to protect the safety
of the computer network," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Internet is yet to "take-off" in China, he said, a good
environment is "more than necessary" for the sound development of
the business.
</P>
<P>
"Any indecent behavior is not welcomed," he added.

<HEADLINE> Media Appeals for Minimizing Pressure on Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers across China
today published lengthy front-page articles discussing the recent
case of a high school student who killed his mother, urging
teachers to ease up on the workload and pressure on students.
</P>
<P>
Xu Li, 17, a middle school sophomore in east China's Zhejiang
Province, was one of the top 10 students in his class. His mother,
Wu Fengxian, a food company employee, demanded that he be among
the best in his class every term.
</P>
<P>
Last November, when Xu's class rank dropped to 18th, his mother
told the teenager he could no longer play football in his spare
time, but had to study.
</P>
<P>
Xu became depressed, feeling that his mother was too strict. On
January 17 this year, Xu wanted to watch a TV program after lunch
and his mother forbid it, insisting that he study instead. Xu
shouted at her, grabbed a hammer and struck her in the back of the
head, killing her instantly.
</P>
<P>
The Guangming Daily carried a prominent story on the tragedy,
saying that is important for all parents to guide their children
so that they will become valuable members of society.
</P>
<P>
"Parents are play an integral role in the development of
children's emotional education, and so, parents, as well as
schools and society as a whole should do their part in improving
the education system," the article emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In modern-day China's educational system, students are placed
under enormous pressure to score high marks that will get them
into a prestigious university and eventually an ideal job.
</P>
<P>
The overseas edition of the People's Daily pointed out in a
page one analysis that strengthening the emotional growth of the
country's young people should be at the top of the country's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that schools should do more to relieve the
burden of students and help the young people to gain a healthy
outlook on life, world outlook and concept of values.
</P>
<P>
A document the Ministry of Education issued Monday urged
educators throughout the country to include courses on law and
discipline, patriotism, collectivism and socialism.
</P>
<P>
It urged parents and teachers not to concentrate solely on exam-
oriented education but instead to focus on raising well-adjusted
people.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency published a commentary Monday on the issue,
stating that urgent measures must be taken to deal with the stress
children encounter at school and home.

<P>
Economic analysts say that if the central and western regions
do not catch up with the flourishing areas in the east, China's
goal of becoming a mid-level developed nation by the middle of the
next century will not be met.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, is one of the key
cities for the development. The city, with a history of more than
3,100 years, has already flung itself headfirst into
infrastructure remodeling, which includes building of highways,
railways, airports, power grids and telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the city government earmarked 68.55 billion
yuan (about 8.26 billion U.S. dollars) for the completion of 150
key facelift projects this year.
</P>
<P>
Similar construction programs have also begun in other western
cities and regions, which are also expecting huge influx of
government funds and overseas capital in the coming years as the
government takes bolder steps to spur the landlocked region's
growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
Various departments under the State Council have started
formulating policies and plans for the development of the western
region, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
With regard to funding, policies and state-funded projects, the
central government will give preferential treatment to the western
region, the sources said, adding that the government will also
adopt a series of incentives to attract both domestic and overseas
investment and talent.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an has targeted tourism as a new economic growth opportunity
and the city's pillar industry. Renowned for its ancient terra-
cotta warriors, the city welcomed 554,016 overseas visitors last
year, a hefty growth of 15.46 percent and a new record high.
</P>
<P>
To further boost tourism, the city has invited experts from
both home and abroad this year to make blueprints for the
development of the industry. It also set a goal for this year:
greeting more than 600,000 tourists and earning 11-billion-yuan in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is also striving to restructure its industries. The city
plans to form seven enterprise groups covering software, new
building materials, medicine and leather this year to operate as
the backbone of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Outdated production facilities will be phased out and modern
science, technology and know-how will be applied in the building
of the city's high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
As China enters a new period of growth of the socialist market
economy, the western region faces fiercer market competition than
during the early stages of reform and opening up in the late 1970s
and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say once the western region takes off, China's
economic strength will take a huge leap forward.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Least Developed Nations Increasingly Marginalized by Hu Guangyao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) believed that the 1990s was a decade of
increasing marginalization for the least developed countries (LDCs)
in the process of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The 48 LDCs, whose population accounts for about 13 percent of
the world's total, have a share in world exports and imports in
1997 of only 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent respectively,
representing a decline of more than 40 percent since 1980,
according to a report available at the 10th Meeting of the UNCTAD
being held here from February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Three quarters of the LDCs derive their export earnings
predominately from merchandise exports and in more than half of
these countries the value of merchandise exports was three times
that of services exports.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the LDCs have a highly concentrated merchandise
export structure, in which one export product, usually
agricultural or mineral, predominates, accounting for over half
the total value of exports of goods.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of LDC merchandise is exported with little or no value
added, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 48 LDCs have attracted less than 1 percent of the
world's total foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.
</P>
<P>
The average GDP growth rate of the LDCs in 1998 was 3.8
percent, about 1 percent lower than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The mounting foreign debt of the LDCs has become one of the
major obstacles to their development.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the foreign debt of 41 out of the 48
LDCs in 1997 reached 23.2 billion U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the 10th Meeting of the UNCTAD urged the
developed countries to help the LDCs by undertaking more effective
measures.
</P>
<P>
Debt reduction, market access, and official assistance were
three of the measures called for to help poor countries realign
their economies amidst the rush toward economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The measures will be reflected in the UNCTAD's Bangkok
Declaration and an Action Plan that will be announced at the end
of the week-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, the developed countries urged the LDCs to place more
emphasis on good governance and efforts to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
Rebens Ricupero, UNCTAD secretary general, said the Third U.N.
Conference on the LDCs to be held in May this year will provide an
important opportunity for LDCs and their development partners to
evolve a new strategy of development cooperation in favor of LDCs.
</P>
<P>
This new strategy should be underscored by a desire to search
for innovative approaches to mobilizing additional resource flows -
-official development assistance and private capital -- in order
to complement LDCs' own efforts to enhance their productive
capacities and competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Increase University Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, February 15 (Xinhua) -- University and college
students across India may have to spend much more on their
education as the Indian government has planned to increase tuition
and other fees from the 2000-2001 academic session.
</P>
<P>
A recently-constituted drafting group for fee regulation has
almost finalized the percentage by which the fees should be raised
in all central universities and colleges, The Times of India
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Human Resource Development Murli Manohar Joshi has
repeatedly stressed the need to raise fees, among other measures,
to generate additional resources for the fund-starved higher
education sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
The drafting group was set up in the wake of a series of
meetings in the ministry and the University Grants Commission
after two expert committees submitted their reports, which
recommended an upward revision of the fee structure for different
courses in universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
The tuition fee, which remained unchanged in India for over
three decades, was proposed to be increased from the present 15
rupees (approximately 0.34 U.S. dollars) to between 55 rupees (1.
27 dollars) and 150 rupees (3.48 dollars) a month for different
courses.
</P>
<P>
However, one of the committees, which is in charge of fee
structure revisions, said the levels suggested were the "minimum
and university may be free to charge more".
</P>
<P>
The committee also recommended hikes in the admission-related
fee, examination fee, enrollment fee and development fee.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the committees aid, the enrollment fee, which now
ranges from 10 rupees (0.23 dollars) to 20 rupees (0.46 dollars),
was "generally low" and should be increased to 100 rupees (2.32
dollars) or more.

<HEADLINE> Delivery Delayed by Strike in Boeing Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Company, the
world's largest aircraft maker, has spent six days without
delivering a commercial jet, largely a result of a walkout by
nearly 20,000 engineers and technical workers.
</P>
<P>
A nearly one-week-long strike by engineering and technical
workers of Boeing Co. has delayed some testing and production of
the F-22 fighter, U.S. Air Force said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the radar-evading jets being built or nearing
completion as well as a scheduled test for structural strength
were both delayed, said Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters.
</P>
<P>
The strike also affected other aircraft delivery. Boeing
confirmed that a 747 jetliner would not be delivered on time to
cargo airline Atlas Air Inc. in Boulder, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
(SPEEA), which represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers
at Seattle-based Boeing, started the strike from February 9 after
the breakdown of federally mediated negotiations over a new
contract. No contract offers or further talks have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Boeing was reported to consider replacing some of the 500 SPEEA-
represented designated engineering representatives (DERs) that the
union calls "the brains behind the planes" and a crucial group in
keeping jets rolling off the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to look at
materials of some DERs-to-be, said Administration spokesman Mitch
Barker.
</P>
<P>
"They're just asking us to look at their qualifications ahead
of time in preparation, I guess, for what they might do," Barker
said.
</P>
<P>
SPEEA spokesman Bill Dugovich said the union is prepared to go
back to the table and reopen contract talks with Boeing at any
time.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Invest More in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Following its economic
recovery, South Korea plans to invest more in Sri Lanka,
especially in infrastructure projects, the official Daily News
here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Song Young-oh said in an
interview with the paper that with the South Korean economy
picking up several companies have re-launched their expansion
programs and South Korean investors will continue to invest in
fresh projects in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
South Korean companies have plans to participate in
infrastructure projects such as highway, power and construction in
which South Korean companies are good, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea remains the largest foreign investor in Sri Lanka
with more than 200 million U.S. dollars in 130 projects, providing
65,000 jobs, 23 percent of total employment by foreign investment
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The export products of these companies also account for 9.6
percent of Sri Lanka's total exports.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said economic and trade ties between the two
countries have moved into diversified areas and trade has been
growing.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade in 1998 was 480 million dollars with the trade
balance in favor of South Korea because of the import of raw
materials to produce various export items.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka remains one of the leading manufacturing bases for
South Korean companies which are exporting all their products.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that the South Korean companies first came
to Sri Lanka in the late 1980s as Sri Lanka offered good
incentives for foreign investors.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's special police
team investigating last week's bus bomb blast at the central bus
station in Colombo has arrested a Tamil rebel cadre as the prime
suspect at Padukka in the suburbs of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
While this main suspect is being interrogated, the police have
also been able to round up 11 other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Among others arrested is another rebel cadre reported to have
transported a time bomb on a Colombo-bound train from Bandarawela
in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Arrested at an estate in Bandarawela, he is also considered a
senior rebel cadre who had been assigned to recruit estate youth
for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
When arrested, he was posing as a Tamil writer contributing to
newspapers in Jaffna and as a lecturer at Tamil forums.
</P>
<P>
Two bus bombs rocked the capital of Colombo on February 9,
killing three persons and wounded 43 others.
</P>
<P>
The two bus explosions followed a spate of similar bombings
blamed on the LTTE rebels who have been fighting a 17-year-old war
against the Sri Lankan government for a separate state for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> PSI Comes Into Force in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI)
for all imported goods into Bangladesh was launched on Tuesday,
bringing under its purview all letters of credit for import of
foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
The PSI system was introduced by the National Board of Revenue
(NBR) to prevent the avoidance of duty payments by importers and
thus increase tax revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Under the PSI system, countries all over the world are divided
into three zones. Three foreign inspection companies have been
entrusted by the NBR to issue clearing report findings for imports
from the countries in the three zones.
</P>
<P>
The NBR has assured that local industrial products will not
face any extra cost as measures have been taken to maintain market
price equilibrium of both local commodities and foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
A source in the NBR explained that the authorities are
examining ways to maintain price stability in the market. If the
price of an imported item is found to be lower in price than a
locally produced item, a supplementary tax would be imposed on the
imported item.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Collection Short of Target in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The collection of tax revenue in
Bangladesh during the July-January period of fiscal 1999-2000
showed a marked decline, or 12.27 percent short of the target,
according to a preliminary assessment published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The assessment indicated that the collection of tax revenue
during the first seven months of the 1999-2000 fiscal year
amounted to 77.87 billion taka(about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars)
against the target of 88.76 billion Taka (about 1.7 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the fall in revenue collection to
declining industrial performance, port congestion, avoidance of
import of products with high import duties, large-scale smuggling
of foreign goods and fixation of very ambitious targets.
</P>
<P>
They also identified non-implementation of the mandatory Pre-
Shipment Inspection system as one of the major reasons that
substantially helped importers avoid duty payments.
</P>
<P>
The government expected that the implementation of the new
system from Tuesday would generate an additional 6 billion taka (
about 1.15 billion dollars) in revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Yanqing County on Beijing's
northwestern outskirts is expected to be selected by the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) as only
ecologically sound area in the capital region.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Beijing Daily", Yanqing County is vital
for the Chinese capital since its geographic location makes it
easy for any air pollutants and polluted water to be carried to
the city center.
</P>
<P>
Yanqing has made big efforts for ecological conservation and
pollution control over the past decade in a bid to keep its air
and water clean.
</P>
<P>
The county has shut down 13 seriously-polluting factories and
plants and rejected to process applications for more than 30
industrial projects with pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation efforts in the past decade have increased the
county's forest coverage to 57 percent, and put into effective
control the 82 percent of its acreages with erosion problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 11 nature reserves have been built in the county to
protect local wildlife and plants. The county has also relocated
20,000 of 50,000 local residents in high mountainous areas to
protect ecologically-fragile areas.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, approximately 150 counties have so far been
selected by the SEPA as model areas for ecological construction
to help improve the natural environment in China.

<P>
Besides Indonesia, Group I consists of host Japan, Thailand,
South Korea, China, the Philippines, Uzbekstan, Kazakhstan and New

<HEADLINE> Chinese Sturgeon Found In Pond Taken To Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A young Chinese Sturgeon,
measuring above 100 cm in length, was recently found in a fishing
pond by a farmer in Zhangjiagang city on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the rare fish usually migrates to the Yangtze
River from the sea and spawn. Sturgeons grow to about 10 cm then
migrate back upstream the river.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the endangered species, animal experts have
taken the Chinese sturgeon to Nanjing Zoo. The sturgeon is
reportedly adapting to its new environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon is one of the oldest vertebrates in the
world. Environmental pollution and illegal catching are posing a
real threat to the sturgeon's survival.
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese sturgeons that swim back to the Yangtze
River every year has dropped to less than 1,000 with only 500
spawning. Experts warned that the fish may become extinct in 50
years if effective measures are not taken immediately.

MONTEVIDEO, February 14 (Xinhua)-- Unemployment rate in Uruguay
went up to 11,4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999, compared
with 10.3 percent over the same period in 1998, the National
Institute of Statistics (INE) reported Monday.

In Montevideo, unemployment rate amounted to 11 percent in the

economic recession caused by the drastic shrink of exports to the

<HEADLINE> Web Hacks Cause 1.2 Billion Dollars in Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Losses caused by last
week's distributed denial of service attacks that temporarily shut
down several of the most popular Websites could amount to more
than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, according to a report released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. research and consulting firm Yankee Group said in the
report the attacks could lead to a one-billion-dollar
capitalization loss and a more than 100-million-dollar revenue
loss in both sales and advertising.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm, the attacks, which hit Yahoo,
CNN.com, eBay, Amazon and others last week, caused service
disruptions for durations from two-and-half to five hours. The
report said that the affected companies and their Internet peers
will spend an additional 100 million dollars to 200 million
dollars on security infrastructure upgrades. The resulting damage
on brand image, partnership and future customers will have a
further impact on all the companies.
</P>
<P>
The Yankee Group calls for Websites to make use of security-
assessment technologies to identify and patch the holes and
vulnerabilities in their systems to prevent such denial of service
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Next, the firm said, the attacked Websites must utilize a
comprehensive security system that include firewalls, hardened
operating systems, security assessment and intrusion detection
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The firm predicted that the Internet security breaches will get
even worse, as attacks could be launched from any of the millions
of homes with always-on cable and DSL (digital subscribe line)
connections.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Criticizes U.S. Senator on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his letter to Li dated on February 9, Helms said he was "
aghast" at the remarks by Minister Liu Xiaoming of the Chinese
Embassy on TSEA passed by the House of Representatives earlier
this month. "Such rhetoric from the second-ranking Chinese
official in the United States requires clarification," Helms said.
</P>
<P>
In a reply letter dated on Sunday, Li said, "Having reviewed
the relevant transcripts and notes, I arrived at the conclusion
that Mr. Liu said nothing wrong or inappropriate at our February 3
press conference."
</P>
<P>
"Our strong opposition to TSEA is totally justified," said Li,
citing three reasons: the bill negates the "one China" principle
and undermines the basic framework of China-U.S. normalization; it
violates U.S. pledges under the three China-U.S. joint communiques;
it fans up a scare about the false "China threat."
</P>
<P>
"If TSEA were made into law, it will further embolden the
already recalcitrant separatist forces on Taiwan, destabilize Asia-
Pacific situation and increase the chances of military
confrontation in the Taiwan Straits," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"I am not sure if China-U.S. relations which both countries
have worked so hard and so long to nurture can survive the
explosive development that TSEA is destined to set in motion," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At his press conference on February 3, Liu, the second chief of
the embassy, warned that the consequences of putting TSEA into law
would be more than China recalling its ambassador from Washington
and worse than Lee Teng-hui's U.S. trip, which aroused tensions
across the Taiwan Straits in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The point he was trying to convey is that if TSEA should
become law, the consequences would be even worse. I stand by this
assessment," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Helms also accused Liu of "personally" attacking
U.S. congressmen and issuing "insults and threats" by "declaring
that the educational level of the most members 'is only about the
level of elementary school', while 'those 70 who voted against the
TSEA, their understanding of Chinese affairs is only about high-
school level'."
</P>
<P>
"As far as I can recall, he has never compared you or any of
your Congressional colleagues to 'elementary school pupils'," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
"The closest reference as I can think of is that some American
scholars once made a remark, saying that even elementary school
students know that Taiwan is part of China, but many politicians
don't seem to know that fact," the ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
"While pointing out the outrageous nature of TSEA, Mr. Liu
expressed the belief that a lack of understanding of the bill's
potential gravity and sensitivity on the part of some Congressmen
was to blame for the vote result," Li added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is a fact that some Congressmen did not
have "adequate knowledge of the origin of the Taiwan question and
the evolution of China-U.S. relations.'
</P>
<P>
Li cited Helms' letter as an example. "More than 20 years have
passed since the U.S. recognized the government of the People's
Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, yet you
are still referring to the Chinese province of Taiwan as 'Republic
of China on Taiwan' and the leader of Taiwan as 'president'."
</P>
<P>
"It would be an understatement just to call this 'ignorance' or
'lack of knowledge'," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
The TSEA, passed by the House on February 1, calls for
substantial upgrading of the U.S.-Taiwan military relations and a
big increase of the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which Washington
officially recognizes as one of China's provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, saying such a measure would
destabilize the Asia-Pacific region, has indicated that it would
veto such a bill if it was approved by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Post Leukemia Therapy on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An Internet website created by
Chinese doctors to spread their original treatment therapy for
leukemia has benefited thousands of patients around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Hematology and Oncology Research Institute, one of
China's major blood cancer medical institutes, set up the webpage
HIH in 1996 to provide detailed information on the therapy, which
is effective for treating cellulite leukemia and M2b leukemia.
</P>
<P>
The treatment initially relies on an extract from arsenic to
kill cancer cells before patients are started on a treatment that
combines Chinese traditional herbal medicine and Western chemical
therapy used for treating leukemia.
</P>
<P>
A leukemia patient surnamed Cai from Indonesia has reported
that his health recovered dramatically after receiving the Chinese
therapy for 56 days. The 50-year-old man expressed his gratitude
in an E-mail to the medical staff in Harbin, saying that he had
been given a second chance to live.
</P>
<P>
Like Cai, more than 4,000 leukemia patients from China's Taiwan
province, the U.S., Japan, Korea and South Africa and other
countries and regions have received help for their disease from
cyberspace. Another 1,000 patients have registered for the
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The therapy has been approved in more than 70 countries and
regions, said Ma Changjun, director of the institute. It is
believed to reduce the chronic pain of lengthy chemotherapy
treatment and bone marrow transplants.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Company Preparing for Stock Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China Pacific Insurance
Company, the country's first nationwide share-holding insurance
company, is working towards being listed within the year, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The company, with life and other insurance businesses, will
strive to introduce a joint-venture system to all its life
insurance businesses while making an initial public offering to
the others, said Wang Guoliang, general manager of the company.
</P>
<P>
China Pacific has already set up a life insurance joint venture
with the US-based Aetna Group in Shanghai to sell personal life
insurance products.
</P>
<P>
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), the industry's
watchdog, has decided to further separate life insurance from
other kinds of insurance in the new year.
</P>
<P>
China Pacific, Ping An Insurance Company of China and Xinjiang
Corps Insurance Company, which are involved in both types of
insurance businesses, have become three targeted companies.
</P>
<P>
"The CIRC has created separate plans for the three companies
and submitted the plans to the State Council for approval," said
CIRC Chairman Ma Yongwei at a recent national conference.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China Pacific, the
company will strive to set up joint ventures in all its life
insurance branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say quite a number of foreign insurers are vying for
the opportunity to work with China Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The company is currently working on being listed on local
securities market to get direct access to the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Beside China Pacific, there are still some insurance companies
planning to be listed at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Face Great Pressures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Education is calling for the mental well-being of students to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
A document the ministry issued Monday urged educators
throughout the country to include courses on culture, patriotism,
collectivism and socialism, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
It urged parents and teachers not to put so much pressure on
students to succeed in exams and instead focus on raising well-
adjusted people, the English language newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Lack of psychological adjustment among students has become a
serious problem in contemporary China, with recent reports
pointing to growing numbers of stressed and psychologically
disturbed students, the daily says.
</P>
<P>
In one shocking example last month, a student in Jinhua, a city
in east China's Zhejiang Province, killed his mother because he
could not bear the pressure he said she put on him to be in the
top 10 in exams, it says.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students in Beijing
between 1997 and 1999, carried out by the Institute of Psychology
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, around 32 percent of high
school students have encountered psychological difficulties, it
adds.
</P>
<P>
The document suggested students should be taught the Law on
Prevention of Juvenile Crimes.
</P>
<P>
It also asks teachers and education administrators to further
reduce the burdens on students, says the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Sub-standard Beer Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China is likely to ban the use
of sub-standard beer bottles to prevent them from hurting
consumers, the English-language newspaper China Daily reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Exploding beer bottles are the number one threat to consumers'
safety, said Wu Gaohan, assistant secretary general of the China
Consumers' Association (CCA).
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 bottle explosions were reported to the CCA in 1999,
killing one person, disabling 88 and injuring more than 800, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions also caused 2.1 million yuan (about 250,000 U.S.
dollars) in economic losses, official statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
The State Quality and Technical Supervision Administration
issued regulations last March, demanding that all beer bottles be
manufactured under compulsory State standards from April 1.
</P>
<P>
Beer bottles manufactured under the old standards were strictly
prohibited from sales since June, according to Li Fengwen,
director of the Administration's Standardization Department.
</P>
<P>
In addition, beer producers were no longer permitted to use
bottles used for soy sauce or vinegar, which were not made to
stand the pressure or heat required for beer bottles.
</P>
<P>
"However, we still find grave dangers to consumers' safety
caused by sub-standard bottles because of the State regulations
have not been properly implemented," Wu was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Former Indonesian Leader Asked to Show Health Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney
General's Office has demanded that the medical team of former
President Soeharto present an official medical statement verifying
his state of health after Soeharto failed to turn up at Monday's
questioning.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't rescheduled (the interview). We're still waiting
for an official medical statement in the next few days," the
Attorney General's Office spokesman R.J. Suhandoyo said.
</P>
<P>
The former president was last week named a suspect in a
widening corruption probe. However, he failed to show up at Monday
's official questioning due to ill-health.
</P>
<P>
"Soeharto's lawyers claim that because he could not attend (the
question session), he cannot be interrogated," Suhandoyo was
quoted by The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Head of Soeharto's defense lawyer team Juan Felix Tampubolon
said Soeharto's medical team would not allow its patient to
undergo further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of state prosecutors conducting the
questioning at Soeharto's residence, Suhandoyo said, "Let's wait
for the official letter (on medical statement) in the next one or
two days."
</P>
<P>
Since Soeharto stepped down in May 1998, there has been a
public outcry for him to be tried for alleged corruption during
his rule.
</P>
<P>
Last year, investigation into Soeharto was ceased by the then
Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko due to "lack of evidences."
</P>
<P>
The move, however, triggered anger from many parties nationwide
who believed that Soeharto was responsible for rampant corruption
in the country during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Under the government of President Abdurrahman Wahid and new
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, the Attorney General's Office
has vigorously reviewed the case and reopened it in December last
year.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the office said new evidence points to "a misuse
of power and authority" in issuing government regulations and
presidential decrees to amass funds for foundations linked to
Soeharto, his family and associates.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who has repeatedly denied allegations that he amassed
a fortune during his reign, was hospitalized twice last year after
suffering a stroke and intestinal bleeding.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Cotton Yarn Production Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 3,930 tons of
cotton yarn in the first 10 months of 1999, 22.2 percent more than
the 3,216 tons produced in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar also produced 14,427,490 meters
of cotton fabrics in the 10-month period, up 64 percent over the
same period of 1998 which saw a production of 8,794,508 meters.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's annual cultivated area of cotton is 283,500 hectares
while the annual production of ginned cotton exceeds 160,000 tons,
of which long-staple cotton accounts for 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and relieve the
shortage in investment capital, the government not only provides
more than 1 billion kyats (more than 3 million U.S. dollars) in
loans to the growers annually, but also grants advance payment for
the purchase of cotton.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Sports Stars Risk Indictment for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Some of the biggest stars in the
recent history of Italian opposition leader and media mogul Silvio
Berlusconi's sports clubs risk indictment on charges of tax
evasion, judicial sources said in Milan Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Among the stars prosecutors believe accepted off-the-record
payments running to billions of lire are the Dutch trio that
helped the AC Milan soccer club to European glory in the late '80s
and early '90s, Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard.
</P>
<P>
Others names were the club's all-time hero, defender Franco
Baresi, present captain Paolo Maldini, and Gigi Lentini, whose
1992 transfer will be the subject of a separate kickbacks and tax
evasion trial starting in June.
</P>
<P>
Also named was a past member of the Milan rugby team, the
Argentine-born star of Italy's astonishing Six Nations debut
against Scotland nine days ago, Diego Dominguez.
</P>
<P>
Among the volleyball stars cited were Italy stars and multiple
world title winners Andrea Zorzi and Claudio Galli.
</P>
<P>
Club officials named included AC Milan soccer club CEO Adriano
Galliani and general manager Giancarlo Foscale.
</P>
<P>
The heads of Milan's volleyball, hockey and rugby clubs were
also cited, all on the same charges of paying top players under
the table.
</P>
<P>
The players are accused of tax evasion in accepting some if not
most of their wages as back-handers, or of evading taxes on sums
paid for the use of their image.
</P>
<P>
The period covered by the investigation is 1991-97.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they have traced payments through two foreign-
based companies in the Fininvest empire owned by Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said a formal request for an indictment
against all 25 named would be made immediately, unless defence
lawyers request further investigations.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- While great numbers of
workers have been laid off, talented people, especially those who
have a good command of high-tech, management expertise as well as
foreign languages, are in short supply in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Many local enterprises have just announced plans for employing
engineers in various high-tech industries. Some are even
considering recruiting talented people from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Feng Defu, vice president of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Co.,
Ltd., said that his company has had difficulties in tapping
overseas markets due to a lack of professionals who are good at
both technology and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to recruit those we want here at present," Feng
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the local talent market show that high-tech
industries and overseas-funded businesses have a growing demand
for talented people over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Talented people engaged in industries like automobiles, bio-
pharmaceuticals, information technology, telecommunications
equipment and new materials are the most sought after.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has decided to turn high-tech industries into key
growth areas of its economy. Shanghai has been focusing on
developing major high-tech products including integrated circuits,
telecommunications equipment, computer and software products,
digital audio and visual products, new medicines, and rare-earth
metals.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Has 230,000 Fewer Babies Born in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- There were 230,000 fewer
babies born in Gansu Province in northwest China last year thanks
to a series of measures adopted by local family planning
departments.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the population growth rate of Gansu, one of the
poorest provinces in China, dropped from 10.4 per thousand in 1998
to 9.17 per thousand in 1999, the first time that the rate has
been below 10 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
To curb the rapid population growth rate and achieve sustained
social and economic development, the provincial government set
aside 20 million yuan to establish a special dual-functional fund
both for eliminating poverty and for encouraging the
implementation of the country's family planning policy. Now the
fund has had 100 million yuan for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 107,000 of 414,000 poverty-stricken households
have eliminated poverty. The average per capita income of 50,000
households reached or exceeded the level of local farmers. This
has encouraged more people to have fewer babies.
</P>
<P>
Located in a land-locked arid region of northwest China, Gansu
has historically been one of the poorest provinces in China. The
number of poor farmers with annual per capita income of less than
200 yuan (24 U.S. dollars) was 12.54 million 20 years ago, making
up 74.5 percent of the province's total rural population.

<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- China's securities market
reported a record turnover of 5.23 trillion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of listed firms in the country rose to 949 by the
end of the year. Capitalization of stocks reached 2.65 trillion
yuan, up 36 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Newly-listed firms raised a total of 124.3 billion yuan from
both domestic and overseas markets in 1999, 30 percent higher than
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that 1999 saw the most intensive and extensive
reforms in the history of China's securities market, resulting in
an improved regulatory system and a market-oriented appraisal
system for initial public offering as well as expanded capital
supply to the market.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies were granted to high-tech enterprises in
1999. Such enterprises now account for 17 percent of listed firms
in China.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Wrought Steel Discovered in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest wrought
steel weapons were unearthed recently in an ancient tomb in the
city of Xuzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The weapons include knives, swords and spears excavated from an
imperial tomb dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists have concluded from this discovery that ancient
Chinese invented metallurgical technology for making wrought
steel before the year 154 B.C., nearly 2,000 years before the
technology was used in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The wrought steel technology is considered as another landmark
in the world's iron and steel industry following the cast iron
technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, capital of east China's
Shandong Province, has recently established a Family Violence
Injury Testimony Center to help redress violence within families.
</P>
<P>
The Center, set up by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court, is
part of China's efforts to reduce all kinds of family violence.
Reports of family violence have increased considerably in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the fabric of Chinese society and the economy
have witnessed huge changes in the last twenty years, especially
in urban and coastal cities. These changes have taken their toll
on many families. There are also many family violence cases
resulting from extra-marital affairs.
</P>
<P>
In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, hotlines and
emergency aid centers have been set up. Many people across the
country are now urging the state legislature to formulate a
special law against family violence.

<HEADLINE> China to Close More Small Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All small oil refineries without government permits will be
shut down, today's China Daily quoted an official from the SAPCI
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Small refineries which fail to pass the government's quality
and environmental tests will also be closed by the end of March,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The administration, the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision and the State Administration of Environmental
Protection are doing quality-control and environmental protection
tests to determine which small refineries must shut down this year.
</P>
<P>
A small refinery is defined in China as one that produces less
than one million tons of oil a year. So far, 70 such refineries
have been closed.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 5,600 illegal refineries of
all sizes had been shut down. Most of them were in Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the
northwest, Shanxi Province in the north, and Shandong Province in
the east.
</P>
<P>
All of these factories' equipment will be dismantled to prevent
them from being reused, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
The government's move will save oil resources and reduce
pollution caused by illegal refineries, said the official, adding
that the move will also put better oil products on the market.
</P>
<P>
The official acknowledged that unemployment concerns may work
against efforts to close refineries.
</P>
<P>
However, local governments are re-employing thousands of laid-
off workers from the closed small refineries, he said.

LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Former England midfielder Paul
Gascoigne broke his arm with a rash challenge as his Middlesbrough
team were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa in the English premier
league match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A disastrous night for player and team was entirely self-
inflicted with Gascoigne's injury reminiscent of the midfielder's
infamous 1991 FA Cup final exit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile his team were just awful in a defeat which increases
the threat of relegation and the pressure on manager Bryan Robson.
</P>
<P>
Benito Carbone and Julian Jooachim made the most of some awful
defending to score two goals each, while the Villa defence had a
trouble-free night - save for an injury to keeper David James.
</P>
<P>
The result lifted Villa to seventh while Middlesbrough remained
struggling in 16th.

<HEADLINE> English FA Acts to Lay Down Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
English charged four clubs with misconduct as they told the
Premiership's bad boys that indiscipline on and off the field will
not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United and Tottenham Hotspur have been rapped after the
flashpoint involving the majority of the players at Elland Road on
Saturday, while Chelsea and Wimbledon are in the same boat after
an incident in the tunnel following their game two days ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chelsea captain Dennis Wise, Wimbledon right-back
Kenny Cunningham and Dons coach Mick Harford are facing misconduct
charges as a result of that after-match clash.
</P>
<P>
Leeds left-back Ian Harte, who was at the center of an alleged
stamping incident involving Chris Perry, has also been given a
separate misconduct charge. They all have 14 days to respond and
request personal hearings if they wish.
</P>
<P>
And in a clear response to the antics of Manchester United in
the last 16 days, when they pursued referees Andy D'urso and Steve
Lodge when decisions went against them, the FA has written to
clubs to warn them that they will be held responsible if their
players show collective dissent towards officials.
</P>
<P>
The move comes just a month after Adam Crozier took over as FA
chief executive and signals a clear intention on their behalf to
root out foul play and intimidation of referees.
</P>
<P>
There is a precedent for clubs to be docked points for
incidents such as those that blighted Saturday's action, with
Arsenal losing two points and Manchester United one following a
mass free-for-all at Old Trafford in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fines and suspensions for the individuals involved can
also be considered but the FA is clearly unwilling to allow what
spokesman Steve Double described as "unedifying sights" continue
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
The increase in incidents has coincided with a period in which
referees have been given a directive ordering them to take a more
lenient view and show more reluctance to show yellow and red cards.
</P>
<P>
Crozier said: "We made it clear two weeks ago that the game as
a whole must improve its conduct and image and recognise the need
to accept our position as role models. Intimidation of match
officials is unacceptable. Clubs must take responsibility."

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Conditionally Allow Arms Inspectors to Return: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will allow U.N. arms
inspectors to return only if the latest U.N. resolution 1284 on
Iraq is modified to make it acceptable to Iraq, said Iraqi Deputy
Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoun on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi newspaper Al-Elam (Mass Media),
Hamdoun dismissed speculations that Iraq will finally allow the U.
N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC,
created according to U.N. resolution 1284, to enter Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last December adopted resolution 1284
which calls for the return of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraq in
exchange of possible suspension of the sanctions imposed on Iraq
since 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of weapons inspection is rejected as a whole so
long as the Security Council is not ready to lift the embargo on
Iraq," said Hamdoun.
</P>
<P>
"The nine-year-long arms inspection has finished, and the U.N.
arms inspectors have inspected all the Iraqi sites that were
subjected to be monitored," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun, former ambassador to the U.N., said Iraq will not
accept the resolution in its present form, and when the Security
Council wants to modify it in order to find a solution together
with Iraq, then Iraq will put forward its suggestions on ways out
of the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Security Council should take the initiative to
search for a solution together with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"If the Council wants to find a solution to the Iraqi issue,
then Iraq is ready to enter into negotiations with the Council,"
said Hamdoun.
</P>
<P>
"But for the time being, Iraq does not sense the willingness on
the part of the Council to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has slammed U.N. resolution 1284 as a photocopy of U.N.
resolution 687 which put the elimination of all Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction as the precondition of the total lifting of the
sanctions on the country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges Massive Turnout in Elections to Disappoint U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday urged the people to disappoint
the United States with a massive turnout on Friday parliamentary
polling to vote for "reliable and religiously-committed people."
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure that Majlis (parliament) deputies will not
be intimidated and will not yield to greedy desires, we should go
to reliable and religiously committed people," Khamenei told a
gathering of officials in charge of Hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming polling is a great test for the Iranian nation
and government, and undoubtedly the vigilant Iranian nation will
once again disappoint the U.S.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. President Bill Clinton said Monday that a possible
rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. would rest in part on the
outcome of Friday's sensitive vote, which will create a new power
balance in the Islamic republic.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials also expressed concern over the
disqualification of some reformist hopefuls by the Iranian
conservative Guardians Council and expressed hope that the Iranian
reformers would win the elections to push forward the reforms of
the moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei warned against western methods in election campaigns,
which he termed as "harmful" to nations and lack of any value, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the elections should be held free from any
tension and clashes, and that the people would vote for their
favorite candidates in a calm atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Rival political parties and groups launched various kinds of
elections campaigns recently aiming to grasp more seats in the
country's powerful legislative body, which can veto Khatami's
reformist programs.
</P>
<P>
As the moderates and reformers, main supporters of President
Khatami, vowed to win a majority in the future parliament, the
conservatives who still control the country's most sensitive organs
warned that the Islamic values are facing threats from the
reformers.

<HEADLINE> Iran, France to Strengthen Industrial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official on
Tuesday welcomed French investments in Iran's industrial sector as
part of the effort to strengthen cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Iran's vehicle manufacturing companies, in order to upgrade
their production technology, will cooperate with European
companies, said Industries Minister Gholamreza Shafei.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that France will be the major beneficiary of the
partnership," he told visiting French Minister of State for
Industrial Affairs Christian Pierret in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Shafei said that
in the next five years Iran would also invite foreign companies to
invest in such priority industries as electronics, semiconductors,
bio-technology, textiles, agricultural and animal-husbandry
processing as well as aluminum and chemical mining.
</P>
<P>
He praised on-going cooperation between the French oil giant
Total and Iran's Industrial Development and Renovation Organization
and hoped other French companies would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
Total, along with other two oil companies, broke U.S.
restrictions against Iran by making big investment in developing a
big gas field in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Shafei also lauded France for its independent policies toward
Iran in recent years, adding that at the time when the U.S. wanted
to exert its dominance over various countries and especially Iran,
French officials expanded their cooperation with Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Pierret said that the value of contracts signed by
the two countries since 1997 stood at 4 billion French francs
(about 600 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries intend to create favorable
conditions for speedy implementation of the contracts between the
two countries' companies.
</P>
<P>
"France is not only interested in expanding the volume of trade,
but also welcomes exchange of technical know-how as well as
obtaining latest information on Iran's technical and industrial
capabilities," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The French minister called their existing cooperation in vehicle
manufacturing as "satisfactory." He also expressed Paris' readiness
to cooperate with Iran in railroad, glass and cement industries.

<HEADLINE> WFP Representative in Iraq Resigns: U.N. Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. sources said here on
Tuesday Germany's Jutta Burghart, representative of the World Food
Program in Iraq, has resigned from her post in protest against the
continuation of sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Burghart has been in charge of the distribution of food aid in
Iraq under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food deal since she took the
post in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Burghart's resignation followed that of Hans von Sponeck, the
top U.N. humanitarian official in Iraq, who tendered his
resignation last weekend amid mounting pressure from the U.S. and
Britain for his criticism of the crippling sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sources did not specify when Burghart tendered her
resignation. WFP spokesman Francis Mwanza confirmed in Rome that
the agency has received a letter of resignation from Burghart.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on condition of anonymity, some European diplomats said
both Burghart and Von Sponeck felt that a U.N. resolution last
month did not go far enough to ease the suffering of the Iraqi
people.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Praises Resigning U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The official Iraqi News Agency
(INA) on Tuesday commented on the resignation of Hans von Sponeck,
U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, praising him for having "a
live humanitarian conscience."
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck tendered his resignation last weekend, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan accepted his resignation on Monday.
Sponeck will stay in his post until March 31.
</P>
<P>
"He strongly rejects to be a perjurer while seeing the crime of
mass murder being perpetrated against the people of Iraq and
keeping silent," INA commented.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck has since October 1998 been responsible for
administering the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, which allows
Iraq to sell oil and use the revenues for humanitarian goods to
ease civilian sufferings that have resulted from the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He has angered the U.S. and Britain for repeatedly calling on
the U.N. Security Council to separate Iraq's humanitarian need from
the aim to eliminate the country's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old German, who resigned entirely from the United
Nations where he had served for over 30 years, said the oil-for-
food program he heads has not met the minimum requirements of the
22 million Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Sponeck paid no heed to pressures and criticisms by London
nd Washington and called for lifting the criminal embargo off Iraq,
despite he realized that his position could cost him high," said
INA.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN(Cable News Network) on Monday, Sponeck
criticized the latest U.N. Security Council resolution 1284 on Iraq
for failing to reflect the fact that there has been long cases of
delays before the Iraqi people got their needs following nine years
of embargo.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the holds of Iraqi contracts by
U.S. and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad rejected U.N. resolution 1284 adopted last December
which calls for the return of U.N. arms inspectors to the country
in exchange of possible suspension of the sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
INA pointed out that Sponeck's predecessor Denis Halliday, who
voiced similar criticism as Sponeck, resigned from his post in 1998
in protest against the deteriorating humanitarian situation in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. built pressure on and criticized Sponeck and Halliday,
which clearly showed that it could not tolerate any international
official who adopts fair and equitable position toward Iraq and
declare the reality of the difficult situation created by the
ongoing embargo," said INA.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Calls for Increasing Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 MEXICO CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico called Tuesday
for an increase of world oil output to impede drastic price surge
that may affect the stability of the international market.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Energy Minister Luis Tellez said that the eventual
increase of barrels does not depend upon Mexico, but on the
consensus with the other oil producing counties.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that the 30 dollars price per barrel registered
Monday for the crude of West Texas Intermediate "may cause brusque
movements in prices that destabilize the market".
</P>
<P>
The international quotation of crude reached the bottom in
1998 and recovered on  April 1, 1999 with the approval of an
international accord to reduce for one year the world offer by 2
million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Tellez considered it necessary to increase world offer for the
re-establishment of the energetic inventories.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Power Minister will meet on March 2 with his
counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Tellez denied the existence of pressure from the United States
or any other country to increase its oil exports, which were
reduced in accordance with international accords.
</P>
<P>
But reports said oil prices surged to fresh nine-year peaks on
Monday on a supply shortage that has driven the engery-hungry
United States to urge the OPEC to pump more crude.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- France has received through the
diplomatic channel the medical report on former Chilean President
Augusto Pinochet from the British government, said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"This report has been transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.
It is back to the French justice to determine the follow-up steps
which it will take in the on-going process," said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
France has welcomed the decision by the British authorities to
transmit the medical report to four countries asking for
extradition of Pinochet -- Spain, France, Belgium and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of London Tuesday ordered British Home Secretary
Jack Straw to do so with the condition of keeping strict
confidentiality of the report by the countries which receive it.
</P>
<P>
The four countries were given seven days until February 22 to
make their comment on the report, which gave ground to a decision
by the British government not to extradite Pinochet to Spain
because of his health condition.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 84, was arrested in October 1998 in London by the
British police on charges of crime against humanity made against
him by the Spanish government.

UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday reiterated that the status quo in
Cyprus is unacceptable.

<P>
The move came after the Council heard a briefing by the U.N.

In a statement to the press, the 15-member Security Council
said this is a matter it would continue to follow with the closest

</P>
<P>
The Council commended the continuing commitment shown by the
parties to the talks process, and welcomed the fact that the talks

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Moscow welcomed Tuesday the
statements made by U.S. President Bill Clinton about Russian-
American relations in an Internet interview and in a CNN
television interview.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership shares the desire expressed by the U.S.
president to intensify the bilateral dialogue, primarily in the
spheres of security and disarmament, and to overcome the emerging
trend there for a dangerous impasse," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"We also note the confirmation by the American leadership of
the importance of making decisive steps to counter international
terrorism," it said.
</P>
<P>
Russian-U.S. meetings to solve major problems and strengthen
international peace and stability are on the agenda for the near

</P>
<P>
During a Tuesday telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
also said Moscow "has taken note of what U.S. President Bill
Clinton said in a recent CNN interview about his desire to advance
the Russian-U.S. dialogue and cooperation, in particular in the
field of security and disarmament, and shares this desire."
</P>
<P>
The talks covered Russian-U.S. relations, in particular the
short-term program of bilateral contracts which are to lay the
groundwork for tackling big issues on the agenda of the bilateral
ties, said the ministry press center.

<HEADLINE> U.S. IPS Revenues Expected to Hit 23 Bln Dlrs in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Revenues in the U.S.
Internet service market will increase 29 percent and approach 23
billion U.S. dollars this year, following a spectacular 67 percent
in 1999, according to a forecast report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two Internet service providers (ISP), America Online and UUNet,
have a commanding lead over competitors in their market segments,
said the report from market research firm International Data
Corporation (IDC). While America Online is by far the largest
consumer-oriented ISP, UUNet dominates the market for business
access, wholesale services, and value-added services.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 40 percent of consumer access subscribers,
America Online's share is more than the next 20 largest ISP's
combined share. UUNet controls 26 percent of revenues in the
business segment, 43 percent in the wholesale segment and 17
percent in the value-added services market.
</P>
<P>
IDC expects consolidation within the consumer segment, with ISP
's merging or taking over the consumer subscriber bases of other
carriers. As a result, AOL will face larger rivals, but none will
seriously threaten its dominance. An increasing number of ISPs
will enter the other markets, and UUNet will get a run for its
money, especially in the business access and wholesale segments,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the consumer segment will maintain the
largest share of the market's revenues until 2002, when the value-
added services segment will grab the lead.
</P>
<P>
In the business market, the number of online users is
increasing and the Internet budgets are substantially increasing.
However, IDC said, traditional ISPs are benefiting less and less
from this trend as interexchange carriers have replaced them as
the largest providers of Internet access services to business. In
the wholesale market, an increasing number of affinity groups will
become virtual Internet service providers, and this will
positively impact demand for whole services.

to enlarge the European Union (EU), hailing it as "the reunion of
Europe".
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons that
Britain was prepared to give up one of its two European
Commissioners to support the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain would also contemplate an extension of
majority voting in areas where it might be in the country's
interest.
</P>
<P>
But he said Britain would be seeking a fairer voting system in
the Council of Ministers to represent British nationals.
</P>
<P>
He insisted on retaining the right to veto in the areas of
defense, border controls, EU treaty amendments, taxation, social
security and revenue-raising.
</P>
<P>
"Institutional reform will be necessary to prepare the European
Union to absorb a dozen new members," Cook said as he unveiled a "
white paper" outlining Britain's approach to year-long EU talks on
expansion and reform.
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing of these reforms is to increase the share of
our vote in the council of ministers," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"France, Germany and Britain contain a majority of the
population of the Union but together have only a minority of the
votes in the council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will be seeking a fairer voting system in the council of
ministers which gives more democratic recognition to the
population of Britain," the foreign secretary added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Promises to Retire at End of Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Promised here on Tuesday to retire at the end of his term
next year and urged former president Kenneth Kaunda to retire from
politics.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while laying a foundation stone at the site
of the Frederick Chiluba Centre, an institute of democratic and
industrial relations studies.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told diplomats, cabinet ministers and other senior
government officials who gathered at the site that African leaders
should learn to feel good about leaving public office just as they
felt good when they got into it.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Africans must end the history of changing a
government through coups.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa has been plagued by coups because a lot of
African leaders have failed to adhere to the law thereby they
relinquish power, but rather hold on to power until they are
forcibly removed by unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation on the continent needs to change quickly
with more African countries assuming and pursuing a culture of
democracy as it has been pioneered by leaders such as South
African former President Nelson Mandela and the late Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere who left office in accordance with the
law.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Supply Medicines to Mozambican Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) is to start supplying the Mozambican victims of
catastrophic floods with medicines in response to the Mozambican
government's appeal for support.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNICEF press release Tuesday, the first batch,
worth more than 160,000 U.S. dollars, includes medicines and
equipment for the treatment of dysentery and malaria, and is due
to arrive in Mozambique later this week.
</P>
<P>
Responding to requests from several Mozambican ministries for
assistance in the flood emergency, UNICEF has solicited 1.25
million dollars from donors in efforts aimed at expanding health
activities, supporting the supply of water and sanitation, and
re-establishing the primary education network in areas affected by
floods, as well as helping resettle those displaced from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is to provide technical and material support to help the
 government coordinate emergency activities, under the overall
leadership of the National Disaster Management Institute of
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Several countries have offered assistance since Mozambique
appealed to the international community for emergency aid to the
victims of flood last week, including Britain pledging 800,000
dollars, the United States pledging 25,000 dollars and Norway
pledging 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The flood in south and central Mozambique early this month has
left 48 dead, 200,000 homeless and inundated many houses, roads,
bridges and farm land.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Proposes Women Take Charge of Media on March 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has
called on the media to ensure that women journalists are in charge
of news on International Women' s Day which falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO Director-General, Koichiro Matsuura, said in a statement
released in Ghana's capital Accra on Tuesday that history would be
made if journalists, the media and the organizations that
represent them come together to make this initiative a success.
</P>
<P>
According to Ghana News Agency report reaching here, on that
day, for the first time in history, a day's news output in both
print and broadcasting, throughout the world, will fall under the
editorial responsibility of women.
</P>
<P>
"By drawing attention to the glass ceiling that still limits
the number of women journalists who rise to key editorial
positions in the media, UNESCO is pursuing the commitment made at
the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 to defend
equal professional opportunities for women."
</P>
<P>
Matsuura said he firmly believes that this issue must remain at
the forefront of the agenda of each society and the international
community until gender balance is achieved at every level in the
work place.
</P>
<P>
Matsuura said International Women's Day provides an opportunity
to raise awareness of the situation of women and to seek responses
to obstacles they face.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO said each media organization should determine how it
implements the initiative.

<P>
NEW YORK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
Tuesday as investors favored oil stocks while making bargain-

<HEADLINE> Anti-Pinochet Relatives March in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Detained and
Disappeared Relatives marched Tuesday in downtown Santiago to show
their happiness after knowing the British High Court decision.
</P>
<P>
The High Court in London ruled that British Home Secretary
Jack Straw has to show to Belgium, Switzerland, France and Spain
Augusto Pinochet's medical records. They are seeking the
extradition of the 84-year-old former Chilean leader.
</P>
<P>
Based on that report, Straw had said that he was inclined to
let Pinochet return home because he is unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The president of the group, Viviana Diaz, said "this is
demonstration that when justice is let to work freely, it may
follow its path. Up until now all we could see was obstruction of
that justice path on the side of the Chilean government."
</P>
<P>
Viviana Diaz said that Pinochet must show his repentance and
must let those who have any information about the whereabouts of
the detained and disappeared be handed in.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chilean government called the ruling positive
because it left the decision in the hands of Straw, who has
already expressed his inclination to release Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in October 1998 in London on a warrant by
a Spanish judge who wants to prosecute him for the human rights
abuses committed under his long reign.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Seventy years after a border
treaty, Chile technically returned Tuesday to Peru the
administration of port installations in Arica, though the formal
ceremony will take place on March 7.
</P>
<P>
The national director of the Bordering Development and Limits
of the Peruvian Foreign Ministry ,Carlos Pareja, and the Chilean
national director of Border and Limits, Maria Teresa Infante,
signed the delivery of the installations and zones under the Peru
and Arica Service.
</P>
<P>
The installations include sea wall dock, railway station and
the customs agency offices.
</P>
<P>
The official record includes the technical plans, maintenance
work, conservation and expansion of the constructions delivered to
Chile.
</P>
<P>
Pareja said the work has not been completed and such transfer
was technical and administrative, so the official ceremony will be
on March 7, with the attendance of the foreign ministers of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
In November 13, 1999, the Peruvian and Chilean governments
signed the official record on pending border affairs from the 1929
Limits Treaty. In a territorial war which took place last century,
Peru lost and surrendered Arica to Chile.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks About Internet Security With Experts. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
talked about the Internet security with technology experts Tuesday
at the White House, saying the cooperation between the government
and the private sector is important in enhancing the network
security.
</P>
<P>
Recent Internet attacks highlighted "how important the Internet
has become to our whole life in America and how vulnerabilities at
one place on the Net can create risks for all," said the president
in Tuesday's Internet Security Meeting aimed at discussing how to
maximize the promise and minimize the risks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
While making their own computer networks more secure, the
president said, government and the private sector should join
efforts to keep the Internet flourishing and growing.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government will keep cyberspace open and
free to facilitate its development.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal 2001 budget, Clinton has already proposed a 2
billion U.S. dollar appropriation for network security and
information technology infrastructure. Now he planned to provide 9
million U.S. dollars right away to begin some of those key
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the meeting were representatives from
more than 30 major Internet and information technology companies,
and some government officials as well.
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly not facing a crisis, but the events of last
week show that everyone -- Internet users, Internet companies, and
government -- need to work together to strengthen Internet
security," said Peter Solvik, the senior vice president and chief
information officer of Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
Solvik said e-commerce and information technology now
represents over one-third of the economic growth in the United
States and it is estimated that e-commerce could reach 1.5
trillion U.S. dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is more important than ever to provide solid and
secure foundation for the digital economy, Solvic said on behalf
of the private sector people who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He asked the government to coordinate the sharing of
information on cyber attacks, vulnerabilities, counter-measures,
and best practices among business sectors to help increase the
security of the Internet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Says Trade Deal With China Offers Export Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vote on the deal, which sets a stage for China to enter the
WTO, may be the most important casts in Congress this year to
maintain the U.S. economic prosperity and leadership in the world,
House Representative David Dreier said.
</P>
<P>
The report was released by Republican congressional leaders as
part of their efforts to rally support for the deal legislation.
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the world's fastest growing economies, and
rapid economic growth is likely to continue in the near future,
provided that economic reforms are continued," said the study by
the Congressional Research Services (CRS).
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, China will have more than 230 million middle-
income consumers and the value of retail sales will exceed 900
billion U.S. dollars and the country will be the world's largest
market for consumer goods and services and a major market for
luxury goods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed last November in Beijing after years
of negotiations. It needs to be approved by Congress and will be
effective after China joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The deal has so far gained strong support in Congress and
experts predicted that it will be passed. If the deal is ratified,
Congress shall end the annual review of China's trade status and
normal trade relations between the two countries will be permanent.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between the two countries increased from 4.9
billion U.S. dollars in 1980 to an estimated 95 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, making China the fourth largest U.S. trading
partner, according to the CRS.
</P>
<P>
The CRS said that the trade agreement between the two will
offer big opportunities for U.S. farmers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The study quoted U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman as
estimating that China's accession to the WTO would increase U.S.
agricultural exports by 2 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
"China's offers on market access would provide across-the-board
benefits for most U.S. exporters of industrial or manufactured
products," the CRS said.
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the U.S. can maintain its current share of China'
s import market, 12.1 percent, China's trade liberalization might
increase its imports from the U.S. annually by about 12.8 billion
U.S. dollars from tariff cuts, reduction of non-tariff barriers
and increased U.S. investment in China.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Goldman Sachs, a leading U.S. banking company, as
saying that China's WTO membership will make the country "a far
more open economy," significantly boosting its economic growth,
foreign investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberalization and greater openness are expected to boost
China's GDP growth by an additional 0.5 percent per year. The
country's total trade and foreign direct investment flows would
nearly double by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Propose All-Sided Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's rebel
National Liberation  Army (ELN) proposed Tuesday the
establishment of peace talks all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The ELN second-in-command, Antonio Garcia, said during a radio
press conference organized by the network "Radio Net" that his
group dismantled Tuesday at 06:00 local time all blockades from
highways to Medellin, capital of the Antioquia district, looking
for dialogue with the government.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if such dialogue is not confirmed, the ELN
will intensify its attacks.
</P>
<P>
The ELN is the second largest rebel organization in the country
after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The
People's Liberation Army (EPL) is the third insurgent Colombian
force.
</P>
<P>
Garcia considered important a step ahead in the peace process
between the government and the FARC and to conclude talks with the
ELN and the EPL.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader insisted upon the ELN demand that the
government establish a neutral zone in the southern jungle of the
Caribbean city of Cartagena for peace talks. "It is not a fancy,
to be able to dialogue, we need space," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rightist paramilitary groups of the country oppose the
government's declaration of a buffer zone for a possible peace
process with the ELN similar to that established for talks with
the FARC in the south of the country.

<HEADLINE> British Court Orders Release of Pinochet's Medical Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw must disclose the crucial report to
Belgium authorities and other countries seeking the release of the
report, a high court in London has ruled.
</P>
<P>
The panel of three senior judges decided that Straw, who
refused to disclose the report after saying he was "minded" to
free Pinochet because the retired general was, found in the
medical report, too ill to stand trial in Spain, acted unlawfully
in refusing to disclose the report.
</P>
<P>
"We allow this application to the extent we hold the medical
report should be disclosed to the four requesting states under
conditions of strict confidentiality." one of the three judges
said, after spending three days considering the issue.
</P>
<P>
This means Belgium, Spain, Switzerland and France will be
presented with the report, and given time to consider its contents
before making their own comments.
</P>
<P>
But six human rights groups who joined the appeal will not be
allowed to see the document Straw had refused to publish.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office later confirmed copies of the report had been
dispatched to the relevant embassies. They have until 5pm on 22
February to make their observations.
</P>
<P>
The secret medical report at the center of the latest ruling
prompted Straw to indicate last month that he was "minded" to
declare Pinochet, 84, unfit to stand trial on torture charges, and
that therefore he should not be extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Belgium, supported by six human rights groups,
argued that his decision was fundamentally flawed and the
countries seeking Pinochet's extradition should be allowed access
to the report so that they could make a "meaningful" response to
the home secretary.
</P>
<P>
The move on Tuesday could set the final ruling on the fate of
Pinochet back several weeks.
</P>
<P>
It means if the countries feel unhappy with the result of that
report, they could go back and told Straw he had made the wrong
decision. If he then ignores them, they can challenge him again.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Greece Expected to Increase in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 was expected to
be a good year for Greek tourism with tourists' arrivals expected
to increase by 8-10 percent compared to 1999, Greek Tourism
Organization (EOT) Secretary General Evgenios Yiannakopoulos said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakopoulos said that Greece could and should have a tourism
industry operating incessantly for 12 months a year and developing,
among others, thousands of new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Greece should utilize its comparative advantages systematically
and the big communication opportunity provided by the 2004 Olympic
games which will take place in Athens, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that his organization's main target was to
modernize infrastructure and hotels, decrease dependence on
seasonal demand in the summer and infiltrate foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EOT would open branch offices in China, Egypt,
Cyprus and Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece now holds 16th place internationally on the list of
tourist destinations. In 1998, 11.4 million tourists visited
Greece and the number is expected to exceed 13 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, people employed in the tourism sector currently
account for 8-10 percent of the total number of the country's
working force and tourist exchange flowing into the country
amounts to 6 billion dollars per year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy: New Fighter Ready for Full Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Navy hopes to receive the go-ahead this spring to start
full-rate production of the aircraft. It plans to spend 45 billion
U.S. dollars to buy 548 of the upgraded version of older F/A-18s
over the next decade. The total cost, including development, is
estimated at 47 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said the carrier jet received the best possible
grades in six months of operation evaluation tests in California
State.
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon officials said Defense Secretary William
Cohen had not had a chance to evaluate the Navy's test results and
that final approval of full-rate production would not be given
until those results were analyzed carefully.
</P>
<P>
The Super Hornet is to replace today's older-model F/A-18s as
well as F-14 Tomcat fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Navy hopes to put the first Super Hornet squadron aboard a
carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Demand for High-Speed Internet Is Building in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. market research and
consulting firm reported Tuesday that 23 million American Internet
users are interested in buying high-speed Internet to their home
for 40 dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Of these, said the Strategis Group, more than 12 million are
ready to purchase now. "Demand for high-speed residential access
is building like water behind a dam," the firm said. "As operator
deployment and provisioning creates an avenue for user adoption,
we will see a rush of growth in home high-speed usage."
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, nearly 1.9 million households in the United
States subscribed to high-speed access via cable modem, digital
subscriber line (DSL), direct broadcast satellite or wireless
broadband. That represents a 185 percent increase over 1998 totals,
higher growth than household Internet adoption in general.
</P>
<P>
The Strategis Group expects more than 25 million high-speed
households by 2004. This rapid increase in customers will drive
service revenues from residential high-speed Internet from 580
million dollars to 7.67 billion dollars in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm, cable modems, the early lead
among the technologies, will serve 46 percent of customers in 2004.
But DSL made strong strides in 1999 and will account for 40
percent of the residential market in five years. Fixed wireless
broadband is beginning to become more active in the residential
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
While availability is currently the key constraint on the
growth of high-speed services, the firm said, market education
will also prove to be a challenge. Seventy-five percent users do
not know if anyone in their area provides high-speed access
services, while two-thirds say they know little or nothing about
cable modems and more than 80 percent say they know little or
nothing about DSL.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Past Failures Contribute Current Violence in Kosovo  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- French peace-keepers
came under attack by Albanian snipers, a U.N. refugee agency bus
was hit by Albanian terrorists. Bloodshed was created in Kosovo,
the Yugoslav province, over the past days in the wake of a new
wave of violence in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica, the most multi-
ethnic area in the Serbian Republic.
</P>
<P>
The ethnically divided city of Mitrovica has been the center
of much of the recent turmoil. The latest spark was a February 2
rocket attack on a U.N. bus carrying Serbs that killed two Serbs
under the escort of international peace-keepers, known as KFOR,
near Mitrovica, some 32 kilometers from the provincial capital of
Pristina. The unsolved assault was followed the next day by a
night of violence in northern in the mining town of Mitrovica. The
bloody night saw a grenade attack on a Serbian cafe that left 15
people injured.
</P>
<P>
The fresh round of violence has again brought the question of
Kosovo's peace and ethnic coexistence to center stage as the key
issue is facing the United Nations Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR, which have failed to create a safe and
secure environment for all ethnic groups in Kosovo since their
arrival in the province last June.
</P>
<P>
A June 10 U.N. Security Council resolution, which authorized
the creation of UNMIK and KFOR, demands full respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, the guarantee of security and equality for all ethnic
groups in the Albanian-dominated province, and full disarmament of
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Left unresolved, the division of Kosovo into a hostile region
could mean that the U.S.-led NATO has won the aggression war only
to eventually lose the peace, further destabilizing the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the Security Council,
unilaterally launched 78-day air strikes on Yugoslavia, a
sovereign member of the U.N. family, grossly violating the U.N.
Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government Sunday demanded that the Security
Council hold an emergency meeting to find a way to end the "
genocidal" attacks on Serbs in Kosovo, following a deadly gunfight
in the town of Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
"The attack against Kosovska Mitrovica is part of a clear plot
by the (ethnic) Albanian terrorists who want to clean all of
Kosovo of Serbs and create an ethnically pure state," the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry has said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The recent wave of violence, to a large extent, resulted from
the failure of UNMIK and KFOR to honor the Security Council
resolution by completely demilitarizing KLA.
</P>
<P>
In a February 11 letter to the president of the Security
Council, Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav
Mission to the United Nations, accused of the failure of UNMIK and
KFOR to fully disarm KLA and "other armed Kosovo Albanian groups."
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led KFOR took over security functions in the province,
which has been put under U.N. administration. But the peace-
keepers have largely been unable to stop a wave of recent attacks
by the ethnic Albanians which has largely emptied Kosovo of its
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK, rather than enforcing a total disarmament, set up the
Kosovo Protection Corps as the successor armed group to KLA, thus
leaving a large number of various weapons remaining in the hands
of former KLA fighters, who have been long fighting for the
independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
That means NATO is stuck in Kosovo indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"Today, NATO is becoming a hostage of those separatists who
tried to create their own independent state linked to Albania,"
Russian Col.-Gen. Leonid Ivashov said in a radio interview in
Russia Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declares Tornado-Ravaged Georgia State a Disaster Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 others injured
as tornadoes slashed through southwest Georgia State early Monday.
</P>
<P>
The tornadoes touched down just after midnight in Colquitt,
Tift, Mitchell and Grady counties. The Mitchell County town of
Camilla appeared to be hardest hit, with tornadoes cutting a 10-
kilometer path through a housing development south of town.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's action made federal funding available to cover housing
and to provide grants and loans to help individuals and business
owners recover from the storms.
</P>
<P>
The White House said federal funding also is available to local
governments for debris removal and emergency protective measures.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is still conducting
damage surveys, which could result in more counties becoming
eligible for assistance.
