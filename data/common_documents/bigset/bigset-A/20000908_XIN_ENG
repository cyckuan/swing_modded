<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is prepared to work
closely with Bangladesh in lowering tensions in the South Asian
region and promoting peace and stability, said Pakistani High
Commissioner in Dhaka Iqbal Ahmed Khan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent letter to
Pakistan Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf, the diplomat
said Pakistan entirely agrees with the proposals offered by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
As special envoy of the prime minister, Bangladeshi Foreign
Secretary Shafi Sami visited New Delhi and Islamabad in close
proximity ostensibly in a bid to reduce tensions in the region and
revitalize the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (
SAARC).
</P>
<P>
The South Asian cooperation forum, considered an important
vehicle for expanding cooperation among the member countries and
ensuring peace in the region, remained almost nonfunctional
following military takeover in Pakistan last year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, tensions have also been mounting in the region
centering friction between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner Iqbal said it is extremely important that
the root cause of conflict between India and Pakistan that whipped
up tensions in the region should be addressed with all earnestness.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the root cause is Kashmir. Once it is resolved,
the countries in the region would be able to harness tremendous
potential that exists in South Asia," Iqbal pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He referred to General Musharraf's offer of no-war pact with
India and mutual reduction of troops, which he made at the United
Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. Musharraf also offered
dialogue with India anytime at any place to defuse the stresses
and strains.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to have a meeting
with General Musharraf early Friday on the sidelines of the U.N.
Millennium Summit. Regional peace and cooperation among the SAARC
nations are likely to feature their talks.

<HEADLINE> South-East Asian TB Training to be Held in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The fourth South-East Asian
Tuberculosis (TB) Training is to be held here from September 11 to
enhance the capability of managers involved in the eradication of
TB in the South-East Asian region, according to the joint convenor
of the training.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day training to be held under the joint aegis of the
Nepali National TB Center and the World Health Organization is
expected to add to the effort to control TB, which has assumed
alarming proportions in the region, Miss Jamuna Shrestha, the
joint convenor, told the press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The training will cover the theoretical issues of TB control,
the use of labs, training supervision and supervision procedures,
drugs management and evaluation, Shrestha said.
</P>
<P>
Some 38 TB control managers from Nepal, India, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea will participate in the training, she said.
</P>
<P>
Observers from Nepal, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland will
also attend the training, she added.
</P>
<P>
TB is a major public health problem in the South Asian
countries. Statistics shows that the region accounts for over 30
percent of the global TB cases.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Expounds Principles of Respect for Sovereign Equality, Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Human rights and
sovereign equality are the two fundamental principles that should
be both respected in dealing with the world affairs, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here Thursday at the interactive round-
table session of the United Nations Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
After citing the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations
adopted 55 years ago, Jiang said: "The two fundamental principles
of respect for human rights and sovereign equality were
established."
</P>
<P>
Expounding on the relationship between human rights and
sovereignty, Jiang said: "it is necessary for the international
community to review these two principles."
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, it is the common aspiration of all mankind to
ensure and enjoy fully the human rights. And it is the sacred duty
of all governments to promote and protect human rights. All
countries are obligated to promote and protect the human rights
and fundamental freedoms of their own people in accordance with
the relevant international instruments on human rights and their
national laws in the light of their own national conditions," the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the principles of sovereign equality of all
countries, mutual respect for state sovereignty and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs remain the basic
norms governing contemporary international relations," Jiang
stressed.
</P>
<P>
All countries are equal, big or small, rich or poor, strong or
weak. It is the divine duty of each government and people to
safeguard state sovereignty and national security. "The people of
a country are entitled to independently choosing their own social
system and development model in the light of their national
conditions and to shaping their own way of life," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people know full well that a country that is
unable to safeguard its sovereignty can not possibly protect human
rights. Therefore, we cherish dearly our national liberation and
state sovereignty which the Chinese people won through protracted
and sanguinary struggles. I am sure that this is true of all
nations," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty and human rights do not conflict with each other,
but rather complement each other and all the countries should
admit and respect the differences and diversity of the world,
Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Ways to Strengthen U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Thursday offered a four-point view on the strengthening
of the United Nations' role in the new century in order to meet
the need of the international situation and the requirements of
the times.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the interactive round-table session of the U.N.
Millennium Summit, Jiang said that the 55-year-old U.N. should and
can play a bigger role in the new century, and that strengthening
the world body's role is "the common task" facing all countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang called for promoting the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, upholding the authority of the
Security Council, enhancing the U.N. role in promoting development
and promoting the democratic decision-making system in the world
body as ways to strengthen its U.N. role.
</P>
<P>
"We should work together to promote the purposes and principles
of the U.N. Charter," Jiang said, adding that "Facts have proved
that the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter remain valid
and relevant."
</P>
<P>
The Charter is a guide for state-to-state relations and it has
identified a road for all countries to follow and set rules for
them to abide by, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged all countries to work together to uphold the
authority of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is the primary responsibility and lofty mission of the U.N.
Security Council to maintain international peace and security as
entrusted by the U.N. charter," he said, adding that it is a
solemn commitment of all U.N. member states to ensure the Council
fulfill its responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is the core of the collective security
mechanism. Taking unilateral actions by bypassing the Security
Council is dangerous and against the will of all member states,"
Jiang warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese president called for greater role of the
U.N. in promoting common development of mankind, one of the
purposes for founding the organization, and the promotion of the
democratic decision-making system in the world body.
</P>
<P>
"With such a large membership of 189, the U.N. is in the best
position to discuss and address this issue that developing
countries are faced with and it should give it top priority,"
Jiang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all the U.N. members, irrespective of their
size, strength and wealth, should be treated as equals.
</P>
<P>
"The reform of the U.N. should reflect fully the common will of
its member states," Jiang went on to say. "Particular and adequate
attention should be given to the reasonable demands and
fundamental interests of the vast majority of developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Fair, Equitable New Int'l Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Thursday at the interactive round-table session of
the U.N. Millennium Summit that a fair and equitable new
international economic order should be established so as to
promote the common development of mankind in the process of
economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should also dedicate itself to establishing a
rational new international financial and trade system and
mitigating the risk borne by the developing countries in the
process of economic globalization," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the fast advancement of science and technology nowadays,
the U.N. should pay special attention to calling upon the
international community to assist developing countries in terms of
human resources development and science and technology so as to
enable them to keep abreast with the new wave of technological
progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the economic globalization is an objective
trend emerging with the development of social productive forces,
Jiang said the progress of modern technology and the birth of
advanced transportation vehicles and telecommunication means have
created conditions for the development of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
"However, countries found themselves in very dissimilar
positions and situations in the process of economic globalization.
While the developed countries are reaping all the 'dividend' of
globalization, the vast number of developing countries are still
suffering from poverty and backwardness," the Chinese president
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We need an 'all-win' economic globalization in which all
countries, North or South, big or small, are all beneficiaries; we
need an economic globalization in which all countries can
participate as equal members," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need an economic globalization in which all countries can
coexist, only when there is mutual respect, mutual promotion and
diversity of economic growth mode, culture and value, can world
civilization thrive and prosper," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> South African Youth Called to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma on Thursday challenged youth to be active in
the fight against spread of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an AIDS awareness campaign, Zuma said over the past
few years government had used every conceivable method to
highlight the dangers of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the government's HIV/AIDS awareness
campaign had been highly successful, what remained was "for us to
break the AIDS chain".
</P>
<P>
"This can only be done by individuals like yourselves and like
myself taking responsibility for our own lives. I always liken HIV/
AIDS to an invading army and when an invading army attacks, it
aims to destroy," Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore in our fight against HIV/AIDS, we must defend
ourselves and our country. We must fight back, defend ourselves
and chase away the enemy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"You must also be active in convincing those who still do not
believe that HIV/AIDS exists that indeed it is a serious threat
and that it kills. That is the task that I give you today," he
said.
</P>

Made dismissed claims by CFU that the Land Acquisition Act was
constitutionally defective.
</P>
<P>
The land acquisitions are within the confines of the
constitution, he told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
CFU said it intends to challenge the constitutionality of the
land acquisition program through the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The farmer organization wants the Supreme Court to set aside
all the preliminary notices to acquire land published since June 2.
</P>
<P>
Made refuted the organization's plan to relaunch its
application in the High Court to appeal against the compulsory
acquisition of land for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was dealing with individual
farmers and not the union.
</P>
<P>
CFU is free to drag us to court if it owns any land. We have
not seen any title deeds belonging to CFU. We are dealing only
with individual farmers and they have 30 days to make their
individual appeals," Made said.
</P>
<P>
He added the DFU has a misconception that with the resettlement
program, the agricultural output would be reduced by 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Made said the local farmers, who would benefit from the program,
already produced more than the white commercial farmers and yet
they farm on poor soils.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that there might be a slight reduction in
tobacco and wheat production. End item

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Vows to Continue Land Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe said on Friday
that it would push ahead with the seizure of white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Millennium Summit which opened at the U.N.
headquarters in New York Wednesday, Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said his land-seizure policy is justified because British
colonial rule left 70 percent of the arable land in the hands of
less than one percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has been criticized by the world's powerful nations for
allowing black Zimbabwean war veterans to occupy thousands of
farms across the impoverished country.
</P>
<P>
"Their response has been staggering beyond description. My
country, my government, my party and my persons are labeled "land
grabbers', demonized, reviled and threatened with sanctions in the
face of accusations of reverse-racism," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"But our conscience is clear. We will not go back. We shall
continue to effect economic and social justice for all our people
without fear or favor," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the world ran the risk of demanding the reform of
national governments and institutions in developing states while
doing nothing to overhaul "undemocratic bodies" such as the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations
itself, he added.

OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd

the entry into force of the country's additional nuclear protocol
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released here, the Canadian ministers said
their country is meeting its multilateral obligations for the

"The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission will be responsible for
implementing the measures Canada has agreed to under the Protocol,

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore and his Republican rival George W.
Bush were virtually tied in two news polls published here Thursday,
but Gore has gained an advantage on top issues such as economy,
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll conducted by CNN, USA Today and Gallup,
Gore had 47 percent to 44 percent for Bush among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
Another poll by ABC-Washington Post showed that the two
presidential candidates were tied at 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
But another poll of 1,001 by Reuters found Gore led Bush by 46
to 40 percent. The poll was taken Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The polls showed that Gore is gaining momentum in his campaign
after the Democratic national convention. Bush led Gore in polls
taken before the two conventions.
</P>
<P>
The ABC-Washington Post poll showed that Gore has opened up a
50-38 advantage on education, and has a slight edge on managing
the economy and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
He also enjoys a double-digit lead on health care and
environment while Bush has an edge on tax and national defense.
</P>
<P>
While Bush held about a 20-point lead among men, Gore has
opened up an 18-point lead among women in the ABC-Washington Post
poll.
</P>
<P>
The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 777 likely voters was taken
Monday through Wednesday and has an error margin of plus or minus
4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> EU Dissatisfied With Revised U.S. Exports Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Friday expressed its dissatisfaction over a revised exports plan
of the United States, describing it as little more than window-
dressing.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc said it expected to mount a new round of
challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) if the proposed
changes were enacted in the U.S. exports plan.
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes were described as "little more than window-
dressing" by one EU official on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have said clearly that the legislation as it is currently
worded does not address the principal problem that we have with
the Foreign Sales Corporation regime and that it constitutes an
export subsidy and is export contingent," said Anthony Gooch, EU
trade spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress on Thursday agreed to quickly revise the
export program which the WTO found to be an illegal subsidy.
</P>
<P>
But the proposed changes to the program do not satisfy the EU
that had challenged the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation scheme at
the WTO already.
</P>
<P>
"The system that is being proposed by (the U.S.) congress at
the moment continues to be contingent on exporting. If that
legislation is put into place by October 1, then no doubt we will
take this up with the WTO again speedily to ask whether they agree
with our view that the system is export contingent," Gooch added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been given by the WTO until October 1 to
work out a replacement program to its Foreign Sales Corporation
scheme to bring it into line with world trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Under WTO rules, if the EU feels that the United States has not
complied with the WTO ruling, it can return to Geneva after
October 1 and ask the WTO dispute panel to rule on the legality of
the revised U.S. program.
</P>
<P>
Should the panel rules against the revised U.S. program, the EU
could seek compensation from the United States or ask WTO
permission to impose sanctions on U.S. goods which could amount to
as much as billions of dollars.

LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Friday that the comprehensive schools in Britain must
undergo radical changes to enable them to match the educational
standards of public and grammar schools.
</P>
<P>
Blair attacked what he called a "one-size-fits-all mentality"
of comprehensives, and called on them to become more flexible to
be able to offer pupils personalized provision.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two-day Progress 21st Century conference held in
Bedfordshire, England, Blair hailed education as still being Labor
's highest policy priority in the long term.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister underlined the government's determination to
raise standards in primary education, but called for a new
approach in the secondary sector.
</P>
<P>
He added the government is committed to the setting up of 800
specialist schools in England by September 2003 -- out of a total
of 3,500 schools -- offering advanced teaching in languages,
technology, sports and arts.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Progress 21st Century conference will also debate
the knowledge economy, social justice, the community, reinventing
government and Britain's new role in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Progress initiative was established by a group of Labor
Party activists in 1996 to promote dialogue between the leadership

<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The political representatives
of loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland held talks Friday
about a feud between rival groups.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and
Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) have been involved in the violent
dispute for more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the meeting in Belfast was postponed for a
second time after a number of incidents in the north of the city.
</P>
<P>
Assemblymen David Ervine and Dawn Purvis and the Lisburn
councilors Gary McMichael and David Adams of the Ulster Defense
Party (UDP) were involved in discussions which have been described
as "an exploratory dialogue."
</P>
<P>
There were no representatives from the Shankill area of Belfast,
where the feud began, on either side.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the police uncovered a weapons cache in a planned
search on Malvern Way in the Shankill which they said "undoubtedly
saved lives."
</P>
<P>
Three men have been shot dead in the violence and many families
have been intimidated from their homes in the loyalist Shankill
Road area of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, most of the community groups based on the
Shankill Road issued a statement calling on the paramilitary
groups to find another way of resolving their differences.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lorry drivers in Britain Friday
caused chaos on a key motorway in a protest echoing that of their
French counterparts to demonstrate against high fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 heavy goods vehicles and tractors took part in a
"go slow" protest on the highway at Gateshead on Tyneside Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of lorry drivers headed for the Texaco refinery in
Pembroke with the aim of staging a further blockade.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and lorry drivers, angry against high fuel prices, said
the protest was the first of many which would continue over the
weekend and spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
The protest, which coincided with the evening rush hour, lasted
for 90 minutes and thousands of motorists were caught up in
tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40-50 trucks were set to begin blockade of a
Texaco refinery at Pembroke in west Wales Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to make the government aware of the problems we
face and the fuel companies as well," said protest organizer
Phillip Rees.
</P>
<P>
In France, the five-day fuel blockades were thought to have
left 80 percent of petrol stations dry, with airports beginning to
cancel internal flights because of fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, protesting UK farmers and hauliers were still
picketing Shell's Stanlow oil refinery near Ellesmere Port in
Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
A Shell spokesman at Stanlow said the protest would begin to
have an effect on petrol stations throughout the north of England
later Friday.
</P>
<P>
It began as a blockade Thursday but was broken up after police
threatened to arrest them. However, more than 500 members of the
Less Tax on Fuel group have pledged to join the protest from
Friday and over the weekend in shifts.
</P>
<P>
British Transport Minister Lord Macdonald said British
protesters did not have the right to interrupt vital supplies.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reaffirms Confederal Solution for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Friday that a solution that does not consider the
sovereign existence and equality of "the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus " as the basis, can not be lasting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the stance in a written statement before Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash leaves for New York on September 9 to
attend the fourth round of the proximity talks on Cyprus, Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a Mediterranean island, has been divided into Greek
Cypriots-dominated south and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots proclaimed "the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, which is only recognized by Turkey. Turkey and
Greece support their side in the island state on ethnic line.
</P>
<P>
U.N. has been trying for decades to reunify the state on a bi-
communal, bi-zonal federation formula, but Denktash, who walked out
of peace talks in 1997, required a confederation of two equal
states on the island.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the U.N., the sides have held three rounds of
proximity talks since the second half of last year to prepare
grounds for substantial peace talks. But no tangible progress has
been reported.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "Mr. Denktash proposed a realist arrangement
which foresees cooperation on the basis of a confederal structure
between the two states on the island. We share and support the
proposal of Mr. Denktash."
</P>
<P>
He said that only when the two sides are considered equals, "the
direct and comprehensive negotiations will start. This is the
common understanding of the President Rauf Denktash and us."

<HEADLINE> Iran Cautions OPEC Members Against Oversupply of Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh here on Friday told members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) not to make any big increase
in crude output when they meet in Vienna, Austria, next week.
</P>
<P>
OPEC member countries should take into consideration the decline
in world economic growth in order to avoid any imbalance of oil
supply in the market, the minister was quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that world economic growth forecast is 4.5
percent for the year 2000, while this figure is only 3.9 percent
next year.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh and his OPEC counterparts are to start their regular
meeting in Vienna on Sunday to decide whether to make any further
increase in output to bring down the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members, excluding Iraq, have increased oil output quota
twice since March to control rising oil prices. But the prices have
remained high, surpassing 30 U.S. dollars a barrel recently.
</P>
<P>
On the continuous price hike since last month, Zanganeh said it
was not caused by a lack of supply. But he referred to
psychological factors, speculation in the oil market and U.S.
presidential elections as important factors in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He said oil producing countries within OPEC have acted enough
and responsibly in the past few months to stabilize the oil market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members have actually added 2.5 million barrels per day to
their total production in the past six months, thus effectively
preventing any lack of supply, the minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that in the past two months, there has been a hike in
crude supply in the market by some 1.5 to 2 million barrels per
day.
</P>
<P>
About Saudi Arabia's reported unilateral increase in supply by
500,000 barrels a day as of July 1, Zanganeh said this has not been
confirmed by his Saudi counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia as a founding member of OPEC is not expected to act
against the organization's collective decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zanganeh also voiced his concern about world oil producers'
dwindling excess capacity of crude production, which now stands at
less than 2 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Non-OPEC oil producing countries are now doing their best to
produce 49 million barrels per day and the OPEC production stands
at 28.5 million barrels per day, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited dropping of oil income, lacking of investment and U.S.
sanctions on Libya, Iran and Iraq as the main factors blocking the
creation of excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
Iran, as the second largest OPEC producer after Saudi Arabia,
currently pumps some 3.8 million barrels of crude per day, of which
nearly 2.45 million barrels are exported.

<P>
The minister was speaking at the international literacy day
celebrations whose theme was "An hour of learning for every adult,
" here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though there are some factors that have hindered
the literacy program such as low publicity and inadequate funding,
the program has however scored achievement as in learning and high
enrollment of women participation.
</P>
<P>
"Adult literacy is one way we can reduce the poverty levels and
it would also help to foster development in the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga further said adult literacy would empower women to
control their lives and therefore, break free from the bone of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for more concerted efforts from both
government and the cooperating partners and further urged the
cooperating partners and other stakeholders to come and fight
illiteracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
And speaking earlier, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) country
representative Cheikh Ndiaye said illiteracy is a major stumbling
in Africa, adding that governments should therefore focus their
attention on literacy issues and needs in order to reaffirm the
importance of literacy to society.
</P>
<P>
Ndiaye said unless it is given adequate human and financial
resources, literacy cannot make a significant impact.
</P>
<P>
He added that significant and sustained improvement would not
be possible unless literacy programs are designed to change
prevailing norms and attitudes that keep women and girls
uninformed, insecure dependent and overburdened.
</P>
<P>
Ndiaye congratulated teachers, non-Governmental Organizations (
NGO's)and other stakeholders in Zambia for their tireless efforts
in combating illiteracy.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Intensifies Strike against Transnational Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has stepped up
fight against transnational crimes with some 70 police officers
having received special training within and outside the country, a
senior police officer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the October 1998 U.S. embassy bombing, we have
stepped up efforts to fight transnational crimes," Tanzanian
Director of Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu said at a ceremony
in which Tanzanian police accepted drug and explosive search dogs
from their British counterpart
</P>
<P>
Rajabu cautioned that efforts made by the government towards
that end are not enough and that the whole society should join the
fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going civil war in neighboring Burundi and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo posed threat to the peace and
stability in Tanzania, as armed robbery increased in border areas
with mass influx of refugees and illegal weapons.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it has
arrested a top aide to Chechen rebel leader Arbi Barayev.
</P>
<P>
Kharon Yunusov, the 35-year-old chief of staff of notorious
Chechen field commander Barayev, was arrested in Moscow in late
August, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting a spokesman for
the Russian Interior Ministry's main anti-organized crime
department.
</P>
<P>
The department received information that Yunusov, who was
allegedly involved in numerous abductions and combat operations
against federal forces for Barayev's band, was to arrive in Moscow
to visit his nephew in a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Yunusov was arrested while leaving the hospital on August 28
and a hand grenade was seized from him.
</P>
<P>
Yunusov, charged with illegal possession of arms, is now being

<HEADLINE> French Minister Warns Against Prolonging Oil Refinery Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Transport
Jean-Claude Gayssot warned the protesting truckers and farmers
Friday evening against prolonging their blockade of oil refineries
and roads.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with France 3 television channel, Gayssot said
that the police force would intervene if the blockade continues
because the country cannot endure an indefinite blockade which has
been going on since Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is very evident that the situation of blockade cannot last,
" he said when asked whether the government is considering
resorting to force to lift the blockade.
</P>
<P>
"We call on everybody to take up his responsibility. The
country cannot be blocked," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
While two national unions of truckers have agreed to lift the
blockade, one last union, the National Union of Syndicated
Organizations of Road Haulers, said it will continue the blockade
until the government meets its demand for further oil tax cut.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the oil stations of the Total-Fina-Elf oil
company and 80 percent of those of the U.S. company Esso have run
out of oil except those on the highways and in the Paris region.
</P>
<P>
The whole French economy is beginning to feel the pinch from
the blockade, as department stores are running out of goods and
airports are canceling flights.
</P>
<P>
The traffic on many highways are being disrupted by protesters
who are staging "snail operation" to block roads.
</P>
<P>
The oil unrest, triggered by sharp rises in oil prices over the
past few months, is also spreading to other European countries,
including Britain, Belgium, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has urged France to stop the blockade which
it says is threatening the economic activities of the whole
continent.
</P>
<P>
In its negotiations with protesters, the French government has
agreed to cut oil tax by 35 centimes (five U.S. cents) a liter
this year and 25 centimes (3.5 U.S. cents) next year.
</P>
<P>
The government has ruled out further concessions because of the
strong opposition to oil tax cutting from the Greens, who make up
part of the left-wing coalition of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

<HEADLINE> Annan Concerned at Impact of High Oil Prices on Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said the oil
price increase has relieved the financial pressures in major oil
exporting countries, but the potential of a serious impact on
inflation and interest rates in major importing countries remain.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, sharp increases in oil prices have
triggered recessions that hurt all countries including the oil
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Expressing particular concern at the adverse effects on oil
importing developing countries, the U.N. chief said high oil bills
could easily jeopardize the first signs of recovery in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are less able to substitute oil by other
energy sources, and their smaller technological and financial
capacity to introduce energy efficient processes and the
increasing burden would result in balance of payments problems and
a reduction in other imports and spending, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The poorest segments of the developing countries will be
hardest hit with an attendant rise in prices of other essential
goods such as fuel, food and transport," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that major oil producers, which have demonstrated
their willingness to look at oil prices and related supply/demand
issues in a long-term context, would be sensitive to the impact of
their decisions on the world economy, especially on the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices soared to a 10-year high of 32.85 U.S. dollars a
barrel on Monday. Experts attribute the trend to expectations that
increased production of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) is not enough to compensate for shortages of U.S.
heating oil expected this winter.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Missile Hit Kursk Nuclear Sub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday vehemently
denied a German newspaper report that the submarine Kursk, which
sank last month and killed all 118 crew aboard, had been hit by a
guided cruise missile fired by a Russian warship.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Berliner Zeitung report that sub had been sunk by a
Granit missile fired by the Pyotr Veliky cruiser was untrue, said
Igor Dygalo, a Russian Navy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Kursk went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August
12 during naval exercises.
</P>
<P>
Dygalo said that missiles and torpedoes used in naval exercises
do not carry warheads, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal
Security Service (FSB), also dismissed the report as "completely
groundless."
</P>
<P>
The German paper said a supposed FSB commission headed by FSB
chief Nikolai Patrushev had come to such a conclusion and reported
it to President Vladimir Putin on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who heads a
government commission probing the disaster, also rejected the
German report.
</P>
<P>
"No firing was taking place at the time the Kursk catastrophe
occurred," Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said authorities are now considering three possible causes --
a collision with another object, a World War Two era mine, or an
emergency in the first (torpedo) compartment of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
"All these versions are equally possible," Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
In Severomorsk, the home port of the Northern Fleet, commander
of the Pyotr Veliky cruiser, Vladimir Kasatonov, said he was
outraged by the Berliner Zeitung article.
</P>
<P>
The Pyotr Veliky did carry out "planned" missile launches
during the exercises, Kasatonov said. "In an effort to ensure
security and rule out non-standard situations during training
exercises, areas for every vessel's whereabouts are clearly
designated and sectors and times for missile and torpedo firing
are defined."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Kursk "could not have been in the area of a
missile launched from the cruiser even in theory," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pyotr Veliky "was participating in the operation to rescue
the Kursk crew up until the last moment," the captain said. "The
sailors did not sleep for days, but none of them took the rest
because everybody knew that we were rescuing our own," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is immoral to blame the cruiser's crew for the deaths of
our friends," Kasatonov said.

<HEADLINE> India Urges Global Strategy Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- India said on Friday
that in a globalized economy, poverty eradication cannot be
treated as the exclusive responsibility of individual nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Millennium Summit which opened at the U.N.
headquarters in New York on Wednesday, India's Prime Minister
Bihari Vajpayee said it should be the concern of all humanity and
a new global strategy against the poverty is essential.
</P>
<P>
Another universal concern is the debt burden of many developing
nations, which grows yearly with new debt being contracted to pay
off current interest charges, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
This results in a continual hemorrhage of wealth that further
debilitates the developing world, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations has a signal role to play in this global
efforts: by focusing attention on equitable development, by
ensuring that development is not the preserve of a few," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is time that we looked at assurance of economic development,
growth and distribution together in a high-level U.N. conference,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged that development be made a cross
cutting issue in the work of a reformed United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank said
Friday evening that it does not exclude the possibility of
intervening in the market to support the euro, whose exchange rate
has fallen to a record low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting of finance ministers, representatives of the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission held in
Versailles southwest of Paris, ECB Vice President Christian Noyer
and French Minister of Finance Laurent Fabius said that "
intervention is an element which remains ready at any moment."
</P>
<P>
Fabius is the current president of the Eurogroup which groups
the finance ministers of 11 euro zone countries and is in charge
of coordinating financial policy with the ECB.
</P>
<P>
The Eurogroup and ECB said in a communique after the meeting
that they are following the situation of euro very closely and are
concerned about the present exchange rate of the single currency
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the euro zone countries are
experiencing "solid growth" and achieving "progress in the fiscal
field."
</P>
<P>
It also said that further structural reforms are needed for the
euro zone countries "in order to increase the potential of growth.
"
</P>
<P>
The euro has fallen 30 percent to 0.87 U.S. dollar, the lowest
since its launching in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Stresses Palestinian Refugees' Right to Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Friday reaffirmed that Palestinian refugees should go back to their
country, warning that "there will not be a peace without their
return."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud made the remarks when meeting a visiting British
parliament delegation, which is on tour to the region, staring with
Lebanon, to study and assess the situation of the Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We will not see the real, just and comprehensive peace unless
the Golan Height is liberated and those Palestinian refugees are
allowed to go back," Lahoud stressed.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 3.5 million Palestinians have been displaced since
Israel was founded in 1948 and they are scattered in Lebanon, Syria
and Jordan. Their return is a key issue in the Palestinian-Israeli
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that his country does not agree to
discriminate against refugees. "What's the difference between the
refugees after 1948 and 1967?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has hinted that the refugees after the 1967 Mideast war
could return while those in the 1948 exodus will not be granted the
right. About half the refugees in Lebanon came after the first
Middle East war in 1948.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have made it very clear that Lebanon will not host
Palestinian refugees for ever. We will not compromise under
international pressures, nor will we accept them faced up with
substantial lure," the leader said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has strongly favored the leave of the registered 360,000
Palestinian refugees, the key factor behind the 1975-1990 sectarian
war, fearing their stay can tip the sectarian balance again.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, reports revealed that some organizations wanted
to offer Lebanon 20 billion U.S. dollars in return for Lebanon's
nod to nationalize and host the Palestinian refugees for ever. The
president hastened to deny the "rumor" and affirmed the non-
acceptance stance.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Names New West Bank Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
General Staff Friday appointed Brigadier General Benny Ganz as the
new commander of Israeli forces in Judea and Samaria, or the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ganz will replace his predecessor Shlomo Oren, who resigned
earlier for a deadly operation mishap, in the next few weeks, an
order signed by IDF Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz stated.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Oren, who took over the command just last
March, was accepted by Mofaz on Thursday when the chief of general
staff presented the investigation findings of the botched raid.
Oren became the highest-ranking officer ever who quit without being
asked to step down.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers of the elite Duvdevan unit, or special troops in
the West Bank, were killed during the operation two weeks ago, when
their comrades mistakenly identified them as targets and killed
them.
</P>
<P>
One disaster after another, the real hunted man Mahmud Abu-
Hanud, a Hamas extremist, managed to flee from the scene after
being wounded and surrendered himself later to the Palestinian
forces.
</P>
<P>
Before IDF's withdrawal from south Lebanon last May, Ganz was
the head of the IDF-Lebanese Liaison Unit. The career experience in
Lebanon may help Ganz to accommodate himself to the new post, which
was regarded one of the most important position in the IDF,
especially facing the possible conflicts with the Palestinians in
the West Bank in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Liberation Organization's Central Council will
meet Saturday to decide whether to declare an independent state on
September 13 without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement.
</P>
<P>
Some Israelis had warned that such a unilateral action will lead
to large-scale conflicts between the two sides in the occupied West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Pilot Bars Israeli Security Officials From Searching Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An EgyptAir pilot said on Friday
that he had barred armed Israeli security men from searching his
plane at the Palestinian Gaza airport and flew back to Cairo empty
after the Israelis stopped passengers boarding his plane.
</P>
<P>
Captain Ali Murad said upon return to Cairo airport that he had
prevented the Israelis from searching his plane because the
aircraft "is considered Egyptian territory with Egyptian
sovereignty," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
An EgyptAir official at Cairo airport said that Egypt, Israel
and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) have an agreement for
Egyptian planes using Gaza airport to be searched by one unarmed
Israeli security official accompanied by an unarmed Palestinian
security official and airline security men, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Murad, who is head of Egypt's Pilots' Union, said that he was
surprised to see his plane surrounded by a number of Israeli armed
security men right after the passengers got off.
</P>
<P>
But "I barred the security men from entering the plane to search
it in accordance with the rules and laws of civil aviation," he was
quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security services control air traffic in and out of Gaza
under agreements signed with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian ambassador in Israel, Mohammed Bassiouni, sent a
representative to the airport to intervene, but negotiations failed
to resolve the matter and the plane left for Egypt without its 91
passengers after four hours of delay.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian national carrier later sent another plane to Gaza
to fly the passengers to Egypt.

LUANDA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) reiterated here on Friday for the Angolan government
's efforts to provide all the school-age children with quality
education.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a letter to the Angolan government while the world
was marking the International Adult Literacy Day, the UNICEF
delegation in Luanda hailed the success achieved by the Angolan
government in the nationwide campaign for fighting illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.5 million people have been trained by the programs
sponsored by Angola's Ministry of Education and Culture in the
basic process of communication since 1975 when the country gained
independence, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "alphabetization corresponds to a fundamental
right of the human being, contributes for his liberation from
alienation and servitude, and constitutes a basic condition for
the democratic way of life."
</P>
<P>
According to a document issued by Angola's News Department, the
illiteracy rate among the Angolan population is estimated at 60
percent, mainly due to the 26 years of rampant civil conflicts
that destructed a lot of schools and displaced 3.7 million
residents, many of them being women and children.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Illiteracy is Only Way to Development: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Fighting illiteracy is the
only way to development, said Rwandan Minister of State for Social
Affairs Odetta Nyiramirimo on Friday at the celebrations to mark
the International Illiteracy Day in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
"Illiteracy is the source of poverty, disease, violence and
sectarianism," he was quoted by Rwanda News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that over 51.8 percent of the Rwandan
population cannot read and write, regretting that the highest
number of illiterates in the country are females, making up 54
percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
"What is painful is that the number of female illiterates who
are 15 years and above increases annually due to poverty and
lagging behind in development," he said, recalling that after the
1994 genocide, 30 percent of the Rwandan families are female-
headed compared with 21 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Economic Social and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), "by 2005, over 188 million people from
developing countries will be illiterate, out of which 115 million
will be females, equivalent to 61 percent."
</P>
<P>
The International Illiteracy Day, which falls on September 8
every year, was first cerebrated in 1967 after education ministers
from UNESCO countries met in Iran in 1965. The day is aimed at
reiterating the role of literacy.

're dealing with the top of the tops. And these are just the
actors," said festival director Piers Handling.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Decide United Nations Accession in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Adolf Ogi said
that the Swiss people will decide whether their country should
join the United Nations in a referendum in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland shares the United Nations values: peace, stability,
democracy and human rights," Ogi said at the U.N. Millennium
Summit in New York on Thursday. "This is why Switzerland intends
to enhance its relations with the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
What is more, he went on, Switzerland hosts an important
headquarters of the U.N. system in Geneva, but the country itself
is not a full U.N. member.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as the first Swiss president at the U.N. General
assembly, Ogi promised that the Swiss government would put the U.N.
membership issue to the people to determine in two years.
</P>
<P>
According to recent polls, the majority of the Swiss support
the idea to join the U.N.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with a group of journalists in his home
town of Kandersteg, Ogi also talked about Switzerland's relations
with the European Union (EU) and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is no timetable for his country's accession
to the EU although Switzerland has signed bilateral agreements
with it. While Switzerland has taken part in NATO's partnership
program, Ogi said, Switzerland has no intention to join NATO at
present.

<HEADLINE> Greece Has Right to Decide Balkan Policy, Says Hitiris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greece decided itself what must be its policy in the Balkan
region, said acting Greek government spokesman Tilemachos Hitiris
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou met with Milosevic in Belgrade Thursday to discuss
the upcoming elections in Yugoslavia, but the U.S. State
Department said that any meeting between a European figure of
Papandreou's stature and persons indicted for war crimes was
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
Hitiris said that there was nothing Greece could do about it if
the U.S. were not pleased.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister made a wish and a suggestion on the Yugoslav
elections for the benefit of the country itself, he said, adding
that Greece with its presence contributed to stability and peace
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Greece was in favor of the
restoration of a climate of peace, cooperation and economic
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Papandreou said Friday that Greece had briefed both
the U.S. and the European Union (EU) over his intention to visit
Belgrade, but Greece did not request authorization as this would
be inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou believed that his contacts with the Yugoslav
leadership were especially useful and his positions were
understood.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister is the only top envoy from an EU country to
visit Belgrade since NATO ended its bombings against Yugoslavia
last June.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, Communist Party of Greece (KKE) Secretary General
Aleka Papariga Friday strongly criticized the Greek government
over its Yugoslav policy, saying that the government was now
trying to influence the result of Yugoslavia's elections, which
are due to take place on September 24.
</P>
<P>
Describing Greece as "the long arm of the U.S. in the Balkans,
Papariga said that Greece had played the role of a partner in
Washington's effort to take over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
She also voiced strong opposition to the NATO exercise which is
to start in western Macedonia this weekend.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Defense
Delegation led by Major General Amos Yaron is visiting India and
called on Indian Home Minister L K Advani here on Friday, the
Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Amos Yaron is the Defense Director General of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Friday meeting was a "courtesy call", during which both
sides discussed matters of mutual interest, the PTI quoted a Home
Ministry official as saying.

According to the PTI, the India-Israel Joint Working Group,
which was agreed during the visit to India of Israeli Minister for

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines decided Friday to raise its policy rates by 100 basis
points effective next Monday, 11 September 2000.
</P>
<P>
The increase brings the overnight borrowing and lending rates
to 11.0 percent and 13.25 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the three-tiered system for overnight
placements of banks will continue to be implemented as follows: an
overnight borrowing rate of 11.0 percent will be offered for
placements of up to 5 billion pesos (11 million U.S. dollars); 9.5
percent for the next 5 billion pesos, and 8.0 percent for
placements in excess of 10 billion pesos (222 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The policy rate adjustments are aimed at addressing emerging
inflationary pressures that could arise from the pass-through
effects of the weakening of the peso-dollar exchange rate," said
the central bank in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The policy rate adjustments are also aimed at addressing the
narrowing differential between domestic and foreign interest rates,
and the consequent shift in investors preference to U.S. dollar-
denominated investments," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate increased to 4.6 percent in August,
the highest level registered in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the peso fell to a record closing low at 45.595
pesos against the U.S. dollar on September 5. The local currency
has fallen almost 12 percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it will continue to monitor development,
and "policy rates will be reviewed and adjusted as may be
warranted by prevailing conditions."
</P>
<P>
However, analysts have expressed concerns the move to raise
interest rates may reverse the economy's recovery, as it could
hamper growth momentum in the banking and property sectors.

SHANGHAI, September 8 (Xinhua)-- With influx of some 30,000
foreign experts every year, there are about 100,000 foreign people
working in this largest economic and financial city in China now,
latest statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 percent of these people are working in nearly 20,000
foreign-funded enterprises as high-class managers. The rest of the
foreign experts are engaged in scientific research, cultural
development, publishing, education, health, media and other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shanghai invites several hundred of foreign experts
on short-term work to deal with specific technical or management
problems.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign people visiting Shanghai has continued to
increase since China initiated the reform and opening-up policy in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
At first, the visitors mainly came from the former Soviet Union
and eastern Europe. Now, foreign experts from over ten countries
are playing an active role in developing Shanghai's industry,
finance, science and technology, commerce, consultation,
agriculture and education.
</P>
<P>
Now, foreign employees make up only one percent of Shanghai's
total population, much fewer than other metropolis in the world.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimated that there will be more foreign people coming
to Shanghai after China joins the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Household Spending Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Filipino families increased
their spending for household furnishings, transportation and
communication and other miscellaneous items by 5.7 percent during
the first half of the year, an institute report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The National Science and Development Board (NSDB) on the
economy said the increased family spending contributed to the
better-than-expected growth of the economy for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 3.9 percent in
the first semester of 2000 which was 1.7 percentage higher
compared to the 2.2 percent gain for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The NSDB said in its research report that spending for personal
consumption, which grew 3.2 percent, accounted for 75 percent of
the GDP growth during the first semester of 2000.
</P>
<P>
This hike in personal consumption expenditure was brought about
by a corresponding increase in spending for household furnishings
such as electrical and recreational video appliances, the NSDB
said.
</P>
<P>
Spending on transportation and communication also posted an
accelerated growth of 7.5 percent due to "the phenomenal rise in
cellular and landline phone subscriptions," it added.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures on miscellaneous goods and services went up by 4.4
percent during the first half of the year, with medical and health
services, personal care and effects as among the biggest
contributors in this sector.
</P>
<P>
"All other spending priorities of families such as on household
operations; fuel, light and water; clothing and footwear also
ticked positive growths," the report added.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- India claimed on Friday that
12 Pakistani soldiers were killed in escalated shelling along the
Line of Control (LOC) in Jammu and Kashmir since Thursday, while
three Indians, including two porters and an armyman, also lost
their lives.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani troops resorted to heavy shelling and small arms
firing along the LOC in a dozen sectors in Kashmir since Tuesday

<P>
Three Indians were killed in Pakistani troops' shelling across

<P>
In retaliatory shelling by Indian troops on Pakistani positions
at Kunda and Juda sub-sectors, 12 Pakistani soldiers were killed
and many injured, Indian defense sources told the PTI.
</P>
<P>
The shelling continued throughout the night in some sectors and
the exchanges of fire were still continuing on Friday, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore-NZ Free Trade Pact to Boost Cooperation: PM Goh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore-New Zealand
Free Trade pact, nearing completion, will give a boost to greater
arrangements between regions such as ASEAN and Australia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The local Channel News Asia (CNA) Friday quoted Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is in New York attending the UN
Millennium Summit, as speaking this to the media with his New
Zealand counterpart Helen Clark.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders enthused about the Agreement between New Zealand
and Singapore on Closer Economic Partnership (ANZSCEP) which will
be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Goh said its success would be the start to a similar agreement
between ASEAN and Closer Economic Relations (CER) countries,
Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
That is due by the year 2010 but he stressed such agreements
are to facilitate rather than replace the freeing up of
multilateral trading.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement scraps tariffs and export subsidies and
liberalizes access to each other's services sectors.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the agreement will mean Singapore can tap into New
Zealand's skilled professionals, something he has often said the
country needs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the two leaders is one of many bilateral talks
held on the sidelines of the UN Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Goh also met with Botswana President Festus Mogae and the
International Labor Organization's chief Juan Somavia.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Former PM Trudeau Reported "Seriously Ill" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Canadian Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau is "seriously ill" at his home in Montreal with his
former wife Margaret and two sons gathering at his bedside, media
here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau's sons Justin and Sacha said in a brief statement
Thursday that their 80-year-old father "is not well" and is "
resting comfortably with his family and receiving medical
attention."
</P>
<P>
They requested the family's privacy be respected.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau's former wife Margaret was seen arriving by car late in
the afternoon after the news of Trudeau's illness first broke at
about 13:15 local time (1815 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, who turns 81 next month, is reported to be suffering
from Parkinson's disease. He "never recovered from the pneumonia
he had last winter," according to one of his friends, Senator
Serge Joyal.
</P>
<P>
"He is 80 years old and he doesn't have the same capacity as
someone 20 or 30 years old. But it has no impact on his mind. He
is as sharp as usual," said the senator.
</P>
<P>
Trudeau was prime minister between 1968 and 1979 and from 1980
to 1984. During his term of office, Canada came through the first
challenge to its national unity in the referendum on the future of
the French- speaking province of Quebec in 1980. The country
normalized relations with China on October 13, 1970.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Troops to Clear Mines for Inter-Korean Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,800 South Korean troops will
begin mine clearing and road work late this month for the planned
inter-Korean railway and highway projects, said the Defense
Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under a comprehensive plan for the projects, the ministry said
it will also mobilize 324 pieces of heavy equipment, including 22
water sprinklers and 48 excavators.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the railroad and highway projects will
require 32.5 billion won (some 29 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry said all areas south of the Demilitarized Zone (
DMZ) and within the zone itself subject to mine removal are 560,
000 square meters, which consist of 240,000 square meters for the
severed rail link and 320,000 square meters for the new highway.
</P>
<P>
At the historic inter-Korean summit in Pyongyang on June 13-15,
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and leader of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Il agreed to relink the
railroad between Seoul and Shinuiju, a DPRK city bordering China,
which was severed before the Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to complete the restoration of a 20-kilometer
rail section across the DMZ within one year. South Korea plans to
restore a 12-kilometer rail section between Munsan and Changdan.
</P>
<P>
The mine-clearing work is expected to take three months for the
4.1-kilometer railroad project and five months for the highway
project.

XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Motorola's top official in
charge of its China business today said that the company aims to
be the best foreign investor in China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, P. Y. Lai, president of Motorola (
China) Electronics Ltd., said that the success made by Motorola in
China is a result from the Chinese government's well-advised
policy and the company's own strategic development plan.
</P>
<P>
Lai promised to further localize his company and greatly expand
its business in China.
</P>
<P>
The company, which had invested a total of 12.5 billion yuan (1.
5 billion U.S. dollars) in China up to July this year, will add
another 16 billion yuan (1.93 billion dollars) to build a world-
class semiconductor production base in Tianjin, north China.
</P>
<P>
An international telecommunications giant, Motorola invested 1.
3 billion yuan into a research academy in China with a total of 18
institutes and more than 800 research fellows.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ruling Religious Faction Warns Against Secular Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Meimad Movement
within the ruling One Israel bloc has warned it will pull out of
the government if bus and state-run airline El Al service is
introduced on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yehuda Gilad, chairman of the movement secretariat, told
Israel Radio on Friday that such action will border on violations
of the coalition agreement between One Israel and Meimad regarding
the relationship between religion and the state.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is in New York attending the U.N.
Millennium Summit, has said that buses and El Al will run on
Shabbat. Earlier, Transportation Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said
that El Al should be allowed to fly on Shabbat to facilitate its
privatization.
</P>
<P>
According to Judaic laws, Jews should not do such secular things
as flying, driving or selling things on Shabbat, the Jewish holy
day which lasts from Friday's sunset to Saturday's sunset.
</P>
<P>
The strict rule on secular activities has aroused
dissatisfaction among secular Jews who are less observant of the
Judaic laws. This constitutes part of the conflict between them and
the observant Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
Meimad leader and Minister of Israeli Society and World Jewish
Communities Rabbi Michael Melchior, who has accompanied Barak to
New York, told Israel Radio Friday that Meimad is prepared to give
up on religious legislation aimed at forcing an observant way of
life on the Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
But the movement, the only religious faction left in the
coalition following the resignation of the National Religious Party
(NRP) and the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party in July, is not willing to
cede the Jewish character of the state and the Jewish identity of
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Moni Mordechai, spokesman of Israeli Society and World Jewish
Communities, told Xinhua that "Shabbat is the mutual basis for the
Jewish people. It is not a practical but rather a cultural thing."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Meimad is not against providing bus
services to the secular people but that should be done within a
covenant.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement between One Israel and Meimad acknowledges
that Israel is a democratic and Jewish state whose Jewish
characters will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Barak would certainly meet strong
opposition if he tries by coercion to implement the transportation
service on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that with the early elections looming,
Barak's bid to open bus and airline service on Shabbat is aimed at
attracting secular voters who have deserted him over the fact that
the prime minister who had given in to a series of demands put
forward by the religious Shas party and that he had neglected
social and economic issues due to his concentrated efforts on the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak's remarks are also seen as a prelude for his new coalition
efforts upon returning from the U.N. Millenium Summit to rebuild
his shaky government left in tatters following the resignation of
former coalition partners in protest of his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, stalled since the July Camp
David summit, failed to achieve a breakthrough at the ongoing U.N.
Millennium Summit which was widely seen as a good opportunity for
the two sides to hold further talks and bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton launched what he called the last
peace effort at the summit, conducting shuttle talks between the
Israelis and Palestinians. He decided to give up his efforts after
the U.S. proposals on the issue of Jerusalem was again rejected by
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Law Ministry is
forming a committee to coordinate efforts to enhance the country's
e-commerce legal infrastructure and legal competency.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs Ho Peng
Kee announced the plan at a Singapore IT Dispute Resolution
Advisory Committee seminar Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new committee will draw its members from the Infocomm
Development Authority (IDA), the Singapore Academy of Law, the
Singapore Law Society and the National University of Singapore law
faculty.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Subordinate Courts will soon take measures to
facilitate the mediation of e-disputes within cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
"For e-commerce to thrive and develop in an orderly fashion, it
will be necessary for both to establish a comprehensive legal and
regulatory framework, and develop the requisite legal expertise to
support the demands that the e-commerce industry will generate,"
Ho said.
</P>
<P>
The IT industry and IT users must realize the need for them to
increase their awareness of the legal implications of e-commerce,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The legal profession must likewise develop greater legal
expertise in e-commerce related matters, and in this way, meet the
challenge of supporting Singapore's bid to be an international
center for e-commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
To deal with e-disputes expected to accompany the advent of e-
commerce, IDA is working with various government agencies to put
in place a complete legal framework for the e-commerce environment.

<HEADLINE> Sulu Hostages' Release Fails to Push Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled release of the
six remaining foreign hostages held by Abu Sayyaf in Sulu
province in the southern Philippines on Friday failed to push
through after negotiators cited various reasons for the delay.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in the southern Zamboanga city,
Philippine chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado cited the
death of Abu Sayyaf leader Mujib Susukan's brother and unusual
movements by the extremists as the cause for the delay.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Friday evening in the televised press
conference that the burial of Susukan's brother was a factor in
the delay because some Abu Sayyaf leaders had to attend the burial
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The other cause of the delay is the reported trouble created
by the Abu Sayyaf members in Maimbong town where Commander Robot (
Abu Sayyaf leader Galib Andang) had to rush to pacify the
community," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf members in motorcycles went around Maimbong town in
Sulu province and harassed residents there, explained Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
The chief negotiator didn't specify any new date for the
release of the six remaining foreign hostages, including three
French, two Finns and one German. Some reports said they might be
released on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources privy to the negotiations claimed the
shortage of ransom money was one of the main reasons for the delay
of the release.
</P>
<P>
They said Libyan officials who arrived in Philippines Tuesday
brought only 4 million U.S. dollars as the Abu Sayyaf has
allegedly demanded a one-million-dollar ransom for each of the six
foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
The botched release was supposed to be follow-up to the freedom
of six other foreign hostages who were released last month.
</P>
<P>
A South African couple, three French and a German national left
the Philippines on August 28 and returned to their respective
countries after their four-month ordeal in the hands of the Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The hostage saga began in April when the Abu Sayyaf abducted 21
mostly foreign hostages from the diving resort of Sipadan island
in Malaysia. Sixteen of the original 21 hostages have been
released so far after 11 million dollars ransom was reportedly
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the remaining five Sipadan hostages, the Abu Sayyaf
is also holding two French journalists and 12 Filipino evangelists.

<HEADLINE> ADB Donors Pledge New Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five donor members of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have agreed on a 5.6-billion-U.S.-
dollar total replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
the bank said Friday in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said the pledge was announced after the fifth and final
donors' meeting in Okinawa, Japan, this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ADF VIII, as the current replenishment is called, will cover
the four-year period 2001 to 2004. The replenishment compares
favorably with a total of 5.1 billion dollars in loan approvals
expected under ADF VII, covering the period 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
ADF loans are provided on concessional terms to ADB's poorer
developing members with limited debt repayment capacity.
</P>
<P>
They support poverty reduction through pro-poor sustainable
economic growth, the provision of social development such as
education and health care, and the strengthening of good
governance.
</P>
<P>
Under the new replenishment, donors agreed to contribute a
total of 2.91 billion dollars. The balance of the replenishment is
expected to be met from repayments of earlier loans.
</P>
<P>
Japan remains the largest ADF contributor with 1.061 billion
dollars. The United States will contribute 412 million dollars,
while the European donors will make a total contribution of 860
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1973, the ADF has played a significant role in
promoting sustainable economic development in low-income members,
particularly benefiting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1999, ADF loans amounted to 22.7 billion dollars,
or 28 percent of cumulative ADB lending. In 1999 alone, 33 ADF
loans were approved amounting to 1.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian E-Village Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said the opening of Malaysia's Entertainment
Village marked the beginning of an exciting new entertainment era
and industry of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said what started as an idea has now
materialized into something tangible.
</P>
<P>
"E-Village is today a reality and we will pursue this till we
can stand alongside others in the entertainment industry
professionally and globally," he said when launching the E-Village
in Dengkil near here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also of great significance that Malaysians were
on the threshold of acquiring new knowledge and the necessary
technical know-how of managing the wonderful new electronic world
of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
"The development of E-Village and particularly the virtual and
Sound Studios clearly demonstrate our ability to keep up with, if
not be ahead of, a burgeoning information technology industry and
growing market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the E-Village project would witness a growth of
opportunities, both social and economic, the transforming of
society and the building of new creative skills and professions.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said the vision to establish an
entertainment center went far beyond mere entertaining as it would
help in developing the skills and capacities to handle the modern
and fast changing technologies involved in entertainment in the
information age.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the development of E-Village would
set the right targets and goals of Malaysia to be not only an
industrialized nation but enlarge the boundaries to test and
challenge Malaysians to achieve more.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister said a whole new infrastructure would emerge
and the foundation of hi-tech entertainment would be laid, which
could then be further developed and generate revenue.
</P>
<P>
With the new resurgence of film making in the world, Mahathir
hoped E-Village would be the springboard for attracting
international film producers and providers of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the local film industry would benefit from E-
Village as it would improve the standards and technics and become
comparable to those produced at other entertainment centers.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to the day when our home grown films and other
international productions carry the credit mention of having being
produced in E-Village Studios Malaysia," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ring Leader Tailed Before 58 Illegal Immigrants' Deaths: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The suspected ring leader of
illegal immigration connected to the deaths of 58 immigrants in
Dover had been under police surveillance before the incident, the
Dutch press reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the police had no clear evidence that the unidentified man
was involved in human trafficking, the press quoted Dutch Justice
Minister Benk Korthals as saying.
</P>
<P>
Korthals told a special parliamentary hearing on Thursday that
the Dutch police had been watching the suspect once or twice a
week for some time.
</P>
<P>
However, the suspect was not followed on the day in June when
the Chinese illegal immigrants were packed into a refrigerated
container truck for the trip to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The name of the suspect was withheld in line with the Dutch
privacy practice.
</P>
<P>
Korthals said that under surveillance operations, groups of
illegal immigrants are allowed to leave the Netherlands to help
gather evidence against the human trafficking gangs.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Dover incident was not among those allowed to
proceed and he denied that he was aware of any human trafficking
activities by the ring leader in question before the tragedy
occurred.
</P>
<P>
Six suspects are now in custody in the Dover case and five
others had been detained and then conditionally released after
questioning.
</P>
<P>
A court hearing on the case in the Netherlands is expected in
September and full parliamentary debate is slated for October.
</P>
<P>
In June, British customs officers in Dover found the bodies of
58 Chinese who had suffocated in the back of an air-tight truck
during a five-hour ferry crossing from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to
Britain's Dover. Only two of them survived the horrifying trip.

<HEADLINE> Drought Costs Tajikistan 57 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought this year will
cost Tajikistan an estimated 57 million U.S. dollars and many
residents of the Central Asian republic need assistance in food
and seeds, an international humanitarian agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Roger Bracke, who led an assessment and coordination team of
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, said they visited 14 Tajik areas hardest hit by the
drought and found the situation far worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in the capital city of Dushanbe, Bracke
said his team will appeal for help for 250,000 recipients in seven
districts of Khatlon and Leninabad regions as they are in severe
shortage of foodstuffs and seeds, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik Red Crescent Society wants flour and vegetable oil
sent to residents of Northern Ganchi and Zafarabad districts and
to the southern towns of Kulyab, Farkhor, Dangara, Vose and
Shaartuz before the onset of winter, which will close access to
many of the remote areas, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is Tajikistan's largest economic sector involving a
population of about 6 million. Some 68 percent of the total
population live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan is mostly mountainous, with only 6 percent of its
land cultivated. Lowland is in the extreme north and in the lower
reaches of the tributaries of the Amu Darya River in the southeast.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Open-End Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is considering to
introduce open-end funds on the market by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
At a high-ranking symposium on open-end funds here today, Li
Yining, head of a lawmaking panel for investment funds under the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest legislature,
said that the mainstream of China's investment funds in the future
will be shifted from closed to open-end funds.
</P>
<P>
Open-end funds, which dominates the world's fund market, have
not yet entered the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Investment funds have become a major part of China's security
market. China has issued over 50 billion yuan of closed-end funds
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Open-end investment funds will allow more people to get
involved in the market, as opposed to restrictive close-end funds,
said Wang Lianzhou, director of the NPC Financial and Economic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Experts at today's symposium pointed out that the knowledge of
investment funds should be popularized among Chinese, the quality
of the professional fund managers should be further improved, and
relevant laws and regulations should be made to manage the fund
market.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: World Timepiece Industry Facing Greater Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- With the continuing decline
of demand and market recession, the world timepiece industry is
facing greater challenges at the beginning of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
This warning came from a group of manufacturers for watch and
clock industry from China, Japan and Switzerland immediately after
they attended the Asian Watch Industry Conference in Hong Kong
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that there has yet to have any sign of the
good news of the new round of turn for the better on the timepiece
market, instead the market recession and supply in excess of
demand have not yet been improved substantially.
</P>
<P>
"In China, the measures taken by the government to stimulate
consumption are just inadequate for the timepiece market, and
therefore it will be risky to merely hope that the market can take
a favorable turn," Li Shiyu, chairman of Rossini Watch Industry
Ltd. and vice-chairman of China Horologe Association, said.
</P>
<P>
However, China's timepiece has quietly and thoroughly remolded
itself, and there do exist a few outstanding enterprises that
dedicate themselves to the creation of famous brands and hope to
be recognized and supported by all, Li added.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, the output of the domestic watch industry has
declined for two consecutive years in terms of both quantity and
value, according to Yukio Shima, director of the JKS News &AMP;
Magazine, who established the status of Japan's largest industry
paper specialized in watch and clock and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
According to the report "Trends of Domestic Watch Industry in '
99" issued by the Japan Watch Association, the total output of the
member manufacturers in 1999 was 88 million pieces of finished
products in terms of quantity, 25 percent down from the previous
year, and 144.3 billion yen in value, a reduction of 29 percent
compared with that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The watch manufacturers lead the watch industry in Japan, and
the retailers lack an independent strategy, Shima said. The
manufacturers including Seiko and Citizen are trying to enter into
the fields other than watches and consequently watch sales account
for less and less in total sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Japanese watch industry has reached an important
and critical turning point where they must go through a structural
reform right at the start of the 21st century," Shima said.
</P>
<P>
The recent consumer trend has shifted from practicality to
design that brought about in the market many varieties of watches
including the revival of old models and the animation character
watches, Shima explained. Another trend is centered around the
young people from teens to 20s who prefer mobile phones with built-
in watch functions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Things seemed much better for the Switzerland's manufacturers.
Swiss brands have always had a sway over the Chinese market of
high grade products and this situation will keep on for a
considerable period of time. And in Japan, despite a decrease in
sales of domestic products, imports from Switzerland were
increased.
</P>
<P>
"We are the largest single purchaser of Rolex watches in the
world having on hand the largest number of references of them and
we also represent successfully Audemars Piguet, Piaget and other
brands," said Jean-Marc C. Anderegg, executive export manager of
BUCHERER Limited.
</P>
<P>
"The success is due to a harmoniously and professionally built
segmentation of our own brands filling the gap unoccupied by the
other brands in the market," Anderegg said. For BUCHERER Swiss
Made Watches export, the Far East counts for about half of their
yearly sales turnover, Anderegg said.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Invite Likud into His Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will invite the major opposition Likud party to join his
government once he returns from New York, Israeli Communications
Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is a move that may cast clouds over the Israeli-Palestinian
peace track as the right-wing Likud is opposed to further
compromise to the Palestinians, local analysts believed.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio reports, Ben Eliezer, who is now
acting prime minister as Barak is abroad, confirmed that the Likud
will be the first party invited by Barak to begin coalition talks
on building up a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who is now in New York to attend the United Nations
Millennium Summit, lost his parliamentary majority ahead of the
Camp David summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in July and
is eager to restore his control in the parliament, which is
scheduled to re-convene at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that to work with Likud indicates that Barak, who
had set the peace as his top priority after he assumed office in
July last year, may finally feed up with the zigzagging of the
peace process and want to change his agenda.
</P>
<P>
Such an alliance with Likud will surely put the domestic
economic and social issues ahead of the peace talks, the analysts
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks had been in deadlock since the
Camp David talks, under the guidance of U.S. President Bill
Clinton, failed to reach any agreement due to significant gaps
between the two sides over the fate of Jerusalem and the return of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's latest efforts -- separate meeting with Barak and
Arafat on the sidelines of the Millennium Summit -- also failed to
bridge gaps between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak said at a new conference Thursday night that he
believed the door for peace talks is still open, Israeli delegates
accompanying him to New York admitted privately that the dominant
mood in Barak's camp is pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Barak's confidant and senior adviser, Friday told
Israel Radio that he is not sure if Israel and the Palestinians
could reach an agreement in the near future, although efforts to
revive the negotiations should still be made.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon, who
repeatedly denied in the past that his party would join Barak's
government, will change his mind. Sharon said Thursday that he will
commit himself to toppling the government, which he claimed had
conceded too much to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, Ben Eliezer said Friday that he is confident that the
Likud will accepted Barak's invitation and join the cabinet once
the party understands the prime minister's stands on all core
issues regarding Israel's security and civil reform.

The truck driver, who was also wounded, was taken into custody
for causing the fatal accident.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Services Industry Expands in 2nd Quarter 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's services
industry expanded by 3.8 percent in the second quarter 2000 over
the same period last year, said the Singapore Department of
Statistics (SDS) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was indicated by the Quarterly Business Receipts
Index (QBRI) for Services Industries, an indicator for monitoring
the current performance of Singapore's services sector.
</P>
<P>
SDS attributed the expansion to double-digit growth in the
business receipts of insurance services, post and
telecommunications, business, professional and air transport
services.
</P>
<P>
The insurance industry expanded by 47 percent in the second
quarter this year, boosted by a strong demand for single premium
life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, financial services which was affected by the
sluggish stock market dropped by 11 percent in business receipts.
</P>
<P>
With the strong growth in air traffic, air transport services
increased by 14 percent in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Land transport services also improved by 8.5 percent, while
water transport services dropped by 5.3 percent compared with the
second quarter 1999.
</P>
<P>
Post and telecommunications performed well for the second
consecutive quarter, rising 17 percent in business earnings.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, IT services grew 5.6 percent in business receipts in
the second quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Professional services rose by 15 percent in the second quarter
this year, largely due to higher turnover of legal activities,
business management and consultancy services, consultant
engineering services, and accounting and auditing services.
</P>
<P>
Business increased by 6 percent on the back of better
performance in advertising, labor recruitment services, exhibition
fair and convention services.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Eases Censorship in Run-up to General Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has eased some censorship regulations in the run-up to
the October 10 general elections, a government spokesman said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Information Ariya Rubasinghe said the president had
eased the censorship effective from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there are still restrictions against reporting
on internal squabbles within the military and military operations
against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting a 17-year war against majority
Sinhalese dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate
state for minority Tamils in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The blanket censorship was imposed on May 3 this year when
government troops were struggling to resist a major offensive
launched by LTTE rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The move of easing censorship came five days after the New York-
based Committee to Protect Journalists urged President Kumaratunga
to lift the censorship ahead of the elections. The local Free
Media Movement had also urged the government to lift the
censorship.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga also lifted a ban on public meetings in
view of the elections. The campaign began earlier this week after
nominations closed for the 11th parliamentary general elections.

<HEADLINE> New Tanzanian Port Opened to Boost Trade in Great Lake Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A new dry port has been
opened in northwestern Tanzania to facilitate trade for countries
in the Great Lake region, the independent Guardian newspaper
reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Isaka Dry Port on Thursday is aimed at
significantly reducing cargo-handling time from the current over
14 days to about five days, Fuad Abdallah, the Tanzania Railways
Corporation (TRC) Principal Commercial Manager, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
TRC had bought two 45-ton front loaders and built two
warehouses to convert the Isaka container terminal into the
current dry port, which has a container stacking area able to keep
360 twenty-foot containers at a go.
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of handling 42,000 tons of break-bulk cargo and
13,000 twenty-foot containers annually, the Isaka port will be
able to effectively handle goods bound to and from the three
landlocked countries of Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Abdallah said.
</P>
<P>
The conversion project is intended to make the port a viable

NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has picked up by 75
percent in Kenya's tourist resort Mombasa since the high season
started in July this year, Mombasa Mayor Masoud Mwahima has said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Increase Oil Quota for Local Explorers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
concluded plans to increase oil quota for indigenous petroleum
explorers and producers as the price of oil in the international
market continues to rise, the Post Express newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new concessions were part of a comprehensive package to
wake up local industrialists to engage more in the upstream sector
of the oil industry, Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the members of the Nigerian Association of
Indigenous Petroleum Explorers and Producers (NAIPEC) in the
capital Abuja on Thursday, Abubakar said the government plans to
increase their quota from 15,000 barrels per day to 25,000 barrels
per day.
</P>
<P>
The government would also review the 1991 policy which allows
local explorers to participate in the oil industry, and remove the
obstacles that stand against local investment and turnover in the
oil industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the indigenous oil production policy has to be
reconsidered especially in the area of the structure of allocating
marginal fields in blocks earlier handed over by major oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president noted that the proposed new
legislation, which is expected to come on stream by 2003, would
define operatorship and contain provisions for adjustable tax rate,
royalty rate and investment tax allowance.
</P>
<P>
On his side, NAIPEC National President Alhaji Salah Mohammed
Jambo said the removal of the restriction on oil production quota
would free resources for more aggressive exploration and
production program.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to stop the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation from intervening in the formulation of policy for
local oil producers.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the biggest oil-producing country in Africa with a
daily output of more than 2 million barrels, but most of them are
produced by foreign oil companies operating in the country.

<HEADLINE> No Reply Yet From France to EU on Road Blockades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- France missed a 24-hour
deadline to reply to a European Union (EU) call to end road
blockades that are blamed for breaching the EU's law of free
movement of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Todd, spokesman for the European Commission that
serves as the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, said that the
commission has so far received no reply from France to its call to
end the blockades.
</P>
<P>
He said the next step the commission has to take is to send a
formal request to the French authorities who have five working
days to reply how they are coping with the road blockades.
</P>
<P>
The blockades have severely disrupted France's public road
traffic as truck drivers blocked fuel depots and farming truckers
and taxis jammed streets to protest the ever-rising prices of fuel.
</P>
<P>
Todd warned that the commission would have to take France to
court should it fail again to reply within the new deadline.
</P>
<P>
But the proceedings at the European Court of Justice usually
take 18 to 24 months before giving a verdict on the case, long
after the road blockades have ended.
</P>
<P>
The French government has already cut down taxes levied on fuel.
Tight production policy adopted by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has contributed to the recent oil price
hike on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices now seemed determined to fluctuate within a
band of 30 U.S. dollars a barrel and it entered that band in
February this year following an uninterrupted rise since December
1998 when the crude oil price bottomed out at 10 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Fadhil Chalabi, executive director of the Center for Global
Energy Studies, warned earlier this week that "if OPEC does not
increase its production, prices will go very high until the peak
of the winter. Prices may even exceed 40 dollars a barrel."
</P>
<P>
OPEC, scheduled to meet over this weekend in Vienna, is
expected to approve an additional production of 500,000 barrels a
day. However, analysts say that amount may not suffice to meet the
demands worldwide.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Friday published its first public health data, a reference for
those EU citizens who are curious and cautious about health.
</P>

Entitled "Key Data on Health," the statistical guide tells
people how many EU citizens are satisfied with their health; what
the differences are between EU member states concerning the
diseases of cancer, tuberculosis and hepatitis; which member state
has the highest ratio of doctors to the total population, and how
many organ transplants are carried out in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The data of the reference guide comes from Eurostat, the World
Health Organization, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the
International Agency for Cancer and the AIDS Surveillance Center.
</P>
<P>
Covering all the 15 EU member states as well as Iceland, Norway
and Switzerland, the first-ever statistical guide reports that
satisfaction with personal health posts the highest in Finland (78
percent), Austria (71 percent), the Netherlands (70 percent),
France (60 percent) and Belgium (56 percent), while
dissatisfaction is the lowest in Portugal (73 percent), Greece (65
percent) and Italy (50 percent).
</P>
<P>
The guide shows epidemic diseases and cancers are reported as
the number one and two killer diseases in the EU, accounting for
40 percent and 30 percent of deaths respectively. They are
followed by respiratory diseases, accidents and suicides.
</P>
<P>
Greece boasts of the highest ratio of doctors to the total
population with 933 doctors per million inhabitants, while the
Netherlands has the lowest ratio of 356 doctors per million
inhabitants.

<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's hopes for a Middle East peace deal

Thursday as Israeli and Palestinian officials made clear that
their meetings with him this week had produced little, if any,
progress on resolving their competing claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

the issues voters say are most important to them.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and other leaders on Thursday took part in
a Security Council meeting intended to concentrate on peacekeeping
problem, but it quickly turned to a discussion about the causes of
war in an age when ethnic cleansing and rape have become the
tactical hallmarks of pickup armies that terrorize populations
weakened by poverty or disease.
</P>

final vote on President Clinton's major trade bill with China, as
momentum built for final passage next week after months of delay.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House on Thursday failed to override President
Clinton's veto of a bill to phase out the federal estate tax, as
prospects for significant tax cuts this year continued to dim.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: China to Open Wider to Outside World in New Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's opening-up will be
expanded from a restricted scope and areas to an all-round
openness, said Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu's remark is a firm and clear signal sent by the Chinese
government to the world that it will push its opening-up, a basic
state policy implemented for 22 years, to a higher level in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fourth China Fair for
International Investment and Trade, Wu said the opening-up
permitted by policy featuring an experimental nature in the past
will be changed into a predictable opening-up under legal
framework, namely to open up in accordance with a committed
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral opening-up mainly on the Chinese side will be
turned into a mutual opening between China and WTO members, she
further explained.
</P>
<P>
To echo Wu's address, Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, said in his speech that the Chinese
government will adopt more forceful measures to further open the
market for trade in goods and trade in services.
</P>
<P>
China will also push forward further the absorption of foreign
funds in commerce, foreign trade, finance, insurance, securities,
telecommunications, tourism and other fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the basic rules of WTO and its commitments
in bilateral agreements, China will gradually and in a planned
manner revise laws and regulations on foreign investment and
further improve the investment environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin recently said "China should more
actively participate in international competition and
collaboration, so as to push forward an all-round, multi-level and
broader opening-up."
</P>
<P>
The opening-up policy is a strategic decision initiated in 1978
by the second generation of Chinese central leadership with Deng
Xiaoping at the core. Deng once pointed out, China's reform and
opening-up would remain unchanged for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The opening-up brings to China a large amount of funds which
the country needs urgently, and technology, talented people with
management experience. China has been the biggest foreign direct
investment recipient in developing countries for seven years in
row since 1993. China's foreign trade ranks ninth in the world and
its economic scale is seventh.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said there use to be disputes about opening-up,
especially on how to make good use of foreign funds in China.
However, such disputes have disappeared in recent years as
economic globalization speeds up, and the science and technology
advance rapidly.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Council's office for reforming
economic system said China's opening-up policies adopted over the
past two decades have been fully implemented, and its opening-up
now faces the change from quantity to quality.
</P>
<P>
Economist Hu Angang said China can realize its strategic
economic goals only by opening wider to the outside world.

Analysts say the 20-year opening-up has made
internationalization a marked structural change in China's economy,
and to the degree that China and other parts of the world rely on
each other has further increased.
</P>
<P>
They said if China wants to realize its goal of doubling its
current GDP by 2010, it needs to introduce more foreign funds,
advance technology and management experiences. China also needs to
further develop its economy, trade, and open its market wider.
</P>
<P>
China urgently needs the world's high technologies and
management experience in the development of its western region,
pushing forward the adjustment of economic structure and reforming
the state enterprises. China also needs to open the market for
commerce, finance, insurance, tourism and other fields as the
living standards of the Chinese people has improved markedly, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts held that the important decision to speed up
negotiation process of China's accession into the WTO, which was
made by the central leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core, is a
significant symbol and the embodiment of the determination of the
Chinese government to raise the opening-up to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
China, in the past year, adopted a series of policies
encouraging foreign business people to invest in high-tech fields,
especially in central and western China. It also opened more areas
in the service and other sectors in accordance with its
commitments in bilateral agreements on accession into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Observers said currently, China enjoys a favorable situation
for its opening-up as the Chinese economy has made a turn for the
better, and the effect of the Asian financial crisis has faded
away.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the next five to 10 years is an important
period for China's economic and social development. Reform of the
economic system, adjustment of the economic structure and economic
growth mode all facilitate the possibility that China's opening-up
will move to a higher level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Twenty more foreign companies
recently joined the anti-counterfeiting alliance in China as the
Chinese government imposed sterner punishment on brand name
infringement.
</P>
<P>
The Quality Brand Protection Committee (QBPC) under the China
Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment said in a news
release today that the leading non-profit anti-counterfeiting
coalition has welcomed such new comers as Kodak, Bosch, Siemens,
Van Melle and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
"The organic growth of QBPC demonstrates the increasing concern
of multinationals and their commitment to fight against
counterfeiting," said Joseph Johnson, chairman of QBPC and
president of Bestfoods China Operations.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work cooperatively with (Chinese) government
officials to put a stop to this illegal activity which hurts
Chinese consumers, the Chinese economy and our businesses and our
employees," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has stepped up punishment of counterfeiting by amending
the Product Quality Law in July. Taking effect on September 1, the
amended law stipulates practical measures against local
authorities who provide shelters for counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
Dow Corning, a U.S. silicon giant running a joint-venture plant
in Shanghai, joined hands with local police in Guangdong Province
in south China to raid a number of counterfeiting factories and
trade companies in the province earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the counterfeiting companies have been charged.
With their counterfeit products, manufacturing equipment and raw
materials confiscated and destroyed, the counterfeiters signed
guarantees of not doing the illegal activity again and paid more
than two million yuan to the victim Down Corning in compensation.

<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
urged research bodies to restructure themselves to release the
power of advanced science and technology.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour to southwest China's Sichuan Province
earlier this week, the vice-premier also called on research
institutes of applied sciences to turn into modern companies for
further development.
</P>
<P>
The research bodies must enhance their economic and
technological strengths by participating in fierce competition in
the market, said Li, who is also a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Between September 3 and 7, the vice-premier visited research
institutes, universities and enterprises in Mianyang and Chengdu
cities.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Mianyang for its efforts to primarily shape several
electronic, nuclear and aerospace bases, which have made a great
contribution to the local economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Li ordered local officials to give full support to
research bodies and high-tech enterprises, providing them with
strategic development guidance and services.
</P>
<P>
The local government must create an environment suitable for
carrying out scientific research and conducive to attracting high-
level professionals, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li urged colleges and universities to train more
talented people for further scientific advancement and economic
growth in the economically-backward province.
</P>
<P>
On the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Sichuan must also
pay attention to protect the environment for sustained development
during China's drive to develop its western regions, he said.

China's Qinghai Province, aiming to monitor disastrous weather.
</P>
<P>
Experts say atmospheric detection is the foundation of
meteorological study. And the atmospheric environment on the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has great influence on the climate of China
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In the light of frequent disastrous weather on Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, the completion of the project will increase the accuracy
and capability of weather monitoring, said Wang Jiangshan,
director of the Qinghai Provincial Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring system, based on over 30 climatic and
meteorological stations in the province and advanced equipment
imported from Finland, will be used to detect barometric pressure,
temperature, humidity, wind direction and power, precipitation,
radiation and other meteorological factors.
</P>
<P>
Li Huang, vice director of China Meteorological Bureau said the
project is the start of China's automation in ground detection. In
addition, over 800 automatic meteorological stations will be set
up across China in the future years.
</P>
<P>
Li added that China will expand cooperation with other
countries in the field of meteorological research and services.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Forms Team to Investigate Atambua Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A team consisting of
representatives of the Indonesian military, police and the
Attorney General's Office has been formed to investigate the
recent killing of three United Nations aid workers in the town of
Atambua in East Nusa Tenggara province, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Indonesian Defense Force (TNI), Adm Widodo AS,
said here Friday that the team has begun to question some people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, said they
have investigated at least 15 East Timorese refugees over their
alleged involvement in the attack on the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The 15 suspects were arrested Thursday for their suspected in
Wednesday attack against civilian U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
Three UNHCR staff were killed on Wednesday when hundreds of pro-
Jakarta East Timor militiamen attacked the U.N. envoy's office in
Atambua bordering with East Timor which got independence one year
ago from the rule of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Rusdihardjo said the investigation touched only their alleged
involvement in the attack and murder.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far not found any political reason (behind the
attack)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Widodo and Rusdihardjo both expressed regret over the incident,
which they said has destroyed Indonesia's image in the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Widodo further said that the military has deployed one
battalion from Solo, Central Java, on Friday to reinforce the
battalion deployed to Atambua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid during his meeting with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York on Thursday promised that
Indonesia would immediately send two battalions to Atambua to
contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian government on Friday reminded the U.N.
Transitional Authority in East Timor and the East Timorese
Resistance Committee to work together with Indonesia to resolve
the problems in the refugee camps which are located along the

<HEADLINE> Nepal, ILO Sign Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government and
the International Labor Organization (ILO) have signed an
agreement on the elimination of worst forms of child labor in
Nepal, an ILO official told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed here Thursday, the Nepali
government will rectify by the end of this year the Convention 182
adopted by the International Labor Conference in Geneva in 1999,
concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the
elimination of the worst forms of child labor, said Yadav Amatya,
national program manager with ILO.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, the Nepali government is developing a 10-year
Master Plan of Action, which will aim at eliminating the worst
forms of child labor by 2005 and all forms of child labor by 2010,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Convention 182 stipulates that the worst forms of child
labor comprises sale and trafficking of children as compulsory
laborers, sex workers or sex slaves, employment of children in
hazardous work, use of children for illicit activities and
compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The master plan also include a pilot project which will provide
skill training programs to child labor-prone families in 7 of the
72 districts of Nepal and help create self-employment
opportunities for adults, said Amatya.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, especially high unemployment of adults, is the main
cause for the wide use of child laborers in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that of about seven million children of 5-14
years old in Nepal, about three million are found to be regularly
working and 1.7 million children are found to be economically
active. As Nepal is an agrarian country where about 85 percent of
the people live on agriculture, over 90 percent of the child
laborers are living in rural areas.

UN TCDC Network Demonstration Base, which is aimed to set up an
example for developing countries to join hands in economic
cooperation.

</P>
<P>
The newly established Xingang Company still considers the iron

</P>
<P>
The Capital Iron and Steel Company owns 53 percent the Xingang

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Find New Immune Molecule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently
claimed to discover a new type of immune molecule, which could be
used for fighting against cancer and deadly infections.
</P>
<P>
Cao Xuetao, a professor with the No. 2 Medical Sciences
University of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), led the research
group, which discovered the molecule, a chemotactic factor
consisting of 77 amino acids.
</P>
<P>
In the well-known Immunology Journal which is published in the
United States, the research group named the molecule MIP-gamma 2,
whose gene is embodied in kidney tissue and the small intestine.
The new find made by the Chinese scientists is said to be a
breakthrough in the research of immunology.
</P>
<P>
Using gene-engineering technology, Cao and his colleagues
separated the new-style molecule from the dendritic cell's gene
pool.
</P>
<P>
The discovery bears academic significance to the understanding
of vital phenomena in the human body, and pathogenesis of many
diseases, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the immune molecule also has important clinical
value, which can provide new remedies or high-tech biologic
medicine to immunity-related diseases.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Control of Precursor Chemicals in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Precursor chemicals refer to
chemical material and reagents that could be used to illicitly
manufacture or synthesize narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Although many precursor chemicals are not narcotics themselves,
they are usually necessary elements for the production or
synthesis of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
According to a United Nations pact in 1988, a total of 22 kinds
of precursor chemicals, including ephedrine, has been placed under
tight control. As a signatory state to the pact, China is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
China has one of the toughest controls on ephedrine, a
substance that could be used to manufacture "ice", one of the most-
abused central stimulant in the world.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, the State Council issued a circular, clarifying
the responsibilities shouldered by different government
departments in the manufacturing, trading, storage, transportation,
as well as the import and export of ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the ministry of public security promulgated a
regulation to tighten the issue of transportation permits for
ephedrine.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economic Growth Hits Six Percent in FY 1999/2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's real economic growth
rate in the fiscal year 1999/2000 ending on July 14, 2000, stood
at 6 percent, the highest in six years, while inflation
decelerated to 3.3 percent, according to Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal'
s central bank.
</P>
<P>
The impressive economic growth, compared to 4.0 percent in the
previous fiscal year, was achieved thanks to improvement in
agricultural sector followed by marked growth in manufacturing,
electricity and trade sectors, said a press communique by the
Nepal Rastra Bank, available Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to a fall in the prices of food and beverages, the annual
average national consumer price index recorded a rise of 3.3
percent compared to a rise of 11.3 percent in the previous year,
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Despite a higher growth rate of exports than imports, trade
deficit increased by 6.7 percent, amounting to 55.34 billion
rupees (790 million U.S. dollars), mainly because of relatively
larger volume of imports compared to exports, it said.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports registered respective growths of 44.7
percent and 22.2 percent, standing at 51.6 billion rupees (737
million dollars) and 107 billion rupees (1.53 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nepal's economy had been in continuous recession since 1992/
1993 fiscal year when it grew by 7.2 percent. In the last six
fiscal years, the economy grew by an average of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stocks Fall Slightly, Most Investors on Sidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua)-- Thai stocks drop slightly
Friday, as most investors stay on the sidelines due to lack of
fresh market-moving factors, dealers said.

concerns over the upcoming general elections, due in the fourth

<HEADLINE> Kenya Industry to be Spared by Power Cut in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's industry will be
exempted from the current power rationing by October 20, according
to Kenya Electricity Regulation Board.
</P>
<P>
Consumers at homes will also have something to cheer about as
the rationing eases to the initial minor rationing from last
September to May this year, the East African Standard reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the period, homes and factories had power cuts of 15
hours and 24 hours per week respectively. Since May the rationing
has worsened with a 72-hour blackout per week for residential
areas and 84 hours per week for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The rationing will be eased after three emergency diesel power
generating units reduce the current deficit from 197 megawatts to
50 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
One of the emergency generating units has already commissioned
for the power supply of 45 megawatts. The other two units are
expected to generate 30 megawatts each from October 1.
</P>
<P>
The current power shortage has led to an industrial daily loss
of over 2 million U.S. dollars in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Due to the prolonged drought, the main source of power supply
in Kenya, hydropower stations, have had a low water level and
reduced the generating capacity greatly.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Energy Resource Should Be Diversified: EU Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Commissioner
of Energy Loyola de Palacio said on Friday that Europe should
revise its policy of transport and diversify its energy resources.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio France Inter, De Palacio said
that the blockade of oil refineries and roads and "blackmail of
society" by French truckers and farmers are unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot take hostage the whole productive sectors of the
neighboring countries," she said. "I see in a very very negative
way the actions which are going on in France."
</P>
<P>
She admitted that Europe is disarmed in the face of the rise of
oil prices in world market and said she will propose in October "a
communication on the security of energy supply" to the 15 EU
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission will propose the revision of transport policy
of EU countries, including a shift from road transport to railway
transport, she said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said that Europe should not abandon its
nuclear energy, which she said can help the continent fend off
shocks from future oil crises.

<HEADLINE> Europe Has No Means to Pressure OPEC, Says French Oil Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The president of the French oil
group Total-Fina-Elf, Thierry Desmarest, said on Friday that
Europe does not have the necessary means to pressure the
Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase
production.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the LCI television channel, Desmarest said
that the means of intervention of European countries is "extremely
limited."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have no doubt a little more of political-
military influence than Europe, and they tried for several months
to do the same (make OPEC increase production) without success,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the present situation in the world oil market
does not make up an "oil shock."
</P>
<P>
"Taking into the account of inflation, the price of 32 U.S.
dollars per barrel today makes up only half of the prices we had
at the beginning of the 1980s," he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil price jumped above 35 dollars a barrel Thursday evening
in New York, the highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
OPEC will decide whether to increase its production or not when
its member countries meet in Vienna on September 10.
</P>
<P>
The United States and European Union have called on OPEC to
increase production by around one million barrels a day.

<P>
In the 1991-1999 period, China seized more than 1,500 tons of
precursor chemical flown into illicit channels, involving more
than 20 kinds of precursor chemical under state control.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, anti-narcotics officers found
more than ten tons of ephedrine flown into illicit channels.
</P>
<P>
Bai said that due to increased overseas demand for precursor
chemical, drug traders at home and abroad have collaborated to
conduct smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
During the period between 1997 and June of this year, Chinese
anti-drug officers cracked some 1,299 such cases, confiscating
more than 1,100 tons of precursor chemical.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, they also stopped more than 4,000 tons

BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China plans to carry out a
four-month operation against "ice"-related crime and to strengthen
the management of precursor chemical, the National Narcotics
Control Commission (NNCC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The operation will start in September, said Jia Chunwang, NNCC
director and minister of public security, this afternoon at a
nationwide tele-conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period of this year, more than 130 ice-
related cases were cracked, with more than 17 tons of ice
confiscated, said Bai Jingfu, NNCC vice-director and vice minister
of public security.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently, the bulk of the ice confiscated in
China had been manufactured by criminal rings that have mastered
the skill of chemical synthesis, instead of the traditional method
of processing ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
These criminals rings boast advanced processing factories and
produce ice for both domestic and overseas customers, the vice
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians are unlikely to declare a state on
Wednesday, as Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
has threatened since the breakdown of the Camp David summit, and
contact between the two sides will continue after that date,
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said at a press conference at the
United Nations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His comments come amid a general pessimism among those who
accompanied him to the U.N. Millennium Summit that any breakthrough
is imminent while Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton are
all in New York. No trilateral meetings are scheduled before Arafat
flies back to Gaza for Saturday's meeting of the Palestinian
National Council.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat told U.
S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday that he demands Palestinian
sovereignty over the Temple Mount. Arafat said he is unwilling to
discuss the American bridging proposals on Jerusalem that were put
forward during and after the Camp David summit, Israeli sources who
received a report on the meeting, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of these statements, Clinton decided not to continue
with his mediation efforts between Israel and the Palestinians
during the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
In the weeks ahead, the United States will try to lead an
international effort aimed at persuading Arafat to demonstrate
flexibility and agree to resume the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A mistake in the movement of a support unit of the Israeli
elite Duvdevan force which took part in the operation to capture a
member of the Palestinian Islamic militant Hamas group prompted a
series of failures that ended with the death of three soldiers by "
friendly fire," and the wounding of a fourth, according to a
detailed report of the failed action made public by Chief of Staff
Shaul Mofaz Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz also announced that he was accepting the resignations of
the head of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) division of the West
Bank, Brigadier General Shlomo Oren, and Lieutenant Colonel "Miki"
and relieved them of their command.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Saying that there will be no whitewash in the Israeli Defense
Forces (IDF), Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz Thursday night accepted
the resignations of two officers who were responsible for the
botched raid in which a senior member of the Palestinian Islamic
Hamas group escaped and three Israeli soldiers were killed by "
friendly fire."
</P>
<P>
He also ordered the implementation of an inquiry's
recommendation that the training of elite units be overhauled.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy Expected to Grow Faster in 2000: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Central Bank said the
island's economy is expected to continue to grow at a satisfactory
pace in 2000 and real GDP (gross domestic product) growth is
forecast to reach 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report published in Friday's local newspapers, the Central
Bank said output growth is expected to be underpinned by a revival
in domestic demand, while foreign demand is envisaged to sustain
its uptrend, enhanced by the performance of the tourist sector.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' gross domestic product expanded by 4.5 percent in real
terms in 1999, when inflation fell to 1.7 percent, the historically
low level.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 annual report said that in 2000, unemployment will
remain at around 3.5 percent, while stricter criteria have been
applied as regards the policy on the employment of foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
But inflation is on the rise, due to the VAT (value added tax)
increase and the soaring fuel price in international markets.
Inflation is provisionally set to rise by 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import growth is being enhanced by the enlarged fuel bill, as
well as the revival of imports for both home consumption and re-
exports.
</P>
<P>
Net invisible earnings are forecast to widen markedly,
reflecting the continued good performance of tourism and other
exported services, the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals are projected to grow by 10-11 percent while a
further increase in per capita expenditure is also anticipated.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account large net capital inflows, the overall
balance of payments position is forecast to show a deficit of 90
million Cyprus pounds (144 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the public sector deficit in 2000 is
expected to widen to 260.9 million pounds (417.4 million dollars)
or 4.8 percent of GDP, compared to a deficit of 220.8 million
pounds (353.3 million dollars), or 4.5 percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Formally Qits COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania ceased to be a member
state of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
effective from mid-night of September 1, 2000, according to a
press release from COMESA headquarters obtained here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Tanzania has lost all the rights and privileges
it enjoyed by virtue of being a COMESA member state. Goods
originating from Tanzania are no longer eligible for COMESA trade
preferences and are now liable to full national rates of customs
duty in all the COMESA member states, it said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, COMESA Certificates of Origin issued by Tanzania are
immediately null and void.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, goods originating from COMESA member states will not
be accorded COMESA trade preferences by Tanzania, when exported to
that country.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Tanzania is not eligible to use COMESA transit
facilities and instruments, namely the COMESA Customs Document,
the COMESA Customs Bond Guarantee Scheme, and the COMESA Carriers'
License.
</P>
<P>
This means that a Tanzanian licensed truck carrying goods to
any COMESA member state should not be allowed to load and carry
any goods from within COMESA to any destination, after offloading
its cargo.
</P>
<P>
Any Tanzanian licensed trucker violating this condition shall
be liable to penalties prescribed in the COMESA member state where
the offense is committed, which may include seizure and forfeiture
of the truck, it said.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is a regional integration grouping 20 Africa sovereign
states, which have agreed to promote regional integration through
trade development and to develop their natural and human resources
for the mutual benefit of all their people.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Officer Nabbed on Suspicion of Passing Secrets to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police on Friday
arrested a senior officer of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (
MSDF) for allegedly passing defense secrets to a Russian military
attache in Tokyo, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and Kanagawa
prefectural police arrested Shigehiro Hagisaki, a lieutenant
commander and researcher at the National Institute for Defense
Studies of Japan's Defense Agency, on suspicion of violating the
Self-Defense Forces (SDF) Law, which prohibits SDF members from
divulging classified security information, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Russian Embassy official in Tokyo was quoted by
Itar-Tass news agency as saying that the arrest is a provocation.
</P>
<P>
"We regard the incident as a provocation with the aim to
undermine all positive achievements in the bilateral relations for
the past few years," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The MPD and Kanagawa police raided four locations, including
the institute in Tokyo's Meguro Ward and Hagisaki's home in
Setagaya Ward, seizing several hundred items.
</P>
<P>
Police said Hagisaki gave the Russian military attache
information about the MSDF on about 10 occasions from September
1999 to last month.
</P>
<P>
Hagisaki, 38, basically admitted the allegations, Kyodo quoted
police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hagisaki was dined and wined in return for handing over
classified documents, and is suspected of receiving money as well,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the National Defense Academy in Yokosuka,
Kanagawa Prefecture, in 1986, Hagisaki served aboard destroyers
and support craft. Fluent in Russian, he had also worked in the
MSDF's documentation division, which deals with information on
foreign defense.
</P>
<P>
Hagisaki had been working at the institute as an expert on
Russia since the end of March this year after completing a master'
s course on security at the academy.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Explains Why Marco Polo Could Not Speak Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- It was not strange that Marco
Polo (1254-1324), an Italian traveler who had stayed in China for
17 years, could not speak Chinese, since he had been here during
the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) when Mongolian nobles governed.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhijiu, a history professor at Tianjin-based Nankai
University, known for his academic study on Marco Polo, noted that
though emperors of the Yuan Dynasty did appoint some officials of
Han ethnic group to strengthen Mongolian rule, these low ranking
officials were not able to improve the status of the Chinese
language.
</P>
<P>
Yang quoted a historical document as saying that "none of the
officials with the administration of Jianghuai Province (areas
between today's Huaihe River and Yangtze River heavily populated
with people of Han ethnic group) knew how to write".
</P>
<P>
"Even Mongolians at that time could not write in Chinese," he
said, "how could today's people expect Marco Polo, a foreigner
from afar, to understand Chinese and write in that language?"
</P>
<P>
Marco Polo came to China with his father and uncle in 1275. "
The Travels of Marco Polo", a widely known travel record allegedly
taken by the traveler, cause debate among today's scholars.
</P>
<P>
Polo noted in his book that he knew four languages, and their
alphabets and ways of writing. But he did not specify which the
four languages were.
</P>
<P>
Most of the names of Chinese places mentioned in the travel
notes were written in Mongolian, Persian, or Turkish. For example,
Marco Polo wrote Lugouqiao Bridge in southern Beijing as "
Pulisanghin", meaning "stone bridge" in Persian.
</P>
<P>
H. Yule, a famous British researcher of the travels, deduced
that Marco Polo probably used Persian, a common language among
foreigners of the Yuan Dynasty, when he communicated with these
foreign guests of Yuan emperors.
</P>
<P>
Yang assumed that the four languages that Marco Polo understood
were Mongolian, Persian, Arabic, and Turkish.
</P>
<P>
That Marco Polo did not understand Chinese was a pity,
resulting from the situation in China at the time. Yang stressed
that it did not prevent Marco Polo from being a friendly envoy
from Italy.

<HEADLINE> China's Preferential Policies for Foreign Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has and
will continue to adopt a series of policies and measures that
encourage foreign investment, according to Shi Guangsheng,
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who spoke at the Fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade, which opened today in the Xiamen Special
Economic Zone in east China's Fujian Province, said that the
Chinese government will be dedicated to the cultivation of a
stable and comfortable environment in order to attract more
foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government first of all, encourages the technical
development and innovation of foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs),
Shi said. Research and development equipment, supporting
technology, accessories and spare parts imported by foreign
investors for self-use may be exempted from tariff and import
linkage tax.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises whose investment in technical development witness
an increase of over 10 percent over that of the previous year,
upon approval, are allowed to offset the taxable income for the
year with 50 percent of the actual value of their technical
development investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-invested enterprises also enjoy preferential treatment
in transferring technology into China and buying equipment
developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Shi said, the Chinese government encourages foreign
businessmen to invest in the central and western regions of China.
Foreign investment in the projects listed in the "Priority
Industrial Catalogue of Foreign Investment in the Central and
Western Region" offer preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises investing in these areas will not be required to
pay tariff and import linkage tax on equipment, supporting
technology, accessories and spare parts imported for self-use.
</P>
<P>
Shi said, there will be more areas attracting foreign
investment in the central and western regions, while the
conditions setting up FIEs will be relaxed and the same is true
with the equity holding proportion of FIEs.

<TEXT>
<P>
The FIEs in the coastal areas are allowed to contract the
operation and management of FIEs and domestic-funded enterprises
in the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, according to China's commitments in the WTO
accession, the Chinese government will gradually open areas in
service trade to the outside world. Foreign direct investment (FDI)
absorption will further promote commerce, foreign trade, finance,
insurance, securities, telecommunication, tourism and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The geographic location of foreign-funded retail enterprises
has been expanded to provincial capital cities, municipalities
directly under the administration of the central government and
Special Economic Zones (SEZs) all over China. The FDI attraction
in foreign trade sectors will also be further enlarged on the
basis of accumulative experience.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also allow qualified FIEs to go
public in China's A stock and B stock market. Investment companies
in China established by multinationals will be allowed to expand
their scope of operations. Value appraisal of imported equipment
of wholly foreign owned enterprises will be straightened out and
adjusted. Policies that are not conducive to absorbing foreign
funds will be cleared and adjusted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will actively explore new ways to expand
foreign investment, perfect relevant laws and regulations and
intensify the formulation of policy measures for foreign
participation in the restructuring of Chinese enterprises to
support and promote foreign involvement through mergers,
acquisition or other methods.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to introduce technology, capital,
managerial experience and operational systems to improve the
ability and scale of FIEs, and the ability and scale of supporting
production and services in state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
China will push forward the reform and development of SOEs and
optimize the adjustment of technical and product structures.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Vessel Saved near Chinese Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Democratic People's Republic
of Korea boat with over 100 persons on board has been rescued near
northeast China's city of Dandong after drifting at sea for four
days, China's State Maritime Administration (SMA) said today.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK ship is now on its way to tow the powerless flat-
bottomed boat, now anchored safely in DPRK waters, the SMA said.
</P>
<P>
According to SMA officials, a Chinese ship called "Zhehai 314"
discovered the DPRK pontoon at 11:20 a.m. Thursday about 20
nautical miles south of Dandong on its way from Pusan of the
Republic of Korea, when its crew saw many people on the pontoon
waving their clothes.
</P>
<P>
"Zhehai 314" soon approached the DPRK vessel and reported the
situation to the China Maritime Rescue Center (CMRC), as a
language barrier prevented them from taking further action.
</P>
<P>
Another nearby Chinese vessel identified as "Honghu 8" was soon
dispatched to the area by the CMRC, whose crew was told that the
DPRK boat had been drifting at sea when the cable connecting it
with a tug boat broke and the ship stranded four days ago.
</P>
<P>
When efforts to contact the DPRK maritime authority failed, the
DPRK pontoon was tugged to waters near a DPRK island and anchored
there. The two Chinese ships left after making sure that the DPRK
boat and the people on board were safe.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side was eventually informed of the situation by
Dandong port authorities.

<HEADLINE> "Candle" Libraries Built in Rural Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will build 300 "candle"
libraries for rural primary schools in the provinces of Gansu and
Sichuan in west China by the country's 16th Teacher's Day, which
falls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Chinese Charity Federation (CCF) said that
these libraries will help enrich rural students' knowledge and
improve rural teachers' professional levels.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate this year's Teacher's Day, CCF and the McDonald
Food Ltd. Corporation jointly held an activity called the "Candle
Library Project."
</P>
<P>
The activity, which began in July, has collected books and
donations in a bid to establish libraries for primary schools in
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the education gap between rural and urban schools,
organizers call for more people to participate in the Candle
Library Project and other public welfare undertakings.
</P>
<P>
By September 6, about 400,000 books had been donated from
cities like, Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Qingdao, Jinan, Zibo,
Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Harbin, Jilin and Changchun. The books
will be placed in Candle libraries.
</P>
<P>
Initiated in 1998 by CCF, the Candle Project aims to lessen the
burden of teachers in poor rural schools and improve their
professional levels.

MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine
Stock Exchange ended marginally higher Friday despite the peso's
continued weakness.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, closed 65 of a
point higher to close at 1,523.69. But the broader all-shares
index dropped 6.14 points to 697.42.
</P>
<P>
Dealers exchanged 310 million shares worth some 20.8 million U.
S. dollars on Friday against Thursday's 323.5 million shares worth
some 33.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market failed to strongly move higher as
investors positioned selectively in blue chip issues on concerns
over the peso volatility.
</P>
<P>
"The character of buying is short-term, that is why the market
only moved sideways. The only thing that perked it up are blue
chip stocks," said Joey Roxas, president of Eagle Securities Inc.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 45.607 pesos against the U.S. dollar early
Friday, weaker compared to the previous close of 45.530 pesos.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister

IAP chairman.

Asked about criticisms on the rate of development of the MSC,
he said the MSC development was ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
He said all infrastructure had been put in place and Cyberjaya

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Find New Evidences for Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The earth's temperature
has risen steeply over the last 150 years, said a group of
scientists, who have been engaged in a study on the freeze and
thaw records for lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
A report on the study, published Thursday by the journal
Science, said that the annual freeze of 26 bodies of water in
North America, Asia and Europe shifted about 8.7 days later over
the last century and a half, while the ice breakup dates have
occurred about 9.8 days earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of this paper is the robust nature of direct
human observations," said John J. Magnuson, a researcher at the
University of Wisconsin and first author of the study.
</P>
<P>
The results, he said, "are not calculations," which are subject
to bias and instrument error, but "direct human observations of a
150-year trend of ice freeze and thaw" that are difficult to
refute.
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly getting warmer in the northern hemisphere," he
said. "This is very strong evidence of a general warming from 1845
to 1995 in areas where there is ice cover."
</P>
<P>
Other researchers said the ice findings are consistent with
recent instrumented temperature readings and tend to support the
idea that the Earth is getting warmer.
</P>
<P>
"This provides independent evidence that the warming we have
seen over the 20th century is real," said David R. Easterling,
chief scientist at the National Climatic Data Center, an archive
center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that temperature trends are a part of the
ongoing research to determine if the burning of fossil fuels, such
as coal and oil, is causing global warming.
</P>
<P>
The theory is that carbon dioxide and other gases added to the
atmosphere by industry and transportation are trapping heat from
the sun and causing the Earth to warm up.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have contended the warming is not real or that
it is part of a natural cycle unaffected by human actions.
</P>
<P>
Magnuson said his study does not address the cause of the
warming trend, but clearly shows it is occurring.
</P>
<P>
The change in the ice-on and ice-off days found in the study
corresponds to an air temperature warming of about 3.24 degrees F
over the 150-year period, he said. An average temperature rise of
just a third of a degree is enough to change the icing and deicing
dates by one day, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The data was compiled from records kept at lakes or rivers in
Canada, Finland, Switzerland, Siberia, Japan and at 14 sites in
five northern U.S. states, according to the author who added that
some of the records date back far longer than the 150 years
studied.

According to local reports, Kuerten, double French Open

<HEADLINE> State Councilor Says Coming Decade Crucial For China (Details) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The coming five to ten years
will be an important period of economic and social development for
China, said State Councilor Wu Yi today in Xiamen, east China's
coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark in a speech titled "An Open China with
Brilliant Future" at the Fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade.
</P>
<P>
"We are to simultaneously embark on the retracking of economic
system, restructuring of the economy and the transformation of
economic growth modes, which will further improve the relationship
between demand and supply, economic structure and institutional
pattern," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
The two-decade reform, opening-up and rapid development has
enabled China to consolidate its comprehensive national strength.
People's life has improved considerably, its international status
has been on the rise and it has reached the strategic objectives
set by the first and second step of modernization drive, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that China's economic development will be
highlighted in several aspects. The strategic adjustment of
economic structure will be accelerated, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said China will work hard to accelerate the
informationization of its national economy and society and bring
the industrial structure and quality to a new level. The country
will also make headway in urbanization, change existing structure
of the city and countryside and bridge the gap between them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the strategy of Developing West China will be
implemented while the advantages of China's eastern regions will
be given to play as before so that the eastern, central and
western regions can five impetus to one another and develop in a
coordinated manner, she said.
</P>
<P>
By deepening reform, State-owned enterprises will set up modern
corporate system, enforce stockholding system and participate in
market competition as real players who are responsible for their
own management decisions, profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
The effort, she said, will fortify the status of public
ownership as the mainstay.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of Rejuvenating the Nation through Science and
Education will be further implemented, she said. Science,
technology and education will make greater progress and following
reform in these aspects, integrate closely with economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
To go with the trend of scientific and technological
development of today's world, she said China will accelerate the
establishment of State Scientific and Technological Innovation
System to increase the capability of making scientific and
technological innovations and turn the scientific achievements
into practical productivity.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted China will also nurture professionals in various
sectors, improve the quality of labor force and actively create
incentive mechanism and social environment that helps excellent
talents find way to distinction.

<HEADLINE> NE China to Focus on Export Processing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The recently established
Huichun Export Processing Zone (HEPZ) in northeast China's Jilin
Province will play a crucial role in the development of the Tumen
River area on the border of China, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sui Qingjiang, secretary of the Huichun City Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said HEPZ is part of the effort of the
Chinese government to accelerate the export processing industry in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Sui said the HEPZ will mainly deal in labor-intensive and
resource-intensive processing industries, including light
industrial products, food and clothing and Chinese traditional
medicines. It will also produce high-tech electronic and telecom
elements with high added values.
</P>
<P>
Huichun owns four ports to Russia and the DPRK, and HEPZ is
close to a Sino-Russian railway station. It will save one-third of
time to transport cargo to the Republic of Korea or Japan through
Huichun than through Dalian, thus lowering the cost by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city has so far opened land or sea transport lines to Busan
of the Republic of Korea, Zarubino of Russia and Seattle of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Sui said that over 10 enterprises from at home and abroad have
settled down in the HEPZ and about 40 other enterprises have
signed letters of intention with the zone. The HEPZ's volume of
export processing is expected to exceed 150 million U.S. dollars
in four years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's NGO Calls for Registration of Cornea Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An eye care and protection non-
governmental organization has called for potential cornea donors to
register at local hospitals to facilitate cornea donations in
Jordan, the semi-official Jordan Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Jordan Eye Bank and Prevention of Blindness
Society urged donors to register with their identification cards,
driving licenses or health insurance cards, to be included into a
data bank at Al Bashir Hospital, King Hussein Medical Center and
Jordan University Hospital, the three largest public hospitals of
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Since the cornea bank's founding in 1979, some 14,000 Jordanians
have registered as potential cornea donors, but the availability of
corneas proved to be limited for patients awaiting transplant in
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 to 150 cornea transplant operations are performed in
the kingdom each year while patients on the waiting list stand at
some 2,000, said Nafez Khader, an official with the cornea bank.
</P>
<P>
The new registration mechanism of potential cornea donors will
help hospitals provide patients awaiting a cornea transplant
immediately and spare doctors from asking for permission from the
deceased person's family members, Khader said.
</P>
<P>
The corneas from the deceased are only usable for transplant
within hours after his or her death.
</P>
<P>
The cost of a cornea transplant at public hospitals of the
kingdom stands at 600 to 700 Jordanian dinars (840 to 980 U.S.
dollars), while the price could be up to 2,000 dinars (2,800
dollars) in private hospitals which import corneas from foreign
countries at higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Colleges in Cyprus to Merge into Private University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Two leading colleges in Cyprus,
the Cyprus College and the Frederick Institute of Technology, will
join forces to form a non-profit private university.
</P>
<P>
The Weekly newspaper reported Friday that Cyprus College Dean
Andreas Eleftheriades has confirmed the two colleges had reached an
agreement to form a private university, in line with such
institution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Eleftheriades said as soon as government regulations are ready
by the end of the year for private universities, work will begin
for the new university.
</P>
<P>
The new university will operate in the present buildings of the
two colleges which will gradually operate as a single unity.
</P>
<P>
"All surplus profits from the new university will remain in the
university for further expansion and not go into the owners' hands,
that's why it will be a non-profit private university, according to
the American model," said Eleftheriades.
</P>
<P>
The new university will offer courses to at least 3,000
students, including 13 different Bachelor's degrees and 33
diplomas, covering the entire tertiary education spectrum on the
island.
</P>
<P>
The boards of directors of the two colleges hope the new
university will be a unique opportunity for local and foreign
students.
</P>
<P>
There is so far one university in government-controlled Cyprus -
- the state-run Cyprus University.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Vows to Host OAU Summit Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian chief government
spokesmen Newstead Zimba has dismissed claims by opposition
parties that it was unnecessary for the country to host the
Organization for African Unity (OAU) summit next year.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Friday quoted Zimba as saying in a statement
issued here on Thursday that politicians, who were against hosting
the meeting in name of the whole country's interest, actually held
their own petty domestic ambitions, which should not be allowed to
derail the government intention meant to benefit the nation.
</P>
<P>
Sakwiba Sikota, second vice president of the opposition United
Party for National Development, reportedly said that it was
unnecessary and costly for Zambia to spend 250 billion kwacha (
about 83 million U.S. dollars) in a year when presidential and
general elections would also be held.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said the figure quoted was a fabrication which did not
exist in the government program.
</P>
<P>
He said member states of the OAU voted for and invited Zambia
to host the summit as a clear testimony of their trust and
confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be forgotten that Zambia is one of the pioneers
in the restoration of multi-party politics on the continent of
Africa," Zimba said, adding: "Within the OAU, Zambia has been one
of the few countries that has advocated sanctions against those
heads of state that come to power through unconstitutional means
from attending OAU meetings."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the spokesman said with about 3,000 delegates
attending the summit, private consumer demand would surely
increase.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Coffee Exports Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan coffee exports dropped
by 24.3 percent to 220,302 bags at the end of August from 291,029
bags recorded in the previous month, according to the latest
report of the Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA).
</P>
<P>
The report available Friday revealed that corresponding export
earnings declined by 29.6 percent to 9.47 million U.S. dollars
compared with 13.45 million dollars earned in July.
</P>
<P>
The exports in August represented a drop of 27.5 percent from
303,987 bags over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop in coffee exports was mainly attributed to very low
prices on the world market, which forced exporters to scale down
their volume. The average crop price dropped to 0.72 U.S. dollar
in August from 0.77 dollars in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export is the major foreign exchange earner of the east
Africa country, accounting for about 60 percent of the country's
total foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Warn of Fatal Germs Under Medical Personnel's Fingernails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals with elevated
rates of infections and death, especially among newborn babies,
should be examined for "potential reservoirs" of bacteria under
the fingernails of nurses and other medical personnel, U.S.
researchers said in a report published here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report carried by The New England Journal of Medicine, the
researchers also said bacterial conditions such as ear-skin
inflammations and fungal nail infections of health care workers "
should be detected and eradicated" to reduce sickness and deaths
among hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
The targeted bacterium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, is "found more
frequently on people who have artificial nails, and that would
include nail wraps and nail tips and other cosmetic-nail treatment,
" said Dr. Lisa Saiman.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDCP), a major advancement would be more frequent,
more thorough hand washing by people who work in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Previous CDCP studies have shown that only 40 percent to 50
percent of physicians and nurses wash their hands properly between
seeing patients -- with nurses washing more often than doctors.
</P>
<P>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can lead to death, causes between
10 percent and 20 percent of infections in most hospitals, medical
scientists have estimated. In addition to newborns, patients
particularly vulnerable to this bacterium are those with burn
wounds, intravenous-drug addiction, cystic fibrosis, acute
leukemia and organ transplants.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say bacterium's most serious infections include
disease of the ear called malignant external otitis, blood
poisoning (septicemia) and inflammation of the eyes (
endophthalmitis), of the interior linings of the heart (
endocarditis), of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (
meningitis) and of the lungs (pneumonia).
</P>
<P>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa also breeds in moist places often found
in sinks, incubators, respiratory-therapy equipment and hand
lotions.
</P>
<P>
Administrators at the New York hospital recommended that
personnel not use artificial nails, remove jewelry and limit
therapy supplies at the patient's bedside, since those supplies
can become contaminated. Also, nurses have stopped heating baby
formula with water, which can carry the bacteria.

<HEADLINE> Background: Foreign Funds Play Big Role in China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Statistics show that foreign
investment is playing an increasingly important role in China's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
In 1999 for example, the industrial added value produced by
foreign-funded enterprises accounted for 20.6 percent of the
nation's total, with the increase rate exceeding the nation's
average.
</P>
<P>
Taxes paid by foreign-funded enterprises rose by 33.78 percent
and the total volume amounted to 16 percent of the country's total
industrial and commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volume of foreign-funded enterprises was
174.5 billion U.S. dollars, or 48.38 percent of the nation's total.
Foreign-funded enterprises are also important in increasing China'
s foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the huge amount of capital that they have brought
into China, foreign-funded enterprises have also brought advanced
technology, management and talented personnel.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 20 million Chinese people, or 10 percent of China
's urban workers, were working for foreign-funded enterprises by
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A report from the China Academy of Social Sciences said that it
is improbable that China's economy would have maintained a 10
percent growth rate over the past decade if China had not opened
its door to foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
China will make more efforts to lure foreign funds in the new
century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As of July this year, investors from more than 180 countries
and regions have established 353,700 foreign-funded enterprises in
China. Contractual investment exceeded 641.7 billion dollars and
foreign funds used amounted to 327.7 billion dollars.

YINCHUAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Illegal overtaking was the
main cause of a major traffic accident that occurred on a section
of the No. 312 state trunk highway in Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The traffic accident claimed the lives of 14 people and injured
27 others. Thirteen of the 42 passengers aboard a bus operated by
a transport company in Yongcheng City of Henan Province were

</P>
<P>
The refitted sleeper bus, which carried 42 passengers including
37 people of Uygur ethnicity, crashed into a cliff near a tunnel
at Liupan Mountain after it was hit by a truck, which was
attempting to overtake the bus.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yufa, driver of the truck, has surrendered himself to the
police and is being investigated.
</P>
<P>
After the accident, a 140-member rescue team was formed to get
the victims to hospital. Relevant departments in Guyuan Prefecture
are communicating with Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Henan
Province on the aftermath of the accident.

<HEADLINE> China Offering More Business Opportunities to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China has offered favorable
business opportunities to overseas investors as reforms and
openning-up continue and modernization process picks up speed,
said State Councilor Wu Yi today in Xiamen in southeast China's
coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
She summed up the major opportunities to overseas investors in
her speech titled "An Open China with Brilliant Future" in the
luncheon meeting of the Fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu promised that overseas investment will find enormous
potential in such areas as agriculture, water conservation, energy,
communications, telecommunications, raw materials, environmental
protection, high-tech and important equipment as China continues
to implement the principle and policies of driving domestic demand
and facilitates the strategic readjustment of economic structure.
</P>
<P>
"China is carrying out the strategy of developing the western
region. The industrial base, technical strength and rich natural
and labor resources in the middle and western regions are
favorable conditions for overseas people to participate in the
cooperation and development of these regions", said Wu.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the Chinese State-owned enterprises are
exploring modern corporate system. It is one of the important
measures to attract overseas investment to reorganize and improve
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"High-tech industry of China has broad market prospect," said
Wu. Multinational corporations can make full use of the existing
technical team and large number of high-quality talent in China
and enjoy corresponding preferential policies if they come to set
up research and development center, invest in the hi-tech industry
or technology research and development projects, or participate in
the commercialization of high technologies and technical
renovation of traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
To further open up services industry is a significant measure
taken by China to achieve coordinated economic growth, according
to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors can introduce rich experience and advanced
managerial methods in respect to services so that China's
intermediary service organizations including banking, insurance,
commercial retailing, foreign trade and accounting firms and make
new progress.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, China will continue to generate unlimited business
by relying on its time-honored historical tradition, profound
cultural content, convenient infrastructure, and complete
industrial system, as well as a sound environment for innovation,
rich resources and enormous market potential," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government welcomes entrepreneurs from all
countries to make investment and will redouble efforts to improve
investment environment, while providing better management and
services related to overseas-funded businesses which will lead to
more favorable operational conditions for overseas investors," Wu
added.

<HEADLINE> China Uses Technical Standards to Expand VCD Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Technology (MIT) announced today that all laser visual disc
players and DVD machines that are sold in China have to be
compatible with the Chinese-developed technical standard of SVCD.
</P>
<P>
At a working meeting on the technical standard of super video
compact discs or SVCD today, Vice Minister of Information Industry
Lu Xinkui said that the Chinese-developed SVCD standard has
already been adopted as a universal industrial standard around the
globe by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in
July.
</P>
<P>
He said that this will promote the expansion of Chinese
manufactures both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that the adoption of the SVCD as a global standard will
provide a level playing field for competition for the once
technically divided market of visual disc products in China. It
also has great significance for the development of new generations
of laser compact disc machines in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-minister, the MIT is working on uniform
standards for home theater products in China. He hopes that
Chinese manufacturers will actively participate in the formulation
of widely accepted standards so as to gain advantages in product
development and marketing in the international arena.

<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan's abortive bid to "
participate in the United Nations" again demonstrates that no
matter how many different tricks Taiwan authorities use, their
attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" at the
United Nations are futile and unpopular, and they cannot change
their failed fate.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said today that the United

issue of "Taiwan's participation in the United Nations" at the
55th Session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It fully reflects the stance of a vast majority of the UN
member states on safeguarding the purpose and principles of the UN
Charter and Resolution No. 2758 of the UN General Assembly as well
as firmly adhering to the one-China principle," he said.
</P>

This is the eighth consecutive year that the General Committee

<HEADLINE> China's Opening-Up to Enter a New Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's opening-up will enter a
new phase as the process of WTO accession speeds up, said Wu Yi,
China's State Councilor, here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark in her speech titled "An Open China with a
Brilliant Future" when addressing the Fourth China Fair for
International Investment and Trade (CFIIT), which opened here this
morning in Xiamen, a special economic zone in southeast China's
coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the new phase is reflected by various aspects.
</P>
<P>
First of all, she said, the opening-up will be expanded from a
restricted scope and areas to all-round openness.
</P>
<P>
"And the opening-up permitted by policy featuring experimental
nature will be changed into predictable opening-up under legal
framework, namely, to open up in accordance with committed
schedule," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral opening-up mainly on the Chinese side will be
turned into mutual opening between China and WTO members, the
senior Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
In order to comply with the WTO rules, she said, China is
screening and modifying the existing foreign-related economic laws
and regulations and establish foreign trade and economic
cooperation administrative system consistent with international
conventions and China's national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"According to the commitments China has made to other countries
and the need of its own national economic development," Wu said, "
we shall make unremitting efforts to improve the level of opening-
up and participate in the process of economic globalization in a
more active gesture and even wider scope."

<HEADLINE> China to Utilize More Foreign Investment, Wu Yi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will unswervingly pursue
the reform and opening-up, stick to the principle of utilizing
foreign investment in an active, rational and effective way no
matter what happens to international situation.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made today by State Councilor Wu Yi at a
luncheon of the Fourth China Fair for Investment and Trade in
Xiamen, a booming special economic zone in southeast China.
</P>
<P>
In her speech "An Open China with Brilliant Future", Wu hailed
it a meaningful way to jointly study the role and development
trend of international direct investment in the process of
economic globalization, explore new approaches to consolidate
international investment cooperation, and look into the prospect
of China's foreign investment attraction.
</P>
<P>
It is an important component of China's fundamental state
policy of opening-up to absorb foreign direct investment (FDI),
she said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign investment has kept increasing in the past 20-
odd years.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, China has accumulatively approved
establishment of more than 350,000 foreign-funded firms with a
total contractual capital of 641.7 billion U.S. dollars and actual
investment of over 327.7 billion U.S. dollars by the end of July
of this year.
</P>
<P>
"From 1993 to 1999, China has been the developing country
absorbing the largest amount of foreign capital seven years in a
row," she said.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that after the outbreak of the Asian financial
crisis, international capital fled away and China was inevitably
affected to some extent.
</P>
<P>
However, many foreign investors have come back again, which is
indeed heartening for the Chinese people, she said.
</P>
<P>
The active utilization of foreign capital has not only promoted
the sustained, sound and swift development of the Chinese economy,
in particular its economic restructuring and industrial upgrading,
but also provided to the vast number of international investors
precious business opportunities and enormous marketplace, she said.

<P>
The achievements of China's foreign investment attraction
should be attributed to the political stability, social security
and relatively high speed of economic development, she added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China has gradually summed up some mature practices
after the exploration. The practices including:
</P>
<P>
-- Enriching and improving laws, regulations and policies
related to foreign investment attraction on a consistent basis
while enhancing the efficiency and service of government agencies
so as to create better environment for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
-- Gradually expanding the opening-up of service industrial and
protecting in real earnest the legitimate rights and interests of
foreign investors, treating each other as equals and providing
mutual benefit in the course of common development.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, she said, economic globalization has become
a historical trend that is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
"China is absorbing foreign capital as necessitated by its
economic development, which also contributes to the international
investment collaboration," Wu added.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Redirect Food Aid for Human Development in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
would redirect its food aid to promote human development in
Bangladesh, outgoing WFP representative Werner Kiene told The
Independent newspaper here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to explore projects with a view to investing in human
capital. We hope that the government can go along the same line
and utilize food aid and assistance in a better way and implement
programs by integrating the interests of the poor people," the WFP
representative said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the newspaper, Kiene said the
WFP and other U.N. agencies now look forward to an area-based
approach to development as a complement to the sector-based
approach pursued so far.
</P>
<P>
He said that international food donors want to give less
emphasis on infrastructure projects if they do not integrate the
poor, because otherwise they do not directly benefit them in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
The WFP will decentralize its activities by locating some of
its staff to areas most prone to food scarcity at times of stress,
Kiene said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty million ultra poor people are not a problem, but a
potential productive resource that the society can use efficiently.
Once they graduate from poverty, they will be a big group of
consumers and a lot of economic activities will be there centering
on them, the WFP official observed, stressing that human
development should be combined with a policy of inclusion of these
people as equal members of the society.
</P>
<P>
In future, the WFP would distribute a new protein and vitamin
rich food instead of distributing wheat, with a view to helping
improve the nutritional status of the recipients of food aid.
</P>
<P>
The WFP representative said the WFP was increasingly becoming
involved with nutrition and would contribute to the National
Nutrition Program of the Bangladeshi government.

<HEADLINE> Houston Replaces Los Angeles As U.S. Smoggiest City  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A series of sweltering
days and soaring ozone levels pushed Houston ahead of Los Angeles
for the title of the nation's smoggiest city.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that Houston recorded its ninth
consecutive day with an ozone reading above the national health
standard Wednesday, giving Houston 37 high-ozone days for the year,
compared with 34 for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"High pressure dictates stagnant air. You have no clouds and no
wind," said Steve Allen, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
"The pollutants that are there are going to stay there. You cook
them every day with the sun, and you get a lot of ozone." he added.
</P>
<P>
Houston hit 107 degrees on August 31 and September 1, and on
Monday, the city hit a record-high 109.
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms pushed inland from the Gulf of Mexico late
Thursday and Friday, which could break the heat and the string of
ozone days, perhaps handing the lead back to Los Angeles, said
Chuck Roeseler, another weather service meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the final week of August and first few
weeks of September are historically the smoggiest of the year,
according to experts who pointed out that in Houston smog season
lasts much longer, sometimes beginning in February and persisting
as late as November.
</P>
<P>
They also say that much of Los Angeles' ozone is formed when
exhaust from cars and smokestacks released during the day mixes
with other chemicals and sunshine, while in Houston much of the
pollution comes from oil refineries, petrochemical plants and
cargo ships.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- One week away from the opening
of the millieum Olympics, a Nigerian runner was killed in a
traffic accident in Southern Australia.
</P>
<P>
Hyginus Anugo, 22, a middle distance runner who competed in the
World Junior Championships in 1996 in Sydney, was hit by a car as
he crossed a street Thursday night, the official Olympic News
Service said.
</P>
<P>
Local television said Anugo was killed while running to catch a
bus.
</P>
<P>
John Coates, president of the Australian Olympic Committee,
said Anugo did not have Olympic accreditation and was not staying
at the Olympic athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
Anugo was with the team in Adelaide where final selections for
relay squads were made. Anugo was not selected after failing to
finish in the top six in a recent team trial.
</P>
<P>
In a condolence note, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on
Friday "expressed his sympathy and expressed the sympathy of the
IOC to the national Olympic committee of Nigeria and the family of
the athlete who was killed tragically last night," said IOC

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Members Asked to Reduce Share Holdings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Counter
Corruption Commission of Thailand (NCCC) on Friday asked cabinet
members to reduce their share holdings in any company to no more
than 5 percent before November 9.
</P>
<P>
The request is based on the Cabinet Members' Business
Partnership and Shareholding Management Act of 2000, written in
line with Article 209 of the Constitution, aimed at "preventing
conflict of interest involving cabinet members."
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members who want to hold on to shares in excess of the
limit are required to notify the NCCC and to transfer those shares
to the care of a trust, it said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet members have been required to include details about
their share holdings in their financial status report to the NCCC,
it said,and will be sued at the Constitution Court if they conceal
information about their share holdings.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 216 of the Constitution, if found guilty
by the Constitution Court, violators will lose their governmental
status and face possible imprisonment of between one and ten years,
the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The NCCC also plans to put information about cabinet members'
assets and liabilities on a government website, it added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Police Caution Ministers of Possible Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Inspector General
of Police Lucky Kodituwakku has cautioned cabinet ministers of the
possibility of assassination attempts on them by Tamil Tiger
rebels in the run-up to the general elections on October 10, press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The police chief was quoted by the private Island as saying
that operatives of separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) had visited the residences of some of the ministers as part
of their effort to gather information about the ministers.
</P>
<P>
In a move to beef up security for the ministers, the government
last month imported several bullet-proof cars for senior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kodituwakku Thursday canceled leave for all police
officers. He told the ranks that they would not be allowed to take
leave in the run up to the elections amid fears of more poll-
related violence and LTTE's assassination attempts.
</P>
<P>
At least five people have been killed in election-related
violence since the parliament was dissolved on August 18. The
campaign began earlier this week after nominations closed for the
11th parliamentary general elections.
</P>
<P>
Security has also been tightened for the Sri Lankan Prime
Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake as he is believed to be a prime
target of LTTE rebels who have in the past assassinated several
Sri Lankan leaders.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake has been given presidential security division
cover as he is expected to lead the ruling People's Alliance
government's campaign for the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE is fighting a 17-year war against majority Sinhalese
dominated government in a bid to carve out a separate state for
minority Tamils in the country's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE attacked both government and opposition rallies during
last December's presidential elections campaign killing dozens of
people and seriously wounding President Kumaratunga.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Soar Beyond Control: Thailand Petroleum Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT) warned that the continued rise in world oil prices
has gone beyond its ability to effectively keep the lid on
domestic prices, The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
PTT governor Viset Choopiban was quoted as saying that if world
oil prices rose again, the PTT would have no choice but to raise
local oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Viset said that since July, the PTT had spent 700 million baht
(17 million U.S. dollars) to keep local oil prices from rising too
much.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil in the world market hit a 10-year high
Thursday, reaching nearly 35 dollar a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The price of diesel oil, in particular, could go up further in
the near future due to growing demand for heating oil in western
countries during the winter, Viset said.
</P>
<P>
The PTT just allowed the local diesel oil price to increase by
another 0.30 baht (0.7 cent) a liter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"If other oil companies increase the price, we will have to
follow suit. Nevertheless, we will keep our diesel price 0.30 baht
(0.7 cent) a liter cheaper than others," the PTT governor said.
</P>
<P>
The organization has been losing 1.1 baht (2.6 cents) a liter
on diesel and 0.4 baht (0.9 cent) a liter on various petrol
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Science, Technology and Environment Minister Pornthep Tejapibul
was quoted as saying that he would propose that the National
Energy Policy Committee (NEPO) cut the tax on oil products by one
baht (2.4 cent) a liter to help soften local oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He said the government could make up the lost revenue by
suppressing oil smuggling, which would lead to higher oil sales.
</P>
<P>
Governor Viset said NEPO had agreed to an oil tax cut as a last
resort. He pointed out that now would be a suitable time for a cut
as the country had run out of alternatives to deal with the price
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Joins ASEAN Telecom Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has cooperated with
other five countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in launching ASEAN's first comprehensive telecommunication
network, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thuegsuban
presided over a launch ceremony at the Asia Comm/ExpoComm 2000
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The network is based on the integration of multi-
telecommunication approaches, including the Internet, the
International Private Leased Circuits, the Frame Relay Service,
the Very Small Aperture Terminal Service (VSAT), and the Video
Conference Service.
</P>
<P>
The integration was the development and application of an
automatic teller machine (ATM) network to be linked to other
telecommunication networks in form of multi-media, with high speed,
security and reliability, said Suthep.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN has linked its telecommunication network comprehensively,
based on the advanced ATM system so that members can communicate
quickly, safely, and reliably through the regional multi-media
integrated telecommunication system, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The integrated telecommunication system could also cope with
expansion and changes of technologies in the future, he noted.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member countries joining in the comprehensive
telecommunication network include Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Thai Senate Begins Deliberating Election Law Amendment Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thai Senate begins to
deliberate the election law amendment bill here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has urged the 200-seat Senate to give a
speedy passage of the bill, which has been endorsed by the House
of Representatives, the lower house, on August 31, to ensure that
the upcoming general election will be held under the amended law.
</P>
<P>
The lower house's term ends on November 17, but a dissolution
seems sure to happen before that date, and the general election
will then be called, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, during discussions in Friday morning, many senators
said they could not pass a bill that puts the independent Election
Commission under a screening panel under the government, which is
proposed and endorsed by the House.
</P>
<P>
This means the Senate will possibly push for changes in the
amendment bill to give the Election Commission absolute power to
handle the election, including disqualification of candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Senate will vote for a decision after debates within
several days.
</P>
<P>
Once the changes are made by the Senate, the bill will be
returned to the House, and then the two houses of the parliament
will form a joint committee to work on the bill.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Issues Statement at Millennium Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the five
Permanent Members of the U.N. Security Council issued a joint
statement on Thursday during the three-day U.N. Millennium Summit,
pledging to make the international body stronger, more effective
and efficient than ever before as it enters the new century.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that mindful of the special responsibilities
of the Permanent Members of the Security Council concerning the
maintenance of international peace and security, and the daunting
challenges facing the U.N. and the world community in the coming
21st century, together, with the entire membership, they are
committed to strengthening the U.N., ensuring the authority of the
Council, and upholding the purposes and principles of the charter.
</P>
<P>
The five Permanent Members of the Security Council include
China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States. The leaders
issuing the statement were Chinese President Jiang Zemin, French
President Jacques Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, they vowed to enhance leadership for peace
and security, saying that the role of the U.N.'s leadership,
particularly in maintaining world peace and security, must be
strengthened to reflect the organization's changing challenges and
priorities.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged that the evolution must take into account
both the shifting face of the world community and the types of
conflicts the U.N. must confront.
</P>
<P>
They committed themselves to foster a more transparent and
broadly representative U.N. Security Council, and to promote its
effectiveness as the leading body in the arena of international
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the leaders vowed to strengthen peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
Given that the nature and number of international conflicts
demanding U.N. involvement has shifted fundamentally over the past
decade, they pledged "to move expeditiously to endow the U.N. with
resources -- both operational and financial -- commensurate to the
tasks it faces in its peacekeeping activities worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Enhancing the U.N. peacekeeping capacity should "strengthen its
central role in conflict prevention and settlement," the statement
said, referring to the Secretary General's Expert Panel on Peace
Operation as an important element to consider in ensuring the U.N.
's effectiveness in this vital sector.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to revitalize management, the leaders promised to "
support steps to empower the Secretary General with the mandate to
modernize and streamline the Secretariat further, to evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of programs, and to focus the world
body's resources on priority areas, while bringing closure to
activities that no longer warrant continued investment."
</P>
<P>
Fourth, describing the U.N. staff as its most valuable resource,
and the skill, vision and dedication of the U.N. Secretariat staff
as having made possible all that the organization has achieved to
date and determining its future, the five leaders pledged to
replenish human resources.
</P>
<P>
They vowed to back prompt steps to ensure that the U.N.'s base
of human capital, especially in the area of peacekeeping, can be
fortified through a process that is transparent, equitable, and
designed to attract the very best talent available the world over.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, in reaffirming financial commitment, they pledged to "
support measures to broaden the resources base of the U.N. through
financial structures that are equitable, transparent and
reflective of current realities for the regular budget and the
peacekeeping budget, and financing of U.N. activities,"
</P>
<P>
Under the Charter, the U.N.'s financial base must accurately
reflect the capabilities and responsibilities of every member
State.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they recognized the need to adjust the
existing peacekeeping scale of assessments, which is based on the
1973 system, in light of changed circumstances, including a
countries' current capacity to pay.
</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the Security Council, they committed to
creating a more stable and equitable financial foundation for
current and future U.N. operations, including through adjustments
to the peacekeeping scale of assessments to reflect the role of
all Member States, and especially the role of all Permanent
Members in the peacekeeping financing.
</P>
<P>
To achieve their commitments and make the U.N. stronger and
more effective, the five leaders also agreed to have more regular
exchanges of views on important international issues.
</P>
<P>
They concluded the statement with appreciation and support for
the U.N. Secretary General for the role he plays in the service of
peace, development and strengthening the U.N. organization.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to work together with the entire U.N. membership
to bridge differences and agree on new measures to build on the
promise of the U.N.'s first 55 years.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of U.N. Permanent Five Summit Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The following is the
full text of the P5 Summit Document issued Thursday at the end of
the historical summit meeting of the top leaders of the five
permanent member countries of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
We, President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China,
President Jacques Chirac of the Republic of France, President
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of the Russian Federation, Prime
Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and President William Jefferson Clinton of the
United States of America have met in New York on 7 September 2000
and hereby state the following:
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the special responsibilities of the Permanent
Members of the Security Council in regard to the maintenance of
international peace and security, we share a solemn commitment to
ensuring that the UN is stronger, more effective and more
efficient than ever before as it enters the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The challenges facing the UN and the world community are
daunting. To meet such challenges, the world community's response
must be quicker, more targeted, and better coordinated than ever
before. As the world's only truly universal organization -- in
terms both of its mandate and its membership -- the UN has an
essential role in the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
The UN can only be as effective, as creative and as
authoritative as its members will it to be. Moving into the next
century, the Permanent Members of the Security Council pledge,
together with the entire membership, to strengthen the UN,
ensuring the authority of the Security Council and uphold the
Purposes and Principles of the Charter. Bearing primary
responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of
international peace and security, the Security Council, in
particular its Permanent Members, has an abiding interest in
ensuring that the UN is equipped to meet the challenges it faces.
We therefore commit ourselves to strengthen the operational
capabilities of the Security Council in this area. Only by
strengthening our dedication to the Purposes and Principles of the
UN Charter, and by endowing the UN with the means to deliver on
its many mandates, can we fulfill our obligations to ensure that
the UN can achieve its full potential.
</P>
<P>
To this end, we will focus our efforts on the following
priority areas:
</P>
<P>
Enhancing leadership for Peace and Security -- The UN's
leadership role, particularly in maintaining international peace
and security, must be strengthened to reflect the organization's
changing challenges and priorities. This evolution must take into
account both the shifting face of the world community and the
types of conflicts the UN must confront today. We commit ourselves
to foster a more transparent and broadly representative UN
Security Council to enhance its effectiveness as the leading body
in the field of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening Peacekeeping -- The nature and number of
international conflicts demanding UN involvement has shifted
fundamentally over the past decade, a change that has yet to be
reflected in structural reforms to equip the UN to fulfill the
array of mandates it now faces. We pledge to move expeditiously to
endow the UN with resources -- both operational and financial --
commensurate to the tasks it faces in its peacekeeping activities
worldwide. Enhancing the United Nations peacekeeping capacity
should strengthen the UN's central role in conflict prevention and
settlement. We look to the recommendations of the Secretary
General's Expert Panel on Peace Operations as an important element
to be considered in order to ensure the UN's effectiveness in this
vital arena.
</P>
<P>
Revitalizing Management -- The breadth, scope, and complexity
of the UN's activities demand effective leadership. We pledge to
support steps to empower the Secretary General with a mandate to
modernize and streamline the Secretariat further, to evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of programs, and to focus the
organization's resources on priority areas, while bringing closure
to activities that no longer warrant continued investment.
</P>
<P>
Replenishing Human Resources -- The UN's most valuable resource
is its people. The skill, vision, and dedication of the UN
Secretariat staff has made possible all that the UN has
accomplished to date, and will determine the organization's future.
We pledge to support prompt steps to ensure that the UN's base of
human capital, particularly in the field of peacekeeping, can be
fortified through a process that is transparent, equitable, and
designed to attract the very best talent available from all
corners of the globe.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming Financial Commitment -- As enshrined in the Charter,
the UN's financial base must accurately reflect the capabilities
and responsibilities of every Member State. We pledge to support
measures to broaden the resource base of this institution through
financial structures that are equitable, transparent and
reflective of current realities for the regular budget and the
peacekeeping budget, and the financing of UN activities. We
recognize the need to adjust the existing peacekeeping scale of
assessments, which is based on the 1973 system, in light of
changed circumstances, including countries' current capacity to
pay. Taking into account our special responsibilities as Permanent
Members of the Security Council, and the duty of all Member States
to meet their financial obligations to the UN, we commit to
creating a more stable and equitable financial foundation for
current and future UN operations, including through adjustments to
the peacekeeping scale of assessment to reflect the role of all
Member States, and especially the role of all Permanent Members in
peacekeeeping financing.
</P>
<P>
In each of these areas we pledge to work together in coming
months and years to ensure that the UN is imbued with the
resources, the vision and the support it needs. As Permanent

<HEADLINE> U.S. University Workers Stage Sickout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of workers at the
University of Texas continued a sickout Thursday saying they are
tired of what they call unfair working conditions at the state's
largest university.
</P>
<P>
The non-teaching employees are seeking pay raises, including an
hourly minimum of 9.16 dollars, and want their insurance premiums
to remain unchanged, according to reports reaching here late
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The university has said it was forced to raise premiums to
offset rising insurance costs. Workers earning 30,000 dollars a
year or less were given a 50-dollar-a-month raise to help offset
the increases.
</P>
<P>
University operations were normal Thursday, the second day of
the three-day work disruption, said Pat Clubb, the vice president
of employee and campus operations.
</P>
<P>
About 300 students rallied and some professors held classes off
campus to show their support for the workers.
</P>
<P>
Exactly how many of the school's 17,000 non-teaching employees
stayed home would not be available for several days. Clubb
estimated the number would be about 500. The University Staff
Association said about 4,800 workers agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
The sickout at University of Texas followed a similar one
Tuesday at Eastern Michigan University, where more than 650
professors went on strike for salary and benefit increases.
</P>
<P>
Salaries for full professors at Eastern Michigan University
averaged 63,000 dollars in 1998-99, according to the latest
figures available from the Mid-American Conference. The average in
the conference, which represents 12 comparable public universities,
was 68,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Permanent Members Hold Historic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The top Leaders of the five
permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations
held its first historic summit at the Waldorf Hotel in New York
today.
</P>
<P>
The Security Counsel summit, proposed by China, is the first
in the history of the U.N. since its founding in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
French President Jacques Chirac, Russian President Vladimir Putin,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang said the purpose of the summit is to
affirm and reflect the importance of the U.N. and their support
for the organization in a bid to strengthen the U.N. and Security
Council's role.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that complicated contradictions and
conflicts were endlessly occurring in the rapidly changing world,
and the purpose of the U.N. Charter has not yet been realized,
therefore the international community has greater expectations
from the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that history and reality have proven that only with
the support of the five permanent members can the U.N. and the
Security Council play a positive role in important international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President noted that in the past 10 years, the
five permanent members have played an important role in securing
the independence of Namibia, promoting the settlement of the war
between Iran and Iraq, the Gulf Crisis, the Cambodian issue, and
handling the nuclear crisis between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang proposed at the meeting that the Security Counsel should
observe under the new situation the following four principles:
mutual respect and equal treatment; expanding consensus and
seeking common ground while reserving differences; increasing
exchanges and coordination; taking into account the interests of
the whole and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the five nations should respect the
aspirations and expectations of all the U.N. member states and
maintain contacts with various nations the world over. Only then
can they fulfill their role in world affairs and win respect from
all U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
The top leaders of the United States, Russia, France and
Britain spoke highly of the summit initiated by China, believing
that the summit is of importance both historically and
realistically.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the top leaders of the five nations had a
thorough exchange of views on U.N. affairs and major regional and
world issues and reached a common consensus.
</P>
<P>
A Summit Document was released at the end of the meeting in
which the five leaders reiterated the core role of the five
permanent members of the Security Council, which includes a
commitment to increasing the leading role the U.N. plays in
safeguarding world peace and security, and its capability to keep
peace; a pledge to take measures to further reform the U.N.,
revitalize management and replenish its human resources; and to
reaffirm financial commitments to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The Document also commits to defending the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, ensuring the U.N. authority and
strengthening its role.
</P>
<P>
Before the summit, Jiang Zemin met with French President
Jacques Chirac and exchanged views with him on bilateral relations
and relations between China and the European Union.

UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Committee decided here Thursday not to table the issue of

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Committee decided Thursday night not to table the issue of
"Taiwan's participation in the United Nations" for the 55th
session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a new heavy blow to the island's attempts for
"international space" expansion.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth consecutive year that the General Committee
has turned down requests from a group of small countries, most of
them in Africa and Latin America, for U.N. consideration of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's new leadership, formed in March, disregards past
defeats and still wishes to regain access into the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee made the decision after an hour-long
evening debate, almost four weeks after Senegal and 13 other
countries sent, on Taiwan's behalf, a letter to U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, demanding the inclusion of the issue in the
new General Assembly session's agenda.
</P>
<P>
China immediately voiced its strong opposition to the inclusion.
Permanent Representative of China to the U.N., Wang Yingfan, also
sent a letter to the U.N. chief, asking the international
community to continue to uphold justice and reaffirm the one China
policy.
</P>
<P>
Wang also spoke against Taiwan's attempt at the General
Committee meeting Thursday night.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Committee decided Thursday night not to consider the issue
of the so-called "Taiwan 's participation in the United Nations"
at the 55th session of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the committee held a long hour debate on
the issue. It was the eighth consecutive year that the General
Assembly turned down the request by a small group of countries,
mostly in Africa and Latin America, foiling Taiwan's attempt to
return to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 70 countries made statements during
the debate. The majority, including the United States, Britain,
France and Russia, four permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, made clear their opposition to the proposal and
reiterated their countries' position of one China policy.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from about 50 countries stressed that the issue of "
Taiwan's participation in the United Nations" has already been
solved by Resolution 2758 adopted at the 26th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, and there is no need to further
debate about it.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should concentrate on matters which demand
urgent attention and put an end to the so-call Taiwan issue, they
said.
</P>
<P>
On August 3, Senegal and a dozen of other small countries sent
a letter to the U.N. General Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
requesting to include in the agenda of the new session of the
General Assembly an item of "Taiwan's participation in the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
China's Permanent Representative to the U.N., Wang Yingfan, had
immediately voiced strong opposition to the issue and asked the
international community to continue to uphold justice.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang spoke again at the Thursday night session
against the proposal put forward on Taiwan's behalf, calling it an
attempt to create "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" in the
world inter-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly oppose the inclusion of item 183 of the draft
agenda in the agenda of the 55th session of the General Assembly.
We hope that the General Committee will continue to uphold justice,
safeguard the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter as well
as General Assembly Resolution 2785 and support the position of
the Chinese Delegation," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government of the People's Republic of
China "rightfully represents all Chinese, including our
compatriots in Taiwan, in the United Nations and all organizations
related to it."
</P>
<P>
The decision by the General Committee was seen as a heavy blow
to the new leadership in Taiwan, which was formed in March. It
became clear that the new regime disregards past defeats and still
wishes to regain access into the U.N.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time since last September that the United
States, Taiwan's main supporter and arms supplier, has been
compelled to distance itself from the controversial issue. A U.S.
diplomat reaffirmed at the night session that his country would
continue to pursue the one China policy. In the past eight years,
no big powers have taken the side of Taiwan on the issue of
returning to the U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar makes efforts to bring
down its illiteracy rate to 9 percent this year from 21.4 percent
in 1983, according to Friday's official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed this to the Education for All Program.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate in Myanmar has reached 91 percent and
endeavors are being made for the remaining 9 percent to be
literates in the 21st century, the paper said hailing the
International Literacy Day which falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to turn illiterates into literates under the
basic literacy program, Myanmar, along with 12 other nations in
Asia and the Pacific region, established in March this year the
Literacy Resources Center (LRC) in cooperation with the Asia
Pacific Cultural Center (LRC) for U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The LRC is to undertake the tasks of production of teaching
aids, literacy training and communication networks with non-
governmental organizations at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Myanmar is also making efforts to enable neo-literates
to be life-long learners under the reading skills promotion
programs and become members of learning society in the knowledge
age of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's illiteracy rate declined to 57 percent from 65
percent after regaining independence in 1948 due to first attempt
of public education and making new life through education from
1948 to 1964.
</P>
<P>
From 1964 to 1983, the country's literacy mass movement was
launched for the second time with illiteracy rate decreasing to 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday opened the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
Expo 2000 at the Mines in Seri Kembangan here in conjunction with
the 4th MSC-International Advisory Panel meeting.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 companies and organizations are taking part in the
three-day exposition highlighting the achievements of Malaysians
and their international partners in embracing new business and
government administrative models.
</P>
<P>
The exposition also exemplified Malaysia's open and pragmatic
policy in dealing with technology and change and its commitment to
working with other world citizens to encourage creativity,
innovation and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
In his message in the exposition's souvenir program, Mahathir
said the MSC, which is celebrating its fourth anniversary this
year, was fast changing Malaysia's economy, business and societal
landscape.
</P>
<P>
The past four years had witnessed several positive implications
of the MSC in tandem with its true identity as Malaysia's next
engine of growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the recent economic downturn it helped rejuvenate
research and development activities, revolutionized the way
Malaysians live, acquire knowledge and work and sparked changes in
both government and business administrative practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also envisaged the smart partnership between Malaysia
and the international companies and between the government
agencies and the private sector -- created during the formulation
and implementation of the MSC's seven flagship applications --
translating into wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians could proudly say that the accomplishments of the
MSC proved the country's ability to conceptualize a world class
idea and turn it into something of practical reality, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Croatian government
recently approved a 10-year landmine clearing program Thursday,
Croatian radio and television station reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the program aims to remove all
landmines in the country by 2010. It will cost 9.6 billion kuna (1.
14 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government believes the program's cost will place too great
a strain on national finances. So, the government is now seeking
alternative funding sources, including credit from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Landmines Removal Center estimates that around one
million landmines are buried beneath over 500 square kilometers of
land. The landmines were planted during the civil war from 1990 to
1995.

long queue formed in front of the Bank Aust ria Kunst, the
location of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers of the exhibition, this is the largest
and most comprehensive collection of Picasso's artworks ever
displayed in Vienna. Around 10,000 tickets have been sold in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Among the artworks are many pieces painted in Picasso's late
period, including oil paintings, sketches, and water colors.
Visitors can also appreciate, from this exhibition, the diversity
of this master's versatile art styles.
</P>
<P>
A highly-productive artist, Picasso left 35,000 pieces of art
to the world after his death in 1973, one-fifth of which to his
eldest son Paul. When Paul died in 1975, he gave all the
paintings to his son, Bernard.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit in Vienna is primarily from Bernard's collection,
with some of them seen by the public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Picasso was born in Malaga, Spain, in 1881. He was brought up
in a creative and artistic atmosphere because his father was a
painting teacher. Picasso moved to Paris in 1904 after his early
academic training in art in Spain; he gradually became an
established artist in Paris.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou in south China's
Guangdong Province has 16 forest parks, the biggest number in all
provincial capitals in China.
</P>
<P>
As a regional political and economic hub, Guangzhou has forest
covering 41.5 percent of the city area, or 224,000 ha. The city
spends over 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) annually on
tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Local forest parks combine landscape gardens and amusement
grounds with stone-laid walk-ways through woods. The refreshing
environment and convenient infrastructure have made local forest
parks very popular.
</P>
<P>
The Liuxihe National Forest Park, the first one in the city,
received 700,000 tourists last year earning 15 million yuan (1.8
million US dollars) in revenue.
</P>
<P>
Another eight forest parks are planned to be built by 2002,
which will increase the coverage of forest parks to 60,000 ha.,
accounting for 7.8 percent of the city area.

<HEADLINE> 15 Arrested Over U.N. Staff Murder in West Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen suspects have been
arrested for their suspected involvement in Wednesday's attack
against civilian U.N. staff in the border town of Atambua, West
Timor, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said he had received word on the
arrests from the Udayana Regional Military Command Chief Major
General Kiki Syahnakri.
</P>
<P>
"The team of investigation has already begun work and 15 people
are being questioned," he was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team consisted of five police officers from
the provincial headquarters and five soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the killing of the three U.N. humanitarian
workers could have been political.
</P>
<P>
"We are investigating whether it was triggered by the death (of
a militiaman) or caused by political motives to discredit the
government," Susilo said.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place after Olivio Mendoza Moruk, former
chief of a pro-Jakarta East Timorese militia group, was found
beheaded in his home Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, at least three staff members of the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were killed when an angry
mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese or so-called militia launched an
armed attack on the representatives office of the UNHCR in Atambua,
a city in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
Susilo said he had instructed security authorities in West
Timor to immediately work to halt the violence and prevent it from
spreading and to assure and protect the security of foreigners,
including UNHCR staff remaining in Atambua.
</P>
<P>
He said extra troops would be sent in and insisted Indonesia
forces had done their best to stop the tragic event.
</P>
<P>
In New York, President Abdurrahman Wahid, who is now attending
a U.N. millennium conference, claimed the attack had been
engineered by his political opponents to undercut international
support for his reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This was done at a time when I am in New York, at the United
Nations, in order to embarrass me," the president was quoted by
the Antara News Agency Friday as saying.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Reduce Poor Countries' Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank's primary task
for the remaining year is to cut 30 billion U.S. dollars in debts
owed by 20 poor countries, said a World Bank official at a press
conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Rischard, vice president for Europe of the World
Bank, said there are 35 countries across the globe where emergency
aid is badly needed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Rischard said, the theme of the annual meeting in
Prague this month by the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund is "Poverty and Debt Exemption and Reduction."
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss at the meeting world financial
stability and economic development. The meeting will also discuss
for the first time such issues as global climatic changes,
decreasing forest coverage and organized international crime.
</P>
<P>
One third of World Bank funds come from Europe, Rischard said,
adding that European countries, therefore, will play an increasing
important role in providing material aid to under-developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Experience and lessons learned in the last decade bear witness
to the fact that the World Bank should attach greater importance
to developing countries in terms of their governmental
administration and related systems, in addition to granting aid to
cultural, educational and public health sectors.

<P>
BUCHAREST, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 119 people were
killed and 244 others were injured in some 11,000 fires across
Romania in the first eight months of this year, Romania's
firefighting forces said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters rescued 1,125 people and saved property worth more
than 1.3 billion leu (about 56,500 U.S. dollars), Emil Marinescu,
chief of staff of the firefighting forces, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In January-August, the number of fires rose by 87 percent
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought over the past several months and
unprecedented high temperatures in the summer this year were
mainly responsible for the frequent fires.
</P>
<P>
In the eight-month period, 539 forest fires occurred in the
country, five times that of the same period in 1999, destroying
539 hectares of forest. Forty-five percent of the forest fires
were caused by improper use of fire by tourists, he added.
</P>
<P>
To prevent fires, the fire fighting forces have stepped up the
implementation of preventive measures in buildings and
institutions in the country.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Thursday that imposing political pressure on
Yugoslavia would be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that during a meeting
with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, Milosevic said that
pressure would have no beneficial results.
</P>
<P>
He noted that applying pressure does not reflect the interests
of any people of any country, and that it could not undermine the
determination of the Yugoslav people to fight for their own
interests.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that he hoped to fortify cooperation in areas
such as economics and culture with other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, who arrived in Belgrade from Macedonia on Thursday
for a visit, also met with President of the Serbian Republic of
Yugoslavia Milan Milutinovic and his Yugoslav counterpart Zivadin
Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
He told Jovanovic that Greece is willing to develop ties with
Yugoslavia and will support the lifting of sanctions imposed on

HAVANA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) is undertaking investigations on food risks in 11
Latin American countries, a WFP official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The WFP's regional delegate, Italian Paolo Mattei, told a press
conference that the analysis basically records food risks due to
natural causes and the ability to respond to the problems.
</P>
<P>
The WFP official explained that Latin American countries,
especially those in the Caribbean and Central American zones, have
to declare themselves in a state of emergency practically every
year, as a consequence of cyclones, earthquakes, drought or other
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Mattei highlighted the investigation in five eastern Cuban
provinces, which he said was the most detailed analysis carried
out by the WFP in the region.
</P>
<P>
The investigations are carried out in different phases, in Peru,
Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The reports are delivered to their respective governments as a
methodological tool of action to fight hunger.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Damaged Pipelines Resume Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Two pipelines in Colombia have
resumed operation after experiencing numerous attacks by guerrilla
groups, Colombian Petroleum Company (Ecopetrol) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 700-kilometer long Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, the second
largest in Colombia, renewed pumping 250,000 barrels of oil per
day, after being inactive for 45 days, said the company.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) carried out 24
attacks against pipelines in 40 days, preventing the pumping of 4.
7 million barrels of export oil.
</P>
<P>
This is the longest suspension of operations of the pipeline
since 1986, when production of Cano Limon began.
</P>
<P>
Oil is the main export product of Colombia. For the year 2000,
income has been calculated at five billion U.S. dollars, involving
about 35 percent of the total exports, but due to intensifying
guerrilla attacks, this figure will probably be lower.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, Colombia's second largest guerrilla force, responsible
for the greatest number of attacks against oil and electricity
infrastructures, warned that sabotage will continue until the
government has a new nationalist energy policy.

<HEADLINE> Science to Uncover Doping in Sydney: S. African Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Olympic Committee of South Africa's (NOCSA's) anti-doping
commission Winton Hawksworth Thursday predicted that doping will
be a big factor at this month's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the top athletes in the world will test positive at
the Games because of the scientific advances since last Olympics,"
said Hawksworth, a retired professor of chemistry, who also sits
on the medical commission of the International Sailing Federation
and international swimming's doping control review board.
</P>
<P>
He further contended that the International Olympic Committee's
decision this week to introduce a combined blood-uring dope test
for erthropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of red
blood cells and provides fuel for the muscles, will doom those
athletes who thought such a test will not be approved in time for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Hawksworth believed South Africa will have a clean team in
Sydney,although anyone crafty enough to have avoided detection,
particularly for the use of stamina-boosting EPO, will be found
out once the doctors come round with their own syringes to take
blood.
</P>
<P>
"The damage to national prestige would be immense," warned the
professor, adding: " The health issue is another story, but the
fact that an athlete is a cheat would be terrible."
</P>
<P>
Hawksworth has spent the past two years primarily educating
South Africa's potential Olympians on NOCSA's policy towards
doping.
</P>
<P>
In this time only two athletes, a boxer and a cyclist, were
excluded from consideration because they tested positive.

</P>
<P>
In a statement made in New York, where he was attending the U.N.
Millennium Summit, Chirac said that the massive increase of oil

<HEADLINE> Chilean Military Service Law Due For Drastic Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Following years of debate
over Chile's Obligatory Military Service (OMS) law, the government
has proposed a series of important changes in the way youth are
recruited for military service, the local newspaper "La Tercera"
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The changes, announced on Tuesday by President Ricardo Lagos,
include automatic inscription for young people on their 18th
birthday, semi-voluntary service, increased participation by women
and greater incentives for recruits, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"These changes involve greater expense for the state as well as
significant legal reforms and therefore will be implemented
gradually beginning next year and concluding in 2005," Lagos said.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Defense Minister Mario Fernandez will be responsible
for formalizing the proposed changes to the OMS, a task that must
be completed in the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the first change to be implemented will be the
automatic registration of young people on their 18th birthday.
This reform, which will be instituted in 2001, will replace the
current process that requires young people to appear in person at
recruitment centers to register for military service.
</P>
<P>
"(This change) will eliminate the entire recruiting process as
well as the sanctions for failing to register. This is currently
an enormous administrative and judicial problem because young
people who do not register are subject to disciplinary action, and
there are close to 10,000 such cases per year," Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
Another change soon to come will be the increased emphasis on
voluntary conscription. In 1998, 53 percent of those who completed
the OMS did so by choice, a figure that increased to 68 percent in
1999. The government hopes to attract even more voluntary recruits
by creating financial incentives, including a substantial increase
in monthly salaries, scholarships for higher education and links
with businesses to ensure work for recruits after they complete
their military service.
</P>
<P>
"We have some job training and also some educational
opportunities at lower levels, but these apply only to a small
fraction of conscripts who make use of the services. The measures
that we are going to take now are much wider in scope," Fernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
In the event that the military quota is not filled by voluntary
conscripts, a draft will be held to fill the remaining vacancies.
Those who are chosen will be required to complete their military
service unless they meet specified exemption requirements, which
have not yet been defined.

<HEADLINE> "I Am as Clean as Snow", Says Konchellah  By Sun Huixia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- 800 meters runner Patrick
Konchellah, One of Kenya's main medal hopes in the Sydney Olympics,
Thursday denied that his withdrawal from the Games was linked with
the fear of a possible blood test.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that I withdrew because of stomach
complications," Konchellah told Xinhua after returning to Kenya's
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not run away from Sydney and he was not
hiding either.
</P>
<P>
"I am available here in Nairobi now for testing even by the
IAAF (International Amateur Athletic Federation). I was tested
four times this year, two in Europe and two in Kenya, and all the
results were negative," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am as clean as snow," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked why he refused to be attended by Kenyan Olympic team
doctors in Australia, he said that he had some medicine with him
and he was also worried that maybe the treatment by the doctors
would worsen his health.
</P>
<P>
Konchellah, who arrived in Nairobi on Wednesday morning and was
due to leave soon for his base in The Hague, Holland, said that he
started developing stomach pains when he came back to Kenya a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
When answering the possible causes of the pain, he blamed the
mixture of food and water he ate in Nairobi after back from Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I was very sick in Sydney and in a terrible condition. In the
past two weeks I could not meet the daily training schedules," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"But I am fine now and you can see me here talking. But the
state is not good enough for the Olympic games and even if the
pain eases," he said vigorously after talking about 40 minutes
with the press.
</P>
<P>
After consulting with his private doctor in Nairobi, he
presented a letter on a pull-out to Kenya Amateur Athletic
Association on August 30 and got the approval four days later.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Kenya will do well in the games and added
that he will fly to Sydney on September 25 to watch the 800 meters
final and give the three Kenyans moral support.
</P>
<P>
"Kenyans have a clean record regarding drug abuse. I personally
believe that all Kenyans athletes to Sydney are clean," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am of course very sad, but it is part of life," he said when
commenting his decision. "Next Olympic Games is still far away, I
can not say anything about my chance in four years."
</P>
<P>
His best performance for the 800-meter event is one minute 42
seconds 98 while the current world record is one minute 41 seconds
11.
</P>
<P>
Kenya media has speculated that Konchellah quitted possibly due
to links with performance enhancing drugs on the grounds that he
refused to be treated by Kenyan Olympic team doctors.
</P>
<P>
Around 38 Kenyan athletes are set to take part in the track and
field events in Sydney and Kenyan National Olympic Committee has
predicted a harvest of at least four gold medals and six to eight
silver and bronze.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence of World War II Germ Warfare Test Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- More remnants of Unit 731, part
of the Japanese Kwantung Army conducting germ warfare in China
during World War II, have been collected by residents in Harbin,
capital city of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The relics include an oriflamme, an aluminium ashtray with the
inscription "Japan's Kwantung Army", a porcelain bowl inscribed
with "Manchuria Unit 731", an officers desk, and an airplane
maintenance record.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that "Unit 731" has been found on items
left by the notorious troop, as most items were marked with "
Kwangtung Army", said Jin Chengmin, vice-curator of the archives
on Unit 731. The ashtray was the first piece of ironware ever
discovered inscribed with Kwantung Army.
</P>
<P>
"It indicates that part of the Kwantung Army did have its
designation changed into Unit 731 in 1941," said Jin.
</P>
<P>
The oriflamme is rare proof of the predecessor of Unit 731,
whose relics have not been discovered yet, said Jin.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 was part of Japan's Kwantung Army, whose headquarters
were in Harbin in 1932. It is notorious for manufacturing
materials for germ warfare that were tested on more than 10,000
live people.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the germ warfare test base was blown up before
Unit 731 withdrew from China. Local historical researchers have
found many articles at the site, but few of them contained medical
data, was surgical equipment, or was evidence relating to top
secrets.
</P>
<P>
China started clearing the site of Unit 731 in Heilongjiang
last month. Local government initiated a city-wide collection of
relics of Unit 731, hoping to find more solid proof of the crimes
of Japanese invaders during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 relics have been found at the site, including anatomic
appliances, incubators and shrapnel.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reaps High-Yield Barley Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous region is to
reap a bumper harvest in high-yield highland barley this year.
</P>
<P>
Highland barley, also known as Qingke, is the principal food
grain in southwest China's Tibet. The region sows highland barley
on 120,000 hectares of land each year, accounting for 60 percent
of the total farmland in Tibet. On average, each hectare of land
produces 3,750 kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
To raise its output, the regional academy of agricultural
science experimented with growing high-yield Qingke strains on 666
ha of land in Nyima County. In cooperation with local farmers, the
agricultural scientists cultivated the crop using the latest
technology and careful field management.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent sample survey, the per hectare output of
the new strain was more than 7,900 kg. Lin Dawu, president of the
local academy of agricultural science said the strain will soon be
common in Tibet.

XI'AN, September 8 (Xinhua)-- The 20th Germany-sponsored
forestation project in China has been launched in Yan'an, the
famous revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
With 12 million marks (about 5.5 million U.S. dollars) from the
German government, China will plant 15,700 hectares of forest and
another 2,300 hectares of forest that yields economic earnings,

purpose and Germany-aided forests have covered some 100 counties
and towns all over the country.
</P>
<P>
China started a large program to return cultivated land to
forests last year. Using overseas aid to plant more forests will
be another important way to protect the environment, said Quan

with him views over the bilateral relations and major regional and
world issues of common concern, a Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, who is here to attend the U.N. Millennium
summit, said that China and the United States, as the two big
powers in the world, have born the common historical
responsibility for the cause of promoting world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past years the general trend of the Sino-U.
S. ties, though experiencing ups and downs, have steadily moved
forward. Facts have proven that to keep and develop a healthy and
steady relationship between the two nations is not only in the
fundamental interests of both peoples, but also beneficial to the
peace, stability and development in the Asian-Pacific region and
the world as a whole, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang pointed out that at the turn of the century,
the governments and leaders of the two countries should stand
ascending and firmly hold the general situation of the bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should, on the basis of the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques, expand exchanges and cooperation and appropriately
handle the differences and Taiwan issue in particular so as to
keep the Sino-U.S. relations developing forward healthily,
steadily and continuously in the new century, which is beneficial
to the peace, stability, development and prosperity of the world,
the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said that the United States and China have
had a good cooperation over the past eight years since he took
office, and leaders of the two nations have personally pushed
forward the improvement and development of the bilateral ties,
increased exchanges and made their efforts in winning the support
of their people for developing the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also said that the U.S. side sincerely hoped that the
two nations would realize true cooperation and China would succeed
in its economic and social construction.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang elaborate China's principle position on the
Taiwan issue, saying that "we have said many times as long as the
Taiwan authorities recognize the one China principle, the contacts
and dialogues between the two sides across the straits can be
restored, leader of Taiwan can come to the mainland or we could go
to Taiwan for talks and anything can be discussed."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said that his country would continue to
abide by the one-China policy, hoping that the Taiwan issue could
be solved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
On the question of U.S. permanent normal trade relations (PNTR)
with China, Jiang said that an early realization of PNTR is
beneficial to the expansion of economic and trade cooperation
between the two nations and to the long-term healthy and steady
development of bilateral relations as well, which benefits the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. Administration is striving hard for
the passing by the Senate of the PNTR bill and the review in the
Senate has made progress, believing that the issue could be solved
soon.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Tourists Visit Romania in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2.35 million
tourists visited Romania in the first six months of 2000, up 7.4
percent from the same period of the previous year, the official
Rompres news agency Friday quoted data of the Tourism Promotion
Office as showing.
</P>
<P>
Most tourists, 2.25 million, came from European countries. They
are followed by Asian tourists (53,687) and North American ones (
39,213).
</P>
<P>
As regards European tourists, they came mostly from the
Republic of Moldova, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The maximum increase of the number of arrivals in Romania was
registered for the tourists from Portugal (32.9 percent), Norway (
28.5 percent) and France (25.2 percent) as compared with the first
six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, a growth by 8 percent in the number of
foreign visitors in Romania was registered in 1999.
</P>
<P>
After an absence of a decade from the maps of the great
European tourist destinations, Romania returned to the attention
of foreign countries, mainly during the past year, after tourism
promotion programs which publicized the total solar eclipse in the
summer of 1999, as well as passing into a new millennium, the
ultimate purpose being to attract foreign tourists from the
countries regarded as targets for the message.
</P>
<P>
All these were materialized during a severe decline of Romania'
s returns from tourism, which amounted to about 250 million U.S.
dollars in 1999, as against 590 million U.S. dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Shippers Block River Danube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian shippers blockaded
the River Danube Friday to protest against the Danube blockage
and the international embargo imposed on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ten barges and five tugboats began blocking a stretch of water
under Romanian jurisdiction at Calarasi, 100 kilometers southeast
of Bucharest. The protest is planned to last three days.
</P>
<P>
Romanian shippers said they have lost some 150 million U.S.
dollars in trade since June 1999, when NATO destroyed bridges in
Serbia, on Romania's western border. The debris left in the
Serbian stretch of the river makes sailing difficult, and a
pontoon bridge made of barges at Novi Sad blocks all shipping.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has authorized up to 22 million euros to pay
for clearing the Danube. The protocol does not include
reconstruction of the bridges, but only the opening of a navigable
channel.
</P>
<P>
Shipping on the full length of the Danube will not resume
before next year, the head of an organization of countries
bordering the river said.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Should Work Hard for Better Mutual Understanding, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is making an effort to
know the U.S. better, and the U.S. should likewise make an effort
to know China better, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president, who is in New York to attend the United
Nations Millennium Summit, made the statement at the luncheon
hosted by the chairman of the National Committee on U.S.-China
Relations, Barber Conable, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in
downtown New York.
</P>
<P>
"To facilitate the development of China-U.S. relations, we
should both try to get a better understanding of each other, in
terms of the country and the people," he said. "History and the
realities show that prejudice is farther away from truth than
ignorance and it is a greater barrier to the exchanges and
contacts between nations than mountains and oceans."
</P>
<P>
"Democracy, freedom and human rights are the common aspirations
of mankind," he said. "However, because of differences in the
history, culture, social system and the level of development,
different countries would inevitably adopt different approaches to
ensure these things to their people and would give them different
contents and connotations. This is quite normal."
</P>
<P>
"The differences among countries should not become an obstacle
to the development of their relations," he said. "Ours is a
diverse and colorful world. To make all countries adopt the same
political system and to judge the various choices made by the
people of various countries according to the values of one country
are not democratic at all."
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States should increase their exchanges
and dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, the Chinese president said, "As is known
to all, the Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive
question in China-U.S. relations. Our relations have experienced
ups and downs over the decades, most of which can be traced to the
Taiwan question."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. governments, both Democratic and Republican, have all
made clear-cut commitments on this question," he said. "That is,
the United States follows a one China policy and observes the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. Furthermore, China and the U.S.
respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, they
refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
"Once reunified with the mainland, Taiwan can still maintain
its economic and cultural ties with the U.S.," he said. "An early
solution to the Taiwan question will contribute not only to a
normal development of China-U.S. relations, but also peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large."
</P>
<P>
On China's access to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Jiang
said, "The United States should create an environment of fair
competition and eliminate all the unreasonable technical barriers
for China's access to the U.S. market in accordance with WTO rules.
"
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said, "Both China and the United States are
nuclear-weapon-states and permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council. As such, we both shoulder important responsibilities on a
series of major issues that bear on world peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"We both hope to see our children live in a world of security,
prosperity and happiness, free from hunger, disease and fear under
the sky that is blue and tranquil," he said. "To that end, we
stand ready to increase consultations and cooperation with the
United States in such areas as security, nonproliferation,
environmental protection and fight against international crimes."
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States, along with other countries of the
world, should work towards the lofty goal of achieving common
security for the whole world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and American people are great people, and China
and the United States are great countries," he said. "We both
should ascend the height to enjoy a distant view and examine
closely and handle our bilateral relations from the strategic
height and the long-term perspective."
</P>
<P>
The Cold War mentality is a product of the old times, he said.
"It is incompatible with the lofty cause of world peace and
development and with the desire of our two peoples for better
China-U.S. relations. Our two governments should go along with the
trend of the times, respond to the call of the people of our two
countries, seek common ground while shelving differences, expand
cooperation and jointly build towards a constructive strategic
partnership oriented towards the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The audience burst into warm applause at the end of the speech
delivered by President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Before President Jiang began to deliver his speech, Henry
Kissinger, who was former U.S. secretary of state, extended a warm
welcome to the Chinese leader. He also spoke highly of Jiang's
contribution to the further development of U.S.-China ties.
</P>
<P>
It is "tremendously important" for the American people to learn
from China, who has a splendid culture with a long history,
Kissinger said, adding that the further development of the U.S.-
China relations can only be achieved on the basis of the respect
for different cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
Present at the luncheon were Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen,
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Wang Yingfan, Chinese
Ambassador the United States Li Zhaoxing, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, and U.S. Permanent
Representative to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke.

<HEADLINE> Romania Launches Euro Bonds in Comeback on Foreign Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- After three years, Romania
has returned on the international capital market with bonds worth
300 million euros, matured within seven and ten years respectively,
the Rompres news agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new series of bonds will be traded by ING Barings of the
Netherlands, which hopes to make the transaction complete by the
end of October, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It may seem a risky move on the eve of elections, but the wide
political consensus for European integration has altered the
Romanian political landscape. I don't see any reason why the new
series of bonds would not be successful," said Stan Rudcenko, an
economist at SG Securities.
</P>
<P>
Romania last year made an abortive attempt to come up on the
capital international market, at the insistence of the
International Monetary Fund, which subsequently gave up the
condition that Romania had to earn funds from private lenders and
thus offered Romanian authorities more flexibility in financing
matters.
</P>
<P>
Merryll Lynch, ING Barings, Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley
have now been interested in offering the Romanian government soft
loans and advantageous return deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The reserves of Romania's central bank stand at about 2.1
billion U.S. dollars, an indication that the bank will not default
on its foreign payments.

<HEADLINE> Italian Method to Genetically Modify Pigs is Efficient, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The method developed in Italy to
genetically modify pigs in order to produce organs which can be
transplanted into humans is the most efficient and economic in the
world today, researchers said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The claim came from Mariluisa Lavitrano, the head of the
genetic transplant project at Rome's La Sapienza University,
during the conference on Bionics for Promoting Man in the Third
Millennium, organized in the framework of the Jubilee for
Universities.
</P>
<P>
Up until now, human genes have been introduced into the genetic
code of pigs by injecting them into the ovary. The method
developed at La Sapienza, on the other hand, injects the human
genes directly into the sperm.
</P>
<P>
Thus the DNA is modified before fertilization and this,
Lavitrano explained, "has proved to be ten times more efficient
than the techniques used so far."
</P>
<P>
The gene injected into the pig's DNA, both in the traditional
method and the one developed in Rome, produces the DAF (decay
accelerating factor) protein which is important for blocking hyper-
acute rejection, the first of the three phases which lead to the
rejection of organs and which takes place in the first minutes
after the transplant.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lavitrano observed, the path towards
transplanting animal organs into human remains a long one and
extreme caution is necessary, especially after it was discovered
that organs from pigs can also transmit harmful viruses to man.

<HEADLINE> Czech Airlines Shows Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Czech Airlines made a profit of
382 million crowns (about 10 million U.S. dollars) in the first
seven months of this year after losses in the same period last
year, the Czech News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the January-July period of this year, the company carried
more than 1.3 million passengers and 9,100 tons of cargoes, which
increased by 22.2 percent and 33.8 percent respectively compared
with last year. In the mentioned period last year, it reported a
deficit of 158 million crowns (about 4.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Kral, vice president of the company, told a press
conference that the growth was attributed to the economic recovery,
the ending of Balkan conflict and the increasing foreign customer
demand.
</P>
<P>
Czech Airlines expects to post a net profit of 206 million
crowns (about 5.4 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Kral added that the company planned to add two Boeings 737-400s
to its fleet next year. Currently, it has a total of 28 different
kinds of planes.

<HEADLINE> China to Become Leading Tourist Country: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Through another 20 years of
development, China will become a leading tourist country not only
in Asia, but also in the world, said He Guangwei, chairman of
China National Tourism Administration at a luncheon here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech entitled "China's Tourism Industry in the
21st Century," at American Express in the World Financial Center,
He said he and his administration are confident that China will be
one of the leading tourism countries in the world by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by researchers from the
administration, China's inbound tourists will total about 140
million annually, earnings in foreign exchange from tourism
industry will reach annually to up to 75 billion U.S. dollars,
while earnings from domestic tourism will top 200 to 300 billion U.
S. dollars annually, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's tourism trade is the most-open
industry, which was one of the earliest to open up to the outside
world. At present, China has opened to foreign investment in six
tourism-related fields of transport, sightseeing, lodging, food,
shopping and recreations.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, China and the United States reached an
agreement on China's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
And China has ever since offered to further open up tourism
services, he added.
</P>
<P>
He regarded tourist industry in China as one blessed with
enormous opportunities and marketplace as well as low risks and
high returns.
</P>
<P>
Chairman He Guangwei also hoped that more and more American
businesspeople would participate in the future development of
China's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States is one of the most developed
tourism countries in the world and one of the major tourists-
generating country for China, and that China is the largest
tourism developing country in the world and is potentially an
important tourist generating market for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"The existing friendly and cooperative relations between the
two countries in the field of tourism should be further developed,
" he told the audience of dozens of American entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Wireless Gaming Explosion Forecast in U.S., Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The wireless games
industry in the United States and Europe will grow from nothing
now to a market of 6 billion U.S. dollars by 2005, said a forecast
report released this week.
</P>
<P>
According to the report from Datamonitor, a global market
analysis firm, mobile phones will be the next platform to emerge
for playing games. By 2005, 200 million people in Western Europe
and the U.S. will be playing Internet games on their mobile phones,
representing four out of five mobile users.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe will take a strong lead over the U.S., with the
U.K. and Germany as its largest wireless gaming markets. Five
years from now, Datamonitor predicts that Western Europe will
continue to lead and account for more than 50 percent of wireless
gaming revenues. The U.S. will gradually catch up and by 2005, its
revenues will have risen to 2.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Card games, quiz games, bingo and other classic games will be
the most popular games on mobile phones, according to the study.
Their simplicity and mass appeal will be ideal for the wireless
gaming market. Popular PC and console games will also be gradually
ported onto mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
How will industry players make money out of this market?
According to Datamonitor, sponsorship will be the most lucrative
revenue stream. Content sponsored by third parties or dependent on
customers paying a nominal fee could also prove successful with
the public. Meanwhile, subscriptions will find a receptive
audience.

PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Three "wise men" appointed by
the European Union for assessing the political situation in
Austria recommended on Friday a lifting of bilateral sanctions
imposed by 14 other EU countries on Vienna.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to French President Jacques Chirac, the
three "wise men" -- former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
former Spanish Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja, and German jurist
Jochen Frowein, said that the sanctions will become harmful if the
14 other EU countries don't lift them.
</P>
<P>
They said that the measures have caused nationalist feeling in
Austria whose citizens think that the sanctions are targeted
against them.
</P>
<P>
The three "wise men" were appointed in June by the European
Court of Human Rights for evaluating the Austrian government's
attachment to the common value of human rights and the political
evolution of the far-right Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider,
which joined the government in February .
</P>
<P>
"Our conviction is that the Austrian government respects the
common European values," said the report.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed sanctions against Austria in February, including
the suspension of bilateral cooperation between Vienna and 14
other member countries, minimum contact with Austrian ambassadors,
and refusal to support Austrian candidates in posts of
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> George W. Bush Adjusts Campaign Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush adjusted his campaign style
Friday to regain the momentum two months before the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor Bush tried his new closer-to-the-people style as
he campaigned near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, sharing coffee and
answering questions from high-tech factory workers.
</P>
<P>
"This is what I'm good at," he said. "I like meeting people, my
fellow citizens, I like interfacing with them."
</P>
<P>
"We're going to continue to have more conversations with
Americans in settings where they live and work," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
Bush, standing amid workers on the factory floor with a
microphone but no dais or podium, talked about the Social Security
retirement system, his education reform agenda and his 1.3
trillion U.S. dollars tax cut proposal. Afterward, he spent 45
minutes in answering questions from workers.
</P>
<P>
The Texas governor changed his campaign style after top
Republicans are getting increasingly concerned about Democratic
nominee Al Gore's rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Polls show Vice-President Gore either even or slightly ahead of
the Texas governor in the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
Bush Friday campaigned in Pennsylvania and Missouri, two swing
states, and then went back to Texas for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush's Democratic rival Al Gore promoted his plans
to upgrade education as he campaigned in New Orleans Friday.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Broadly on Corporate Profit Warnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
broadly Friday as investors took profits from a recent rally in
response to profit warnings from a number of companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 39.22 at 11,220.65
points, extending its loss of 50.77 points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 119.94 at 3,978.41 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 8.01 at 1,494.50.
</P>
<P>
The market fell after a handful of companies warned that their
earnings in the third quarter would not meet expectations. Among
them were Gadzoox Networks, First Data, MPower Communications and
automotive parts maker TRW.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Corp. and Merrill
Lynch downgraded First Data and MPower Communications separately
after the two companies lowered their profit expectations.
</P>
<P>
Corporate profit warnings sparked worries among investors about
investment returns in the slowing U.S. economy. Traders cashed out
of some blue chip stocks and moved the money to the tech sector
Thursday after companies such as DuPont, Campbell Soup and Circuit
City Stores warned that they could not meet earnings expectations
in the third quarter. Blue chips fell while tech shares rose on
that day.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates for six times
since last summer in a preemptive move to cool off the economy and
keep inflation from rising. Rate hikes could lead to higher costs
and lower demands for companies.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.24 at 675.73. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 6.26 at 967.92. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 7.12 at 535.70.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,540 down, 1,325 up and 489
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 958.65 million shares from 973.54
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's New President to Set Up Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's new President
Abbiqassim Salad Hassan said here on Friday that would begin to
set up a government after his return to his country.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, who is here attending the three-day U.N. Millennium
Summit which opened at the U.N. headquarters in New York Wednesday,
said in his meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that he
would start with the naming of a prime minister and the
establishment of government agencies.
</P>
<P>
He said he would need U.N.help.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that while the U.N. is prepared to assist,
there has to be an end of violence that has torn the country apart
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
The president apologized for the loss of life to U.N.
peacekeepers and aid workers during that period.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the Djibouti peace process which had culminated
in his election as the president of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Hassan was elected two weeks ago by a parliament operating out
of the neighboring state of Djibouti. His presentation at the
summit ended more than a decade's isolation of his impoverished
nation.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a central government since 1991. Clan
leaders from across Somalia gathered in Djibouti in May of this
year to work out a plan to restore some sort of order to the
fractured nation.
</P>
<P>
A 425-member parliament was created three weeks ago with
representatives from all of Somalia's clans and sub-clans.
Elections were promised after a three-year transitional period.
