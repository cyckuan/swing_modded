<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and France signed today a financial protocol
under which the kingdom will receive 80 million French francs
(about 16 million U.S. dollars) in soft loans.
</P>
<P>
Paris also granted Amman about 10 million francs (about 2
million dollars) to finance a project to computerize the Amman
Financial Market.
</P>
<P>
Agreements were also reached to provide Jordan with technical
assistance to finance other technical studies and projects upon
the request of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- An Iranian oil specialist has predicted a price drop
in the world oil market in 1997, saying the oil price would
fluctuate between 17 and 21 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Hojjat Ghanimi, Director of the National Iranian Oil Company
(NIOC), said that the oil prices in the coming year would not be
much higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Akbar quoted him as saying that "there are
projections that the price of North Sea Brent crude would swing
round 17-21 dollars and no more."
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran should not take for granted artificially
high oil prices at present for next year's economic planning. The
recent rise in oil price in the international market has been
caused by political rather than economic factors, he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the oil price hike in the past few weeks to
tension in the Persian Gulf, Baghdad's push into the Kurdish
northern Iraq, the approaching U.S. presidential elections, early
cold spell in the northern hemisphere and the drop in stockpiled
oil in the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran has signed a 600 million U.S. dollars contract
with three foreign companies for construction of a petrochemical
complex in the western province of Kermanshahan, a press report
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Iran reported that a consortium made up of
companies from German, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates
has been set up for the project in the provincial capital of
Kermansha, about 650 kilometers west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not identify the three foreign
companies involving in the petrochemical project in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the privately-owned complex would have
an annual production capacity of 900,000 tons of chemical
fertilizers, including 540,000 tons of urea fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller said that the "non-interest banking system"
advocated by her coalition partner Welfare Party (RP) would soon
be put into practice, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ciller as saying that a new company to be set
up would give interest-free credits to small and medium-sized
industrial concerns.
</P>
<P>
She said that the 1997 draft budget was prepared as a
"balanced budget," and that this would be tested for the first
time since 1970.
</P>
<P>
For a balanced budget, the tax revenues have been raised from
27 billion U.S. dollars to 32 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nestle to Invest Five Billion Yuan in China by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's Nestle Company,
the world's largest food manufacturer, is to increase its
investment in China to five billion yuan by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Helmut O. Maucher, chairman and CEO of Nestle, revealed the
company's China investment plans at a news conference in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
China has the largest population in the world, indicating a
huge potential in the food market, said Maucher, and China's
sustained economic growth, enforced purchasing power, as well as
progressive change of Chinese consumer habits, has encouraged
Nestle to inject more funds in the country. It will lift China to
one of the most important markets for Nestle in the world, Maucher
added.
</P>
<P>
Nestle has now invested 2.8 billion yuan on nine joint
ventures and two solely-owned companies in China, mainly serving
the China market with worldwide range of food products and
beverages, including instant coffee, tea, milk powder, condensed
milk, infant cereals, ice cream and culinary products.
</P>
<P>
Nestle has 75 percent of China's coffee market.
</P>
<P>
China's policy to give priority to agriculture in national
economy, provides a good opportunity for investment by Nestle,
which depends greatly on farm produce as its raw materials,
pointed out Maucher.
</P>
<P>
Nestle intends to help China develop its farm produce
processing industry, to help enliven the economy in the country's
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase its share of China's market, Nestle also
plans to expand its business in the country's central-west areas
in the future.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, Nestle is expected to
earn three billion yuan in sales in China's inland areas and Hong
Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
Two Nestle-funded enterprises are to go into operation in
Tianjin on October 25. Nestle Dairy Farm Tianjin Ltd, a joint
venture costing 300 million yuan, will produce and sell ice cream,
and Nestle Tianjin Ltd, a 430 million yuan company, exclusively
owned by Nestle, will produce chocolate and mints. By then, nine
of the 11 Nestle's projects in China will have become
operational.

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Egyptian Companies to Show Quality in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 companies from
Egypt are determined, by taking part in the first exhibition of
Egyptian products in China, to present the high quality of its
improving national industries.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the exhibition coincides with the third
session of the Sino-Egyptian Committee to be held in Beijing
Friday, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA)
today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Supply, Internal and Foreign Trade Ahmed
Goweili, head of a large trade delegation, will meet with Chinese
officials on expanding bilateral trade, reducing trade barriers
and balancing trade relations during his five-day trip.
</P>
<P>
The activities, synchronizing with the 40th anniversary of the
establishment of the Sino-Egyptian diplomatic ties, will witness
the implementation of the deals signed during the 1994 Beijing trip
by President Hosni Mubarak and the May 1996 Cairo visit by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The volume of Sino-Egyptian trade, which stood at 453 million
U.S. dollars in 1995, does not tally with the strong ties binding
the two countries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The high quality of foreign and local products available in
Chinese markets poses a major challenge negatively affecting
the volume of Egyptian exports to China, the report added.
</P>
<P>
However, Egypt and China share various similarities in their
economic reforms, which are being applied to streamline economic
activities in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under study is a joint project to turn the Suez area into a
free zone where Chinese products will be assembled and later
exported to European states, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
China has set up 14 free trade zones in coastal areas, since
it adopted the reform and open-up policy in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The report recalled that Sino-Egyptian economic ties have
witnessed a remarkable leap in the 1990s when a number of
agreements were signed.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China and Egypt signed two agreements, one on
protection of investments and the other on promotion of judicial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A year later, they came up with three other accords on
enhancing joint work in economic, cultural and technical domains.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth which characterized China over the past 15
years has indicated that China will be one of the expected
leading powers across the world in the 21st century, the report
concluded.

<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has developed
viable democratic institutions that will ensure stability in the
post-Mandela period, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said in Harare
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates to the southern African trade and
investment summit, Mbeki said the peaceful nature of the 1994
elections that brought the ANC into power and subsequent local
government elections had demonstrated the maturity of South
Africa in terms of the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of the constitutional court and the
introduction of a new constitution supported the existence of an
inclusive system of government that would guarantee legitimacy
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki called for the overhaul of South Africa's civil service
in order to make it responsive to the needs of people and to
fight corruption which he said was rampant in the government
system.

<HEADLINE> New Signs for Fire Fighting Introduced in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Fire Service
Department has recently introduced the design of a package of four
new indication signs for emergency vehicle access (EVA).
</P>
<P>
Lam Chun-man, chief fire officer of the Fire Protection Bureau,
said the introduction of the new signs was aimed at arousing
public awareness of the importance of keeping the EVA free of
obstruction for the purpose of fire fighting operation.
</P>
<P>
Emergency vehicle access in some of Hong Kong estates is very
often obstructed by illegally built houses, huts or articles
stored by the nearby household.
</P>
<P>
The four signs will respectively give specific indications of
the layout of an EVA, the emergency route as well as warning
against car parking and obstruction to emergency vehicles in the
event of a fire.
</P>
<P>
With detailed specifications available, the department hoped
that by January 1 next year, the design of the new signs will be
adopted by architects in new developments whereas for existing
buildings, the building management concerned would be requested to
provide such signs.

PYONGYANG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today called for reform of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
A story marking the United Nations Day, carried in today's DPRK
newspaper, Minju Choson, said the U.N. had to reform itself by the
way of democratization, because there were many issues in
desperate need of solving. These included ethnic conflicts,
territorial disputes, poverty and the world's peace and security.
</P>
<P>
On the Korean issue, the newspaper said the United Nations bore
responsibilities for the Korean split. It should work hard to
pledge security and maintain peace on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the United Nations to rescind the title of
U.N. Forces Headquarters in South Korea, which the DPRK said was
used by the United States as a political pretext to station its
troops on the peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Largest Project to Improve China's Paper-Making Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- China, the home of
paper-making, is to boost its paper industry with a massive
increase in locally supplied wood-pulp.
</P>
<P>
According to a document signed jointly by the Ministry of
Forestory and the Guangdong provincial government today, a
wood-pulp mill, with annual output of 300,000 tons, will be built
in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The mill, costing over 700 million US dollars, is described as
the largest of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Yucai, vice Minister of Forestry, the project
will mark a historical turning point in China's paper-making
sector.
</P>
<P>
The vice Minister said that the country's production ability of
paper-making raw material has long been too low to meet demands.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Forestory showed that last year
China spent 2.68 billion US dollars importing wood-pulp, and its
follow-up products, while at the same time large quantities of
wood were exported.
</P>
<P>
Located at the southern end of China's coastal line, Zhanjiang
has one of the nation's eight most famous sea-ports. Nearly one
third of its land is covered by high quality forests.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of forestry, Xu Youfang, officials from both
Guangdong, and the related state department, as well as
representatives from some world famous paper and wood companies,
attended today's event.
</P>
<P>
Tore Amundsen, chief representative of Beijing Representative
Office of Knaerner, one of the world's leading machinery
suppliers, said that the wood-pulp project will provide a good
opportunity for his company to cooperate with China.
</P>
<P>
Wood-pulp paper-making is listed by the State Council as one of
the key industries China will develop during the
Ninth-Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> European Parliament Adopts EU 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament today
passed its first reading of the 1997 budget of the European Union
(EU), which amounts to 82.514 billion ECUs (103.142 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the first reading, the Euro-deputies raised the spending
by 868 million ECUs (1084 million dollars), from an earlier
proposal by the EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The council suggested a zero-growth for the 1997 budget from
that of the 1996, in order to be in line with austerity plans
adopted by EU countries for joining the European Monetary Union by
1999.
</P>
<P>
But the Euro-deputies, meeting in full sessions in Strasbourg,
said a plan by the European Commission for raising the 1997 budget
by three percent over 1996 was reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Detlev Samland, president of the Budget Commission of the
European Parliament, said this was the first time the deputies had
stood on the side of the European Commission, which was the
executive organ of EU.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is now in the camp of the Council of Ministers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament will definitely adopt the 1997 EU
budget at its second reading next month, if the Council of
Ministers decides to approve it.
</P>
<P>
The added spending will be used for research projects,
development of trans-European communications, peace-making in
Northern Ireland, environment protection, consumer protection, and
equal opportunities for men and women.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament today also froze 56.6 million ECU
(70.75 million dollar) in aid to Turkey for 1997. This was in
protest for what it called a "deplorable human rights situation"
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The aid is mainly compensation for the possible loss that could
result from the entry by Turkey into a customs alliance with the
EU, in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputies have decided to freeze temporarily 26
percent of the salary payments for employees of the European
Council in order to push for internal reform of its management.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today that the United Nations of
the future would be an efficient intergovernmental organization,
in the service of its member states and their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of United Nations Day this morning,
Boutros-Ghali said that the U.N. of the future will offer an
effective system of collective security.
</P>
<P>
"Prevention would become the primary rule of action. The
requisite mandates and resources would be provided to all peace
operations in a consistent and reliable manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said an effective division of labor with regional
organizations would be in place. Some form of limited
U.N.-authorized rapid deployment force answerable to the member
states would be ready, following a Security Council mandate, to
deal with violence that no single nation or group would consider
it a matter of national interest to tackle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Development would receive the attention and resources that it
deserves, he said, adding that the relationship between developed
and developing states would change, fundamentally, from assistance
to cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth would be understood as essential not only to
advance material progress, but to provide society with options in
every important field," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nature would be allowed to renew itself, investment in people
would be understood as a prerequisite to progress, and a strong
civil society would participate in shaping and supporting the
development effort, he added.
</P>
<P>
In essence, the U.N. chief said, the vision of the U.N. was a
simple one: it would be an organization that functioned as the
drafters of the Charter had intended; it would be an organization
which would not only adapt to changing international conditions,
but contribute to the improvement of these conditions.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Industrialist Warns of Lip-service to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian industrialist warned
here today that southern Africa is treading dangerous waters as
regional leaders continue to pay lip-service to economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
"Growing discontent was beginning to creep into the region
because of delays in establishing favorable economic relations
among countries in the region," said Mark O'Donnell, Chairman of
the Zambia Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing the ongoing Southern African Trade and
Investment Summit.
</P>
<P>
"If the regional economic system continues to be unfairly
dominated by South Africa, the discontent will even grow," said
O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
Trade in southern Africa is skewed in favor of South Africa,
the region's economic giant, which has a superior economic base
built over decades of economic sanctions imposed on the country
during years of its apartheid rule, he said.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the ratio of trade between Zambia and South
Africa currently stood at 20 to one in favor of Johannesburg,"

<HEADLINE> Balanced Regional Trade Urged in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyril Ramaphosa, executive
deputy chairman of the New Africa Investments of South Africa,
said here today that South Africa's economic power in the region
could not be sustained unless other economies became active
partners in trade.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates to the southern African trade and
investment summit in Harare, Ramaphosa said unless there was
increased investment into other member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), there was a great danger
that the regional powerhouse would lose a major market for its
products.
</P>
<P>
"There is need to intensify investment to other countries in
the region to enable them to also export to South Africa and
increase regional trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
The countries, he said, should shift from being resource
producers into manufacturers if they are to penetrate the
lucrative South African and global markets.
</P>
<P>
He urged the countries to take advantage of the relative
political stability prevailing in the region by consoldating
economic ties through creation of conditions that allowed free
flow of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Dissatisfied With Duma's Decision on Fleet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Parliamentary Chairman
Alexander Moroz said today Russian Duma's ban on the division of
the Black Sea Fleet was a reaction to the proposed eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Moroz made the remarks when meeting the visiting Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy. He said the Duma's decision was
also a reaction to Ukraine's desire to move closer to the NATO.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, voted on
Wednesday to halt division of the Black Sea Fleet, one day before
government delegations from the two countries were to negotiate on
the division.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said Russia was trying to strengthen the Black Sea Fleet
to confront the NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision of the Duma violates the international law
and has no legal effect on Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Moroz said he believed that the bill passed by the Duma would
not get support from the Federal Council, the upper house of the
Russian parliament, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin would not
sign it either.
</P>
<P>
Moroz was also reported to have told the Swedish Ambassador to
Ukraine that the decision of the Duma had interfered with
Ukraine's internal affairs.

JOHANNESBURG, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Pieter Botha was today summoned to the court by a penal

</P>

This follows his implication by a former police commissioner

Retired General Johan Merwe told the Amnesty Committee of the

</P>
<P>
Vlok again made it clear today that the orders came from
Botha, who was president of the country between 1984 and 1989, at

UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and Cameroon President Paul Biya discussed
Wednesday the current tension in eastern Zaire between the
Banyamulenge and Zaire forces, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.

<P>
Speaking at the noon briefing today, spokeswoman Silvana Foa

They encouraged the authorities of the region to resume the
dialogue and to strive for a lasting and peaceful solution to
ensure the stability of that area of strategic importance for the
African continent as a whole.

concerned in achieving peace and security, including the convening
of a conference for peace, security and development in the Great

<HEADLINE> Hariri Again Designated Lebanon's Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Rafik al-Hariri, who was twice
designated prime minister separately in October 1992 and in May
1995, was entrusted this evening by President Elias Hrawi to head
the next government, House Speaker Nabih Berri announced.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting at the Beirut Presidential Palace in the presence
of the house speaker, the president informed Hariri of the decision,
Berri told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started immediately after the incumbent Sunni Moslem
prime minister came back at 4:45 p.m. (14:45 GMT) from a brief
visit to Damascus where he held a meeting with Syrian President
Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's government resigned on October 15 to make way for the
formation of a new one, and the president asked it to carry on
official functions in a caretaker capacity until the new
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected parliament Tuesday voted for a renewal of the
four-year mandate for incumbent House Speaker Nabih Berri, making
him the second among the country's three top leaders, better-known
as "troika."
</P>
<P>
After modifying the constitution, which had banned the
re-election of the president or extension of his term, the
parliament gave Hrawi a three-year extension of his presidency
last November.
</P>
<P>
The Maronite Catholic president, who has the constitutional
right to name a prime minister, conducted Wednesday and Thursday
consultations with all the members of the 128-seat parliament,
from which the new government must win a confidence.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, some 100 deputies expressed their
support for the nomination of Hariri as head of the next
government, official sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon with a 35,000-strong
force deployed on two-thirds of Lebanon's lands, has evidently
approved the choice.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi held a meeting with Syrian President Assad in Damascus
Tuesday and the formation of the new Lebanese government was
reportedly on the top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the nomination was announced only a
couple of hours before the arrival of French President Jacques
Chirac, who is on a tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
Personal friendship between Chirac an Hariri is an overt secret
and France has repeatedly expressed its desire to see a continuity
of the reconstruction process in Lebanon, masterminded by
billionaire Prime Minister Hariri, "regardless of the circumstances
in the region.''
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who has headed two cabinets since October 1992, is
expected to have greater influence in parliament thanks to the
overwhelming victories scored by supporters of his Syrian-backed
government in the August-September general elections.
</P>
<P>
He won his first parliamentary seat in the Beirut constituency
and became the head of a bloc of about 20 deputies, one of the
biggest in the unicameral house.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to facilitate approval of projects in his
multi-billion-dollar plan to rebuild Lebanon. The plan was impeded
by the previous parliament in which Hariri had fewer supporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite working to strengthen the Lebanese currency and boost
international confidence in postwar Lebanon, Hariri has been
accused of sinking the country into debt by borrowing on the
international markets to finance the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
Critics also say he has no social policy that takes into
account the situation of the poor, but Hariri has repeatedly said
the new government must give top priority to resolving social
problems.

<P>
AMMAN, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein and French
President Jacques Chirac asserted here today the need to
safeguard the Middle East peace process and make all possible
efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders told reporters at their joint press conference
at the Royal Palace here that the two countries' stands on the
future of the Middle East peace process were "identical."
</P>
<P>
President Chirac pledged that Jordan and France, which share
the same view on the peace process, will make utmost and
concerted efforts to restart the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The president said he briefed the king on the outcome of his
visits to Syria, Israel, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of
Ramallah. He also expressed his satisfaction over his visit to
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The king said it has been a life-long struggle to achieve
peace, adding that he believes peace is in the hearts of
overwhelming majority of the people, not only in Jordan,
Palestine and Israel, but also elsewhere throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein promised that he would do everything possible to
achieve a peace based on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
On the Jerusalem issue, the king said the basic article in the
Jordanian-Israel peace treaty, which was signed on October 26,
1994, is that Jordan has a special role in the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue of Jerusalem will be discussed
in the final status negotiations between the Palestinians and
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders paid tribute to the Jordanian-French relations
that have been strengthened in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Chirac concluded his two-day official visit to Jordan after
the press conference and left Amman for Beirut for his fifth leg
of his six-nation tour in region.

<P>
DAMASCUS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Abdulla al-Ahmar, Assistant
Secretary General of Syria's ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party,
met here today with a visiting delegation of the Communist Party
of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, al-Ahmar hailed the ties of friendship
between Syria and China at the party and government levels,
expressing Syria's desire to further strengthen the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He lauded China's stance on supporting the just Arab cause to
restore the occupied Arab territories, including the Golan Heights
which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmar said the Middle East peace process is experiencing a
stalemate on account of the policies by the Israeli government and
its anti-peace practices.

Underlining Syria's adherence to peace, al-Ahmar said that
Syria is keen on the establishment of a just and comprehensive
peace on the basis of international legitimacy and the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded a complete Israeli withdrawal from the
 Golan, south Lebanon and the Palestinian territories to pave the
way for establishing an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the international community and the
U.N. Security Council to exercise pressure on Israel to commit
itself to relevant U.N. resolutions and the establishment of a
just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Huang Huang, head of the CPC delegation, said the Chinese party
and government will continue to support the just struggle of the
Arab people as well as Syria's just stance. He said that China is

<HEADLINE> Situation in Eastern Zaire Still Tense: UN Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The situation in eastern
Zaire is extremely confusing, tense and volatile, said Silvana
Foa, spokeswoman for the U.N. secretary-general at a noon briefing
today.
</P>
<P>
The movement of the U.N. staff is severely restricted, she
said, making it very difficult for the U.N. to confirm anything.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, Zairean soldiers had conflicts
with armed groups infiltrated from its neighboring countries,
which sparked a mass exodus of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The new fighting seemed to be centered 30 kilometers south of
Bukavu, capital of Kivu, which reported a tense combat this
morning, Foa said. There are about 80 international staff still
gathering at the U.N. compound there, she added.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night on the road leading to Bukavu, a security
contingent hired by the U.N. to protect the refugee camps was
ambushed and there are unconfirmed reports that a number of the
soldiers were killed and a certain number were taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
She said that U.N. vehicles were grabbed as some civilians
tried to flee the town.
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed reports from Bujumbura, a town of
Burundi on the eastern side of the border with Zaire, people could
hear the sounds of aircraft and large explosions across the border
of Uvira. Local people believed there were large scales of
fighting in Uvira, according to the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that about 300,000 refugees had fled
camps along the Zairean border. Twenty-one out of 50 camps are now
practically empty. U.N. staff members, more than 200 in all along
the border areas, warn that food is running short as more Zairean
civilians start to join the refugees.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Welcomes European Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has expressed his belief that Europe is possibly playing
an "important role" in the peace process in the middle east,
the state-run Radio Lebanon reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was quoted as saying that "the peace needs different
views and new ideas and participation (of various parties) in the
political, economic and cultural aspects."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Radio France International on the eve
of French President Jacques Chirac's arrival in Beirut, Hariri
said that Arab countries, especially Lebanon, welcome the role
which Europe can play in the region.
</P>
<P>
They "want Europe to play a role more effective and stronger
than what it played before," the prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
"A role of Europe, especially France, in the Middle East
peace process does not mean a cancel of the role of the major
partner, namely the United States, in the process, but will be a
supplementary role, particularly France Knows the region better
than other countries," the Lebanese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived here from Amman this evening on the fourth leg
of his tour in the region, which is aimed at seeking a more
significant European role in the Middle East peacemaking.

<HEADLINE> Amhara Sacks Its General Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Amhara National
Democratic Movement (ANDM), one of the ruling parties, today
dismissed Tamirat Layne as its General Secretary and member of
the central committee, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the ANDM said its central
committee in an emergency meeting held on Tuesday decided that
Tamirat should not continue as an activist in the ANDM as he
behaved contrary to its discipline.
</P>
<P>
It is the strong conviction of the ANDM central committee
that there are no grounds for Tamirat who failed to
discipline himself to discharge his responsibilities to continue
with the high post in the government and as the representative of
the ANDM in parliament, it said.
</P>
<P>
ANDM hopes that Tamirat would correct its mistakes on time as
a political activist and had untirelessly attempted to correct
the repeated undisciplinary acts of its former general secretary
but in vain. It did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Tamirat, as Prime Minister in the transitional government
during 1991 and 1995, was elected as Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Defense in August, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
(Eprdf) is made up by four parts -- the Tigray People's
Liberation Front (Eplf), the ANDM, the Oromo People's Democratic
Organization (OPDO) and the Southern Ethiopian People's
Democratic Front (Sepdf).
</P>
<P>
Eprdf has so far made no comment on the move by the ANDM. But,
well-informed sources here said the ruling Eprdf will announce
its attitude later.

NICOSIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here today Services in Cyprus have grown into a
dynamic and increasingly important economic sector, resulting in
the export of more and more services to central and eastern
Europe and the Middle East.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Reform Party
presidential nominee Ross Perot today rejected his Republican
counterpart Bob Dole's effort to persuade him to quit the
presidential race and endorse the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
"Do I intend to campaign to the bitter end? Yes." Perot said
during a luncheon speech at the National Press Club in
Washington D.C. He called the Republicans' effort "weird and
totally inconsequential."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Perot's Reform Party running mate, Pat Choate, urged
Republicans to support the Reform Party ticket. "When he knows he
can't win, he asks us to bow out of the race," Choate said.
</P>
<P>
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed made the urgent entreaty at
a meeting with Perot in Dallas, Texas, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Political analists say that Dole's appeal to Perot shows the
frustration within the Dole camp as the campaign entered the final
12 days with Clinton comfortably ahead in national polls.
</P>
<P>
A new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, for example, had Clinton at
52 percent, Dole at 35 percent and Perot at 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to Become Stronger for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Resident Coordinator of
the U.N. system in Tanzania J. Victor Angelo today said for the
United Nations to be an effective force for peace it has to
become stronger for development.
</P>
<P>
The Coordinator of the U.N. system was speaking during a flag
raising ceremony to mark the 51st anniversary of the U.N. held at
the Karimjee Hall grounds in the city, which was attended by
diplomatic envoys accredited to Tanzania and the general public.
</P>
<P>
Angelo said a total of 79 out of 82 conflicts in the world
over the past three years took place within nations themselves
and 90 percent of the casualties have been civilians.
</P>
<P>
He said these conflicts required development upstream and not
soldiers downstream.
</P>
<P>
"They call for a strengthening of the U.N.'s role in
development, not for drastic cuts in funds for fighting poverty,"
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Angelo called on the international organization to focus its
attention and resources on poverty eradication and conflict
resolution.
</P>
<P>
He said serious consideration must be given to far-reaching
reforms in order to make the institution more accountable,
efficient and transparent.
</P>
<P>
These reforms should be coupled with other changes that build
stronger, better funded world organizations capable of
contributing importantly to the challenges of the new century, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator said the U.N. has to be able to move early to
act properly to land development now instead of soldiers later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Bakari Mwapachu urged the governments of Burundi and
Rwanda to create requisite conditions for the early return of
their refugees.
</P>
<P>
He also urged international organizations to redouble their
efforts in creating the necessary conditions for the smooth
repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acting foreign minister appealed to the
international community to share the burden of protecting and
facilitating the voluntary repatriation of the refugees as well
as rendering assistance to local communities hosting them.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Vows to Liberate Israeli-occupied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Rafik Hariri, who was
designated today by President Elias Hrawi to head his third
government, vowed to continue the efforts to liberate a southern
Lebanon border strip occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the designation at the end of a meeting with Hrawi
and House Speaker Nabih Berri, Hariri stressed that he would make
efforts to "liberate the Israeli-occupied Lebanese lands and
consolidate a Lebanese role in the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said that these tasks would be fulfilled only "through a
permanent coordination with Syria and its leaders."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the accusation that his previous government had
ignored the situation of the poor in its social policy, the
billionaire prime minister said that his new government would
"give a priority to the social affairs in the wide-scale process
of rebuilding the country."
</P>
<P>
He said that he would work to maintain a cooperation between
the government and the parliament "for the sake of the national
interests."
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Berri, on the other hand, noted a continuous
cooperation between the government and parliament in the past
four years, saying that the legislative and executive authorities
would "cooperate more and more" in the future.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the three top leaders and parliamentary
deputies would hold consultations on the formation of the new
government at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third government headed by Hariri after he
was designed the prime minister in October 1992 and May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut Presidential Palace said in a decree that the
President, after consulting with the house speaker, the prime
minister as well as parliamentary deputies, "informed Hariri at
5:25 p.m. (15:25 GMT) Thursday the decision entrusting him to
form the new government."
</P>
<P>
The meeting in the presidential palace started after the
incumbent Sunni Moslem Prime minister came back at 4:45
p.m. (14:45 GMT) from a prompt visit to Damascus where he held a
meeting with Syrian president Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's last government resigned on October 15 to make way
for the formation of the new one, and the president asked it to
carry on official functions in a caretaker capacity until the new
government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon with a 35,000-strong
force deployed on two-thirds of Lebanon's land, has evidently
approved the choice.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi held a meeting with Syrian President al-Assad in
Damascus Tuesday and the formation of the new Lebanese government
was reportedly on top of the agenda.

<HEADLINE> French Police Intensify Crackdown on Corsican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- French police have lately
intensified their crackdown on Corsican nationalists with a dozen
arrests made to bring to justice those who blew up part of the
mayoral office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe early this month.
</P>
<P>
The front of the office building of the French paramilitary
police of gendamerie in Bonifacio, South Corsica, was targeted by
gun fires this afternoon, gendamerie sources said.
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which did not kill or injure anyone, took place
after the paramilitary police detained two unidentified Corsicans
in Bonifacio this morning in a raid to arrest suspects involved in
the bomb attack on the mayoral office of Bordeaux on October 5.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack, which seriously damaged the reception room of
the city hall of Bordeaux, was claimed by the Corsican nationalist
group the National Liberation Front of Corsica, FLNC-Canal
Historique.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other people, arrested by police over the bomb attack in
earlier police operations, were questioned today by a rotating
commission headed by Paris Investigation Judge Jean-Louis
Bruguiere, who is in charge of anti-terrorist files.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police launched a large-scale operation this morning
in both Corsica and in continental France to search for suspects
involved in the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Among the people questioned today were several from the same
Cantara family in Bonifacio, who were close to Francois Santoni,
the leader of the FLNC-Canal Historique, which have been fighting
for the independence of the Mediterranean island from France for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
Judicial police, assisted by the elite police unit of RAID,
have been launching several operations in search of the
nationalists in Bordeaux, Marseille and Bonifacio, as Prime
Minister Alain Juppe, who is also the mayor of Bordeaux, has vowed
to "apply the law" upon the Corsican nationalists.
</P>
<P>
Before it attacked the mayoral office of Bordeaux, the
FLNC-Canal Historique launched a series of bombing attacks against
the offices of the local deputies of Corsica, who had called on
Juppe to carry out a tougher line against the nationalists.
</P>
<P>
The FLNC-Canal Historique accused Juppe of "having denied the
existence of the Corsican people and closed the door upon all the
big progress" made in the past several years over the autonomy of
Corsica.
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated development, two major cities of Corsica,
Bastia and Ajaccio, were deprived of electricity power for several
hours this morning because of a strike staged by the staff of an
electricity company who were protesting the failure by the
government to observe their promise of creating 20 more jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides today sent his reply letter to Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to disclose the content of the
letter, but he said it is in line with decisions made by
the National Council, the top advisory body to the president
on handling the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash sent a 33-page letter to Clerides on September
22 in reply to a first letter sent by President Clerides
urging him to accept his proposal for the island's complete
demilitarization. Denktash rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' first letter followed the killings of two Greek
Cypriot protesters in the buffer zone by Turkish troops
in August.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said today that he will meet National Guard
Commander Lieutenant General Nicolaos Vorvolakos to discuss the
military dialogue, which is expected to start next week, between
National Guard officers and Turkish army officers.
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted an indirect military dialogue based on
the provisions of 1996 U.N. Security Council resolution 1062,"
Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1062 calls upon the military authorities on both
sides to enter immediately into discussions with the
U.N. peace-keeping forces on the island to clear all minefields
and booby-trapped areas inside the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and seized the northern third of the
island following an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. troops have been patrolling along the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone, separating the Turkish troops from
the Greek Cypriot National Guards.

there which is greatly endangered by the on-going fighting between
Zairean troops and the Banyamurenges, the ethnic Tutsis living in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The violences which have already thrown more than 250,000

</P>
<P>
The ministry said that the team of experts, which is already

refugees and 10,000 local villagers, are fleeing the fighting in
eastern Zaire.
</P>

in liaison with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Ajello, who met with Zairean officials in Brussels today on the

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- African women leaders
should have more confidence and capability in using the media to
address development issues and reach the grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Director for
Africa, Marie-Angelique Savane, told a press conference here
today that the media was a vital equipment for achieving
developmental goals.
</P>
<P>
"I highly expect that the second regional conference of
African women ministers and parliamentarians, which starts
tomorrow in Dar es Salaam, would help empower women ministers and
parliamentarians ability to face the media," she said.
</P>
<P>
Citing women in Asia as an example, she said that Asian women
have access to information and are therefore more empowered.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa we mostly find passive members of parliament as
they are not empowered to be active enough to challenge the whole
process of development," Savane argued.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Kurdish Rivals in Northern Iraq to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey called on two rival
Kurdish factions in northern Iraq to implement a cease-fire to
avoid increasing instability in the region, according to a
statement from the Turkish Foreign Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey urged the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) and its rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) to
prepare the necessary environment for talks to be held in Ankara
in the coming days in a bid to implement the cease-fire, which was
declared at midnight Wednesday .
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes between the rival factions of the KDP and
PUK erupted when the former's leader Massoud Barzani, backed by
Iraqi troops, took over northern Iraq in a move which triggered
U.S. missile attack on Iraqi defense targets early September.
</P>
<P>
The PUK retaliated two weeks later and recaptured some of its
lost towns.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the KDP and PUK have reportedly agreed in
principle to a cease-fire in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey pursues an active diplomacy to re-establish stability
in northern Iraq and wishes that reconciliation should be gained
immediately among all the groups living in northern Iraq within
the framework of Iraq's territorial integrity, sovereignty and
political unity which Turkey has supported from the beginning,"
the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
"With this, Turkey expects proper atmosphere to be created for
the implementation of the 986 Resolution of the U.N. Security
Council," it said.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. resolution 986, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months in exchange for food
and medicine for its sanction-hit people.

<HEADLINE> Developing States Urged to Stop Experting Raw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending a
seminar on the present world trade system have urged developing
countries to stop exporting raw materials or semi-finished goods
to developed countries to avoid being further exploited.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania News Agency (SHIHATA) quoted participants as
saying in the seminar on Uruguay Round results today that by
continued export of raw material or semi-finished products to
developed countries, the exporters would be gaining nothing
except loss and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from government, public and private institutions
elaborated that prices offered for raw materials like cotton, are
always low but importing countries make big business out of the
importation of raw materials and exports of finished products to
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, especially those from Africa never give
the price of their produce (raw material like cotton) which is an
indication of unfair deal to them.
</P>
<P>
The experts insisted that developed countries are buying raw
material at unbelievably low prices and after processing them,
they have been sold to developing countries at unreasonably high
prices and making big profits margins.
</P>
<P>
To rectify the situation, the participants called upon
developing countries to sell their products or commodities after
processing them.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their concern that deteriorating trade in
developing countries is being enhanced by developed nations which
dominate the entire business.
</P>
<P>
The seminar with 60 participants is organized by the Ministry
of Industry and Trade and has discussed various subjects
including trade policy review mechanism, overview of the
multilateral trade system, agreement on textiles and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements are on import licensing, anti-dumping
measures and general agreement on trade services.
</P>
<P>
The facilitators to seminar come from the World Trade
Organization (WTO), U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) and the International Trade Center (ITC).

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Supports NGO Involvement in Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGO) could play an important role in monitoring
and assessing the social and environmental impact of the Lesotho
Highlands Water Project, South African Water Affairs Minister
Kader Asmal said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the tenth anniversary celebrations of the joint
South African and Lesotho project in Cape Town, Asmal said the
image of the project had been tarnished by complaints about
progress and the implementation of some social and environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Asmal suggested that a community advisory
office staffed by the NGOs be established in the project area to
act as an intermediary between the affected people and the
Lesotho Highlands authority.
</P>
<P>
The office could help local people understand their rights,
formulate and present their claims, complaints and suggestions,
and help communicate with local communities.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said he had already instructed the South African
delegates in the Joint Permanent Technical Commission to ensure
that outstanding claims from people who felt they had suffered
because of the project or had not been properly compensated were
dealt with "fairly and compassionately".
</P>
<P>
He said the Lesotho and South African governments, by working
closely with NGOs, could develop a process through which local
communities could take part in project discussions and decisions
that had a direct impact on their lives. enditem

companies are the strongest statement that they have faith in
post-1997 Hong Kong and we entirely agree. We are working in close
collaboration with our customers to ensure that our new products
meet the demanding requirements for service in Hong Kong," he
said.
</P>
<P>

minister and member of the parliament for disciplinary reasons,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported tonight.

has unanimously voted for the decision of the Central Committee

Tamirat from his post as the general secretary of the ANDM, as a
member of the Central Committee and as its representative in the

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Vital for Economy: Egyptian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said today the private sector is playing a basic and
pivotal role in making investments and expanding exports.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prime minister made the remarks in an address read
out on his behalf at the inaugural session of the Conference on
the Management of Investments and Exports here.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has become a basic partner of the state and
contributed more than 50 percent to Egypt's development plan,
el-Ganzouri said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government in the coming stage would
concentrate on expanding the base of ownership and the
participation of the private sector in the development plan as
well as activating the role of the burgeoning stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government would go all out to
create a favorable environment for investors by adopting
legislations aimed at easing restrictions on investment.
</P>
<P>
It would also offer additional incentives to encourage
investment and export, open new horizons for investments in major
national projects and set up new urban communities and tourist
cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Egypt has sold more than 1 billion U.S. dollars
worth of assets in line with the economic reform in the early
1990s. Seventy percent of them have consisted of shares in public
sector firms offered through the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, about 90 firms are to be sold to
generate 4 billion to 5 billion dollars, according to el-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
The private sector turned out 63 percent of Egypt's Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1994/95, which totaled 14.6 billion
Egyptian pounds (about 4.3 billion dollars), while the public
sector took up the remaining 37 percent, according to a report
by the Central Bank of Egypt.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Education
Joseph Kamotho said here today that for the democratization
process to be successful it must have root in the cultural set-up
of any nation without interference from the outside.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when he received three members
of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral
Assistant.
</P>
<P>
Democratization process cannot be the same globally because
different countries have different cultural backgrounds, said
Kamotho, adding that Kenya was practising democracy according to
its cultural set-up.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the democratization and electioneering processes
in the country, he noted that Kenya was willing to be assisted in
the fields, but would not allow anybody interfering in its
internal affairs, particularly the political affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official pointed out that his country had overcome
many challenges in the democratization process since independence
especially in the introduction of multi-party system into the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho said that during the single party regime, it was
individual verse individual and now it was party against party.
</P>
<P>
He accused opposition parties in the east African country of
engaging in confrontational politics since they lost the general
election in l992.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is scheduled to hold its second multi-party general
election next year.

<HEADLINE> Economic Development to Lead Increase in Social Product </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Prime Minister Mirko
Marjanovic said Thursday that accelerated economic development
could in two years bring about an increase of the per capita
social product from 1,600 U.S. dollars to over 2,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The essential goals of Yugoslavia's overall strategy is
accelerated development and full opening to the world in the best
way for realizing development potentials, Marjanovic said during a
cabinet meeting in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Due to the U.N. sanctions, per capita income is now 1,000 U.S.
dollars, half of what it was in 1987. Foreign debt stands at about
8 billion dollars, and half of workforce is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic policy for 1997, Marjanovic said the
goals must remain the same -- the stability of prices and the
exchange rate of the national currency Dinar, growth of production
and exports, structural changes and improvement of the standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
Dinar has been fairly stable since late last year when it was
devaluated from one dinar one D-mark to 3.3 Dinar one mark. The
annual inflation rate is estimated at about 100 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"A strict policy of budgetary restraint will also be followed
next year, in order to reduce public spendings to about 43 percent
of the social product," he said.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Existing Homes in US Down in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. declined by 2.9 percent in September but
continued to drive toward a new annual record.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors said today that sales
of existing single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 4.02
million annual rate, down from 4.14 million in August.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth straight decline but still was the seventh
consecutive month that sales of previously owned home have topped
the 4 million rate.
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled 3.80 million in 1995. The record was 3.98 million
set in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the Northeast posted a 5.3 percent sales increase
and sales inched up 0.7 percent in the south. However, sales fell
by 13.4 percent in the West and down by 3.7 percent in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe the sales of existing homes will hold
steady or even spur renewed growth as mortgage rates in the U.S.
have been falling recently.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.23 percent in
September, up from 8 percent in August but below July's average of
8.25 percent. They averaged just 7.86 percent this week.
</P>
<P>
The national median price of an existing home was 117,700
dollars in September, down from 122,300 dollars in August but
still higher than the price of 114,800 dollars a year earlier. The
median is the midpoint, meaning half of the homes cost more and
half cost less.

<HEADLINE> Rosenbluth International Keen on China Travel Management Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The US's Rosenbluth
International, the world's third largest corporate travel
management company, announced today that it is to join China
Merchants International Travel Company in a partnership agreement
to provide full-scale travel management services for China.
</P>
<P>
Hal F. Rosenbluth, president and CEO of the company, revealed
Rosenbluth International's investment plans in China at a news
conference today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
This is the second project funded by Rosenbluth International
in China, following a joint venture cooperatively set up with
Shanghai Spring International in Shanghai in 1995 to facilitate
business and leisure travel in and out of Shanghai and the US.
</P>
<P>
High-speed development of China's economy, and deepening of the
country's reform, and opening wider to the outside world, is
encouraging large numbers of multinational companies to swarm into
Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the country has a growing demand for travel
management services for the big corporations, said Rosenbluth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to projects in Beijing and Shanghai, Rosenbluth
intends to expand its business in other Chinese cities and
regions, to help personnel in tourism understand and accept
travel management principles, and to develop China's tourism
markets.
</P>
<P>
Except for hotels and restaurants, China has few projects
cooperating with overseas partners in tourism. The country, as
part of its overall reforms, is working more with overseas
companies in travel management services to develop its tourism
trade.
</P>
<P>
Based in Philadelphia, Rosenbluth International is a
privately-owned company, offering comprehensive corporate, leisure
and meeting travel services.

<HEADLINE> Injury Forces Chen Lu to Quit Asian Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China's Chen Lu, champion
of '95 World Figure Skating Championships in Birmingham, England,
was forced to pull out of the Asian Figure Skating Championships
by foot injury on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Chen had a recurring problem of feet injury in her training
and that forced her to quit this championships," said Mr. Ren
Hongguo, manager of the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
"But that would not rule her out of the Skate Canda next
month," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's absence from the championships would be a blow to her
fans in the capital city. Chen said: "It's a pitty that I could
not take part in the competition. But I will have an exhibition
on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Chen had been forced to quit the '94 World Championships for
feet injury after taking a bronze medal at the Lillehammer Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ito Midori, a top skater in women's individual event,
gave the organizers another blow when she decided to give up the
championships.
</P>
<P>
Ona Nagahisa, leader of the Japanese delegation, explained:
"She did not have a good training recently and she will return to
competition in late November."
</P>
<P>
In the day's short program competitions, China's Li Chengjiang
and Arakawa Shiauka of Japan led the men's and women's individuals
respectively.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Durable Goods Orders Up Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Orders for durable goods in
the U.S. shot up by 4.6 percent in September, the steepest jump in
nearly four years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods last month
totaled a record seasonally adjusted 174.1 billion dollars,
compared with 166.4 billion in August. It was the largest increase
since a 7.8 percent jump in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
Much of the advance was due to a rebound in aircraft orders.
But excluding the transportation component, orders were up by 0.9
percent, the fifth increase in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
The report said that transportation orders jumped 17.5 percent,
the first increase since May and just the third this year. More
than half of the increase was due to aircraft orders, but demand
for automobiles also rose.
</P>
<P>
Demand for communications gear helped boost orders for
electronic and other electrical equipment 1.9 percent after
falling 5.2 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
But orders for industrial machinery and equipment declined 0.9
percent on top of a 0.8 percent dip a month earlier. Tickets for
primary metals were down 1.7 percent after slipping 4 percent in
August.
</P>
<P>
These orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand
and modernize and have been a major source of economic strength
during the current expansion.
</P>
<P>
Unfilled orders rose 0.7 percent, the fourth increase in the
last five months. A rising backlog could mean businesses will have
to increase production and manpower to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, grew 1.4 percent, the
third consecutive increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the sharp increase of orders for durable
goods is raising questions about the extent to which the U.S.
economy is slowing.

<HEADLINE> Water Conservancy Strategically Important: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
that water conservancy construction is a pressing task in
economic and social development, and is strategically important
for future development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a national water conservancy meeting in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at mobilizing all the social forces to
push water conservancy construction to a new height.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that since its founding, China has made
tremendous achievements in water conservancy construction, which
has played a significant role in promoting industrial and
agriculture production, in resisting floods and droughts, and in
protecting people and their properties.
</P>
<P>
However, floods have long been a problem plaguing the Chinese
nation, and are far from being averted. The focal point lies in
retarded water conservancy construction, which makes China weak in
withstanding natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that governments at all levels should take an
earnest approach towards water conservancy construction, and make
a remarkable progress in improving anti-flood capacity within the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should make hard efforts to strengthen the
construction of irrigation and water conservancy projects, and
always guard against floods and droughts, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is necessary to economize on water,
control water pollution, and boost water-conservancy construction
by adopting applicable technologies.
</P>
<P>
The premier called upon all governments to take practical
measures to increase investment in water conservancy construction,
and raise the necessary funds from the central and local
governments, collectives, and even individuals, in order to keep
water conservancy construction abreast with economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to develop water conservancy
construction, so that an industrial policy can be formulated in
line with the requirements of socialist market economy, he said
</P>
<P>
He noted officials in some localities and departments failed to
pay much attention to water conservancy work, and warned that the
trend must come to an end, otherwise the on-going modernization
drive will suffer from the impact of unharmonious development
between water conservancy and economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Li added those officials who ignore water conservancy
construction, and have caused losses to the people and their
properties, will be criticized and punished if the problems are
serious.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun said at the meeting that efforts
will be made to build an effective, reliable, advanced and
practical anti-flood system, covering the country's seven big
rivers, and major anti-flood areas in five years.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Calm returned to the streets
of St. Petersburg in Florida early today after a night of rioting
sparked by a white officer's shooting to death a black man, local
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The city is very calm right now," Police Chief Darrel Stephens
told news reporters in the morning. "No new incidents have taken
place."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of angry youth ran into the streets, throwing rocks,
bricks and bottles at officers in riot gear and setting fire to
vehicles and buildings hours after the shooting in a predominantly
black neighborhood south of downtown.
</P>
<P>
At least 11 people were injured, including a police officer who
was shot and a newspaper photographer who was beaten during the
riot and confrontation between the crowds and police.
</P>
<P>
Set on fire were 28 buildings, including a police substation
and a post office. Burned vehicles included a police cruiser and a
TV news truck.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that 20 people were arrested and police
planned to work 12-hour shifts and step up patrols today.

The riot started after two officers stopped a car with two
people inside. One of the officers, Jim Knight, opened fire,
striking the driver, after the car lurched forward. Police said
the driver was apparently trying to run the officer over.

<HEADLINE> Dayawan Nuclear Power Station Passes Safety Appraisal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Dayawan Nuclear Power Station,
one of China's two operating nuclear power stations in southern
Guangdong province, passed a safety appraisal by a team from the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the station has been checked on its
operational safety by the international organization since it
started business operation in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) of IAEA, invited by
the Chinese government, a member to IAEA, has made a three-week
examination, and concluded that the power station is operating
strictly in accordance with international safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The power station underwent a review of its management,
training and qualification recognition, operation, maintenance,
technical support, radiation prevention and protection, and
emergency measures, by the inspection team consisting of 16
specialists from the United States, Britain, Hungary, the
Netherlands, and several other countries.
</P>
<P>
The head of the team, K. Hide, said the team was greatly
impressed with the open and candid manner of the staff of the
station, who were eager to listen to suggestions for innovation
from the team.
</P>
<P>
He said IAEA will submit to the Chinese government a detailed
technical report on the appraisal in three months.
</P>
<P>
According to Hide, OSART reviews are aimed at promoting
information flow of advanced experiences, raising innovation
proposals, to improve the overall operational standards of nuclear
powers stations in all IAEA member states.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of the review showed that Dayawan Nuclear Power
Station is under a strict international monitoring system to
ensure its safety, apart from its own complex safety equipment,
sophisticated design and a qualified staff, according to Liu
Xicai, general manager of Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Company.
</P>
<P>
IAEA sponsored two pre-OSART reviews, and a technical exchange
for production preparation, before the station went into
operation, and also several later training courses.
</P>
<P>
Specialists from the station have been sent to participate in
nuclear safety activities organized by IAEA.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the international exchanges have been of great help to
the improvement of the station's management and safe operation
standards.
</P>
<P>
By October 24, the station had provided 9.3 billion
kilowatts-hours to power grids, with this year's total amount
expected to be up to between 10-15 billion kilowatts-hours.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Textile Firm Auctioned Off in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A large state-owned textile
enterprise, which had been running in the red for 26 months, was
sold by auction today in Taiyuan, capital city of Shanxi Province
in north China.
</P>
<P>
It is one of the biggest State-owned enterprises to go under
the hammer in China so far, fetching a price of 486 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Textile, Dyeing and Printing Factory, with 15,000
workers and fixed assets of 480 million yuan, was declared
bankrupt on September 30 by a local court.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which was once listed among the country's top 500
large enterprises for four consecutive years, had handed over to
the state 670 million yuan in profits and taxes over the past 40
years.
</P>
<P>
However, it was ran into trouble due to rapid market changes
and misconduct in management since 1993. As a result, the factory
accumulated a total liability of 780 million yuan, and a ratio of
assets and liabilities of up to 180.88 percent before it offered
for auction.
</P>
<P>
Taiyuan Cotton Textile State Assets Management Corporation, the
buyer, has pledged to invest 90 million yuan to inject new life
into the factory.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the bankrupt enterprise began living on unemployment
benefits from today.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Reports Continued Destruction of Bosnian Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- An apparently tit-for-tat
destruction of Muslim and Serb houses occurred Thursday in the
western part of Bosnia, the NATO-led peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to IFOR spokesman Major Simon Haselock, 51 Muslim
houses which had been war-damaged and abandoned in villages
southwest of Prijedor were blown up to rubbles with anti-tank
mines early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Then in the afternoon, 30 uninhabited Serb houses in an area 12
kilometers southeast of Prijedor were gutted by fire. Both areas
are in the the zone of separation which divides Bosnia into the
Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of abandoned houses near Prijedor has followed
similar actions in other sections of the dimilitarized zone such
as Zvornik and Doboj.
</P>
<P>
Haselock said that the IFOR has yet to know who should be
responsible for the the explosion and arson near Prijedor.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a disturbing trend on the use of fear and
intimidation in the areas that are not inhabitable at present,"
the IFOR spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly designed to keep fear alive and to intimidate
displaced people who may have wished to return to their former
homes."

<HEADLINE> Chen Muhua Meets Women Delegation from HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met
today in Beijing with a delegation from the Professional Women and
Entrepreneurs Association of Hong Kong, led by its honorary
president Annie Suk Ching Wu.
</P>
<P>
Chen, also president of the All-China Women's Federation,
expressed welcome the delegates on the first visit of the
association since its establishment this September, saying that
Hong Kong's return to the motherland is the people's will and the
trend of the time.
</P>
<P>
She said it is only just over 240 days before China resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee to be established shoulders the dual
tasks of choosing the candidates of the first chief executive and
the provisional legislature of the SAR, which means that the Hong
Kong people will truly and democratically participate in political
and government affairs, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She hoped the visiting women delegates will closely unite
people in various social circles of Hong Kong, and continue to
contribute to maintaining stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,
and promote exchanges between women from China's inland areas and
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also member of National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said the main purpose
of establishing her association was to serve as a bridge for
economic co-operation between Hong Kong and the inland areas, and
play a more significant role in promoting the social status of Hong
Kong women.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Policeman Admits Shooting Police Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese police officer, a
member of the Aum Shinrikyo religious sect, has reportedly
admitted shooting a police chief in March 1995 in an assassination
attempt following the deadly sarin gas attacks in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old policeman from the Metropolitan Police
Department told interrogators that on orders from a senior Aum
member, he shot Takaji Kunimatsu, head of the National Police
Agency (NPA), with a gun he obtained from another cult member,
local press quoted police sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I shot him," sources quoted the officer as telling police.
</P>
<P>
Details of the officer's admission were not available and there
were some unclear points in his statements, police said.
</P>
<P>
Hiroyuki Kurata, chief of the National Public Safety Commission
and Home Affairs Minister, said at an informal cabinet meeting
earlier today, that the police officer was being questioned, and
that his name had been found on a list of Aum members, Foreign
Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Kurata was quoted as refusing to provide details, on
grounds that investigations were still under way and there was no
proof that the policeman shot Kunimatsu.
</P>
<P>
On March 30 last year, Kunimatsu was shot by a masked man from
a distance of 20 meters in a suspected terrorist attack as he left
his condominium in Tokyo for work.
</P>
<P>
Kunimatsu was taken to hospital unconscious, but recovered
after undergoing an eight-hour emergency operation. He resumed his
official duties 70 days later.

<HEADLINE> China to Joint Hands with Overseas IT Companies to Develop Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China's State Information
Center has joined with three computer giants to give a boost to
Chinese people wanting to surf the world on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
US-based Hayes (Asia Pacific) Company, Microsoft (China)
Company, and Hong Kong-funded Stone Rich Sight Company, announced
today that they are joining with the State Information Center in a
unique cooperation arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The parties will provide full-scale solutions to problems for
China's Internet users in order to promote the development of the
country's information technology industry.
</P>
<P>
Low speeds in information transmission, lack of high-quality
information services offered in Chinese, as well as relatively
higher costs for hooking up to the Internet, have had a negative
influence on China's Internet Development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing Chinese clients with the most advanced
modem to help speed up information transmission, Hayes will
cooperate with the other three parties to develop a special VCD,
which contains Hayes' digital telecommunication software,
Microsoft's Chinese-version netscape software, and Stone Rich
Sight's Chinese tool software, as well as access to China Economic
Information Internet Service.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation is expected to lift the number of subscribers
linking up in China to the Internet, and provide users with large
amounts of China's economic information.
</P>
<P>
The four parties plan to hold a large-scale symposium in
Beijing in November, and promote the VCD to the Chinese
market. Hayes already has a 30 percent to 40 percent share of
China's modem market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed deep
regret and serious indignation after the European Parliament
decided to award Wei Jingsheng this year's Sakharov Prize.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the announcement by the European Parliament
on October 24, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in
Beijing that the decision was actually encouraging anti-Chinese
government activity, and is a "rude interference into China's
internal affairs and judicial sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Shen said Wei Jingsheng, a criminal who violated China's
criminal laws, was sentenced for leaking state secrets, and
stirring up trouble to threaten and endanger national security.
</P>
<P>
Wei, being deprived of political rights, was sentenced again
for undertaking activities aimed at overturning the Chinese
government during his release on parole, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
"This is a matter within the judicial scope of a sovereign
state that no country has the right to interfere in," the
spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
"We advise a few members of the European Parliament, who defame
and accuse China out of vicious motives, not to go too far along a
wrong path," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The wrong doings harm China-Europe relations, and moreover,
harm the interests of the Europeans," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Tour Chief Furious over Grand Slam Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- ATP Tour chief executive Mark
Miles has strongly attacked last summer's decision by the
International Tennis Federation to move the rich Grand Slam Cup in
Munich into the middle of the autumn Tour tennis season for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It was a self-centered decision, " said Miles, speaking at a
presentation in Stuggart on Friday for next month's ATP Tour World
Championship in Hannover, Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Putting another big event in the middle of a crowded season
signifies a disruption to the flow of (Tour) tennis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Miles has been on the public relations warpath since July, when
the Grand Slam Committee -- composed of the chairmen of the four
Grand Slams -- decided to move their rich 16-man exhibition event
in Munich from early December to the fourth week of September
(23-28) following Davis Cup semifinal play.
</P>
<P>
The ATP Tour, which runs the men's computer ranking system and
sanctions more than 75 events over 44 weeks per year, is fearful
that inserting a six million dollar temptation for top players in
the time period will spell disaster for Tour events.
</P>
<P>
They are particularly worried for tournaments in Singapore and
Beijing thousands of kilometers and hours of travelling time away.
</P>
<P>
"The Grand Slam Cup creats a disruption of an already busy
calendar. It will put an obstacle to the flow of events," Miles
said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Grand Slam Cup's start in 1990, the Tour has always
dismissed the rival event as an exhibition, which does not count
for coveted ranking points.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a small accomodation has been reached between
the warring sides, with Grand Slam Cup events included in official
Tour match statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to move the Grand Slam Cup date will be a loss
for Munich as well," said the American CEO. "But they (the Grand
Slam Committee) thought it would be better and that is what they
did."
</P>
<P>
Miles is concerned that few elite level players will bother to
commit to some of the nine ATP Tour events scheduled before,
during and after the Grand Slam-Davis Cup fortnight.
</P>
<P>
He named as danger events Basel (the week of September 29, one
week after Munich) Vienna (week of October 6), Toulouse (opposite
the Grand Slam Cup) plus Singapore and Beijing which follow in
October.

<HEADLINE> Overall Examination, Key to HK New Airport Construction: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that the ongoing overall examination on issues concerning
the construction of Hong Kong's new airport is of great importance
to the airport project.
</P>
<P>
Hu Houcheng, Chinese member of the Airport Committee under the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), met with the chairman and
members of the Airport Consultative Committee (ACC) this afternoon
to discuss the overall examination of the progress of the new
airport core programs and implementation of the financial
arrangement for the new airport and airport railways.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that there are only more than 200 days before the Hong
Kong's handover, the new airport project is experiencing a key
period. It is the appropriate time now for the two sides to carry
out the overall examination.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong residents have already expressed their
ideas to the problems that have been exposed during construction
of the new airport. At a meeting held not long ago, the Economy
Panel of the Preparatory Committee especially discussed such
problems as the delayed construction of the airport terminal and
the huge indemnity.
</P>
<P>
This should arouse the attention of all sides, especially the
attention of the British side who is in charge of the ten core
programs before July 1, 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of the examination is to find out the
vulnerable spots in the project and determine the measures to be
adopted, so that the new airport can be completed within the
budget and the time limit, while quality is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that intensive examination should be made of
"bottle-neck" projects that affect the progress of other projects
and projects which have been severely delayed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the British Hong Kong Government to adopt effective
measures to solve the problems that are hampering the progress of
the new airport construction.

BONN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras defeated
Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-1 in their quarter-final at the Eurocard Open
tennis tournament in Stuggart on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After five breaks of serve in the first set -- the final four
games all went against the server -- the world No. one stepped up
his pace to overwhelm ninth seed Agassi in the rapid-fire second
set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras earned his 11th win against only eight losses to Agassi
in a series which began on clay in 1989 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
The world number one fired over his ninth ace of the afternoon
on match point. Sampras won six of ten break points while Agassi
could only manage three of six.
</P>
<P>
Sampras broke for a 3-1 lead in the first set, with the seventh
through tenth games all going to breaks, two apiece.
</P>
<P>
Sampras got in the last word and never let up in the second set
as he booked a semifinal against unseeded Jan Siemerink.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the world No. 26 Dutchman claimed his second Top 5
scalp of the week with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) upset of fifth seed Goran

<HEADLINE> West China to Woo More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China's central government
will try to create a more favorable environment to help the
western parts of the country woo more foreign investments, a
high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Xinhua, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, the central government will list projects in
the central and western parts of the country as priorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it will allocate more funds to help the areas to
develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
"All this will provide a good basis for cooperation with
foreign businessmen," Chen said at a seminar on policies for the
west China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the areas are economically backward
compared with the country's eastern and coastal parts, they have
their own advantages.
</P>
<P>
The west has rich mineral and agricultural resources, as well
as a cheaper labor force, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The investment environment in the central and western areas has
been greatly improved along with the opening of the
Beijing-Kowloon railway, he said, adding that the environment will
be further improved with more preferential policies worked out.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the growth rate of foreign
funding used in the central and western parts of China was 24
percent, higher than the country's average.

by Annie Suk Ching Wu, member of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and honorary
president of the association.

believe that Hong Kong will make a closer ties with China's inland
areas after its return to the motherland on July 1st next year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IEA to Seek Closer Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Energy Agency
(IEA) hopes to develop an open and constructive relationship with
China to share mutual interests and strengthen cooperation at "a
mutually acceptable pace," IEA Executive Director Robert Priddle
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua at the IEA headquarters, Priddle,
who will pay an official visit to China from October 28 to
November 5, said the visit would push the IEA-Chinese cooperation
to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Priddle said he was optimistic about the prospect of
cooperation between the IEA and China.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic development in the past 15 years had won
overall international recognition, including that of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), of
which the IEA was a subsidiary organ, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not altruistic that we are showing interest in the
China's energy development, but it is out of a need for mutual
benefit that we are spending more time outside the member
countries of IEA in seeking cooperation," the IEA leader said.
</P>
<P>
The world energy consumption, the bulk of which has been taken
by OECD countries, was now more and more shared by non-OECD member
states, such as China, Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
China, the third largest energy producer and consumer after the
United States and Russia, and the largest coal producer in the
world, had become a really important player in the world's energy
market, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in China, Priddle will sign a cooperation
agreement on energy with Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet Chinese Vice Premier Zhou Jiahua, and
will visit Shanghai and the Three Gorges Dam under construction in
Hubei, according to IEA officials.

<HEADLINE> Minister Warns Russian Forces "in Acute Crisis" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov warned today that the Russian military is
experiencing "an acute crisis" because of underfunding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first nationwide meeting of servicemen fighting
in trouble spots, Rodionov expressed concern about "the trend
toward decreasing the levels of combat and mobilization readiness
of troops, forces and administrative organs."
</P>
<P>
Interfax reported that he was also seriously concerned about
the troops' insufficient rapid deployment ability, accommodation
problems, lack of up-to-date arms and undermanning.
</P>
<P>
The minister claimed that "chronic under-funding has put the
armed forces on the edge."
</P>
<P>
"If the 1997 defense budget is not corrected, Russia may
finally lose the armed forces as an integral and capable state
structure," he warned. He said the projected budget covered only a
third of necessary expenses.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, his ministry was ready to take resolute
measures to reform the army and the navy.
</P>
<P>
"We do not advocate the creation of a super-army. Russia needs
mobile, sufficiently prepared and technically-equipped armed
forces, whose high military power possible enemies will be aware
of," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov said the existing plan for gradual reforms in the army
and the navy until the year 2000 would give the armed forces a new
image.

The New York Times:

<P>
-- Ceremonies were held in Israel in the first anniversary of

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Outstanding National Debt Grows at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's outstanding
national debt this year is estimated to increase at a lower rate
of 5.4 percent after increasing 14.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
As a percentage to Gross National Product (GNP), the national
debt will be lower at 31.7 percent compared with the 34 percent
last year, according to the Finance Ministry's 1996/1997 Economic
Report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The national debt in 1996 is estimated to reach 72.26 billion
ringgit (about 28.9 billion US dollars) by the end of this year
against the 68.569 billion ringgit (about 27.4276 billion
dollars) in 1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The external debt position of the federal government is
expected to improve further due largely to the strong fiscal
position as well as the appreciation of the ringgit against major
currencies during the year.
</P>
<P>
The public sector external debt in 1996 is expected to decline
0.6 percent to 39.87 billion ringgit (about 15.948 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the private sector external debt is expected to increase
13.8 percent to 32.39 billion ringgit (about 12.956 billion
dollars) largely to take advantage of the relatively lower cost of
borrowing abroad.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the share of private sector external debt to the national
debt is expected to increase to 44.8 percent in 1996 from the 41.5
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The national debt servicing is expected to increase from last
year's 15.311 billion ringgit (about 6.1244 billion dollars) last
year to 16.06 billion ringgit (about 6.424 billion dollars) this
year, of which 50.5 percent is for servicing the external debt of
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The national debt service ratio is expected to decline to 5.9
percent in 1996 compared with 6.2 percent in 1995, the report
said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng told
Maung Aye, Vice-chairman of the State Law and Order Restoration
Council of Myanmar, today that more military exchanges between
China and Myanmar will help promote all-round friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China, as a developing country, is willing to develop its
friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence, Li said during a meeting
with Maung Aye and his party in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar enjoyed traditional friendship, to which the
Chinese government attaches much importance, Li said, adding that
the prospects for furthering bilateral ties are promising.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China upholds that all countries should
be treated equally, irrespective of being big or small, rich or
poor, powerful or weak.
</P>
<P>
China believes that the development road and social system of a
nation should be decided by its own government and people, in line
with its own national situation, and no country should be allowed
to interfere in other country's internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
China opposes any interference in internal affairs of other
countries or hegemonism, adding that the so-called theory of a
"China Threat", advocated by some westerners, is totally
groundless, he told Maung Aye, who is also deputy commander of the
armed forces and commander-in-chief of the army of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to Myanmar last year, Premier Li said he is
pleased with the economic development of Myanmar, which, he said,
enjoys rich resources and broad prospects for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
General Aye, on a visit to China at the invitation of Zhang
Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central military Commission, said
that the purpose of his China trip is to enhance the ties between
the two armies, and also between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief to Lead Delegation to Cairo Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid announced here today that he will lead the
Arab League delegation to the third economic conference for the
Middle East and North Africa, due to be held here on November
12-14.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Egyptian Middle East news agency, Abdul
-Meguid said that the consolidation of stability in the
Middle East region was a necessary step so as to benefit from the
region's potentials, to reach out to the future, and to pave the
way for constructive cooperation among partners who look
forward to a better future.
</P>
<P>
He added that achieving this cherished cooperation among the
states of the region hinges on the establishment of lasting and
just peace.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of peace, he said, requires the search for
economic ways and means to ensure the continuity of cooperation
among the states in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that institution of the appropriate political
atmosphere, and the achievement of real breakthrough in the peace
process, would pave the grounds for the success of the economic
conference. It is therefore necessary that Israel implements all
peace agreements it has signed with the Arab side.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the Cairo Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference will group delegates from 88 states, 65 Arab
and international organizations and financial institutions and
more than 1,000 key businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Russia, DPRK to Start Talks on New Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will soon start consultations on
a new treaty to boost cooperation, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Grigory Karasin said today.
</P>
<P>
Karasin, who is in charge of Asian affairs in the Russian
Foreign Ministry, told reporters that the new treaty is designed
to further mutually-beneficial cooperation between the two
countries on an equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Karasin
said Russia, which "always played a corresponding role in Korean
affairs," wants its Far Eastern borders to be safe.
</P>
<P>
The key issue is "to prevent the escalation of tension in the
region, resume the inter-Korean peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, we agree to any proposal that aims at
strengthening peace and stability on the peninsula and that takes
into account the interests of all sides involved in the Korean
problem," Karasin said.
</P>
<P>
"As for the U.S.-South Korean proposal about the four-party
format of the talks with participation of the two Koreas, the
U.S. and China," Karasin said, "its implementation, in our view,
is scarcely possible under the present conditions when some of its
potential participants oppose such a scheme."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the need was increasingly obvious for
convening a widely participated meeting on Korea, with the
participation of DPRK, South Korea, Russia, the U.S., China, Japan
and the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Uruguayan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today in Beijing that China values its relations with Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that China wants to join efforts with the
Uruguayan government to advance their relations to new heights,
looking forward to the future.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng made the remarks at a meeting with Uruguayan Foreign
Minister Alavro Ramos in Zhongnanhai, site of the Central
Government.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Uruguayan relations have been developing smoothly since
1988, when the two countries were diplomatically linked, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These were featured by exchange of visits between senior
leaders of the two countries, and the considerable development of
exchanges and cooperation in political, economic, diplomatic, and
all other fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li believed that the strengthening of bilateral relations
accords to the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and will
benefit peace and development of the world.
</P>
<P>
China and Uruguay have also cooperated well with each other in
international affairs, Li Peng said, adding that he hopes the
close cooperation and coordination will continue.
</P>
<P>
Li thanked the Uruguayan government for its support to China on
the issues of China's entry to the World Trade Organization, and
the Pan-American Development Bank, and for China's becoming an
observer to the integration association covering Latin America, as
well on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also appreciates the Uruguayan
government's stance in sticking to the principles stipulated in
the Joint Communique on establishing diplomatic relations between
the two countries, by upholding the "One China" policy, Li Peng
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said Uruguay is one of the earliest countries in Latin
America that pioneered economic and trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"Uruguay is a reliable economic and trade partner of China in
the Latin American region," Ramos said, adding that Uruguay wishes
to expand its cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> FIS Introduces Emergency Safety Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Ski
Federation (FIS) said on Friday it would introduce emergency
safety measures in alpine skiing to provide more protection for
racers following a spate of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Plates fitted to skis to enable racers to corner faster had
introduced new risks into the sport said FIS, hinting they could
have contributed to the tragic death in 1994 of double world
champion Ulrike Maier of Austria.
</P>
<P>
FIS said it would enforce a new rule at the 1996/97 season's
opening World Cup races in Soelden this weekend, restricting the
size of the metal plates used under bindings -- the connection
between ski and ski boot.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the FIS Alpine committee Toni Sailer said skiers
would be disqualified if the fitting of plates increased the
distance between the bottom of the ski and the highest point of
the binding to more than 60 mms.
</P>
<P>
The distance would be restricted further to a maximum of 55
mms for the 1997/98 season, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The height given by these plates combined with the new format
of skis -- of being wider at the top and bottom and narrower in
the center -- leads to new risks we didn't know of before," said
FIS president Marc Hodler, adding that a number of universities
had begun investigating the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly accidents have started occurring on relatively flat
parts of the slope where accidents shouldn't happen, for example
when a skier is going straight and suddenly loses control of his
or her ski.
</P>
<P>
"We saw this with (German Markus) Wasmeier in Wengen and it
could have been the case in a bad women's accident some years
ago, although we cannot be certain," Hodler said in a clear
reference to Maier's death.
</P>
<P>
Maier was killed from neck injuries sustained in a fall during
a World Cup downhill at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in 1994,
when she suddenly lost control of her right ski.
</P>
<P>
FIS will also begin checking the size of the sole of the ski
boot to ensure racers do not compensate the height lost from the
plate by building up the sole. However, this rule will only come
into force at the November races in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The development of a long-term,
friendly neighbor relationship between China and the Philippines,
and other ASEAN countries, is an important component of China's
foreign policy, Chinese Premier Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a meeting with Arturo T. Enrile, chief
of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines, in Zhongnanhai,

<HEADLINE> China's Scientists to Gaze Into 100 Million Galaxies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China is to build the world's
most advanced telescope that will allow scientists to carry out
surveys of 100 million galaxies.
</P>
<P>
And the country is to develop a micro-precise monitoring
system, using satellites, that will pave the way for a major
breakthrough in earthquake alerts in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The schemes form part of a massive 470 million yuan state
investment plan for four ambitious science projects in the
remaining years of this century.
</P>
<P>
The country hopes that its appliance of frontier science will
give it a firm foothold in the forefront of international
scientific and technological science in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The package includes the construction of an advanced sky survey
telescope, a national synchronous radiation laboratory, a earth
crust movement monitoring network and an advanced light source
that is at lease 100 million times brighter than X-ray light.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the plan smoothly, China will draw on experience
collected from the country's development of atomic and hydrogen
bombs in the 1960s and 1970s, and mobilize the most elite
scientists. It will also strengthen international cooperation, and
win strong support from scientific and industrial circles, the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China will invest 170 million yuan to build a sky survey
telescope, which is the most advanced in the world, in Yanshan
Mountains of north China.
</P>
<P>
The large area, multi-object spectrum telescope, with a calibre
of four meters and a length of 40 meters, can observe at least 100
million galaxies, which will open up a brand-new area for
astronomy during the trans-century period.
</P>
<P>
China has already invested 100 million yuan, building eight
more light beams and eight laboratories for the Hefei-based
National Synchronous Radiation Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The completion of this synchronous radiation device will put
China in the front in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 80 million yuan will be set aside for the
building of a new synchrotron light source in China's largest city
of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed new machine will operate at energy levels from
2.2 to 2.5 GeV, to provide a brighter source of synchrotron light
for researchers in fields ranging from advanced materials, life
sciences, nuclear physics, medical science to electronics,
medicine, petroleum and the chemical industries," researchers from
CAS said.
</P>
<P>
China will, at the same time, invest 120 million yuan to build
an earth crust movement monitoring network, by adopting a global
satellite positioning system, and satellite laser distance
measurement know-how.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that China is about to make a breakthrough in
earthquake forecast, scientists said.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette, who is currently accompanying President Jacques Chirac
on a Middle East trip, held talks here today with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after the meeting, de Charette reiterated
France's support for Lebanon. He noted that the peace process in
the Middle East is presently in a "critical situation."
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister said that the relations linking
Lebanon and France is "totally different from the relations which
France set up with other countries because of their deep-rooted
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He underlined his country's support for Lebanon in a
five-nation committee monitoring cease-fire in south Lebanon. The
committee was set up in accordance with a cease-fire understanding
reached between Lebanon and Israel on April 26 under the auspices
of the United States and France.
</P>
<P>
A consultative committee was also established consisting of
donor countries that have promised to provide financial
assistances to Lebanon for the rebuilding of its war-devastated
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The task of the cease-fire monitoring committee comprising the
United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel was to oversee
the implementation of the cease-fire understanding.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister stressed France's effective
support for Lebanon and its role in activating the peace process
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We heard from the French minister, after his tour
in the region, and after our meetings with President
Chirac, information which he carried with him from
Israel, Syria and Jordan," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, accompanied by de Charette and other French officials,
arrived in Beirut Thursday night on the fifth leg of his tour of
the region, in which he had visited Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This is the second visit by the French president to Lebanon
and to the region in less than seven months.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is scheduled to leave the Lebanese capital
this afternoon for Cairo, the last leg of his Middle
East trip.

nation should be decided by its own government and people, in line
with its own national situation, and no country should be allowed
to interfere in other country's internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
China opposes any interference in internal affairs of other
countries or hegemonism, adding that the so-called theory of a
"China Threat", advocated by some westerners, is totally
groundless, he told Maung Aye, who is also deputy commander of the
armed forces and commander-in-chief of the army of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to Myanmar last year, Premier Li said he is
pleased with the economic development of Myanmar, which, he said,
enjoys rich resources and broad prospects for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
General Aye, on a visit to China at the invitation of Zhang
Wannian, vice-chairman of the Central military Commission, said
that the purpose of his China trip is to enhance the ties between
the two armies, and also between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Reports Lack of Food in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations refugee
agency Friday reported shortage of food in the Bukavu area of
Zaire, where 60,000 refugees and 10,000 displaced Zaireans have
arrived after fleeing the intensified ethnic fighting in Uvira
region.
</P>
<P>
Food stocks in Bukavu of eastern Zaire could only last two more
weeks, Christiane Berthiaume, spokeswoman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
She said about 30,000 more people were still on the way to that
area.
</P>
<P>
In Goma, north to Bukavu, food stocks would run out in just two
days, she said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the World Food Program (WFP) warned that the
cut-off of humanitarian supplies due to the worsening security
situation in eastern Zaire would result in a major hunger crisis
affecting over one million refugees.
</P>
<P>
WFP said it could deliver food from neighboring Uganda and
Tanzania for the next two months, but access to refugee camps was
impossible.
</P>
<P>
The UN food agency added that Zairean authorities halted 75 of
its trucks at the border with Uganda for security reasons last
weekend. The trucks carried over 2,200 tons of food destined for
Goma and Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
According to Berthiaume, the Zairean government has closed
borders with neighboring countries except for the Bukavu region.
</P>
<P>
Considering the deteriorating situation in eastern Zaire, High
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata urged Rwandan refugees to
return to Rwanda. Ogata asked the refugees to consider the
statement by the Rwandan government early this week inviting them
to come back home.
</P>
<P>
Ogata also promised international support for their return, and
stressed the fact that "80,000 refugees have recently returned
home to Rwanda from Burundi, and UNHCR and UN human rights
observers report that they are now busy resuming normal lives."
</P>
<P>
In eastern Zaire, there are currently more than 143,000 Rwandan
refugees. UNHCR earlier said that a total of 75,000 Burundi
refugees in the region had expressed the wish to stay.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokeswoman Friday told reporters that in the Rwandan
town of Cyangugu along the border with Bukavu, UNHCR has
established three reception stations capable of receiving 15,000
people, in preparation for possible return of Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
She said UNHCR would provide each returnee with food for two
months. According to her, UNHCR has in neighbouring Uganda and
Tanzania stocks of relief goods sufficient to meet the needs of
300,000 people, including blankets, plastic sheetings and farm
tools.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen High-Tech Firm to Set Up Plant in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A large high-tech firm in China's
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) plans to establish a factory
in Macao to produce compact laser discs and related products, the
"Macao Daily News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A top executive of the Xianke Group Company, one of the largest
laser products manufacturers in China, said the company plans to
invest between 10 million and 20 million U.S. dollars in Macao to
build the plant for producing audio and video laser products.
</P>
<P>
A group of top executives of the company will visit Macao next
month for investment details, the report quoted Ye Huaming,
chairman of Xianke, as saying.
</P>
<P>
First established in May 1984, Xianke became a group company
in December 1991 and has now under it more than 80 companies with
total assets estimated at 1.5 billion yuan (about 181 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moving part of its laser production lines to Macao is aimed at
the international market, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said his company is to invest in Macao because the
cost of production is relatively cheaper here as the salary level,
indices of living and price of real estate are all lower than
those in Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
"The incentive policy to industrial investors in Macao is
quite attractive to many Shenzhen companies," he said. "Macao is
somewhat like Shenzhen at the time when the SEZ was first
established. I believe that more and more companies from China's
inland areas will invest in Macao in the coming two to three
years."

<HEADLINE> JLG Experts Reach Consensus on PLA Advance Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and British sides
 of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached a consensus
 today on the importance, necessity and some principles concerning
 the advance party of the Hong Kong Garrison Troops of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The two sides ended the two-day 20th expert meeting on Hong
Kong's defense here today. During the meeting they discussed the
stationing of an advance party of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison
Troops before the handover.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative on the JLG, told a press
briefing after the meeting that it is necessary for a limited
number of advance personnel of the PLA to come to Hong Kong on an
early date, so that they can make preparations for the deployment
of the future PLA Hong Kong Garrison Troops and avoid the "defense
 vacuum" on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen stressed that the British side will remain fully
responsible for Hong Kong's defense until June 30, 1997, while the
 advance party of the PLA will not participate in or take over the
 defense responsibility during this period.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the number of the advance personnel would
be very small.
</P>
<P>
He said that preparations must be made in various aspects
before the stationing of the PLA Garrison Troops, such as the
arrangement of the barracks, telecommunications, navigation and
familiarity with marine, land and air traffic.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that when the advance personnel come to Hong Kong,
they will strictly abide by Hong Kong's laws and regulations, and
actively cooperate with the British side.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the Chinese and British sides have agreed to
hold the 21st expert meeting soon, at which the Chinese side will
discuss concrete issues concerning the arrival of the advance
party with the British side.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will maintain and
carry forward their spirit of cooperation so as to complete the
defense transfer smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Urging Early Adoption of Garrison Law on Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today
called for an early adoption of the law to allow for the sending
of troops to Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed that the new law should be as comprehensive
as possible, by taking all possibilities into consideration before
hand.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
the country's top legislative body, started to review the draft of
the Law on Sending Troops to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) during panel discussions this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Many people say that the draft, based on the Chinese
Constitution and the Basic Law on the HK SAR, and with reference
to practices of the British Army in Hong Kong, enshrines the
justifiable principles of maintaining China's sovereignty and "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
However, the practice of one country with two systems, and
forming an SAR, is unprecedented in human history, and the
formulation of such a garrison law has no experience to follow,
said Xu Qichao and Zhou Jue, members of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we must consider all the possibilities before
hand, and try our best to prevent difficulties in the enforcement
of the law," Zhou Jue said.
</P>
<P>
Another lawmaker Li Xu'e, said that opinions of the Hong Kong
consultants on Hong Kong affairs, named by the central government,
should be fully solicited in the course to draft and revise this
law.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue said that this draft law, after being unveiled for the
first time two days ago, has aroused enormous interest in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Adoption of this law as soon as possible will be conducive to
building up the confidence of Hong Kong residents and to the
smooth transition on July 1, 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the law did not rule that a draft law must be discussed at
least in two sessions of the NPC Standing Committee before
adoption, I would propose a vote be taken this coming Tuesday,"
Zhou Jue said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, lawmaker and president of the Hong Kong branch of
Xinhua News Agency, who did not attend the panel discussion today,
is reported to share Zhou Jue's opinion.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing today
met here today with visiting Egyptian Minister of Supply and
Internal Trade Ahmed Goweili and an Egyptian delegation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li said China and Egypt, as two of the
oldest civilizations in the world, enjoy a traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
They have the same, or similar view-points on international
affairs, and support and cooperate with each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries, while developing political
relations, are doing their best to strengthen cooperation in
economic, trade, technology and other fields.
</P>
<P>
He cited the ongoing exhibition of Egyptian commodities in
Beijing, and the planned establishment of a distribution center of
Chinese goods in Egypt, as signs of closer economic and trade ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Goweili said Egypt is willing to develop its traditional
friendly relations with China, and the current visit, his first to
China, aims to consolidate and strengthen bilateral economic and
trade bonds.
</P>
<P>
Expressing Egypt's wish to be a partner in China's economic
development, Goweili extended a welcome to Chinese businesses to
invest in Egypt in various forms.
</P>
<P>
Goweili arrived in China on Wednesday to attend the third
meeting of Sino-Egyptian Economic and Trade Joint Committee at the
invitation of Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic

<P>
Lawmakers are satisfied with the stipulations in the draft on
the responsibilities and duties of the troops to be stationed in
Hong Kong, and the independent relations between the troops and
the HK SAR government, as well as on legal matters relating to the
troops to be stationed there.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested many revisions to further safeguard the
legitimate rights of Hong Kong residents and the military
personnel to be stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue and Cheng Shouliang, a deputy to the NPC, said that it
is not enough for the stationed troops to merely "inform" the HK
SAR government on matters of military exercises before hand, as it
was put in the current draft.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, they should consult the local government or other
organizations, if such military operations would affect the public
interests there," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Qichao noted that the independence of stationed troops from
the HK SAR government is reasonable, but that their "closer
cooperations and coordinations" should be encouraged "to avoid
possible by-effects."
</P>
<P>
On the disciplines the stationed troops should observe, Li Xu'e
said the words "for profits" should be omitted in the article to
prohibit military personnel from becoming engaged in "businesses
for profits," because it is hard to determine whether their
businesses are for profits, or not.
</P>
<P>
This suggestion won support from many other legislators, who
deemed it improper for the army to take any commercial businesses
to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Budget Deficit Reduced to 2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti state budget
deficit has come down from 18.03 billion U.S. dollars in
1991-92 fiscal year right after the Gulf War to 2.15 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995-96 fiscal year, according to the latest
official figures.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Nasser
Al-Rodhan has told the Kuwait News Agency that Kuwait's deficit
reached its peak of 5.464 billion Kuwaiti dinars (18.03 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1991-92 because of the state financial
commitments to carrying out the Gulf War to end the Iraqi
occupation and the urgent requirements to rebuild the economic
and social structure in the country.
</P>
<P>
It fell to 653 million dinars (2.15 billion U.S. dollars)
in the 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said "this was far beyond our expectations. Estimates
spoke of a 1.61 billion Dinars (5.3 billion U.S. dollars)
deficit for this year at best."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti state budget for fiscal year 1996-97 endorsed by the
last National Assembly on October 1 was projected at 4.21 billion
dinars (13.89 billion U.S.dollars) with an estimated deficit at
around 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, currently under a government scheme designed to
balance it by the turn of the century without cutting the
salaries of the Kuwaiti employees, has registered a 100 million
dinars (330 million U.S. dollars) reduction compared with that in
the fiscal year 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the forthcoming phase (1996-2000) would
mark the start of practical steps in economic reform based
on restructuring and striking a balance between the public and
private sectors in addition to balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
He said that "improved oil prices and reforms to the oil
sector in the country played a positive role in realizing this
success in addition to serious and continuous efforts to control
and rationalize budget expenses despite enormous difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Al-Rodhan said "the road to a balanced and stable development
was still a long way to realize because it required
diversification in local revenues and balanced financial role."
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait would have to continue to increase expenditure
on defense, security and education although there is
a need to cut expenditure in certain sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's financial policy in the
forthcoming phase will concentrate on reducing expenses and at
the same time increase and diversify non-oil revenues through
charting a developed taxation program that would not become
a burden on the society.

NICOSIA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has stepped up its
efforts to fight against drug abuse as the problem has posed a
real danger to the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a panel discussion on "Fighting Narcotics in

as it is in other European countries, there is a growing problem
which poses a very real danger to the island.

and those who deal in them".
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the lives of young people depend
on their stance toward drugs: they must not allow anyone to
destroy their dignity, to humiliate and exploit them.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had stepped up its efforts to deal
with the problem, but it was impossible to fight a complex
social phenomenon such as drug abuse with legislative measures
alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
With the formulation of the national policy against drug
abuse and its strict enforcement, Christofides stressed that "it
is our ambition to provide our young people with strong
antibodies and to give them through education the best possible
immunity to drugs within the framework of a long-term
educational strategy."
</P>
<P>
During last year, there were 156 drug-related cases with 222
people involved. So far this year, police tackled around 146
drug-related cases with 176 persons involved, the majority of
them were Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Trade Ministers Meeting Opens in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The third meeting of the
inter governmental group (IGG) of trade ministers and commerce
secretaries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) opened here today in a bid to enhance their
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
India today urged SAARC member nations to reduce trade tariff
and remove quantitative restrictions for trading in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Secretary Tejender Khanna in his inaugural
speech said that placing of quantitative restrictions would hamper
the growth of trade among the member countries.
</P>
<P>
India was working towards realization of the South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) by the turn of the century. Since the trading
communities in the SAARC region are convinced about the need to
user in an era of free trade, it was the duty of the civil
servants and the official representatives to work towards this
goal with the approval of their respective governments, he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has asked for almost 1,500 tariff line concessions.
The request has been discussed in the first and second IGG
meetings in Colombo and Islamabad. It is likely to enter a crucial
phase of negotiations at the current third meeting.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes European Intervention in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani today welcomed the European intervention in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old president said that "we have been witnessing
positive development in recent days of the Middle East
conflict. That is entry of Europeans into the Middle East
political scene."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the statement while addressing a large number
of people at the Friday prayer gathering at Tehran University
campus this morning.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Iranian government is happy with
the latest development in the Middle East because it would be
relieved from the tremendous pressure due to the competition between
the super power of the United States and France.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati also openly
expressed its welcome to French President Jacque Chirac's peace
mission and encouraged him to stop U.S. monopoly in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose America's unilateral approach to the Middle East
and the Persian Gulf. The active political presence of France
would stop U.S. monopolistic approach," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iranian mass media hailed French President Jacques Chirac's
peace mission in the Middle East. Many newspapers devoted much of
the coverage to the visit. Some papers even recommended the
Arab countries to welcome Chirac as an effective and impartial
mediator, saying that the United States has lost its
credibility as a broker of peace.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani told the large crowd that the European intervention
in the Middle East conflict began with two developments.
</P>
<P>
The first one was the German mediation between Israel and
South Lebanon in exchange of bodies of Israeli soldiers with
Moslem war prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The second one was Chirac visit to Lebanon about six
months ago. A series of positive developments have been brought
about to Lebanon after Chirac' visit.
</P>
<P>
While praising France's role in the region, the Iranian
president lost no chance to criticize the United States.
</P>
<P>
"What have been proved in the past few days is that the
Americans are not friends of the Arab states as they claim to
be." he said. "It is becoming more clear to the Arab states and
the people of the region that the shepherd is actually the
wolf. Americans should not be trusted."

<HEADLINE> Large Transport Conglomerates Suggested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of
Communications Huang Zhendong has suggested that transport company
groups be set up to improve competitiveness among regions in the
auto transport business.
</P>
<P>
Huang told a national meeting on transport management recently
in Yulin City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, that
conglomerates could be an important way for the country's
transport businesses to go from scattered practices to large-scale
operation.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the ministry's transport enterprises
operate 274,800 motor vehicles, accounting for 6.74 percent of the
nation's total, and carried 3.6 billion passengers and 518 million
tons of cargo, worth 27.142 billion yuan, last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, a total of 4,207 enterprises were engaged
in transportation, including 2,281 state-owned entities, 1,911
collectively-owned ones, and 15 foreign-backed. Some 2,623
enterprises are making a profit.
</P>
<P>
Huang said he believes that an express passenger and cargo
network is the trend for the transport business, with improved
highway conditions and automobiles, and urged transport
enterprises along expressways, especially large enterprises to
form enterprise groups or joint-stock companies, co-operating with
administrative departments of communications, and helping promote
the rational distribution of capital and resources.

<HEADLINE> 700-year-old Distillery in Inner Mongolia Still in Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Recently, archaeologists came
upon a stone mill and wine jars from the Yuan Dynasty that are
still being used to make wine and liquor out of local grain.
</P>
<P>
The distillery started in the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and is
still in use in the village of Dabhar, in Ulanqab Prefecture, in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, far away from
highways and without access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
Also discovered nearby were the remains of buildings that were
probably a postal station, and arrow heads and pieces of armor and
wine cups at a hill five km away from the village, all dating from
the Yuan Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The scholars say that the find shows that distilleries and bars
were built along a 700-year-old post road linking present-day
Beijing and the Republic of Mongolia, as recorded in historical
documents.
</P>
<P>
They say that the workshop is a living relic which will
contribute to the study of the Yuan Dynasty and the history of
distilling.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac, who is currently visiting Beirut within his Middle East
tour, praised today a Syrian role in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a dialogue with some 200 Lebanese university students in
the French Cultural Center here, Chirac noted that the Syrian
presence in Lebanon is for "supporting Lebanon's withstanding
against the Israeli occupation."
</P>

based on territorial ambition, but on security considerations.
He hoped an implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that a participation of France and Europe in the
Middle East peace process is not for the sake of their own
interests, but is aimed at reaching a peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Chirac ruled out a possibility to separate the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks in the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that France always supports Lebanon's policy of
reconstruction, and it supports Lebanon through "the historical
relations between the two peoples."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the Lebanese youth will play a role in the
reconstruction process in this country.
</P>
<P>
After the open dialogue with the Lebanese students, the French
president went to the parliamentary building and held a meeting
with House Speaker Nabih Berri, which is followed by a meeting
between Chirac and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Unveils Budget for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today announced
the budget for 1997 that contains fresh measures to improve the
quality of life and develop the country's financial services
industry.
</P>
<P>
The budget is also aimed at checking inflation, increasing
productivity, cutting the current account deficit and developing
the Multi-Media Super Corridor, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said while presenting the budget in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget has a total expenditure package of 59.982
billion ringgit (about 24 billion US dollars) against a projected
federal government revenue of 60.778 billion ringgit (about
24.3112 billion US dollars), leaving a surplus gap of 796 million
ringgit (about 318.4 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"After taking into account loan repayments of 1.65 billion
ringgit (about 660 million US dollars), the federal government's
overall account will register a surplus of 2.446 billion ringgit
(about 978 million US dollars) next year," said Anwar, who is also
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget expenditure, up from 55.467 billion ringgit
(about 22.1868 billion US dollars) for this year, is made up of
42.713 billion ringgit (about 17.085 billion US dollars) for
operating expenditure and 17.269 billion ringgit (about 6.915
billion US dollars) for development.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that thanks to the continuing robust economy on the
back of the ninth consecutive year of high growth, the no-tax
budget is also aimed at setting the tone for Malaysia's
development into the next century and addressing what economists
described as the problems of success.
</P>
<P>
He said the budget strategy was designed to ensure sustained
economic growth in the medium and long term to achieve sustainable
growth through enhanced productivity.

The Central Bank's Thursday statement coincided with the ministry's
re-affirmation of its earlier claims, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports at Thursday's newspapers, the Central Bank
said in the mid-year report that the difference between this deficit
and the budget surplus announced by the ministry is accounted for
largely by the difference between the debt service payments of the
ministry and the bank.
</P>
<P>
The ministry recorded 22 billion Naira (about 275 million Dollars)
and six billion Naira (about 75 million Dollars) for the country's
external debt service payments, as against the actual payments of 26.8
billion Naira (335 million Dollars) and 12.13 billion Naira (about
151.6 million Dollars) in the bank, respectively, reports said.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement later Thursday, the bank denied officially
releasing a mid-year report to the public although it acknowledged "an
earlier draft of the report (where) there was a reference to a
provisional budget deficit," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that a reliable ministry source insisted
Thursday on the eight billion Naira surplus profile, describing the
report of a deficit as "a lie".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of God, announced that they
thwarted an infiltrating attempt of Israeli forces toward
southern Lebanese villages early this morning, killing and
wounding several Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced in a statement that its fighters detonated a bomb
targeting an Israeli patrol attempting to penetrate toward
"liberated areas," killing and wounding "a number of Israeli
soldiers."
</P>
<P>
It added that a violent fighting erupted between the
guerrillas and the Israeli patrol.
</P>
<P>
Radio Israel confirmed the pre-dawn operation, saying that two
Israeli soldiers were killed and four others wounded in the bomb
attack in the eastern sector of the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It described the conditions of the three wounded as
"dangerous."
</P>
<P>
In a retaliation for the attack, Israeli occupation forces
bombarded Arab Salim, Kfar Ruman, Jebal Rafih and Wadi AI-AKhdar
in Iglim AI-Toffah, or province of Apple, a mountain area some 65
kilometers southeast of Beirut. It caused no casualties.

The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah has vowed to launch
military attacks at the Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of
Fathi Shukaki, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.
</P>
<P>
Shukaki was gunned down in Malta on October 26, 1995, and his
assassins were never found, but Israel's Mossad secret service is
widely believed to be behind the killing.

Israeli artillery intermittently bombarded suspected guerrilla
targets on the hills opposite the Israeli-occupied border strip
since Wednesday morning when Israeli helicopters rocketed an
area just outside the buffer zone's eastern sector.

Hezbollah guerrillas launched an attack Thursday at a position
of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia at Tomat
Niha with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, wounding

</P>

European integration.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The biggest shipment so far of US arms to Bosnia

moved into high gear.

The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Firm Due To Chinese Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices in Australia
firmed this week after an increase in demand from China, the
Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose 11 Australian cents during
this week's sale to 575 cents (460 US cents) a kilogram, while the
western market indicator rose 10 cents to 535 Australian cents
(428 US cents) a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Exporters attributed the price rise to increased demand due to
exporters compiling orders for shipment to China in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Sales of stockpile wool by the Wool International were fairly
modest this week with 6,528 bales sold, the ACWE said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The subdued sales mean Wool International would have to sell
about 39,000 bales during the next five to six weeks to meet the
required minimum quarterly sales of 182,000.
</P>
<P>
More than 73,000 bales were expected to be offered for auction
during next week's sales in Sydney, Geelong and Fremantle, the
ACWE said.

<HEADLINE> Services Sector Has Biggest Share of Malaysia's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's services
sector, the biggest one of its economy, is expected to continue
its steady growth both this year and next with the transportation,
storage and communications sub-sectors expanding the fastest.
</P>
<P>
The sector which grew 9.4 percent last year is expected to
outpace overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth by expanding
at 8.9 percent this year and at a forecast 8.7 percent next year,
according to the 1996/97 Treasury Economic Report released here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sector is expected to have value added by 58.07 billion
ringgit (about 23.228 billion US dollars) this year to account for
a 44.6 percent of GDP compared with 44.3 percent last year and is
forecast to account for a 44.9 percent share of GDP next year.
</P>
<P>
The impetus to growth in the sector was, as in recent years,
attributable to the government's promotional efforts to develop
the sector with a view to reducing the deficit in the services
account of the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
The efforts were also aimed at preparing Malaysia's services
sector for the imminent further liberalization of the sector to
global competition in line with the country's commitment under the
General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).
</P>
<P>
The sector still has much scope for further expansion in view
of the large service imports and expanding market for services in
the region's trade, the report said, adding that vigorous efforts
were being made to explore future potentials by way of developing
the sector into a vibrant foreign exchange generating industry as
well as a catalyst for future economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite growing by more than 9 percent in recent years, this
sector still lacked capacity to export as well as substitute
imported services, such as in freight and insurance, education and
professional services, including financial services, it added.
</P>
<P>
Within the services sector, the transportation, storage and
communications sub-sectors were projected to continue recording
double-digit growth of 13.2 percent this year, thanks to
continuous investment to improve, expand and modernize the land,
sea and air transportation system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, value added in the finance, insurance, real estate
and business sub-sectors is expected to expand by 10 percent this
year against the 10.5 percent last year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale and retail trade, hotel and restaurants
sub-sectors were expected to grow 9.5 percent this year from 10.1
percent last year because of strong domestic demand amidst higher
disposable income and increased tourists inflow.

TOKYO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's consumer prices remain
stable, with the index for Tokyo's 23 wards falling 0.1 percent in
October from a year earlier, Kyodo News Service quoted the
Management and Coordination Agency as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The slight fall represented the second straight month of
decline, following a 0.4 percent drop in September, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index stood at 100.0 in October, unchanged
from the previous month, against the base of 100 for 1995, it said.

Excluding volatile prices for fresh fruits and vegetables, the
index came to 100.1, down 0.1 percent from a year earlier but up
0.1 percent from the previous month, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The narrowing in the index's drop margin in October from that
in September was attributable mainly to higher food prices in
October, which rose 0.5 percent from the year-earlier level, it
said.
</P>

Nationwide consumer prices in September remained unchanged from
a year earlier, and rose 0.4 percent from the previous month, with

"It is time to stop struggling for influence, for posts, it is
time to work," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
All authorities, all branches of power, instead of quarreling
with one another, should show real care for the benefit of people,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the main task now is to improve the life of
Russian people and to consolidate society.
</P>
<P>
Professionalism, the ability to work for the benefit of people,
should be the only criterion to judge officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the government, the parliament, the presidential
administration and regional authorities are all state institutions
obliged to serve the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that both central and local authorities should
ensure human rights, introduce law and order and pay regularly
pensions and wages.
</P>
<P>
However, some leaders fail to understand this or don't want to
understand this, Yeltsin said and warned that such actions would
discredit the authorities and erode the confidence of citizens in
the state.
</P>
<P>
And such officials should be fired, he added.

<HEADLINE> European Initiative Envisages Sponsorship of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The European peace initiative
that was hailed by the Arabs and rejected by Israel is meant to
include Europe as a third sponsor of the peace process, beside
the U.S. and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, led by French President Jacques Chirac on his
ongoing six-leg Middle East tour, aims to carve out a larger
European role in the Arab-Israeli peace making, the Egyptian
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The initiative calls for pushing forward the peace talks on
the land-for-peace basis, implementing the signed agreements
between Israel and Palestine and restarting talks on other
tracks.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted diplomatic sources as saying that the Europeans
are keen to work with Syria to make talks on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks more successful.
</P>
<P>
France has played a part in arranging a cease-fire in Lebanon
in April, which ended the Israeli bombardment, known as Operation
Grapes of Wrath.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans will continue to monitor, along with the U.S.,
the cease-fire in South Lebanon, said the diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they will also extend financial and economic
support to all parties involved in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The assistance will be no less than that furnished by the
Americans if the initiative is accepted, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The parties concerned have yet to approve the appointment
of a special EU envoy to the peace talks, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Such a representative would, like the American sponsor, take
part in all the peace talks and make suggestions to help the
parties overcome their problems.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Israeli Casualties Caused by Guerrillas in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- radio Israel, monitored in
Beirut, announced that two Israeli soldiers were killed and four
others wounded in a bomb attack by guerrillas in the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
It said that the pre-dawn attack took place when guerrillas
detonated a bomb targeting an Israeli patrol inside the buffer
zone.
</P>
<P>
The casualties suffered by the Israeli troops in south Lebanon
are the most serious in recent months. The radio described the
conditions of three of the wounded as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
No guerrilla faction has claimed responsibility for the
operation on the last active battle front of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, where the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or party of
God, spearheads a guerrilla campaign against the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite fundamentalist group has vowed to carry out military
attacks against the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon to
mark the one-year anniversary of the assassination of Fathi
Shukaki, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group.
</P>
<P>
Shukaki was gunned down in Malta on October 26, 1995, and his
assassins were never found, but Israel's Mossad secret service is
widely believed to be behind the killing.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery has intermittently bombarded suspected
guerrilla targets on the hills opposite the Israeli-occupied
border strip since Wednesday morning when Israeli helicopters
rocketed an areas just outside the buffer zone's eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas launched an attack Thursday at a position
of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia at Tomat Niha
with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, wounding one
militiaman.
</P>
<P>
Today's casualties brought the toll to 23 of the Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon by guerrillas since the beginning
of this year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Economy to Expand at More Sustainable Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian economy is
estimated to expand at a more sustainable pace this year following
a period of rapid expansion in the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
Its real gross domestic product (GDP) is envisaged to register
a slower growth of 8.2 percent in 1996 against 9.5 percent in
1995, with the rates of growth in all sectors expected to moderate
from the high levels achieved in 1995, according to the Finance
Ministry's 1996-97 Economic Report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the real GDP growth for 1997 is envisaged at 8.0
percent, marginally lower than the 8.2 percent growth estimated
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main impetus to growth continues to come from the
manufacturing sector which is expected to continue to expand,
albeit at a slower rate of 12.8 percent for 1996 compared to a
14.5 percent growth in 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the agriculture sector will have a better performance
with a slightly higher growth rate of 1.6 percent against 1.1
percent in 1995, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
In line with the GDP growth, the nominal gross national product
(GNP) is envisaged to continue to increase by 13.1 percent to
235.3 billion ringgit (about 94.12 billion US dollars), with
which, the per capita income of the population is expected to rise
by 10.5 percent to reach 11,118 ringgit (over 4,447 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Public investment is expected to increase by 19.6 percent in
1996, but private investment growth, which surged by 28.9 percent
in 1995, is expected to decelerate to 9.9 percent in 1996 mainly
due to lower investment in the oil and gas sector and slower
expansion of investment in large privatized projects.
</P>
<P>
Aggregate domestic demand is envisaged to expand at a slower
rate of 10.2 percent in current prices to 250.1 billion ringgit
(100 billion dollars) in 1996, after a surge of 17.4 percent in
1995, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As for external demand, growth in exports of goods and
non-factor services is expected to decelerate to 5.0 percent to
219.2 billion ringgit (87.68 billion dollars) in 1996 against 20.1
percent growth in 1995 while imports of goods and non-factor
services are expected to decelerate significantly to 2.6 percent
in 1996 to 222.5 billion ringgit (89 billion dollars), against a
growth of 22.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The current account of the balance of payment is envisaged to
record a lower deficit of 14.8 billion ringgit (5.92 billion
dollars) or 6.3 percent of GNP in 1996, against a deficit of 18.7
billion ringgit (7.48 billion dollars) or 9.0 percent of GNP in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The level of net international reserves held by the Central
Bank as at the end of 1996 is expected to increase from 63.8
billion ringgit (25.52 billion dollars) as at the end of 1995 to
65.0 billion ringgit (26 billion dollars), which is equivalent to
4.1 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
Inflation this year is expected to remain relatively low,
averaging 3.6 percent during the first nine months of 1996, but
slightly higher in comparison with 3.4 percent during the
corresponding period of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Still Main Impetus to Malaysia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Though affected by the
deceleration in the growth of the electronics industry in the
global market, Malaysia's manufacturing sector still remains
strong enough to be the main impetus to the economic growth of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The sector is expected to continue to expand, albeit at a
slower rate of 12.8 percent this year and 12.5 percent next year
against the 14.5 percent growth last year, according to the
Treasury's 1996-97 Economic Report released here today.
</P>
<P>
Its share to real GDP is expected to increase from 33.1 percent
in 1995 to 34.5 percent in 1996 and further up to 36 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Its contribution to overall real growth in 1996 is estimated at
51.6 percent against 48.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented industries in the sector are expected to
record a slower output growth mainly as a result of slackening in
external demand for electrical and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
But output growth of domestic-oriented industries is expected
to accelerate moderately, underpinned by capacity expansion and
strong sales order, particularly for the chemical products and the
non-metallic products.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented industries, as a group, registered a less
robust growth of 11.7 percent in the first seven months of this
year in comparison with 16.6 percent growth during the
corresponding period last year, according to latest statistics
available.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the domestic-oriented industries, as a group,
registered a stronger output growth of 15.2 percent during the
review period compared with 12.8 percent during the corresponding
period of 1995.

SANYA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Sanya, on south China's island
province of Hainan, plans to spend 500 million yuan on a sewage
treatment plant with a daily capacity of 80,000 tons in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Sanya was just a sleepy fishing village a decade ago and now is
a growing city, but is called a "pure land" by tourists.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the city has invested more than ten
billion yuan in fixed assets, mostly in basic facilities, and
enterprises from the US, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the
Republic of Korea, Austria, and Hong Kong region have signed
agreements on eight projects, involving a total investment of two
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were over 640 overseas-funded
enterprises in the city, which had a population of 32,000 in 1975,
but now has 120,000.
</P>
<P>
But, rapid economic development was not going to be obtained at
the expense of the environment, local officials said, and within
five years, the number of environment workers in the city
increased six-fold, and there were nine local environment
regulations or rules.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Hold Third Overnight Talks On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 25 (Xinhua)-- The Israeli-Palestinian
Security Sub-Committee met late Thursday night in Jerusalem to
continue discussions on security arrangements for the 450 Jewish
settlers after partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West
Bank city. The talks lasted till dawn today.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, PLO Secretary- General Abu Mazen
reported both progress and problems after more than two weeks of
negotiations, especially after the two overnight discussions in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, Mazen, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy, said
 that he doubted whether an agreement would be completed in
another overnight session.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy still maintains an upbeat,
saying that an agreement is very near.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross also expressed
optimism that the two sides could wrap up a draft agreement
in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday following the second overnight talks, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu phoned U.S. President Bill Clinton
claiming that Arafat was blocking progress at the talks. Clinton
replied that U.S. envoy Ross would remain in the region for
a few more days in an effort to help bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher also discussed
U.S. strategy with Ross and advised him to stay as long as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat denied that the
Palestinian side was dragging on. Asked to explain why the
talks at one moment seemed close to completion and at another
back where they started, Erekat replied in a humorous way: "I
would say the (Israeli) government sometimes sounds like it has
labor pains, but then it turns out to be a false pregnancy."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Offers Solution to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Mussa has offered a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock
over Hebron -- all 400 Jewish settlers should leave the West Bank
city.
</P>
<P>
"The solution for them to stay is wrong," Mussa told the
Washington Times in what the paper termed as a blunt interview
this week, which was carried by the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Jewish settlers live among 100,000 Arabs in Hebron,
from which Israel should have withdrawn its troops seven months
ago under the 1995 self-rule accords.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if they do stay, the security measures for
them would have to be commensurate with their small number.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for all these complex security
arrangements," he said, in reference to the Israeli demand for
better security guarantees, the right to future expansion of the
settlements and limits on Palestinian building near Jewish areas.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accused the Israeli side of trying to
renegotiating the agreement and strangling the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"An Arab is equal to a Jew, not a millimeter less than that,"
said the minister, adding that if the Israelis abandon its
prejudice and "we will see the signing of something very soon."
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, Mussa said the Israeli government must
recognize the need for compromise on the basis of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
"It's either this or no peace process," Mussa said, noting
that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu could not see that
creating peace without paying the price is impossible.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of U.S. brokered Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations over the troop pullout from Hebron resumed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are balking over a list of Israeli demands
aimed at improving security for the Jewish settlers. Palestinian
negotiators have said they were willing to consider minor
changes, but that the two sides must stick to the terms of the
Hebron redeployment agreed to by Israel's previous government.
</P>
<P>
Mussa also welcomed French President Jacques Chirac's call for
a stronger European role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this call because we think Europe can introduce an
element of balance into the region," he noted, adding that "the
European role should complement and not replace the U.S. role."
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who has visited Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Jordan, is scheduled to leave Lebanon for
Egypt today, the last leg of his tour in the region.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minority Group Bids Farewell to Hunting Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Wu Fugui, a member of the Oroqen
minority, hasn't touched his shotgun in years, having turned to
vegetable-growing, and he's not alone: all the hunters in the
ethnic minority living in north China's Helongjiang Province and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have said good-by to the
sporting life that their ancestors lived for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
Meng Songlin, a magistrate of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner
(county) in Inner Mongolia, says that since the founding of new
China in 1949, the lives of the Oroqen people have seen three
changes, thanks to the country's favorable policies for ethnic
minorities.
</P>
<P>
The first came in 1951 when the Oroqens had all put an end to
their traditional life of going on hunting trips and settled into
the socialist life, and the Chinese Central Government helped them
set up primary schools and provided free medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
The second was in 1988 when the Oroqens began to turn their
single-product economy into a diversified economy, thanks to the
efforts of technicians who taught local hunters how to plant grain
and keep animals.
</P>
<P>
According to Meng, more than 30 private farms have emerged in
the banner, with a total farming area of 1,300 ha, and the
Oroqens, who used to get grain allotments from the state, began to
sell grain to the country.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, 2,130 Oroqens living in the autonomous banner have
been able to provide 1.25 million kg of grain for the state
annually, with their average annual income reaching 1,132 yuan in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The banner declared a "prohibition on hunting" at the beginning
of 1996, marking the final end of the traditional way of life and
ushering in the third change in their mode of production.
</P>
<P>
Meng proudly notes that, "Most Oroqens have mastered a good
number of production skills, including tractor driving, and
operating other agricultural machines, and are competent enough to
cope with modern agricultural production."
</P>
<P>
Wu Yufu, a former hunter, said that his family now not only
plants grain but also breeds edible fungus, and explains that
"fungus alone brings in an annual income of 30,000 yuan."
</P>
<P>
According to Meng, the Oroqens don't hesitate to embrace modern
civilization, and telephones, color TV sets, and washing machines
have all found their ways into ordinary Oroqen homes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the banner's Oroqens are in good position to meet
the challenges of the new century, since their community not only
has a hundred college grads, but even has its own home-grown
post-grads and doctors.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says APEC Meeting in Subic Will Give Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that while the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
meeting in Osaka gave the agenda, the APEC meeting in Subic next
month will give action.
</P>
<P>
In a one-hour tele-press conference here this morning with
American journalists in Washington, Ramos said that he sees three
essential elements of APEC which need to be pursued at the
informal APEC leadership conference on November 25 in Subic, 80
kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, the essential elements are:
</P>
<P>
-- Adoption of the Manila Action Plan for APEC containing plans
of actions which APEC members will take individually and
collectively to begin implementing free trade through the
liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
-- Contribution of APEC to the World Trade Organization
ministerial conference in Singapore in December this year.
</P>
<P>
-- Discussion of new ways of enriching the economic and
technical cooperation among the APEC economies to meet the global
challenges of the future.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that at the Subic meeting next month, the 18 APEC
members will begin the implementation of the free trade goal
agreed by their leaders in Bogor, Indonesia, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders agreed in Bogor that industrialized economies will
achieve the goal of full trade and investment liberalization and
facilitation by 2010 and developing economies by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Last year in Osaka, Japan, APEC leaders adopted the Osaka Actin
Agenda, which serves as the roadway towards the APEC goal.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Ramos also expressed confidence that
the APEC leaders will work together with the private sector to
ensure that the benefits of APEC are spread throughout each and
every economy.
</P>
<P>
"We want -- and need -- to make APEC 'real' for the people of
our region. I am confident that our meeting next month will do
that," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Compact Car Producer Finished B Share Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing-based Chang'an
Automobile Company, China's largest compact car manufacturer, has
closed its offer of 250 million B shares for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The issue raised a total of 586 million yuan (about 70 million
US dollars) for expanded production.
</P>
<P>
The company in Chongqing, Southwest China's Sichuan Province,
built 70,000 compact cars and sold 66,000 units last year, about
20 percent of the country's total sales of such cars.
</P>
<P>
Chang'an is also one of the largest engine producers in China,
as its production capacity reached 90,000 units last year.
</P>
<P>
The funds raised through the share issue are expected to
finance an expansion project, which will enable the company to
produce 150,000 smaller cars, and 240,000 engines and gearboxes a
year.
</P>
<P>
The project, which has been approved and included as a key
project in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000), will also be
supported by the State Development Bank and the Export and Import
Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The shares were issued at a par value of 2.03 yuan per unit,
and will be listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's production of compact cars
grew an average 35.8 percent between 1984 and 1995, far above the
growth rate of 14.7 percent for the entire automobile sector.

JOHANNESBURG, October 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will never threaten to resign as either head of
state or as African National Congress (ANC) chairman and risk
creating unprecedented uncertainty and instability in South
Africa, Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said on Thursday
night.

Mankahlana was denying a newspaper report that Mandela had

Addressing reporters in Cape Town, Mankahlana said: "The
President's Offce cannot understand why this rumour was run as
fact after the Office of the President emphatically indicated to
the newspaper concerned that the story was inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
He said the President's view is that the government's economic
policy will go ahead although its details can still be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in the President's nature to deal with matters of
national concern in a way that prioritises his personal
feelings," Mankahlana added.

</P>
<P>
The facility would provide venture capital to business in the
private sector which has high growth prospects but lacks access
to credit for expansion.
</P>
<P>
The companies set up by the venture capital would be exempted
from paying income tax for 10 years from the date of their
commencement, the paper quoted Kenyan Minister for Finance
Musalia Mudavadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi said that the facility is a welcome development as
deposit-based local financial institutions cannot meet the
growing demand for investment.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that interest rate on bank loans will decline as
venture capital firms introduced the concept of non-debt funding
to Kenyan companies.
</P>
<P>
The current lending rates on bank credit at 20 to 30 percent
are too high to promote investment in the private sector, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The fund will concentrate on making a broad range of
investments in areas such as manufacturing, tourism, agriculture
and agro-processing, mining, property development and financial
services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minority's Historic Government Building Repaired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 24 (Xinhua) -- A 700-year-old building that
was used as the Dai Tusi in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and
which was damaged in last year's earthquake, has been repaired.
</P>
<P>
The Tusi was an hereditary position appointed by the central
government of tribe leaders in ethnic areas of the modern-day
Menglian Dai, Lagu, and Wa Autonomous County,
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that a leader of the Dai set up his
government here in the mid-12th century, ruling over an area of
several hundred square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Scholars say that the building is the best preserved out of 18
Tusi buildings in the province. It was a historical site, but was
damaged by an earthquake in July last year. Repair work started
soon after the earthquake, with financial support from local
people and 600,000 yuan from the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The restored building covers a 7,000-sq-m space, and now serves
as an ethnic history museum, displaying some 500 Tusi relics.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 Chinese and overseas tourists have visited the
site in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Rural Enterprises Under Heated Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Support and criticism
directed towards rural enterprises in China are so strong that the
current debate among the legislators on a new draft rural
enterprises law has become fierce.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say rural enterprises developed since the country's
economic reform and opening up in 1979, have turned out to be a
major components of the national economy. But critics charge that
their operations must be controlled and standardized, because of
fears of further pollution and wastes of resources and energy.
</P>
<P>
After preliminary reviews two months ago, the draft law is now
under consideration during the 22nd meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
However, most of the lawmakers, including Buhe, Ni Zhifu,
vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, agreed that
formulating such a law is necessary for the healthy development of
rural enterprises, and to advance the social and economic
development of the country's vast countryside.
</P>
<P>
"The draft is now basically feasible, and should be put up for
approval next Tuesday," Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Teng Teng, also vice-president of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, said the development of Chinese rural areas, with a
population of 800 million, has mostly relied on the development of
rural enterprises in the past two decades, and it is never too
much to optimize the role they play.
</P>
<P>
But today, rural enterprises are facing increasingly tough
competition from overseas enterprises, just like state-owned
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If no favorable laws and policies are adopted to support such
enterprises, many of them will be broken, and rural development
will be affected," Teng said. Many other additions were made by
lawmakers to protect the rights and interests of rural
enterprises, such as refraining governmental intervention in
management affairs, prohibiting illegal burdens against them, and
improving their operational mechanism.
</P>
<P>
However, Legislator Chi Haibin proposed not adopting such a law
at the present time, saying that it's still a difficult period for
China's industrial production, with its rapid growth and low rate
of return.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this is the over-supply and tax cuts for
overseas-funded and rural enterprises, which result in unfair
competition against state-owned enterprises, and lead to falling
profits for state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the industrial structure is being re-adjusted,
this law, giving too many favorable conditions to rural
enterprises, should not be adopted. If it is, the tax cuts must be
dropped from the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial profit rate is down from 12.6 percent in 1984 to
around 3 percent today, reports say.
</P>
<P>
Legislators say they are satisfied with the limits on pollution
and wasting energy and natural resources in the development of
rural enterprises law.
</P>
<P>
Also being debated is the definition of rural enterprises and
the way they are managed. There are those who say it is especially
important that rules be added stating that enterprises sponsored by
township governments or those not supporting local agricultural
development not be treated as "rural enterprises".
</P>
<P>
"Rural enterprises" must be those owned by farmers and must
support the growth of local agriculture, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Also proposed at the meeting, was the idea that
self-disciplinary bodies be set up for co-ordinating, supervising,
and providing service to rural enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Greener China Means Better China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Increasing afforestation will
be one of China's main efforts in the coming century, and "more
people will come to understand that a greener China will mean a
better China," according to Liu Kun, secretary-general of the
Green China Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Liu, also a former vice-minister of forestry who had been
involved in the country's afforestation work for nearly half a
century, disclosed that the latest statistics show that China's
forest coverage rate has reached 13.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the few nations with a special state ministry
for forestory, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in an interview Thursday that, as a developing country
with the world's largest population and limited forest resources,
China is facing a tough task, and that "many of the current
ecological and environmental problems in our country -- such as
water and soil erosion, desertification, water shortage, and
frequent flooding and droughts -- are all largely attributed to
insufficient or poor-quality forests."
</P>
<P>
He said China has targeted the next century for an economic
take-off, but without greater efforts in afforestation the nation
will hardly accomplish its grand blueprint.
</P>
<P>
"Trees are not planted for today; their benefits will be seen
in the future; they play a crucial role in achieving a balance
between environment and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's forestry work is at an historical turning point in its
development," and it is the high time for all of its citizens to
promote the sense of making their country greener, he said, adding
that "this is not only an economic and ecological issue, but a
social and public welfare project that requires understanding,
support, and participation."
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985, the Green China Foundation is said to have
received more than 15 million yuan worth of donations from China
and abroad, which has been used for 13 forests of friendship or
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
"Through our efforts, more funds are expected to be collected
to contribute to a better China and a better world, but with the
huge task, we still need support," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Encouraging Overseas Investment In State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging overseas
business people to invest in technical improvements in large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, a senior Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national meeting on economic co-operation and
investment policies for central and western China, Yu Xiaosong,
vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said
that the technical transformation of one-third of China's 15,000
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is essential, and
that this offers overseas investors many opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Yu pointed out that China encourages overseas business people
to invest in projects which are in line with the country's
industrial policies rather than just taking advantage of
preferential treatment in various localities.
</P>
<P>
In order to create an atmosphere of fairness, China is
formulating a number of laws, such as the Anti-Monopoly Law, and
corresponding rules and regulations to standardize the market, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese government will increase
investment in the central and western parts of the country, in 18
provinces and autonomous regions. This will help narrow the
economic development gap between these areas and the coastal
regions, which is a major part of China's economic development
blueprint.

FUZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Exports in Fujian Province
recovered their momentum in recent months after a half-year slump,
and hit the 1-billion-US-dollar mark in July and registered the

<P>
A local trade official predicts that the export volume will hit

Fujian is one of China's leading exporters, and has 100

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Collection Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's revenue collection
fell by about TK one billion (about 23.8 million US dollars)
against the target for the first quarter of the current 1996-1997
fiscal year beginning from July 1.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source today, the shortfall occurred
mainly because of the import performance in July and August.
</P>
<P>
The revenue projection for the first quarter had been fixed at
TK 27.25 billion (about 648.8 million dollars) as against the
collection of TK 26.25 billion (about 625 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
But compared with the corresponding period of the last
1995-1996 fiscal, the revenue collection in the first quarter of
1996-1997 increased by TK 1.79 billion (about 42.6 million
dollars), a senior official of the National Board of Revenue said,
adding that the shortfall against the target in the past three
months is expected to be abridged by December with the expansion
of imports by that time.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Squads to Test Vehicle Emission in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Mobile squads of traffic
police will carry out emission tests to vehicles on streets of
this capital city of Nepal in an effort to control the increasing
air pollution in the city, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The concept of such mobile testing squads has been introduced
to make the nearly six-month-old vehicle emission test program
more effective, the report quoted a senior official from the
Ministry of Environment as saying.
</P>
<P>
Records show that about 20,000 vehicles have undergone the
emission test in Kathmandu since the government launched the test
program last May and over half of them passed.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that there are over 100,000 registered
vehicles in the Kathmandu Valley.
</P>
<P>
Under the emission test rules, the maximum emission of
mono-oxide allowed for petrol-fueled vehicles is three percent,
according to traffic police sources.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles which fail the test for two times within a period of
two months would be given red stickers and prohibited from
entering certain places in downtown city including government
office premises, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the Kathmandu Municipality said
recently that the city is planning to keep the diesel-fueled
three-wheelers, or tempos as called by local people, out of the
streets of the city.
</P>
<P>
These vehicles, which local residents depend on heavily for
in-the-city transportation, are mainly responsible for the air
pollution in Kathmandu, they said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Illegal Imports from India Outnumber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Illegal imports of various
commodities into Bangladesh from India are more than one and a
half times the legal imports, a study published here today said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study conducted by a research fellow of the
Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), illegal import
through legal and illegal channels during 1993-94 was estimated at
622 million US dollars as against the legal import to the tune of
413 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the total illegal imports from India in the fiscal, goods
valued at about 519 million dollars entered Bangladesh through
illegal channels while other illegal imports came through legal
channels in collusion with customs officials and through
under-invoicing, the study said, adding that imports with
underpayment of duties accounted for nearly 25 percent of the
legal imports from India.
</P>
<P>
The study also noted that total illegal imports from various
countries constituted nearly 18 percent of all legal imports into
Bangladesh during the same fiscal and the bulk of the illegal
imports came from India.

<HEADLINE> Riots in Florida After Police Shoot Black Motorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 11 people were
injured in a riot Thursday night as angry crowds set fire to
vehicles and businesses after police shot a black motorist during
a traffic stop in St. Petersburg, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The riot, which involved more than 200 people, started in the
evening and continued late into the night as more than 130
officers carrying plastic shields and other riot gear barricaded
streets to contain the violence.
</P>
<P>
A television report said the shooting took place about 5:30
p.m. EDT (17:30 GMT). Police opened fire on the driver of the car
after it lurched forward during the traffic stop in a
predominantly black neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The man, who hasn't been identified, died before reaching
Bayfront Medical Center, a hospital spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings were burning out of control as the violence
kept firefighters away.
</P>
<P>
Groups of youths ran back and forth in the night, threw rocks
and bottles, aiming at the officers as well as businesses and
passing cars.
</P>
<P>
Three downtown hospitals treated and released 11 people,
including two police officers, with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The White House expressed immediate concern about the riot.
"We're making inquiries of local officials for an assessment of
the situation," White House press secretary Mike McCurry said from
New Orleans, where he was on a campaign trip with President Bill
Clinton.

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- India and the United States
have agreed to further enhance their existing defense cooperation
after a two-day meeting here of the two countries' defense policy
group.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed on early finalization of a
three-year program on cooperation between their defense forces
which provides for professional interaction and joint exercises at
progressively higher levels of scale and sophistication, Defense
Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to formalize a program for 1997-2000 followed
satisfaction expressed by both sides over the joint exercises and
so on during the program that has been drawn up for 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
Indo-US military cooperation was reviewed at the just concluded
second meeting of the defense policy group which oversees the
service-to-service interaction. The group had been set up under
the agreed minute on defense cooperation formalized when American
Defense Secretary William Perry visited India in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had a "detailed exchange of views on their
security perceptions in the Asia Pacific region, and on issues of
mutual concern relating to worldwide terrorism, maintenance of
international peace and security through UN peacekeeping
operations," the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides reiterated the importance of enhancing Indo-US
defense cooperation as an important part of the overall bilateral
relationship," the sources added.

JAKARTA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Australia have

Organization (WTO), official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made by visiting Australian Deputy Prime

was quoted as saying after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also Australian Trade Minister, said Indonesia
and Australia were both in "full support" of China's entry,
subject to a round of negotiations set to resume in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner this issue is progressed the better for global
trade liberalization and for the momentum of the WTO," he noted.

Fischer said progress should be made on the issue before a WTO
ministerial meeting scheduled for December in Singapore, where
China's WTO participation is expected to be a key topic.

NEW DELHI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's multinational company
Citizen is setting up shops in India for manufacture and marketing
of its world famous watches.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company is entering the Indian market through a

</P>
<P>
The joint venture with Japan holding 51 percent stake will
assemble, produce and market watches using the Citizen technology

</P>
<P>
Citizen is understood to be very keen on developing a strong
vendor base in India as the company has plans to procure
components from here for export.
</P>
<P>
This is viewed as a significant move as, of late, more and more
overseas companies, particularly Japanese ones, are shifting their
souring base to India because of the rising production costs and
environmental problems in their own countries.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Economy Falls by 10 percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's total output fell 10
per cent to 257 billion leva (1.1 billion US dollars) in September
over the same period in 1995, the lowest figure for the year so
far.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today by the Bulgarian State Statistics Bureau
show industrial and agricultural production for the first nine
months of this year fell by two percentage points over the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest in a series of poor economic figures from
Bulgaria which is facing a severe economic and financial crisis as
it tries to transform its state-controlled economy into a
market-led system.
</P>
<P>
The country has been slow to implement politically unpopular
reforms which involve closing dozens of loss-making state
enterprises. The International Monetary Fund has said it won't
provide fresh loans to the country until the government fulfills
its reform pledges.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has soared and is forecast to exceed 200 percent this
year. The central bank is running out of foreign reserves to
import fuel and wheat and to prop up the currency, which has been
devalued by some 230 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has risen to 12.5 percent and is forecast to rise
further, and gross domestic product, a measure of economic growth,
is falling.
</P>
<P>
The total output of farm produce in Bulgaria in 1995 was one
third of 1992 and the country, which used to grow enough food to
feed three times its nine million population, now has to import
grain.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador, Peru to Resume Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador and Peru are ready to
discuss again a thorny border dispute that led to the two
countries to a military confrontation last year.
</P>
<P>
With final preparations already finished, the meeting, between
foreign ministers from the two countries, is scheduled to take
place next Monday in the Chilean capital Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has proposed to create a special mechanism to eliminate
disagreement that might emerge during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peru responded that all must be subjected to a peace deal
signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in February 1995 that ended a
one-month conflict between Ecuador and Peru.
</P>
<P>
About 50 people were killed and more than 100 were wounded in
the conflict over a disputed stretch of undemarcated border in the
Condor range of Andes between January 26 and February 22, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Luigi Ennaudi, U.S. special advisor on the
Ecuador-Peru border issue, visited Quito to seek a formula of
consensus and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Ennaudi had also traveled to Lima before going to Argentina,
Brazil and Chile, which together with the United States are four
guarantor countries of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran officials said the forthcoming meeting will focus on
the implementation of the Itamaraty Peace Statement, signed by
Ecuador and Peru in February 1995 under international mediation.
</P>
<P>
The sixth point of the statement calls for talks on a solution
to the remaining disagreements in territorial matters as soon as
the first five points on ceasefire and demilitarization are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador has claimed it has complied with the statement and
criticized Peru for not complying with it.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Ex-Defense Minister Questioned on Graft Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution has
summoned former Defense Minister Lee Yang-ho for questioning on
graft charges, a prosecutor said today.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's move against Lee, 59, who was defense
minister until October 17, was taken last night.
</P>
<P>
Lee allegedly received 187,000 U.S. dollars in bribes from
Daewoo Heavy Industries Company through an arms dealer in April
1995 in connection with an army helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
The suspicion goes that the former official pocketed the money
from Daewoo in return for a state license to participate in the
arms buildup program.
</P>
<P>
Questioning of three top Daewoo officials during the past fews
days backed an allegation made by the arms dealer Kwon Pyong-ho
that he received 374,000 U.S. dollars from Daewoo and gave half of
the money to Lee, the prosecutor added.
</P>
<P>
Chung Ho-shin, who was vice president of Daewoo Heavy
Industries Company last year, was quoted as saying that he
delivered to Kwon two bags each containing 187,000 U.S. dollars in
cash, asking Kwon for his cooperation in securing a contract for
the company's army helicopter project bid.
</P>
<P>
If the charges are substantiated in the questioning, the
prosecution plans to seek an arrest warrant against Lee.
</P>
<P>
On October 19, South Korean President Kim Young-sam instructed
the prosecution to thoroughly investigate the corruption scandal
involving the former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Those found to have been involved in corruption or any
irregularities should be punished strictly by law, regardless of
their positions, said Kim.

JAKARTA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia has agreed to support
Indonesia's stance that non-trade issues should not be raised at
the upcoming ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
At the third Australia-Indonesia ministerial forum here
Thursday, Australia agreed to join forces with Indonesia and other
developing countries to try to keep labor and other contentious
issues off the agenda at the inaugural ministerial conference of
the World Trade Organization in Singapore in December, official
sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade Tim
Fischer said, after meeting Indonesian Industry and Trade Minister
Tunky Ariwibowo, that Australia shares common ground with
Indonesia on the discussion of labor and trade linkages and other
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Thursday to attend the forum, said
any discussion on labor should occur at the international labor
organization because "it is not a core issue of the WTO."
</P>
<P>
He also said Indonesia and Australia agreed to support China's
entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important that China, with its hugely growing
economy, becomes a WTO member sooner rather than later," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between Indonesia and Australia reached 2.3
billion US dollars last year, with Australia enjoying a surplus of
some 500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first Australia-Indonesia ministerial forum was held in
Jakarta in 1992 and the second in Canberra in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Yingkou Launches Container Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Yingkou, Liaoning province, has
begun regular international container service to a number of
countries and regions, including the Republic of Korea, Japan and
Hong Kong and other world ports, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The services are offered by the newly established Yingkou Cosco
International Container Harbor Co Ltd, a joint venture between the
port city and the China Ocean Shipping Co (Cosco), the largest
ocean-shipping company in China.
</P>
<P>
Cosco is the only modern wharf company with both transportation
and port advantages in Northeast China, and the only company
engaged in container wharf services in Yingkou Port.
</P>
<P>
The company boasts an annual handling capacity of 15,000 TEUs
(twenty-feet equivalent unit) and 309 meters of wharf line, which
can accommodate one 15,000- or two 5,000-ton container ships.
</P>
<P>
An old port with a history of more than 130 years, Yingkou's
9.5-meter deep channels do not freeze all year round. It handles
11.53 million tons of cargo annually, including metal ore,
fertilizer, aluminium powder and other cargo.
</P>
<P>
Yingkou Port neighbors eight major industrial cities in the
middle of Liaodong Peninsula, which takes 75 percent of the
container cargo in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Geographical advantages make Li Kelin, vice-president of Cosco
and Huang Enyuan, chief of Yingkou Port, confident about the
development of the container services. They are proud that the
services of the new company will boost the economic development of
the three provinces in Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Yingkou Port now operates 22 voyages every month, compared with
six in the past.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Withdraw Troops from Tajik-Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia today denied it plans to
withdraw its Border Guard troops from the border between
Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"If we withdraw troops from the area, Russian security would be
under threat, which is equally to say that we open our doors to
the thieves," Interfax News Agency quoted a Russian Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Border Guard troops are responsible for
safeguarding the Tajik-Afghan border, which is also seen as the
border of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), because
the ability of these two countries to control the border region is
very limited," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Tajik President
Imomali Rakhmonov agreed at a CIS summit in early October to
strengthen security along the remote and mountainous border.
</P>
<P>
The border, which was peaceful during the Soviet Union era,
went out of control after the collapse of the bloc in 1991 and has
become an important route for drug-smuggling in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the "poppy center" has moved from
Myanmar into Afghanistan, where the climate as well as the
situation of paralysed government are suitable to grow poppies
from which drugs such as cocaine are made.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.5 tons of drugs were found in the border area in the
first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik-Afghan border is also a route used by criminals and
arms dealers to get into the CIS, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between Russia and Tajikistan, Russia kept
thousands of border guards stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border
to safeguard the CIS area, after the former Soviet Union collapsed
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But Tajik Islamist guerrillas regularly cross over from bases
inside Afghanistan into Tajikistan to battle government troops in
the republic's four-year civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 veteran Red Army
soldiers, Eighth Route Army soldiers and retired government
officials have established a society here to study the Chinese
patriotic philosophy known as the "Yan'an Spirit."
</P>
<P>
Yan'an in northwest China's Shaanxi Province was the
headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party during the War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
Yan'an Spirit asks people to be practical and realistic, to
uphold the truth, to correct mistakes, to blaze new trails, and to
work hard for the benefit of the people.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the society is to study, publicize, inherit and
develop the Yan'an Spirit formed during the War.
</P>
<P>
The society plans to develop the spirit among the people,
especially among youngsters, in order to speed up China's economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
Lectures and exhibitions will be held and works on Yan'an
Spirit will be published, according to the head of the
society.

<P>
VIENNA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Chancellor of
Austria Franz Vranitzky said today his country hopes to normalize
relations with Yugoslavia and strengthen economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement during talks with visiting Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic, who arrived on Wednesday for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel told Milutinovic he hoped both countries would soon sign
an investment protection agreement, marking the first step towards
restoration of their once close economic ties.

<P>
Austria suspended diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia in 1992,

the first government official from the new Yugoslavia, comprising
Montenegro and Serbia, to visit Austria since it restored
recognition in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Austria had signed 15 cooperation agreements with the former
Yugoslavia and wants to reactivate them, Schuessel said.

<HEADLINE> Clock's Advance Cut by Half Hour in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to put the clock back by half an hour at midnight
Saturday, October 26, according to an official press release
today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sri Lanka will be six hours ahead of the Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT).
</P>
<P>
In view of the power crisis which prevailed during the first
half of this year, the government, as a measure to conserve
electricity, decided to set the clock forward by one hour. This
decision came into effect on May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
This measure made it possible to conserve a considerable amount
of power as anticipated in addition to other benefits thanks to
the availability of more day time.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, certain sectors reportedly faced difficulties
due to the failure of the transportation system to make changes to
keep up with the advanced time. It has also been observed that
these difficulties would be compounded in the coming months as the
sunrise will be later.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources said that considering the benefits
and difficulties it has become clear that it would be more
suitable to maintain the Sri Lankan time six hours ahead of the
GMT. This means that the prevailing time should be put back by
half an hour.

<HEADLINE> Parties With No Seats Must Return Election Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly two thirds of the 33
political parties that took part in Sunday's general elections in
Nicaragua failed to win a single seat in the new parliament and
now face having to return government money used to fund their
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Twenty parties failed to secure the minimum 27,000 ballots
needed to win a seat in the 90-seat National Assembly and now have
to return about 1 million cordobas (11,600 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with electoral law, those political parties that
do not win one seat in the Parliament must return the funds to the
state over a five-year term," a General Comptrollership official,
Juan Peters, said today.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's election, Nicaraguans voted for a president, a
vice-president, 90 National Assembly deputies, 145 mayors and town
councils and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reports from more than 85 percent of the polling stations, put
Arnoldo Aleman, the Liberal Alliance presidential candidate and a
former Managua mayor, in the lead with 49.3 percent of the vote,
against 38.1 percent for former president Daniel Ortega of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN).
</P>
<P>
Under Nicaragua's electoral law, the candidate who receives
more than 45 percent of the votes can be declared the winner but a
second round of voting must be held if none of the candidates
passes the 45 percent mark.
</P>
<P>
But the final official results of the elections may not be
known for another week because of complaints by the FSLN and
several other parties about irregularities in the voting.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) said Wednesday that the
results could be delayed until early November, to give election
observers time to compare results sent from polling stations by
telegram with the results posted at each site.
</P>
<P>
Ortega, president between 1985 and 1990, alleged Monday that
telegrams used to report provincial results to the CSE were
"altered" and did not reflect the number of votes his party
obtained .
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one of the international
observers monitoring the elections, said the CSE had promised to
provide copies of the telegrams to those political parties to
enable them to double-check the results. International observers
described the elections as generally "fair."

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Rural Enterprises Under Heated Debate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Support and criticism directed
towards rural enterprises in China are so strong that the current
debate among the legislators on a new draft rural enterprises law
has become fierce.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say rural enterprises developed since the country's
economic reform and opening up in 1979, have turned out to be a
major components of the national economy. But critics charge that
their operations must be controlled and standardized, because of
fears of further pollution and wastes of resources and energy.
</P>
<P>
After preliminary reviews two months ago, the draft law is now
under consideration during the 22nd meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
However, most of the lawmakers, including Buhe, Ni Zhifu,
vice-chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee, agreed that
formulating such a law is necessary for the healthy development of
rural enterprises, and to advance the social and economic
development of the country's vast countryside.
</P>
<P>
"The draft is now basically feasible, and should be put up for
approval next Tuesday," Buhe said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Teng Teng, also vice-president of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, said the development of Chinese rural areas, with a
population of 800 million, has mostly relied on the development of
rural enterprises in the past two decades, and it is never too
much to optimize the role they play.
</P>
<P>
But today, rural enterprises are facing increasingly tough
competition from overseas enterprises, just like state-owned
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If no favorable laws and policies are adopted to support such
enterprises, many of them will be broken, and rural development
will be affected," Teng said. Many other additions were made by
lawmakers to protect the rights and interests of rural
enterprises, such as refraining governmental intervention in
management affairs, prohibiting illegal burdens against them, and
improving their operational mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Continues to Work Before Heart Operation: Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has been working while preparing for a heart operation, his wife
has told the Russian Public Television.
</P>
<P>
Naina Yeltsin said during the interview, which was aired today,
that the president was very busy every morning, either on the
phone or at meetings, at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
She said her whole family tried to ease him of extra burden
following the September 5 announcement of doctors' recommendation
about his surgery, but the president "never listened to anyone."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin wanted to work so long as he could stand up and he
wanted to have the operation as soon as possible, the Russian
first lady said.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Yeltsin's daughters and grandchildren and
other family members often came to visit and bring the president a
great comfort, she said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's doctors have said that his heart surgery would take
place next month and the preparations for the procedure were under
way.

<HEADLINE> Jiaodong Peninsula Prospers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven industrial cities,
like "a string of glistening pearls," have emerged on the horizon
at Jiaodong Peninsula, east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The newly linked cities, which are connected by rail and
expressways, are thriving as the most robust and dynamic city
group in all of North China.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" said that with cities like Yantai, Qingdao,
Weihai and Weifang, the Jiaodong Peninsula has an area of 45,700
square kilometers and a population of 24 million, of which 760,000
are urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Among the coastal cities opened to the outside, the four cities
have developed their economies rapidly and helped fuel the
development of another group of newly founded industrial cities.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that the gross domestic product
(GDP) of the 27 cities of the peninsula was up to 208.4 billion
yuan (25.1 billion US dollars) last year and the per capita GDP
was 9,717 yuan (1,170.7 US dollars), which is about three times
the national per capital in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-year Plan Period (1991-1995), these
cities registered an average annual increase of 22.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 23 county-level cities, 11 have entered the list of China's
top 100 cities. Some 15 county-level cities have brought their
industrial output sales up to 4 billion yuan (482 million US
dollars), and four of them up to 7 billion yuan (843.4 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Convenient transportation forged the basis for the fast
development. The four airports in the peninsula have opened about
100 air routes with cities at home and abroad. Five opening sea
ports can handle up to 110 million tons of cargo a year. An
expressway and first-rate roads connect these cities, which
shorten the traffic time between them to one hour.
</P>
<P>
"The peninsula's development owes a debt of gratitude to the
policy of opening to the outside world," said Ren Haishen, mayor
of Yantai. "In 12 years, 3,800 joint ventures have been
established in Yantai. The 2.6 billion US dollars investment has
quickened our development," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
The seven county-level cities under the administration of
Yantai all grew into industrial cities from rural counties and
towns in the period of 15 years of opening to the outside.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guodong, vide-director of the Shandong Foreign Trade and
economics Commission, said that the city group, which is very
alluring to foreign investors, is the spearhead of Shandong's
opening.
</P>
<P>
There are 12,500 foreign-funded enterprises in these cities
which have put 8.2 billion US dollars into production and the city
group has become the focus of overseas investment in Shandong.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Rural Enterprises Under Heated Debate (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Legislator Chi Haibin proposed not adopting such a law
at the present time, saying that it's still a difficult period for
China's industrial production, with its rapid growth and low rate
of return.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this is the over-supply and tax cuts for
overseas-funded and rural enterprises, which result in unfair
competition against state-owned enterprises, and lead to falling
profits for state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the industrial structure is being re-adjusted,
this law, giving too many favorable conditions to rural
enterprises, should not be adopted. If it is, the tax cuts must be
dropped from the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial profit rate is down from 12.6 percent in 1984 to
around 3 percent today, reports say.
</P>
<P>
Legislators say they are satisfied with the limits on pollution
and wasting energy and natural resources in the development of
rural enterprises law.
</P>
<P>
Also being debated is the definition of rural enterprises and
the way they are managed. There are those who say it is especially
important that rules be added stating that enterprises sponsored by
township governments or those not supporting local agricultural
development not be treated as "rural enterprises".
</P>
<P>
"Rural enterprises" must be those owned by farmers and must
support the growth of local agriculture, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Also proposed at the meeting, was the idea that
self-disciplinary bodies be set up for co-ordinating, supervising,
and providing service to rural enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Offers Truce to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
offered a temporary ceasefire to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) guerrillas in the southern Philippines, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, vice chairman for military affairs of the MILF,
said the ceasefire offer was made through presidential executive
secretary Ruben Torres in a letter delivered to his group.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the offer involved the signing of an interim truce
and the creation of two technical committees, one to work out the
ground rules of the ceasefire and the other to discuss the content
of the coming formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are still studying the proposal," said Murad, adding
however that his group wanted the "ground rules" for how the
ceasefire would be established before any signing.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that clashes between members of the "Lost
Command" under the MILF and government troops have entered the
fifth day today, with more than 25 rebels having been killed and
some others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting has centered on a Japanese-funded
irrigation dam near the town of Carmen in Basilan province in
Mindanao which the MILF claims as its territory. Hundreds of
people have fled the area in fear of danger.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government was holding exploratory talks with
the MILF in preparations for formal talks. The insurgent group has
been opposing the final peace agreement signed earlier by the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front and vowed to
seek Muslim independence in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes to Scale Down Trade Surplus with Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
called for joint efforts to scale down the trade surplus with
Egypt in favor of China, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the third session of the Sino-Egyptian Economic and
Trade Joint Committee, Chinese Minister Wu Yi of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation said yesterday that China does not want to
see a trade surplus with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
She said China is looking forward to importing more Egyptian
commodities.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries stood at 450 million
U.S. dollars in 1995, of which China enjoyed a surplus because of
an advantage in exporting certain commodities such as shoes and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is rich in cotton, but prices are too high for the
sluggish Chinese textile industry to bear, said Wu, adding that
China is also a big cotton producer and it had a bumper harvest
this year.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between the two countries have achieved
remarkable success since China established diplomatic relations
with Egypt 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ahamed Goueli, minister of trade and supply for the Arab
Republic of Egypt, said the Egyptian Products Exhibition that
opened in Beijing yesterday offers an opportunity for Chinese to
select suitable goods and for Egyptians to increase exports to
China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said Egypt may increase the export of aluminium ingots to
China. She said Egypt will have a certain share in the Chinese
clothing market.
</P>
<P>
Goueli said Egypt invites Chinese entrepreneurs to contract
projects there, and encourages them to set up joint ventures in
the Sues Free Zone.
</P>
<P>
Chinese entrepreneurs are able to know more about Egypt through
the exhibition, the chinese minister said.

BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Haier Group, one of China's
largest home appliances manufacturers, has inked contracts worth
112 million US dollars during the 80th session of the Chinese
Export Commodity Fair held in Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven days, Haier Group ranked first in sales
contracts in the home electronic appliances sector, which achieved
a sales volume of 251 million US dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
"Heier's name is our main advantage to win in the fair," said Wu
Kesong, vice-president of Haier Group Co, who expressed
satisfaction with the volume.
</P>
<P>
Haier's primary products, including refrigerators, washing
machines, air conditioners and freezers, have been ordered by
foreign traders.
</P>
<P>
Haier began to export products with their own brand name in
early 1995, when all the export products were labelled with
foreign trade marks.
</P>
<P>
"To create an international brand is the goal of our global
promotion strategy," said Wu, who expects this year's profits in
foreign currency to be 45 percent higher than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Star-Rated Pleasure Boats to Sail in Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A classification project to
give star ratings to pleasure boats in the Yangtze River, the
longest river in China, is underway.
</P>
<P>
The first group of star-rated boats will be selected at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
With the smooth development of the "Three Gorges Project" in
the Yangtze River, the famous scenic spot of the "Three Gorges"
has become another tourism hot spot.
</P>
<P>
The local tourism market went into a slump in 1994, with bad
management blamed for the bleak market. The pleasure boats in the
Yangtze River had no strict quality standards.
</P>
<P>
To win more passengers, some cut prices drastically, others
self-claimed themselves as luxury boats.
</P>
<P>
The disorder of the market led to a decline, both in service
quality and satisfaction rate among customers.
</P>
<P>
The National Tourism Administration began to lay down the
star-classification standard for pleasure boats in 1994. After two
year's work, the standard took effect in November, 1995. A
national star classification committee for pleasure boats has been
established to improve the administration of the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 24 (Xinhua) -- An international convention
setting down safety standards for nuclear power plants came into
force today, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
announced.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA said 27 countries have ratified the Convention on
Nuclear Safety, including Britain, China, France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The convention, adopted in June 1994, could only go into force
90 days after ratification by 21 countries. The United States has
not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were some 476 nuclear power plants operating or
being built around the world. The pact aims to achieve and
maintain a high level of nuclear safety through international
cooperation and requires signatory countries to report on the
implementation of its rules every three years.
</P>
<P>
Countries must report on the status of their current land-based
civil nuclear power plants and their plans to expand the industry,
including the siting and design of new plants.
</P>
<P>
The document also sets out a framework for a review of a
nation's atomic sites by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring states may call for an urgent study if they are
concerned about a reactor's safety and a possible radioactive
fallout accident affecting their own people and crops.

BEIJING, October 25 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of an agency

WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Richard Jewell is now a
"former suspect" in a bomb explosion during the Atlanta Olympics
this summer which left two dead and 112 injured, a judge said in
Atlanta on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta federal judge Owen Forrester gave the FBI five days to
release documents on which it based its presumption of Jewell's
guilt.
</P>
<P>
"The court concludes that the Jewell chapter of the Centennial
Olympic Park bombing investigation has been closed," the judge
wrote in a 20-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
"The court concludes that the government's interest in
protecting an ongoing investigation would not be compromised by
the release of historical information pertaining only to a known
former suspect," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Jewell was working as a security guard in the Olympic
Centennial Park on July 27 when he reported spotting a suspicious
package that exploded minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Jewell, who was once hailed as a hero but later called as a
suspect, insists he is innocent and has threatened to sue the FBI
and media organizations for defaming him.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
who is seeking re-election, said Thursday his differences with Bob
Dole don't involve labels or who is "a good person or a bad
person," but what's right and wrong for American people.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his record proves he has the right answers.
</P>
<P>
"Even though our friends on the other side don't like to admit
it, we are better off than we were four years ago," news reports
quoted Clinton as saying in Birmingham, Alabama, a state with a
Republican pattern in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole campaigned
at the Alabama capital in Montgomery, trying to preserve what the
polls indicate is a narrow Republican lead.
</P>
<P>
Later, both Dole and Clinton attended rival rallies about five
miles apart in Louisiana, Clinton from an industrial park at Lake
Charles and Dole from the heart of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who eluded direct replies to Dole's assaults on his
integrity and ethics, said the November 5 election is "not a
question of who's good and bad. It's a question of what's right
and wrong for our people."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also is targeting other states in the South, once
considered generally safe territory for a Republican ticket. He
was in Florida on Wednesday. He will campaign in Georgia on
Friday, with Texas and Arizona among other likely stops in the
final days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
In conservative country, Clinton described his proposals on
school uniforms, youth curfews, drug testing for driver's licenses
for teen-agers as local initiatives that can have a national
impact in making schools and children safer.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic policies are working," he claimed. "Our crime
policies are working."

WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it would not accept a demand from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to apologize for an American who
DPRK claimed to be spying for South Korea in the country.
</P>
<P>
DPRK's Central News Agency said on Thursday that Carl Hunziker,
who was arrested after entering the country in August, was not a
missionary as he himself claimed because he did not know the Ten
Commandments or how to pray.
</P>
<P>
DPRK said the situation would only get "gloomier" if the United
States do not want to apologize for the incident.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States adopts a negative attitude... toward the
spy case... the possibility of a solution will be gloomier,"
DPRK's Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has repeatedly said Hunziker, 26, was
not a spy, rejected to apologize, instead, it demanded an
immediately release of Hunziker.
</P>

"There's going to be no apology from the United States," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "We demand his release."

<HEADLINE> Britain Disagrees with EU Flexible Pacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind warned today that French and German plans to allow
some European Union (EU) states to integrate faster than others
would have to be approved by all 15 member states.
</P>
<P>
Paris and Bonn on Tuesday unveiled their plan designed to allow
EU states to push ahead with joint ventures without being held up
by reluctant partners such as Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the parliament today, Rifkind said that any
cooperation venture which involved European institutions or funds
would require unanimous approval before a small group could go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"That is not for some theoretical or ideological reason, it is
because having access to European institutions means the European
Commission will be involved, the European Court will be involved
and the budget will be involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's worry was over pacts involving EU funds and
institutions like the court of justice, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said, "None of us have any doubts that the European
union of the future will be flexible... it is how it will work,
what the institutional implications will be and how the interests
of minorities as well as majorities can be properly safeguarded."
</P>
<P>
He warned that a rush to accept flexible pacts without
considering the consequences was dangerous.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ready to Lead Fight against Terrorism, Ghali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called today for a
comprehensive legal forces and global effort to fight against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum at Harvard University tonight, the
Secretary-General said that now terrorism has grown from a
national to an international and to a global threat. "The
communications revolution, the private global economy and the
increasingly "borderless" world we live in provide conditions
which terrorists can exploit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nations are recognizing the importance of a global approach to
defeat terrorism, the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
He gave out the principles set at the Summit of the
Peace-makers in Egypt in March and the Declaration on Terrorism of
the Group of Seven Summit in Lyon, France, in June, which declared
the will of the international community to enhance the capacity to
defeat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general called for a comprehensive legal
framework for the fight against international terrorism in all its
aspects, no matter what kinds of difficulties involved.
</P>
<P>
He also gave a review of the 11 international conventions
deposited with the United Nations that address crimes associated
with terrorism of different forms.
</P>
<P>
Ghali said the task to combat terrorism will be threefold in
the future. First, the international conventions should be used as
a platform for immediate global action to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, "We must rally the political will to overcome
the difficulties of international cooperation and coordination."
</P>
<P>
The third aspect is to widen the network of legally binding
international conventions to address the key counter-terrorist
subjects not covered by these instruments, such as bombing,
fund-raising, traffic in arms, technical cooperation in training
for counter-terrorism, exchange of information on suspects and
preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It has become possible to tackle the question of international
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, in all its
specificities, according to Ghali.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the unique role of the United Nations in
leading the anti-terrorism activities. The United Nations "stand
ready both to lead and to serve in this effort," he said.

<HEADLINE> Developing Courtyards Becoming Important In East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 25 (Xinhua) -- A kind of "courtyard economy" has
been playing a growing role in the countryside in east China's
Anhui province, and could become another pillar of the economy in
agriculture in the next few years, augmenting farming and rural
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the courtyards of farm houses
have a total area of about 530,000 ha., and planting medicinal
herbs and raising domestic animals have become a major activity in
the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
Annual incomes of farmers in Mengcheng, China's largest cattle
raising county, rose by 40 percent after the courtyard economy was
developed. Some 270,000 households are giving straw to cattle in
their courtyards, where each one has more than three head of
cattle on average.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have set up a group of key enterprises by
providing favorable credit and loans and tax policies, and to
date, some 100 key enterprises, more than 30 villages and 10
production bases in the province are planting medicinal herbs,
growing vegetables and edible Fungi, and breeding cocoons for
silk.

<HEADLINE> Morrison to Return to Ring after Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- HIV-infected former
heavyweight contender Tommy Morrison said on Thursday he will
return to the ring eight months after retiring, according to a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Morrison said he will fight on the undercard of the George
Foreman/Crawford Grimsley title fight in Tokyo on November 2.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, who retired from boxing in February after testing
positive for the virus that causes AIDS, signed a contract to
fight an undetermined opponent.
</P>
<P>
The bout appears to be a tuneup for a pay-per-view rematch
between Foreman and Morrison early next year. Morrison handed
Foreman one of his four career losses in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Morrison (45-3-1) has stated that proceeds from the fight
will benefit children with HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Since he is unlikely to obtain a license to fight in the
United States, Morrison will probably have to fight overseas if
he wants to continue his career.

<HEADLINE> British Beef Safe to Eat: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major insisted today that British beef is safe to eat despite of
new scientific findings linking mad cow disease with the human
equivalent, CJD.
</P>
<P>
A team of British scientists reported Wednesday that they have
discovered a critical similarity between the new type of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) which has infected humans and
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle.
</P>
<P>
The finding adds powerful backing to claims that mad cow
disease has been transmitted to humans through infected beef.
</P>
<P>
But Major said that Britain has been acting along this
assumption since March and has taken strict measures to ensure
that infectious beef is kept out of the food supply.
</P>
<P>
"There's no new fresh public health concern. People can eat
beef as safely today as they could yesterday, and I think it's
perfectly safe," he said on BBC television today.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister added that there is no justification for the
European Union (EU) to harden its stance against lifting its world
ban on British beef exports due to the new findings, saying that
"there is no need for the European Union to panic and change its
views".
</P>
<P>
He was backed by Commons leader Tony Newton, who said today
that the new discovery will not affect government policy since the
government has already been acting on advice that there might be
such a connection.
</P>
<P>
John Pattison, senior government scientific adviser on mad cow
disease, held the same opinion. "All the necessary restrictions on
infected British beef going into the human food chain are now in
place," he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
However, Franz Fischler, the EU Agriculture Commissioner, is
reportedly to have said today that the EU embargo on British beef
exports will remain.
</P>
<P>
"What the British scientists have discovered shows how serious
the crisis is," Fischler said.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the ban in March after the UK first reported a
suspected link.

<P>
LONDON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that it was very likely Poland would be one
of the new members the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
is planning to admit in three years' time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with visiting Polish
President Aleksander Kwaskniewski, Major said, "I think Poland is
a primary applicant for membership of NATO. I know that is very
much the wish of the Polish government, and I think the British
government see them as a future member as well."
</P>
<P>
Major also rendered strong support to Poland's parallel bid to
join the European Union (EU). "The sooner that enlargement goes
ahead the better," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Polish president said that his country saw membership of
NATO and the EU as historical opportunities not to be missed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Put Investment on Top Priority: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy
Nawal Tatawi said today Egypt will put investment on top priority
and will need 1,500 billion Egyptian pounds (441 billion
U.S. dollars) in the coming 20 years to energize its modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
The government in the coming stage will focus its basic task on
attracting investment, Tatawi said, addressing the opening
session of a conference on the management of investments and
exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the national modernization plan aims to get
Egypt "out from the narrow Nile valley to the horizons of
development in all directions," adding that if the plan goes well,
20 percent of Egyptian land will be turned into urban,
agricultural and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
About 4 percent of the territories is inhabited by nearly 99
percent of the Egyptian population, who habitually gather along
River Nile, around the Suez Canal or in the oases.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of Egypt's new two-year economic reform program
strengthened the confidence of foreign businessmen in the climate
of investment in the largest African country, she said.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the program, which is the third stage of
Egypt's economic reform, the Paris Club will write off Egypt's
third part of its foreign debts, which is about 4 billion
U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor
Song Jian remarked today that the Sino-US science and technology
cooperation has been "flourishing", and appealed American
entrepreneurs to participate in the joint programs in the field.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-US science and technology cooperation is highly appraised
and supported by both government," Dr. Song, who is also Minister
of State Science &AMP; Technology Commission of China, made the speech
to representatives from industrial community at a luncheon hosted
by the US-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Agreement of Cooperation in Science and Technology"
signed by Deng Xiaoping and former US President Jimmy Carter, Dr.
Song said, scientists and engineers from the two countries have
been working together effectively in a wide range of fields.
</P>
<P>
"To China, scientific research and its exchange and cooperation
with outside world has dramatically propelled the process of its
reform, opening and social progress," Dr. Song said, and "the
cooperation on science and technology is the most effective way"
leading to further economic and commercial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the minister said, some famous American companies
such as Ford Auto Corporation, IBM and IGCC (Integrated
Gasification Combined Cycle), started their cooperative research
programs with China.
</P>
<P>
"We find ourselves at a unique moment in human history on the
planet,...a time not only of unprecedented problems but also of
unprecedented opportunities..." Dr. Song quoted a Harvard
University scientist as saying and called for US business
community to "join us" through participating in the bilateral
science and technology cooperative programs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Song Arrived here Wednesday evening for the 7th Joint
Commission Meeting on Science and Technology Cooperation. The
Chinese delegation and officials of the White House Office of

<HEADLINE> UK Businessmen Urged to Grasp Opportunities in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EDINBURGH, England, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's senior
trade commissioner in Hong Kong Francis Cornish said here today
that Britain has "huge business interests" in Hong Kong after 1997
and he encouraged British businessmen to take the golden chance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the one-day business conference entitled "Hong
Kong, 1997 and Beyond" held here today, Cornish said that
Britain's investment in Hong Kong has increased dramatically "with
one thousand British firms there and with 28 percent of Britain's
total foreign investment".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Hong Kong is, without doubt, British businesses'
"most important foothold in the Asia Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner warned his countrymen not to ignore the
transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997 as Hong Kong "is
likely to remain an extremely good market in its own right and is
likely to remain one of the principal business hubs in the
region."
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to say that as the clock ticks closer to the day
the areas where difficulties remain are diminishing. The
atmosphere between Britain and China, both bilateral and over Hong
Kong, is much improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that Hong Kong will continue to be "the bridge
to China" in the years beyond 1997, and therefore British
companies which are already in Hong Kong, should make great
efforts to "look after their existing customers" in order to
maintain their footholds there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he encouraged other British companies not yet there
to grasp the golden chance of doing business in Hong Kong by
saying "my advice is do your homework and try it."
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities in Hong Kong are enormous and there is no
easier point of access to the Asia Pacific region more widely," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Troops Fighting in Zaire: Hutus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 24 (Xinhua) -- Exiled Rwandan Hutus claimed
today that over 1,000 Rwandan troops are fighting alongside
Banyamulenge rebels against Zaire's soldiers in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Innocent Butare, Executive Director for the exiled Rally for
the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR), claimed
that his group has accurate intelligence which pointed to Rwandan
military involvement in fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
``We know there are up to 1,800 Rwandan troops helping the
Banyamulenge fight Zairean government troops in Uvira, Nyangezi
and they are now moving toward Bukavu,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda immediately denied the accusations, saying stunning
military advances by the Banyamulenge this week were an
indication of gross incompetence by the Zairean army.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said ethnic Tutsi Banyamulenge fighters reached
the town of Nyangezi, 27 kilometers south of Bukavu, the capital
of Zaire's south Kivu province over night.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Zaire said Banyamulenge had also seized Kamanyola
and Bwegera towns, south of Bukavu.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Zaire has been a power keg since the 1994 civil war in
Rwanda and genocide sent more than a million Hutus afraid of
reprisals for the massacre into the region and fuelled local
rivalries.
</P>
<P>
People fear Tutsi-dominated armies in Burundi and Rwanda could
be drawn into the fighting, sparking a wider conflict in central
Africa's volatile Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said today Banyamulenge -- an ethnic Tutsi group
which came to Zaire from Rwanda at the end of the 18th century --
rebels had pushed close to Bukavu on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Butare's accusations were backed by exiled former Rwandan
Interior Minister Seth Sendashonga who said: ``i have no doubt
whatever in my mind that Rwanda is militarily involved in
eastern Zaire.''
</P>
<P>
As a senior member of the Rwandan government until he fled to
Kenya last year, Sendashonga charged that the operation involved
more than 1,000 Rwandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
``This was a well-planned operation and so far it looks like
Rwanda's military objective (of strengthening the Banyamulenge
and driving Rwandan refugees back home) is going to work,'' he
accused.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 refugees were on the move in eastern Zaire
following the fighting and they faced food shortages unless food
aid arrives in a few days.
</P>
<P>
Butare charged that the Rwandan strategy was to cut off the
airports at Bukavu and the north Kivu provincial city of Goma
before driving over a million Rwandan Hutu refugees back home.
</P>
<P>
However, Claude Dusaidi, a senior aide to Rwandan
Vice-President Major-General Paul Kagame, denied in Kigali that the
charges were true.
</P>
<P>
``There is no truth to that at all. The Banyamulenge do not
need our help to fight the Zairean army. Zaire is a country at
war with itself,'' Dusaidi said.
</P>
<P>
``The Zairean army is no army at all. Troops are demoralized.
They have not been paid for many years and so they cannot fight,"
he said.
