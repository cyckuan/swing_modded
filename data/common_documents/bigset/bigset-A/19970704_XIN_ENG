<HEADLINE> Iran to Test First Fighter Plane: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The first Iranian-made fighter
plane is expected to be tested during the Defense Week maneuvers
in late September in the southern part of the country, local press
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shahbazi, an Iranian Brigadier General, was quoted as
saying that the fighter to be tested in the war games code-named
Ra'd-9 (Thunder-9) was manufactured by the Iranian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The officer didn't elaborate on the type and technical details
of the fighter plane. However, specialists doubt the Iranian Air
Force's capability in producing jet fighters, even military
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source said the first Iranian fighter was
assembled by the Air Force, with its parts made in Indonesia. But
there is no immediate confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Air Force, now 15,000 strong, used to have
U.S.-made F-5s and F-14s as its main fighter aircraft before the
Islamic Revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> US Phone Giant to Join With Italian Phone Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T, the largest long-distance
phone company in the United States, and the Italian phone company,
Stet S.P.A., announced a broad agreement in Rome Wednesday to
cooperate in Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, negotiated over the last four months, was the
latest move in the industry to form global networks, and is aimed
to better their odds in the emerging global telecommunications
race, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Stet -- short for Societa Finanziaria Telefonica --
will enter a joint venture that AT&AMP;T has with Unisource, a
consortium of phone companies from Sweden, Switzerland and the
Netherlands. In latin America, Stet and AT&AMP;T will form a 50-50
venture to run two operating companies, one specializing in global
links for multinational corporations and the second to provide
links for local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
John R. Walter, AT&AMP;T's president and chief operating officer,
was quoted as saying that for AT&AMP;T in the next five years, "growth
will come from outside the United States." He said that AT&AMP;T
expected Stet's entry into Unisource to increase revenue over
forecast by 30 percent. Revenue in 1997, he said, is expected to
double from 1996, to 400 million U.S. dollars, and to reach 2
billion in five years.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Asian, Latin American Success Sets Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today hailed the economic success in Asia and parts of
Latin America, saying it showed the path to accelerated
development lay in better integration with the mainstream of the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
"New and dynamic centers of trade and investment have arisen
in Asia and parts of Latin America, and they are fast becoming the
engines of growth in world output and trade, "Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to a high-level panel here sponsored by the
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
</P>
<P>
The UN secretary-general said while he is encouraged by several
positive economic trends in the developing world, "at the same
time, it is distressing that many developing countries and large
numbers of people in all countries have been excluded from the
benefits of globalization."
</P>
<P>
For many African countries and for the least-developed
countries, "the risk of further marginalization remains
all-too-real".
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the international community to give greater
support to the African countries which are opening up and
liberalizing their economies.
</P>
<P>
African countries are pursuing structural reforms and
adjustment programs, and many have achieved impressive levels of
growth. They need increased and sustained official assistance, and
a comprehensive solution to their external debt burdens, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Above all, to help them to outgrow their dependence on
commodities and aid, their exports must be accorded free access to
world markets," Annan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The human rights watchdog Amnesty
International accused German police of racism in a report issued
here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Butler, Amnesty's investigator responsible
for Germany, evidence collected since 1995, which listed 40 cases
involving police violence against non-Germans or German nationals
of foreign extraction, showed that police racism was part of a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
Butler also accused prosecutors of being dilatory over claims
of police violence and the courts of being partial to police in
dealing with such cases.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent
complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such
complaints.
</P>
<P>
The Amnesty report was immediately challenged by the interior
ministers of Germany's 16 states, who denied the police were
racist as a whole and noted that the misdeeds of individual
policemen were objectively and thoroughly investigated by
prosecutors and the courts.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, every state has its own police force.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Seeks Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodum Sihanouk
sent a letter today from Beijing to his people, calling for
peaceful negotiations to solve the present political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin released by the royal palace today quoted the
letter as saying the king was willing to supervise the peace talks
as a mediator, so long as no participants of the talks charged him
with trying to resume political power when there were quarrels.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the king said "we have to agree to organize a
meeting between those who have power to debate and find a way to
solve all problems under the presidency of the king who is a
neutral referee."
</P>
<P>
"But if (you) appoint me to be president of this big meeting,
(you) should not accuse me of being a power-hungry person who
seeks to take advantage while other are quarrelling," he added.
</P>
<P>
The king also appealed to the two prime ministers, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Hung Sen, their parties and troops loyal to
the respective prime ministers to make peace and resume the
cooperative brotherhood and harmonious atmosphere they shared
during 1993 to 1994.

<HEADLINE> US Auto Makers' Sales Decline in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 3 (xinhua) -- The General Motor, one of the
three big auto makers in the United States, said Wednesday that
its sales fell 13.3 percent last month, following a stellar first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Other auto makers also announced their June sales results, and
together registered a decline, according to a report of the New
York Times today. Ford's sales were down slightly, while Chrysler
Corportion's sales fell 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said, smaller auto makers reported their
sales gains.
</P>
<P>
The weak sales of the big auto makers reflect lackluster demand
for new cars and trucks industrywide, said Wall Street analysts
who are puzzled by the auto industry's slow sales at a time when
economic factors seem so favorable: interest rates are low and
stable, unemployment levels are at record lows, and measurements
show strong consumer confidence and high personal income levels.
</P>
<P>
But some other analysts said that the weak June sales were an
indication that the Federal Reserve was correct in deciding not to
raise interest rates to slow the economy.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Islamic Painting Distributed Through Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified Israeli has
distributed through the Internet an insulting anti-Islamic
painting, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
The painting depicts a sow, with words "The Prophet Mohammed"
on it, feeding piglings at the breast. Its caption reads: "Thus
do the Palestinian people drink from the prophesies of the Swine
Prophet Muhamad."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the act, the Palestinian Ministry of Planning
and International Cooperation said in a statement that "we
believe this act is part of an organized Zionist campaign against
Islam."
</P>
<P>
It noted that the act "refutes Israeli allegations that it is
an individual act."
</P>
<P>
This was the second insulting anti-Islamic incident in a
week. At the weekend some 20 posters were found pasted on
Palestinian stores in Hebron, showing the Prophet as a pig
writing the Koran.
</P>
<P>
The posters touched off a wave of anti-Israeli violence in the
city and elsewhere this week. A 25-year-old Jewish woman from
Jerusalem, suspected of distributing the posters, was detained.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities condemned the insulting act, but
insisted that it was committed by a woman alone.

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
today reaffirmed that his Socialist government is "profoundly
attached to a policy of particular, privileged and friendly ties
with Africa."
</P>
<P>
"The government should, with President (Jacques Chirac), see to
it that the bilateral relations between Chad and France continue
to develop," said Jospin after a meeting with visiting Chadian
President Idriss Deby.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France's Africa policy should adapt to "the
problems of the time, and the evolution of the spirits, notably of
the African people."
</P>
<P>
President Deby, who is here for a three-day visit, also met
with President Chirac today.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said this week that
France should reflect deeply on its Africa policy and pay more
attention to developing relations with English-speaking African
countries.
</P>
<P>
France's Africa policy has been greatly shaken by the war in
former Zaire, the recent conflict in the Central African Republic,
and the on-going confrontation in the Congo Republic between
President Pascal Lissouba and former President Denis

<HEADLINE> Jailed IRA Bombmaker Wins Right to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Gilbert McNamee, an Irish Republican
Army (IRA) bombmaker responsible for killing four British
cavalrymen, won the right today to appeal against his conviction.
</P>
<P>
McNamee has been imprisoned since 1987 to serve a 25-year
sentence for conspiring to cause a number of explosions, including
the 1982 Hyde Park bomb attack on a ceremonial parade by the
Household Cavalry.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was set up earlier
this year, referred McNamee's case back to the appeal court after
doubts were raised about fingerprint evidence that was crucial to
his conviction. McNamee's appeal was rejected in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Following enquiries into a number of issues, including
scientific evidence, fingerprint evidence and the disclosure of
evidence at the time of the original appeal, the Commission
believes that Mr McNamee's conviction should be reconsidered by
the Court of Appeal," the commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
McNamee was convicted after prosecution lawyers told London's
central criminal court that two of McNamee's fingerprints were
found on adhesive tape found on a cache of bomb-making equipment
found in southern England. Another of his fingerprints was found
on a battery used in the Hyde Park bomb which survived the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
McNamee's defense lawyers had argued that while there were only
two of his fingerprints on the tape, there were many more of
someone else's there.
</P>
<P>
These fingerprints might have got onto the tape quite
innocently when McNamee worked at an electronics factory in
Ireland where rolls of the same type of tape were used, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
If McNamee won his appeal, it will be the latest in a series of
convictions for serious crimes to be overturned.

<HEADLINE> Gun-battle Follows Monarchy Rally in Tirana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A gun-battle broke out in downtown
Tirana, on Thursday, soon after a rally and a march by supporters
of Albania's self-claimed king Leka, killing at least one person.
</P>
<P>
About 500 supporters of the self-claimed king marched from the
main Skanderbeg Square to the headquarters of the central
electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
Firing broke out as the marchers converged on the election
headquarters. Witnesses said the shooting, which carried on for
about 10 minutes, appeared to be aimed into the air. Police
officers guarding the building housing the election commission
fired back.
</P>
<P>
The incident erupted as Albanians awaited the final results
from Sunday's parliamentary elections which officials hope can
help end months of chaos triggered by high-risk investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Leka has charged electoral fraud in the elections, which also
included a referendum on returning the monarchy to Albania. He has
insisted that monarchy was supported by the majority of the voters
in the referendum, but the central electoral commission said on
Wednesday about 35.7 percent voted in favour of this and some 64.2
percent against.
</P>
<P>
Leka, who has worked as a businessman in Johannesburg, South
Africa, is the son of an army officer who became Albania's king in
1928.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary election results showed that in Sunday's elections,
the Socialist Party defeated the Democratic Party of President
Sali Berisha. Berisha had already conceded defeat despite a second
round of voting on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bashkim Fino denounced action of monarchy
supporters in a TV speech and urged people to keep calm.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Berisha reiterated that he would resign.
</P>
<P>
"I will resign. I know you want a date, but it's very difficult
because there's a process involved," Berisha said at a news
conference. He pledged earlier this year that he would step down
if the rival Socialists won the elections.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Saudi Arabia Call for Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Saudi Arabia highlighted
the necessity of realizing just and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East at a joint meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
"This peace should be based on commitment to the international
legitimate principles, the implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and on the land-for-peace principle,"
said a communique issued at the end a meeting of the
Egyptian-Saudi Joint Higher Committee.
</P>
<P>
The 7th meeting of the joint committee opened here this
afternoon to discuss ways to boost bilateral cooperation in
political, economic, tourist, cultural and investment fields, and
to regulate Egypt's labor force in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The communique reiterated their countries' rejection of the
Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian and Arab
territories, and stressed their refusal of "all Israeli measures
and attempts aiming at Judaizing and annexing the holy city of
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Saudi counterpart Prince
Saud al-Faisal al-Saud, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said
that Egypt and Saudi Arabia are doing their best to save the peace
talks that collapsed in March after Israel broke ground for a new
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister pledged to continue utmost efforts to "clear
the atmosphere in the region" that has been soured by the
distribution of offensive anti-Islamic posters in the West Bank
town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the incident, saying that the posters reflect
warped Israeli view of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official also blamed Israel for poisoning the
atmosphere ahead of the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Summit scheduled in November in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has decided to boycott the summit due to Israel's
participation.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Embarks on New Journey in Peace and Serenity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- When a new work day arrived
following a five-day public holiday, Hong Kong has embarked on a
new journey in peace and serenity.
</P>
<P>
While it was just past midnight and most of the Hong Kong
residents were fast asleep, the "Three Express Trains" had arrived
at the railway terminal at Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
In the past three and a half decades, the trains have traveled
ceaselessly between China's interior and Hong Kong, carrying fresh
non-staple food including meat, fish, poultry and eggs to supply
the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
At four o'clock am, the double-decked trolley bus, a veteran
public transportation vehicle that has been on wheel in Hong Kong
for almost a century, started its first journey of the day across
the Hong Kong island dotted by skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
Then, fresh vegetables with morning dews appeared at dawn on
large and small vegetables stalls across the city. When it was
nearly six o'clock, Uncle Lee, an elderly newspaper vendor in the
downtown Wan Chai district, loaded all newspapers onto his stall
in a neat order.
</P>
<P>
"I have been selling newspapers here for a dozen years," he
said. "But my business has never been brisker than in recent
several days."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's number one metropolis in terms of
press density, with more than 100 local newspapers, journals and
magazines for a population of some 6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The commercial districts in the downtown area revived at around
8 a.m. with swarms of commuters scurrying to their work. On the
roadside tea houses, however, senior citizens were seen taking
their breakfast with a bottle of tea in a leisurely and carefree
manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wong Tai Sin Temple, the most famous religious site
in Hong Kong had been filled with the fragrance of incense sticks.
</P>
<P>
There are some 1,000 religious sites in Hong Kong, which only
has an area of 1,092 sq km.
</P>
<P>
At ten o'clock this morning, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, one of
the world's eight leading stock markets, re-opened after a
five-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
In the Exchange building in Central, red jackets stared at the
electronic board displaying every change of the Hang Seng Index.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the index jumped to a record height of
15,363 points, a very good sign for the 350,000 financial
professionals working to keep Hong Kong its current status as an
international financial center.
</P>
<P>
Things that will not change
</P>
<P>
Horse race court at Happy Valley was serene and silent, for the
last race season had ended three weeks before. Last season's race
drew an overall stake of some 90 billion Hong Kong dollars (about
12 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the horse race will resume again in September as
usual, with only some small changes in its name and insignia that
will fade away the trappings of the 156-year British colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Jockey Club, operator of the horse racing, has
invested more than one billion Hong Kong dollars to upgrade and
renovate its headquarters building, develop a world-class racing
court and add more horse stables.
</P>
<P>
Night life is a major feature of Hong Kong's culture. When the
night falls, numerous night clubs, bars, and discos throughout the
metropolis continue to attract tens of thousands of local
residents and overseas tourists with dazzling neons and melodious
music.
</P>
<P>
"The transition of Hong Kong has been so smooth that people
living here could hardly feel it," a foreign businessman in Hong
Kong said.

to the economic development of Hong Kong, including the free trade
policy, the monetary and financial system, the shipping operation
and management system, and low tax, would remain intact beyond
1997.
</P>
<P>
This has greatly helped to increase Hong Kong people's
confidence in the prospects of Hong Kong's economy, which has led
to the current stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To date, Hong Kong has become the world's largest cargo
container port in terms of handling capacity, and the Kai Tak
International Airport has ranked among the world's busiest
airports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are 112 ocean-going vessels entering and
leaving Hong Kong daily on average, and every less than two
minutes a plane takes off from or lands at Kai Tak airport.
</P>
<P>
The city is also building a large and modernized new airport,
which is scheduled to go into operation in April 1998. And its
first-phase construction has almost been completed.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong
Kong economy has kept an average annual growth rate of 5.8
percent, and has been reputed as the world's freest economy for
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong scored an economic
growth of 6 percent, and all predictors expected an annual growth
rate of more than 6 percent for Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now the regional bases for over 700 transnational
corporations. The latest confidence survey conducted by the
British, Japanese, American chambers of commerce in Hong Kong
among their member companies showed that more than 95 percent of
the respondents are optimistic about the prospects for long-term
investment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On the ceremony to mark the establishment of the HKSAR, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin reiterated that the principle of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
with a high degree of autonomy is beneficial to Hong Kong, to the
rest of China and to the whole world, and there is no reason to
change it.
</P>
<P>
Things that have changed
</P>
<P>
However, some things do have changed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When local residents wake up in the morning and open their
windows, they no longer catch sight of the Union Jack. Fluttering
in the air are the Five-Star Red Flag, China's national flag, and
the Hong Kong SAR regional flag featuring a blossoming bauhinia.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Embarks on New Journey in Peace and Serenity (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before the handover ceremony on July 1, trappings of
colonialism had phased out quietly. The Queen's head on coins and
stamps, which had been there for one and a half centuries, were
replaced by the pattern of bauhinia and the skyline of Hong Kong
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 1, Hong Kong stamps carrying the Queen's
head or British royal insignia had lost validity, and the old
crown insignia of postal service on the over 800 pillar-boxes
across Hong Kong had been removed to usher in the new insignia --
a phoenix that symbolizes a new birth.
</P>
<P>
The Government House, residence for the British Hong Kong
governors, has turned from a heavily-guarded center of colonial
rule into a commemorative site.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the last Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten bade
farewell to the Government House, a solemn ceremony was held there
by the HKSAR government to present the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the
highest award in the new honors system, to 12 recipients who had
contributed tremendously to the local community.
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m. today, Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR
and all principal officials of the SAR government reached their
offices for the first day of work for the civil service of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"We're now the masters of our own destiny," Donald Tsang
Yam-kuen, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR government, said with a
sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
Another distinct sign for change is the Five-Star Red Flag
flying over Tamar, the former site of the British Hong Kong
garrison which was taken over by the troops of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the British military force and the entry of
the PLA troops have been regarded as a significant symbol of
China's resumption of its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
after 156 years of British occupation.
</P>
<P>
In peace and serenity, Hong Kong, back to the embrace of its
motherland, is ushering in a brilliant and more splendid future.

<HEADLINE> British Doctors Vote Against Euthanasia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- British doctors today strongly
rejected the change of the law that bars doctors from carrying out
mercy killings or helping dying patients to kill themselves.
</P>
<P>
The doctors attending the annual conference of the British
Medical Association (BMA) in Edinburgh passed the motion after a
lengthy debate.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors described as agonizing the decisions they had
faced when terminally ill patients had appealed to them for help
to end their suffering, and thus called for changes in the law to
legalize mercy killings.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Macara, chairman of the BMA council, said the vote showed
most doctors were against euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
"Others rightly see us saving life, not embracing death. We
should not do anything to betray that trust in our essential vital
function," local reports quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the BMA's solidarity on today's vote, there have been
growing calls in Britain for the legalization of euthanasia and
assisted suicide, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Files Complaint Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon filed today a complaint to
an international committee overseeing violations of a cease-fire
in south Lebanon over the Israeli bombardment of a south Lebanese
village Wednesday in which one civilian was wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said that his ministry
lodged the complaint to David Greenlee, the Cyprus-based chairman
of the five-nation cease-fire monitoring committee over the
Wednesday bombardment of Kfar Tibnit.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz accused Israel of being behind the current escalation
of tensions in south Lebanon, saying that Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is attempting to distract attentions from his
domestic problems through the escalation.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the state-run Lebanese National News Agency
(LNNA) as saying that the bombardment of inhabited areas in south
Lebanon violated the cease-fire understanding Lebanon and Israel
reached in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising representatives
from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States, is to
hold a meeting next week to discuss the Lebanese complaint. This
will be the 13th meeting of the committee this year, according to
the LNNA.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon this week following a
series of violent exchanges of fire between the Israeli occupation
forces and their client South Lebanon Army militia on one side and
Lebanese resistance guerrillas on the other.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out this morning an air raid at
suspected target of Lebanese resistance guerrillas in the Saida
area in the western part of south Lebanon. The warplanes fired two
air-to-surface missiles but caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, announced that its fighters launched today attacks at
seven Israeli positions in the Israeli self-carved "buffer zone,"
killing and wounding a number of Israeli soldiers. But the
casualties have not been confirmed by the Israeli side.

<HEADLINE> French Gov't Not to Impose "Irrational Effort" for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy and
Finance Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that the government
would not impose any "irrational effort" to attain budget criteria
for the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the Finance Commission of the French National
Assembly, Strauss-Kahn also said that the government would "give
the means to put public finance in conformity with its valuation
of the Maastricht treaty."
</P>
<P>
But he said that France could not attain the criteria of
cutting its public deficit to 3 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) this year, as was required by the 1997 budget law
drafted by the former government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account all the factors, the objective of limiting
the public deficit to 3 percent of the GDP appears unrealistic,"
he said, adding that the deficit would stand around 3.5 percent of
the GDP, instead of 3 percent, by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that that public deficit stood at 4.2 percent of the
GDP by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government would stop the policy of
cutting income taxes adopted by the former government, but would
lower the 20.6 percent added-value tax, or sales tax, in order to
stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said Wednesday that
the government could raise taxes on families and enterprises
earning super-high profits to help improve the budget balance.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Alleged Military Support to Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today denied
a Turkish accusation that Cyprus is providing missiles to the
Kurds who are fighting a separatist war in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily
press briefing that both Cyprus and Greek governments have
dismissed claims by Ankara and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash that the two countries offer military support to the
Kurds.
</P>
<P>
"We deny these claims," Christofides said, adding that
"whenever a round of negotiations on Cyprus is due they (the
Turks) escalate these views, slanders and false claims, creating a
climate which is not conducive to effective talks."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated the Greek Cypriot side's readiness to
attend, with goodwill, the forthcoming U.N.-led direct talks aimed
at achieving a Cyprus solution.
</P>
<P>
The direct negotiations between Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will take place
from July 9-13, at a rural retreat called Troutbeck, 145
kilometers north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides will attend the negotiations decisively,
backed by his recent talks in Athens and guided by the unanimous
decisions taken by the National Council, the top advisory body to
the president on the Cyprus issue," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Christofides added the governments of Cyprus and Greece
confirmed their close cooperation, noting that during President
Clerides' visit to Athens, earlier this week, the two countries
had "common views on the tactics to be followed."
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Athens, President Clerides
exchanged views with Greek government leaders on Cyprus issue,
prior to the July face-to-face talks near New York.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has

</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Food and Agricultural

<HEADLINE> Bonn, Paris Eye Closer Ties Despite Disagreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France said here today
that the traditional Franco-German axis will not be threatened by
their differences on some key issues such as the single European
currency and the expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
After talks with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine here
this afternoon, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that
Bonn and Paris are in full agreement in fundamental policies. It
is wrong to speak of "a sputtering of the German-French motor or
even a crisis in the bilateral relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no serious problems between Germany and France,"
Kinkel declared. "The privileged relations" between Bonn and Paris
remain of central importance for Europe and a "constant" in the
foreign policies of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who is on the first official foreign visit since the
French Socialist government took office four weeks ago, stressed
that the common goals of the two countries are more important than
their differences in details.
</P>
<P>
He added that such differences also existed earlier between the
two countries but did not effect the bilateral ties adversely.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers today also issued a joint declaration aiming
at improving coordination between the two governments in foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
It was pledged that the two ministers would make joint foreign
visits in the future and the two foreign ministries would
intensify their efforts to seek common positions on important
bilateral and multilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to strengthen the exchange of
diplomats and envisaged to establish joint embassies in third
countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Vedrine held talks with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl on such issues as the NATO enlargement, the timetable for the
European Union eastward expansion and the planned single European
currency, where France and Germany hold varying positions.
</P>
<P>
On the NATO enlargement, for example, Paris and Bonn have taken
different approaches in the light of a U.S. request to limit the
first wave of members to only three countries: Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
While France came out in support of more than three candidates
to also include countries like Romania and Slovenia, Germany has
so far stopped short of making firm commitments.
</P>
<P>
On the single European currency, the Euro, Germany has been
insisting on strict adherence to the budgetary and fiscal targets
required for launching the Euro on January 1, 1999, but France
favors a softening of the criteria.

<HEADLINE> Botswanan President Urges Closer African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) --Visiting President Ketumile
Masire of Botswana today urged the eastern and southern African
countries to establish closer trade links through cooperation and
exchange of experience.
</P>
<P>
President Masire, who arrived here Monday for a five-day state
visit to Tanzania, made the remarks when he was officially
opening the 21st Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair (DITF).
</P>
<P>
Masire said most countries in the region were underdeveloped,
but could share their experiences from neighbors through trade
fairs and other commercial activities to improve their industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
Masire said the rise of Eastern Asia into an economic bloc was
is by accident but through cooperation and exchange of
experiences among those countries which then shifted into
industralized countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the southern and eastern African
countries to promote co-operation and exchange of experience in
agriculture and animal husbandry. "Through improved agriculture,
the lot of the people in the region will improve their living
standard as most people in this area live in the rural areas
depending on agriculture which now needs to be overhauled,"
Masire said.
</P>
<P>
Masire and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa agreed to set up
a joint commission as a way to strengthen the relations between
Tanzania and Botswana in the areas of agriculture and trade.
</P>
<P>
The 21st DITF, an annual event, has attracted 13 foreign
countries. They are Britain, Kenya, France, South Africa, Iran,
China, Norway, Zambia, Syria, Pakistan, Uganda, Japan and
Austria, and over 500 local exhibitors.

<HEADLINE> Breastfeeding Supported in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Despite the dangers posed by the
AIDS, breastfeeding is still supported by the government in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Currently available information on the risk of HIV
transmission through breast milk has concluded that there is no
need to change policy based on the 1992 World Health Organization
(WHO) and UNICEF consensus on HIV transmission and
breastfeeding,'' said a statement issued today by the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry recommends the need to provide voluntary and
confidential HIV testing and counselling for women who
wish to know their HIV status for them to make informed decisions
on breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, health experts have agonised over whether the
threat of HIV should affect breastfeeding. While transmission to the
baby is possible, bottle feeding has also been found to pose a more
serious hazard.
</P>
<P>
At the current weekly AIDS death rate of 500, Zimbabwe is said
to be losing the breastfeeding campaign due to the pandemic.
The country is projected to have 600,000 orphans by the year 2000,
among them babies needing breastfeeding substitutes,
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 25 to 50 percent of babies who escape HIV
infection at birth are likely to contract it through breast milk.
But despite this frightening reality, experts maintain that
babies fed on mother's milk have fewer illnesses and less
malnutrition than those on other foods.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy Mohamed
Sahnoun said today he wanted the Security Council to endorse an
African peacekeeping force for the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after the Security Council was briefed on the
recent situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Sahnoun said the main conflict
concerned presidential elections and who would manage the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who has been negotiating with the warring parties in
Brazzaville, said both sides wanted a peacekeeping force which
could supervise a cease-fire and secure the airport to make sure
weapons would not flow into the country.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun said a multinational force mainly made up of African
countries would need outside, voluntary financing. "Without the
logistical and financial support necessary to send the force, the
process of peace will collapse," he added.
</P>
<P>
The month-long civil war, which has killed hundreds of people,
began when President Pascal Lissouba tried to arrest his
predecessor Denis Sassou and disarm his private army.
</P>
<P>
A mid-June cease-fire was negotiated by the mediators hours
after France pulled out its soldiers from Brazzaville. But
fighting has resumed.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Coup Has Liberian Link, UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's ambassador to the United
Nations, Jame Jonah, has alleged that there is a Liberian connection
to the country's May 25 coup, saying that the link is responsible for
the intrasigence of the coup plotters.
</P>
<P>
The core leadership of the Revolutionary United Front rebels, whom
he accused of hijacking the coup from the soldiers who executed it,
were mainly Liberians, the envoy said in New York Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We presumed they are taking orders externally," he said, quoted by
the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
"The accent of the rebel leaders just gives them up completely,"
Jonah said, adding that people who had been involved in the Liberian
civil war knew the people.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, the people in Sierra Leone who are resisting
to return power to the toppled civilian government are these in the
leadership, and the military people who made in coup are no longer in
control.
</P>
<P>
The coup, the third in the tiny west African country in five
years, has been pressed by universal condemnation, and African
leaders are unanimous in supporting any efforts, including the use
of force, to reverse it.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional organization, Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), has decided to settle the crisis by dialogue with the
military junta in two weeks beginning June 26. If negotiations fail,
an embargo and the use of force will follow.
</P>
<P>
The envoy also praised Nigeria's leading role in the effort to
reverse the May 25 coup, saying that "without Nigeria's assistance, I
really do not know that Sierra Leoneans can do to remove this illegal
regime from our country."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the main contributor of the ECOWAS peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG whose troops are reportedly holding some strategic
positions in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown, including the
international airport.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Sierra Leone, both ECOWAS members with the former
currently taking the chairmanship, have a long relationship, with many
in Nigeria's colonial administration being Sierra Leoneans and many
Nigerians attending the Fourth Bay College in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin to Acquire Northrop Grumman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) --Lockheed Martin Corp. is buying
Northrop Grumman Corp. in an about 8 billion U.S. dollar deal that
combines two of the U.S. biggest defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came today would bring together the nation's
No. one and sixth largest defense contractors. If approved by
federal regulators and stockholders, it would create a new giant
with revenue of 37 billion dollars and 230,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposed deal, Lockheed will take also over
3.3 billion dollars of Northrop's debt.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin is wellknown as the maker of the F-16 Falcon
jet fighter and the Trident missile and Northrop Grumman, for its
B-2 stealth bomber and the MX missile system.
</P>
<P>
The two companies already have collaborated on the Joint Strike
Fighter, the F-22 fighter jet and early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
Combining with the larger Lockheed will no doubt be a help.
Lockheed Martin has been on a roll recently, winning one contract
last year to develop the nation's next space shuttle and landing
another that keeps it in the competition to build the nation's
next light strike-fighter jet for the military services.
</P>
<P>
Northrop Grumman, based in Los Angeles, employs more than
45,000 people and had sales of about 8 billion dollars in 1996.
Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Maryland employs 190,000 and
had annual sales of almost 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
pending approval from federal regulators and two company's
shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Imports Bring Huge Loss to Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is losing more than 26.1
billion Naira (about 307 million U.S. Dollars) annually as a
result of illegal importation of palm oil, refined oil and
tallow, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The current glut of these products in the domestic market has led
to the crash of the price of palm oil from 48,000 Naira per ton to
25,000 Naira in the past five years, said Femi Adeyehun, chief
executive of Okitipupa Oil Palm Plc.
</P>
<P>
According to him, an average of 900,000 tons of palm oil are being produced?
annually by all the 10 major producers in the country while an
average of 60,000 tons are imported illegally per month.
</P>
<P>
The illegal imports come from Indonesia, Malaysia and Portugal as
well as some west African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, four major producers have closed down, while
several others are on the brink of collapse, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our investigations show that the rapid decline in the domestic
price of palm oil is caused by dumping of the product either in the
crude, refined and mixture forms on the Nigerian market," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than two million agricultural and allied workers
would soon be laid off if the palm oil importation was not checked.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Rejects Accusation on Renault Plant Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
today rejected accusation from the Belgian government and some
unions that he had broken his promise to stop Renault close its
Vilvoorde auto assembly plant in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"At no moment in the electoral campaign, did you hear me say:
If the left wins the elections, Vilvoorde will be re-opened. I
said: the issue will be re-opened, and we have reopened it," said
Jospin during a television interview this evening.
</P>
<P>
The French automaker Renault announced last week that it would
stick to its controversial plan to close its Vilvoorde assembly
plant, which would result in the lay-off of 3,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose hometown is
Vilvoorde, accused Jospin of creating illusion by giving false
messages during his legislative campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that Renault would create a new industrial center
on the site of its former plant in Vilvoorde, which will employ
400 workers, and that the social compensation plan for the workers
by Renault, including providing jobs in French auto plants, is
"exceptional."
</P>
<P>
"The social (compensation) plan is exceptional... It is not
true that things will end as it would be ended if there was not a
new majority in France today," he said.

WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. vessel has unloaded
17,000 tons of grain on the west coast of the Democratic People's

WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. today denied a Bosnian
Serb TV report that the Stabilization Forces in Bosnia had been
ordered to arrest former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
his former army commander Gen. Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
The report was "absolutely and unequivocally false," State

<P>
He said there had been no change in the orders to the
peacekeeping forces led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) on their behavior towards alleged war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb Television quoted unidentified Bosnian Serb
security sources as saying that Karadzic and Mladic were to be
arrested on sight and U.S. and British military units had been
designated to capture them.
</P>
<P>
Denying the report, Burns said,"There has been no change in the
instructions for pertaining to the detaining and arrest of
indicted war criminals."
</P>
<P>
He said the rule remained that if any of those troops encounter
people who they know to be indicted war criminals, they are to
detain them for transfer to civilian authority so they may be
arrested and then turned over to The Hague for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic and Mladic were accused of committing war crimes by
the Western powers during the Bosnian civil war in 1992-1995.

<HEADLINE> Seminar On Rejuvenation of Chinese Nation Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A seminar themed "The
Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation" was held recently in the city
of Dongguan, south China's Guangdong Province, attended by nearly
70 scholars from the inland areas, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Qian Weichang, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the
meeting that the homecoming of Hong Kong is an important and
historic step in the long journey toward China's reunification and
national rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
It is a common aspiration of all Chinese people, including
those from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, to resolve the questions
of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Authorities should follow the trend of development
and stop engaging in activities to create "two Chinas" and "one
China, one Taiwan," said Qian, who is also chairman of the China
Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Taiwan authorities to negotiate with the mainland
under the principle of "one China" and formally cease the hostile
relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Blair Vows to Clean up Standards in Public Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today vowed to clean up standards in public life, and turned the
screw on the exposed cash-for-questions scandals which involved
opposition Conservative Party members.
</P>
<P>
Five former Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) were
censured Thursday in a damning report released by Sir Gordan
Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine if these were Labor Party members and these
allegations were proven against them, that they would be staying
in the Labor Party," Blair told reporters on a visit to his
Sedgefield constituency in northeast England,
</P>
<P>
The report put new Conservative leader William Hague under
pressure to take action against the five MPs. But Hague's scope
for action is limited because none of those criticized was
re-elected in the May 1 election that ended Conservative Party's
18-year rule, and installed Labor in government.
</P>
<P>
Vowing to take tough measures against scandals, Blair said one
of the reasons the Labor Party won the election was because people
believed "there was a need to clean up standards in public life
and we will do that.
</P>
<P>
"We will put forward a whole range of measures in relation, for
example, to the conduct of MPs and ... to party funding. That's
important because people have a right to know that the MPs they
elect are going to do their jobs in a proper way," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has already used sweeping new rules,
outlawing anything that could hurt Labour's standing, to sanction
two MPs facing allegations of financial irregularities.

<HEADLINE> Novotna Injuried before Wimbledon Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Jana Novotna's hopes of winning
Wimbledon tennis women's singles title suffered a blow on
Friday when the Czech injured her thigh.
</P>
<P>
The third seed Novotna, due to meet top seed Martina Hingis in
Saturday's final, withdrew from Friday's doubles quarter-final due
to what the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) described as a
"chronic" thigh muscle problem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the WTA put her playing ability at 75 percent
but said her chances of playing were "probable".
</P>
<P>
Novotna suffered the injury during a previous match and the
problem will be re-evaluated on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Novotna and American Lindsay Davenport, the third seeds in the
women's doubles, were due to play Sabine Appelmans of Belgium and
Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands in Friday's quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Czech has won 12 grand slam doubles titles,
including three women's doubles and one mixed doubles title at
Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> World Airport Traffic in First Quarter Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's airports registered a
five percent growth in passenger traffic while cargo volume soared
by eight percent in the first quarter of 1997, compared with the
same period last year, the latest airport traffic report from the
Geneva-based Airports Council International (ACI) said.
</P>
<P>
The ACI report, containing data from 495 airports worldwide,
said that aircraft movements rose by two percent for the first
three months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Africa witnessed the highest growth of nine percent in
passenger traffic in the first quarter, followed by Asia-Pacific
and Europe with six percent.
</P>
<P>
Airports in Latin America and Caribbean reported five percent
growth, while North America and Middle East saw more modest
increases of three percent and two percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Airports in Asia-Pacific outshone other regions with 14 percent
growth of cargo volume, followed by the Middle East's nine
percent, North America's eight percent, and Europe's four percent.
</P>
<P>
Cargo handled in airports in Africa and Latin America and
Caribbean remained virtually unchanged with 0.7 percent and 0.5
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
African and European airports saw a five percent growth in aircraft
movements, followed by Latin America and Caribbean with four percent,
Asia-Pacific with three percent and North America with one percent.
</P>
<P>
Aircraft movements at airports in the Middle East were lowered by
one percent.
</P>
<P>
ACI Director of Economics Paul Benhke said "broad-based steady
growth in passenger traffic occurred across all regions for the first
quarter of 1997, showing a strong increase over a similar buoyant
first quarter in 1996."
</P>
<P>
"Part of the increase could be attributed to the early Easter
travel season falling within the first quarter this year," he
added.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Memorial Hall of the War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression has received over eight
million visitors since it opened a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The hall was established in July 1987 at the Lugou Bridge, the

China's eight-year struggle against Japanese imperialists in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits in the hall include a vast array of photos and
materials illustrating the crimes of the Japanese invaders,
according to Yu Yanjun, deputy curator.

<P>
The hall has hosted some 100,000 visitors from 28 countries and
regions, with the majority from Japan. Young people account for 60
percent of the domestic visitors to date.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the hall has twice been named as an exemplary

Communist Party Central Committee as one of the country's 100
outstanding patriotism education bases.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls For More Efforts For Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan opened the International Disability Center (IDC) today
and called on the international community for more efforts to
improve the rights and lives of disabled people.
</P>
<P>
On opening the center in the French town of Ferney-Voltaire
near Geneva, Annan said: "More than half a billion men, women and
children, roughly one out of every 10 people on earth, suffer some
mental, physical or sensory impairment, making people with
disabilities one of the world's largest minorities.
</P>
<P>
"In developed and developing countries alike, disabled persons
face discrimination and are found disproportionately among the
poorest strata of society," Annan told those at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Former UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is the
president of the IDC, which was established by the International
Disability Foundation (IDF).
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the IDF, Hans Hoegh, was the Special
Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for the U.N. Decade
of Disabled Persons, which ended in 1992. The United Nation's
Secretariat's Division for Social Policy and Development will have
regular exchanges of information with the IDF.
</P>
<P>
Annan hoped those ties would be further strengthened. He asked
the international community to keep their pledges in the last
decade, "to prevent disability, to enhance rehabilitation, to
fight against prejudice and to build a world in which every
citizen can participate fully and actively".

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Speech Urging People to Press Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
speech that reveals the light shed by the modern history on the
Chinese nation has inspired deep thought in the people and urged
them to press forward.
</P>
<P>
This is the general opinion expressed by experts,
scholars and ordinary people alike after hearing the speech
delivered by the Chinese present at Beijing's mass rally to
celebrate Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said that the modern history of China
makes clear the truth that the Chinese nation must rise in
struggle and work hard to make the country strong if it is to
change the historical fate of being bullied and oppressed due to
poverty and backwardness; that it must have the leadership of an
advanced political Party and the guidance of a scientific theory
if it is to realize national liberation and prosperity and
strength of the country; and that it must break away with the
state of being closed and must open up the country to the rest of
the world if it is to catch up with the progress of the times and
the development trend of the world..
</P>
<P>
Su Junhong, a researcher from Kunming, capital city of Yunnan
Province in the southwest, said the president's speech is
penetrating. The return of Hong Kong is the result of the growing
strength of the Chinese nation, which is in turn the result of the
growing strength of the leadership of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Staff members from the library of Nanjing University said that
Jiang's speech has filled them with confidence in the long-term
stability of Hong Kong, in the leadership of the CPC, in the
realization of the targets set by Deng Xiaoping for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and in the ultimate
settlement of the Taiwan issue based on the principle of "one
country, two systems."

of sovereignty over Hong Kong and that they are an important force
in keeping Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, he went on, the PLA troops, braving wind and rain,
reached their designated barracks on schedule for taking over Hong
Kong's defense. This showed their high sense of discipline and
they are worthy of being called a mighty and civilized army, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu Zhenwu congratulated Tung Chee Hwa on the
establishment of the HKSAR government and on his assuming the post
of the HKSAR Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
The general briefed Tung on his troops' activities in the past
three days in Hong Kong, and expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf
of the officers and men of the HK Garrison to the HKSAR government
and Hong Kong residents for their support to the PLA troops'
entry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, people from various circles of Hong Kong had
visited the PLA troops six times over the past year and made many
valuable suggestions about the troops' formation.
</P>
<P>
On their way to the barracks in Hong Kong, General Liu said,
Hong Kong customs helped the soldiers through the formalities at
the quickest possible speed and HK policemen guided them safely to
the barracks. Moreover, thousands of Hong Kong residents braved
heavy rain to welcome them along the route, waving colored flags
and presenting a large plague inscribed with "a mighty and
civilized army".
</P>
<P>
All this showed that the HKSAR government and Hong Kong
citizens care for and love the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, the general
said, adding that his troops are deeply moved and are more
determined to carry out their duties well.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa and the PLA visitors expressed their willingness
during the meeting to establish necessary working contacts and
make joint efforts to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity
and stability.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Urges to Strengthen Party Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of China
(CPC) official has urged continued efforts to do research in Party
building and promote the Party building work in an all-round
manner.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in
an article congratulating on the publication of the 100th issue
of the magazine "Party Building Research".
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that China has now entered an important period
of development, and the entire Party and Chinese nation should
work to bring into the 21st century the cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, initiated by late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Party building in an all-round manner is a great
project which has been very fruitful over the past few years. But
he said that there are still some new problems that need urgent
solution.
</P>
<P>
In building the Party under the new situation, he said, the
most important thing is to equip the Party with Marxism-Leninism
and Mao Zedong Thought and the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics advanced by Deng Xiaoping so as to enhance
the ideological and political qualities of Party members, such as
persistence in serving the people wholeheartedly, maintaining
blood-and-flesh relations with the people and raising the ability
of resisting corrosion by decadent ideas.
</P>
<P>
He called for great efforts to improve democratic centralism,
strengthen grassroots organizations and select outstanding
young cadres.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the problems existing in the Party in the
areas of ideology, organization and style of work should be
studied in the context of deepening reform, promoting development
and maintaining stability and should solved by employing scientific
theories.

<HEADLINE> Gifts from Interior Areas Attract HK viewers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 people spectators have
visited a range of displaying gifts presented to the newly-founded
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center (CEC) over the past two days.
</P>
<P>
The 32 valuable gifts were from the Chinese Central government
and all 31 interior provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities in China's interior area. Its display was held at
the very venue of the historic Hong Kong handover ceremony held at
midnight Monday and closed this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The gift from the Central People's Government is a huge bronze
sculpture featuring a blooming bauhinia, a symbol used in the
special regional flag and emblem of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
A stream of people flocked to the large exhibition hall on the
fifth floor of the Hong Kong CEC all day long today. In the crowd
inside the hall there were both the elderly and teenagers, and
also some people from overseas.
</P>
<P>
"We can tell the kind attention the central and provincial
governments have shown to Hong Kong and its six million people
from the invaluable gifts they have sent to us," many locals
shared this view after their visit to the show.
</P>
<P>
A senior citizen stood with a walking stick in front of a piece
of red wood carving, entitled the "Bridge of Unity", from the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China, and look at and
appreciate it with great interest.
</P>
<P>
"We are both 84 and seldom leave home," his friend named Lam
said. "But we agree that we can't miss this exhibition, for it has
a large collection of priceless gifts from across the motherland,
and it is worth seeing."
</P>
<P>
Piano instructor Kathleen Sunshine Kwan, who was taking notes
from the board beside the exhibits that carries the gifts'
whereabouts, said that both the gifts and their verses of
introduction were real beautiful.
</P>
<P>
"From them I can feel the deep affection the people in the
interior areas cherish for us," she said. "It is a pity that the
display can't last longer."
</P>
<P>
With a video camera in hand, a senior citizen in his 70s walked
around and took photos for all art works. His wife Shum
Hakim-ting said that they had flown in from Canada just to see and
experience Hong Kong's historic return to China.
</P>
<P>
"My husband is fond of taking photos. He wants to have photos
of all these valuable and elegant works of art so that we can
enjoy them after we reach home," the old lady explained.
</P>
<P>
Just an hour before the closing of the exhibition, many people
were still queuing at the entrance of hall to await his turn to
enter.
</P>
<P>
"However, owing to heavy rains, there were not so visitors
Thursday. Nevertheless, more than 5,900 visitors came to visit it
today," a HKCEC staff member said.
</P>
<P>
When the exhibition is over, the Hong Kong SAR government will
move these valuable gifts to an appropriate site, so that they
will open to the public permanently.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China and Malaysia today
agreed to make greater efforts to promote bilateral economic and
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides today minuted down the agreement at the end of
the fourth meeting of the China-Malaysia Joint Economic and Trade
Commission (JETC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Li Guohua and Malaysian Secretary General of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industries Asmat Kamaludin signed the

Satisfied with the achievements of the bilateral economic and
trade cooperation since the last JETC meeting in 1994, the two
sides shared the view that there are still great potentials for
further expansion and development of such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to upgrade the structure of commodities for
exchange and increase the share of value-added and hi-tech
commodities in the exchange.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto today
called on the people to get used to patronizing Indonesian
products in anticipation of global free trade.
</P>
<P>
"If people prefer to patronize foreign products, there will be
no market for domestic products," the president said when
receiving local officials at the Merdeka Palace here.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Indonesian nation must be accustomed to using
domestic products from now on because by the year 2020, trade will
be liberalized in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He said developed countries can produce better and cheaper
products than Indonesia because they have mastered science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
To prevent domestic industries from going bankrupt, children
who will experience the impact of liberalized trade by 2020 must
be accustomed to using domestic products from now on, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Overhauls Asset Evaluation Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China has disqualified two asset
evaluation agencies and suspended five others in an effort to
standardize the valuation industry, an official of the State
Administration of State Property (SASP) said today.
</P>
<P>
The SASP recently launched an annual check of the 107 asset
evaluation agencies directly under its administration and found
seven of them to be unqualified, said Zhang Jixiang, director of
the SASP's center overseeing asset valuation.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven, Zhongyu Certified Public Accountants and Beijing
Xinhua Certified Public Accountants have been stripped of their
qualifications for asset evaluation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other five, which include Zhongqing Certified Public
Accountants and Guangda Asset Evaluation Company, have had their
business operations suspended and were ordered to meet the
necessary requirements within a set period of time.
</P>
<P>
China approved and established its first specialized asset
valuation agency in 1990. It currently has more than 3,300 such
agencies and over 55,000 professional valuers.
</P>
<P>
As the number of asset appraising agencies has increased very
rapidly in recent years, some unstandard practices have cropped
up, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Blocks Tax Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) today rejected a tax reform bill proposed
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right government in the upper
house of parliament, in which it holds the majority.
</P>
<P>
The tax plan passed the lower house a week ago where the ruling
coalition is in majority, so it will now be sent to a mediation
committee comprising representatives from both sides on July 10.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to negotiate a compromise deal.
</P>
<P>
The SPD had previously vowed to block the tax reform package,
describing it as socially unjust and lacking a solid financial
basis.
</P>
<P>
The reform bill planned a net reduction in tax revenues of
about 30 billion marks (17 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Both political groups are believed to be considering raising
indirect taxes, including the value-added tax and the petroleum
tax, so as to make up tax revenue loss.

TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government decided to
ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) at a cabinet
meeting Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT, which prohibits all nuclear test explosions, was

The Japanese diet has passed a bill approving the ratification
of the treaty.

Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said his government
will submit documents of approval to the U.N. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty must be ratified by 44 nations -- the five declared
nuclear powers and all other nations believed to have nuclear
potential -- before it can take effect.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly hope that India and other countries will join the
CTBT," Ikeda said. "We will take every opportunity to persuade
them to do so."
</P>

Ikeda is expected to visit India and Pakistan later this
month.

<HEADLINE> TV Joke Stops Germans in Their Tracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Airports and travel agencies
throughout Germany have been bombarded with inquiries after a
television joke that Bonn is planning an "exit tax" on every
tourist leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel was trying to cut Germany's huge
national debt by forcing tourists to pay 100 dollars per adult and
50 dollars per child each time they left the country on vacation,
the German ARD public television network said in its "Monitor"
public affairs show Thursday evening
</P>
<P>
Later that evening and next morning Germany's airport
ticket-booking counters and travel services were "bombarded" with
telephone calls from puzzled travelers demanding explanations, or
threatening to cancel travel plans, said the German news agency
DPA.
</P>
<P>
The DPA quoted German Travel Bureau Association official Ariane
Alzer as saying: "This will cost us millions in lost revenue.".
</P>
<P>
However, the Cologne-based WDR television, which produced the
"Monitor" show for ARD, apparently remains light-hearted.
</P>
<P>
"It was supposed to be tongue-in-check, an ironical satire," a
WDR spokesman said. "But many Germans apparently just don't
understand that kind of humor."
</P>
<P>
The incident has dramatized Germany's public fears that the
Bonn government will take more unconventional moves to reduce
state debt and tighten its budget in its struggle to meet the
strict requirements specified in the European Union's Maastricht
treaty for joining the planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government has already been sharply criticized for its
fund-raising moves to revalue the central bank's gold reserves, to
sell state assets, and to raise indirect taxes such as a petrol
tax.

MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine police announced today
the solution of a case in which a famous columnist of a Manila
tabloid was shot to death in a taxi earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Efren Fernandez, director of the Philippine National Police
Criminal Investigation Group, said the cracking of the case came
after the arrest of a former auto painter and a member of a
notorious gang, who preyed on unwary taxi passengers in the past
few years in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
However, friends and families believed that Danilo Hernandez,
47, a columnist of People's Tonight, was killed by a drug
syndicate on June 2 for his vehement attack on drug traffickers in
his articles.
</P>
<P>
The auto painter, arrested after a gunfight on July 2, has
admitted participation in the killing of Hernandez. He pointed to
the gang member as the gunman who shot Hernandez in the head,
Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's death hit the headlines. At a press conference held
in the Presidential Palace, President Fidel Ramos urged the
immediate arrest of the murderers.

<P>
"The truth is that if Cambodia requests (such help), the ASEAN

Qiao gave a high evaluation of bilateral relations, expressing
the belief that Tonje's current visit is sure to promote the
friendship and cooperation between the two countries and their
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
China has all along paid close attention to the African
people's causes of independence and economic construction, Qiao
noted, adding that China and African counties have shared the same
historical experiences and are now facing the task of development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they should support and cooperate with each other,
Qiao said, adding that China hopes to discuss with Kenya
experiences in various aspects and to seek new forms of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tonje thanked China for its support to Kenya in its struggle
for emancipation and in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He extended congratulations on Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, and thanked the Chinese government's invitation to
Kenya to attend the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
China's smooth resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong is a great victory in its process towards a peaceful
reunification, and the success should be attributed to Deng
Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems," Tonje said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Asks for Help to Put Out Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has asked foreign countries
for help to put out a strong fire in a state-owned munition
factory in central Turkey Thursday, a Turkish official statement
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that Turkey asked Israel,
France, Britain, the United States and the Netherlands to
provide assistance for extinguishing the raging fire which
engulfed the TNT ammunition manufacturing complex owned by the
Machinery and Chemical Industry (MKE) company in the city of
Kirikkale.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli helicopters and one transport plane carrying
technical equipment and 41 crew arrived at Akincilar Air Base
today and the two helicopters took part in the fight against the
flames from the air at 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT), said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that France promised to dispatch
three fire experts to Turkey this noon, and Britain and the
U.S. will provide all kinds of logistic support in a bid to
put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
The explosions rocked the ammunitions factory in Kirikkale,
killing two people and injuring many others including three
policemen.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of civilians were evacuated from the
neighborhood as a precautionary step.
</P>

Turkish President Suleymand Demirel and other leaders rushed
to the city Thursday evening to inspect the explosion site and
battle against the fire.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dry Weather Becomes More Frequent: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- As Australia faces its worst
drought since 1982-83, researchers warned today that the
dry-weather cycles were becoming more frequent, possibly because
of global warming.
</P>
<P>
The dry conditions in Australia associated with El Nino events
are caused by changes in water temperature and air pressure over
the Pacific and are counter-balanced by heavy rainfall and floods
in South and North America.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Trenberth, an atmospheric scientist from the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in the United States, said today
that in the past 20 years there had been eight El Nino events and
only three La Ninas, the opposite phase of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
Trenberth, who was in Melbourne to attend an international
weather conference, said that the dry conditions could be
aggravated by global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
He warned "that now means that drought is something Australia
may have to deal with on a longer term basis."
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Meteorology also confirmed early this week that
Australia was heading for the most severe El Nino event since
1982-83, and it was likely to last for another 12 months, peaking
in December.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Bureau of Meteorology show that four out of
the 26 major El Nino events in the last 450 years occurred after
1982, when more than six billion US dollars worth of damage was
caused by floods in northern and central America, hurricanes in
the Pacific and drought and fires in Australia, South America and
part of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Trenberth said that the impact of higher temperatures on the
naturally- occurring El Nino events would be to increase the
evaporation of moisture from drought-affected areas and make more
moisture available to areas going through the wet phase of the
cycle.

SHENZHEN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen plans to take advantage
of Hong Kong's homecoming to step up cooperation with Hong Kong in
the financial sector, so as to open Shenzhen's banking industry
wider to the rest of the world, the director of the Shenzhen
Branch of the People's Bank of China said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of local bankers in south China's
Shenzhen, Jiang Chaoliang said everything is ready to start
exchange of bills between Shenzhen and Hong Kong and the payment
and settlement systems of the two places are expected to be linked
up soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shenzhen is also trying to win approval from the
central authorities for setting up joint venture security
companies, cooperative funds and joint venture insurance firms in
Shenzhen and for allowing Shenzhen-based overseas banks to handle
Renminbi yuan business, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's financial industry has been brisk since the
beginning of this year. Banks have provided 53 billion yuan in
loans and the amount of financing through money markets came to
nearly 100 billion yuan of funds raised from the local financial
market since the beginning of this year. The amount of loans
provided by Shenzhen-based foreign banks increased by 10.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper Baht Helps Boost Thailand's Tourism Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai tour operators have welcomed
the government's decision to float the baht as it will benefit
their business.
</P>
<P>
The floatation is tantamount to a devaluation of the Thai
currency and will make Thailand a place cheaper to stay in.
</P>
<P>
'The prices for our tour programs will be 25 percent cheaper on
the average if customers pay in U.S. dollars,"' said Tuangsak
Dephasadin, executive of T.T. Tour-East Co., one of the leading
tour operators in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the costs for Thais traveling abroad will be higher,
as they will have to pay more baht to exchange for foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has designated 1998 and 1999 "the revisit
Thailand years." The Tourism Authority of Thailand hopes its
campaign, 'amazing Thailand', will bring at least 17 million
foreign visitors into the country in the two years and generate a
revenue of around 16 billion U.S. dollars in the said period.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A sharp decline in gold stocks in
the wake of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) decision to
divest two-thirds of its gold reserves sapped the Australian share
market today, prompting across the board falls.
</P>
<P>
Investors dumped gold stocks from the opening bell after gold
price tumbled 7.00 US dollars an ounce overnight.
</P>
<P>
The gold index, which makes up approximately 3.0 percent of the
all ordinaries index, ended 4.1 percent lower today while gold
bullion closed in Sydney at 323.75 US dollars an ounce from 332.60
US dollars last.
</P>
<P>
The leading market indicator, the all ordinaries index,
retreated from a high of 2750.5 to finish 9.5 points down at
2733.4 points.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 338.87 million shares traded worth
755.02 Australian dollars (566.265 million US dollars), with falls
outnumbering rises 718 to 450.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said gold stocks were heavily sold in late afternoon
trade and support from the industrial sector waned as brokers took
"exposed positions."
</P>
<P>
"For many traders in the market it's been a black day, and with
the gold index down four percent, we would expect a lot of
volatility," Morgan's Stockbroking Associate Director Neil Bryan
said.
</P>
<P>
The RBA said it had completed the sales because gold did not
give it enough asset diversification. The move followed sales by
the Belgium, Austrian and South African central banks.
</P>
<P>
"It's a message that yet another central bank thinks gold is
less relevant," Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
Goldfields Ltd posted the biggest losses in the gold index,
losing 12.63 percent, or 24 cents, to close at 1.66 Australian
dollars while Wiluna Mines lost 43 cents, or 10.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Normandy Mining, which topped turnover with 9.780 million
shares worth 14.345 million Australian dollars (10.75 million US
dollars), fell five cents to close at 1.41 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Plutonic shares fell seven cents to close at 4.105 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hartley Poynton stock broker Ben Laurence said he did not
believe the gold market had bottomed.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index slipped 11.4 points to 1497.4, while
the all industrials index ended 8.4 points down at 4330.5.
</P>
<P>
The bank sector defied the trend, closing 15.2 points higher at
4952.6.
</P>
<P>
Home-grown investment bank Macquarie made the biggest gains,
surging 60 cents to 12.40 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANZ closed up 12 cents at 9.87 Australian dollars, Commonwealth
Bank firmed four cents to 16.06 Australian dollars, NAB closed up
five at 19.40 Australian dollars and Westpac added three to 7.91
Australian dollars.

Among the leaders, BHP dipped eight cents to 19.60 Australian
dollars while Rio Tinto finished up three cents at 22.43
Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Renew Clashes With Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes between
Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers continued in Hebron
today, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian teenagers began their stone-throwing
street battle after Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians threw a home-made hand-grenade and fire bombs
at the heavily-armed soldiers, while shouting anti-Israeli
slogans. The soldiers and border police responded with rubber
bullets and gas grenades.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven Palestinian stone-throwers were wounded, but
no Israelis were hurt.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security men succeeded earlier in the day in
calming down the situation, but later failed to hold back the
angry teenagers after prayers.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the Israeli military authorities sealed off the
largely Palestinian self-rule West Bank city, in an attempt to
put down further violence. Some Palestinians who were not Hebron
residents were barred from entering the city.
</P>
<P>
The week-long wave of violence took place after the insulting
anti-Islamic posters were found outside Palestinian stores. The
posters showed the Muslim Prophet Mohammed as a pig writing the
Koran. The incident aroused furious reactions from Muslims.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, undercover Israeli soldiers infiltrated into a
group of demonstrators as they began hurling stones at the
Jewish settlement around Beit Hadassah. Some teenagers were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army apparently believed that by so doing they
would succeed in putting an end to the daily clashes that have
left dozens of Palestinians and Israeli soldiers wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today again accused
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of being behind the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly cabinet session, Netanyahu said that
Israel had conveyed serious messages to the PNA over the
anti-Israeli violence in Hebron and Gush Qatif in the Gaza
Strip, and is now waiting to see what response there will be.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is trying to resume security cooperation
and negotiation with the Palestinians, but the violence is
sabotaging this.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu charged that the PNA is not doing enough to stop
the violence in Hebron and is organizing those demonstrators in
Gush Qatif.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse Index up 39.11 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index today gained 39.11 points, or 6.3 percent, from
Thursday, to close at 657.09.
</P>
<P>
Some 469 million shares worth 16.5 billion baht (about 589
million U.S. dollars) changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The stock market index rose for three consecutive days since
the Thai central bank on Wednesday abandoned the 13-year-old fixed
exchange mid-rate system and allowed the baht to float under
market forces.
</P>
<P>
The floatation is seen as a de facto devaluation of the baht
and has made Thai shares so cheap that investors simply cannot
resist the temptation to buy, pushing up demand for the shares and
the trading volume.
</P>
<P>
The SET on Thursday gained 49.19 points to close at 617.98
points.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader on Peace Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has not totally abandoned peace talks with the
Philippine government despite recent military offensives launched
by Manila, a rebel leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF deputy chief
for political affairs, as saying the MILF suspended the low-level
peace talks "merely to wait for a better atmosphere to resume."
</P>
<P>
In response to the Thursday meeting of the Southern
Philippines' Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), the MILF
leader also said his group will welcome all initiatives by various
groups for the resumption of its peace negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD met Thursday in Maguindanao province, western
Mindanao, to seek exploratory solutions to the recent conflict
between the military and the MILF, which displaced thousands of
civilians in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD meeting decided to continue efforts for the
resumption of the peace negotiations between the MILF and Manila.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome all efforts to normalize the situation," Jaafar
said.
</P>
<P>
But Jaafar said the resumption of the stalled peace
negotiations will all depend on the "sincerity" of the government
in seeking genuine and lasting solutions to the Mindanao problem.
</P>
<P>
The MILF pulled out of the peace talks with the government late
last month after the government troops overran a major MILF camp
in North Cotabato after weeks of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began peace talks with the government in early January
this year.

<HEADLINE> W. African States Close Down Embassies in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and six other West African
countries have closed down their embassies in Sierra Leone, in
what appeared to be a prelude to the military intervention led by
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria media reported today that the withdrawal of their
diplomats by Ghana, Guinea, Senegal, Benin, Togo and Cote
d'Ivoire started on Wednesday and is expected to be completed
today.
</P>
<P>
Before the massive withdrawal, Nigeria diplomats had already
left Freetown a few weeks ago, Foreign Ministry sources in Abuja
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the close-down of embassies is following the
recommendation of the foreign ministers of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) when they met in Conakry of
Guinea in late June.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Foreign Ministry sources said the withdrawal of
diplomats may be a prelude to the storming of Freetown by the
ECOWAS peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Malu has said recently
that his troops are ready to flush out the coupists in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
But ECOWAS foreign ministers have agreed in Conakry that
negotiations and economic sanctions will be used to force out the
new military government led by Major Paul Johnny Koromah, before
military intervention is being taken.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Starts Control Plan for Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Ministry of Health has
launched a special five-year control program to curb malaria
which has claimed dozens of lives in the eastern African country
since last month.
</P>
<P>
Currently malaria is a leading killer across Kenya due to the
heavy rains as anti-malaria drugs have ran out of stock in most
districts of the country, the East African Standard newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has already provided 42 kits of drugs per
district and will send additional supplies soon, Director of
Medical Services in the ministry James Mwanzia was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he appealed to medical practitioners and leaders to
help educate the public on control measures especially in rural
areas and directed medical personnel in the affected areas to
work with commitment to combat the problem.
</P>
<P>
There is "an upsurge in mosquito density countrywide due to
the cold weather and the situation is compounded by malnutrition
and anemia especially among children who are most affected," he
said in Uasin Gishu District, western Kenya, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He is on a tour of malaria-prone districts there also
including Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Kakamega.
</P>
<P>
Eight people died of malaria in Uasin Gishu last week and up
to 30 malaria victims have died in Nandi following an outbreak of
highland malaria in the area a couple of weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> China Urges International Community to Help Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's Permanent Representative Wu
Jianmin said here on Thursday that emphasis should be placed on
the world's developing countries, especially the least-developed
ones.
</P>
<P>
"The external economic environment was becoming ever more
important to the economic growth of such countries, and owing to
their weak economic bases, they were more vulnerable to
unfavorable changes in the external economic environment," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a high-level panel sponsored by the United
Nations Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
"Many were weighed down by poverty, population pressure, heavy
foreign debt, worsening trade terms, inadequate infrastructure,
and environmental challenges," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu called on the international community, especially the
developed countries, to contribute to creating a sound
international economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"The trend of declining development assistance should be
reversed as quickly as possible," he stressed. "The international
community should take full account of the difficulties and needs
of developing countries when formulating the rules of the game."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Wu said, developing countries should take an
effective part in the decision-making process of world economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The stability of financial markets should be maintained to
keep volatility from threatening the fragile situations in
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.N., Wu added, it should carry out its reform
process with the intent of establishing a fair and equitable new
international economic order.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Upgrade Air Traffic Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- South African air traffic
department will modernize its air traffic services infrastructure
over next four years at the cost of 30 million Rand (6.7 million
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Air Traffic and Navigation Services Company (ATNS) had
entered into a contract with Decca (SA) for the installation and
upgrading of a significant section of the Very High Frequency
(VHF) transmitters and receivers throughout South Africa, ATNS
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project involves the upgrading of all existing
transmitters and receivers nationwide, the relocation of some of
the existing sites, and the implementation of new sites which may
be required to provide full radio coverage across the country
from about 7,000 feet and above, an ATNS spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said all VHF transmitters and receivers in use in South
Africa required upgrading because of shortcomings in the existing
radio communications coverage.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled duration of the project is four years and work
will begin in the Johannesburg flight information region.
</P>
<P>
"Once the systems have been installed and commissioned, the
air traffic control centers will be well equipped to handle the
ever increasing air traffic flow within South African air space
and the intensified demands of air travel's stringent safety
requirements," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Mining Industry Urged to Empower Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Mines Minister Swithun
Mombeshora has urged the mining industry to assist the government
in ensuring the economic empowerment of previously disadvantaged
black Zimbabweans is not just window dressing.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day 25th annual general meeting of the
Association of Mine Managers of Zimbabwe in Nyanga of east
Zimbabwe last night, Mombeshora said the racial composition of
various corporate boards within the mining industry reflects the
skewed nature of ownership in favor of white Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
He said the government took a dim view of mining companies
which include black Zimbabweans on their boards to appear as
though they were empowering them, yet they deprived them of the
necessary authority.
</P>
<P>
"The empowerment of our people must not be a window dressing
exercise. There are instances where our people are appointed to
chairmanship positions in some of your companies and yet real
power and decision making processes have been totally removed
from the incumbent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to large mining firms to consider
assisting small miners or people intending to venture into mining
but lacked resources as part of their contribution toward the
success of the indigenization program.
</P>
<P>
He also urged mining firms to diversify into the production of
non-traditional minerals such as non-metallic minerals.
</P>
<P>
Although Zimbabwe was endowed with a diversity of minerals, he
added, the mining industry was dominated by the production of a
few minerals such as gold, asbestos, coal, nickel, iron, chrome
and platinum.

<HEADLINE> Iran Declares Its Government Ministers Free from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's judicial chief claimed here
today that his investigation has shown no signs of financial
corruption among the ministers of the outgoing cabinet of
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
At the Friday congregation, Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi told
prayers gathered at Tehran University "All of these ministers
have been investigated by my office, there has not been any
case of financial corruption."
</P>
<P>
Article 142 of the Iranian Constitution has made it incumbent
on the Judiciary chief to have a record of the assets of
ministers before and after taking office.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 Iranian members of the parliament (MP) last week
called on Yazdi to implement the article in the Constitution
with some concern about the corruption of high-ranking government
officials.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the corruption has reportedly been a big social
problem due to the tremendous economic hardship in the country
since late 1993. Some banking, customs and government officials
have been prosecuted for crimes of corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, Yazdi said, "The MP's can be sure that I had already
done that duty."
</P>
<P>
The judicial chief said that the law did not make it
mandatory for him to declare the assets of the ministers to the
public.
</P>
<P>
According to the judicial official, the discrepancy in the wealth
accumulated will be reported after consultations with Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"If there is discrepancy, it will be brought to the attention
of the leader, and if he sees it fit, the people will find out
about it," Yazdi added.

<HEADLINE> Official Outlines Work of Economic Services Bureau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for Economic Services
Stephen Ip of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions said
here today that economic prospects over the medium remain good.
</P>
<P>
"The government forecast is for a trend Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growth rate of 5 percent per annum," he added.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center, Ip gave a brief introduction on Hong Kong's economic
fundamentals and the work covered by the Economic Services Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has long served as a major trade, financial, tourism
and business center and is widely regarded as one of the most
competitive economies in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past two decades, the average economic growth rate in
real terms was about 7 percent per year. Economic growth has been
led mainly by a surge in the exports of goods, particularly
re-exports, as well as export of services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ip outlined the work of his Economic Services Bureau, which,
known as Economic Services Branch before July 1, is responsible
for eight areas: civil aviation, shipping and port development,
tourism, telecommunications, postal services, energy, agriculture
and fisheries and meteorological services.
</P>
<P>
On civil aviation, Ip said, "We are committed to maintaining
Hong Kong's position as a center of international and regional
civil aviation. Our target is to ensure that Hong Kong's airport
capacity and air services are sufficient to meet the growth in
demand."
</P>
<P>
On the regulatory side, the Basic Law provides that the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall continue the
previous system of civil aviation management in Hong Kong and keep
its own aircraft register, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We and the Civil Aviation Department will ensure that the high
standards of civil aviation management achieved in Hong Kong are
maintained," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the field of port development, the secretary said
that the port is Hong Kong's most important natural resource since
"over 90 percent of our trade, by weight, is handled by the port."
</P>
<P>
Since the opening up of China's economy in the late 1970s, Hong
Kong's container terminals have been serving as the main conduit
for South China's trade with the world. The strong export growth
on the mainland has made Hong Kong the world's busiest container
port for five years in a row, he continued.
</P>
<P>
He reassured that there is no change in Hong Kong's autonomy in
managing the shipping business after July 1, saying "China's
commitment to maintaining Hong Kong's position as a major
international port and maritime center is clearly spelt out in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law."

MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The year-on-year inflation rate in
the Philippines rose slightly to 4.8 percent in June from 4.2
percent in May, the National Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
But the latest inflation level was still lower compared with
the year-ago level of 9.8 percent, according to figures released
by the office.
</P>
<P>
The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, posted the highest inflation rate at 8.1 percent,
while Eastern Visayas registered the lowest rate at 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation for the first semester this year averages 4.6
percent, much lower than the 6.4 percent target for the whole year
under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said today that the
government is optimistic inflation could be close to the lower end
of the target range of 6.0 to 7.0 percent, if not better.
</P>
<P>
He said the Central Bank will continue watching any possible
pressure on inflation, particularly on the demand side.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to look at the core inflation and ensure
that liquidity growth will be significantly more prudent than what
is programmed," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Firms Urged to Involve in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Union of Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges (TUCCE) has urged local firms to get more
involved in the country's defense projects.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News today quoted Erol Gemalmaz,
deputy chairman of the TUCCE's Executive Board as saying that the
TUCCE aims to encourage local firms to engage in some of the
defense projects worth 150 billion U.S. dollars that Turkey has
planned for the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Gemalmaz said that a report issued by the TUCCE Thursday
disclosed channels which could be used by industrialists who are
considering investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that currently only 21 percent of the primary
weapons, equipment and spare parts needed by the Turkish Armed
Forces could be turned out by domestic production, and the
remaining is imported from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Retired General Fikret Ulger, who prepared the TUCCE report,
said that among neighboring countries, Turkey ranks the third
after Israel and Russia in allocating funds for defense.
</P>
<P>
Ulger noted that Turkey could provide 75 percent of its total
defense needs by boosting the output of related local firms and
making wise investments in the field based on strategic needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, among the 150-billion-dollar defense
project, Turkey needs 750 helicopters, 180 rocket and missile

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Prehistoric Fern Habitat Discovered in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- World's largest habitat of Cyathea
Spinulosa, a prehistoric fern, and regarded as live botanical
fossil for its co-existence with dinosaurs, was discovered
recently in Longling County, southwest China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Spinulosa led world's vegetation about 100 million years ago,
and therefore proves valuable to the studies of palaeogeology,
palaeobotany and palaeoclimatology.
</P>
<P>
The size and density of the Spinulosa assemblage is hardly
rivaled in the world, said an official from World Wildlife Fund
(WWF).
</P>
<P>
Densely populating 191.4 hectares in a large natural reserve
called Yiwanshui, meaning "a bowl of water", three species of the
fern have been found to be present in two categories. Yunnan is
known as a kingdom of plants for its diverse flora.
</P>
<P>
Larger than all previously discovered habitats of Spinulosa
combined elsewhere in the country, Yiwanshui is thickly vegetated
with the giant fern four meters tall, which is quite rare in the
world. Some trees even reach a height of ten meters.
</P>
<P>
Strict regulations are being drafted to ensure protection of
the newly-discovered Spinulosa habitat.

<HEADLINE> Hefty Wage Bill for Civil Servants Approved in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The government has approved the
allocation of about nine billion Zimbabwe Dollars (818 million
U.S. Dollars) to meet several salary and allowance adjustments
for its 160,000-strong civil servants with effect from July 1.
</P>
<P>
The new packages announced by Public Service, Labor and Social
Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro include payment of the final
20 percent tranche from the job evaluation exercise and a 10
percent across-the-board cost of living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Transport and housing allowances went up by between 20 and 31
percent on a sliding scale while night duty, on-call, call-out,
stand-by and uniform allowances would be hiked for those in the
health sector.
</P>
<P>
The adjustments approved on Thursday this week were the result
of successful negotiations between representatives of the
government and respective staff associations which were concluded
on Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants went on a nationwide strike last August
demanding higher salaries and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The government granted them an across-the-board 20 percent
salary rise and also paid them their annual bonuses, suspended in
1995 because of a crisis in the state's finances.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro, however, said while the increases which would cover
the next 18 months were within funds approved by the government,
it was crucial that such increments be synchronized with ability
to pay considering impact of the expenditure on the overall
economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sees Moderate Growth in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria said in
its latest research report that the country recorded moderate
growth in agriculture last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank's 1996 annual report, the aggregate
index of agricultural production rose by 3.7 percent compared to
3.4 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
All the sub-sectors contributed to the increase, with crop
production up by 3.6 percent against 3.0 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, all the major staple food items recorded
significant increase except maize and rice whose production
declined by 10.3 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that the hectarage under maize and rice
cultivation was reduced, owing largely to inadequacy and late
supply of fertilizers, while farmers switched to planting of
millet, sorghum and groundnut which are less fertilizer
dependent.
</P>
<P>
Cash crop increased by 14.4 percent. Soybean, cotton and
coffee enjoyed appreciable increases while the output of rubber
and shea nut declined.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, the prices of Nigeria's major
agriculture export commodities were generally depressed in the
world market during the year under review.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine commodities monitored, five recorded price rises
while four suffered price drop compared to the 1995 level. The
bank did not say what the commodities are.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chart Change Drive to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Will President Fidel Ramos stay in
power after his term ends next June?
</P>
<P>
Most Filipinos, including contenders in the race to succeed the
president, could hardly give a definite answer at the moment
despite Ramos' assurance that he will step down next year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, the president serves a
single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, as campaigns for charter changes are
continuing, no body can predict what will happen at the country's
political stage tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, President Ramos has repeatedly
promised publicly that he plans to retire after his six years in
office are up.
</P>
<P>
But last week, Ramos said that he is finding it hard to resist
the "wide-spread clamor" for him to run for re-election. He was
referring to growing calls to amend the constitution to lift the
limits of his term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' statement has led to speculations in the country that
the president might seek a second term if charter change drives
would succeed in the end.
</P>
<P>
Amending the charter in the Philippines can be done through
three ways -- a people's initiative, the convening of the Congress
into a constituent assembly, or the calling for a constitutional
convention.
</P>
<P>
At present, campaigners are trying the first option and the
second method to achieve their objective -- to lift term limits of
all elective officials, including the president.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, an organization called "People's
Initiative for Reforms, Modernization and Action" (PIRMA) has been
gathering signatures of voters who favor the lifting of term
limits of elective officials. And last month, PIRMA presented 5.5
million signatures to the Election Commission, calling for a
national referendum on charter changes.
</P>
<P>
The signatures represented 15 percent of about 36 million
registered voters although the constitution requires only 12
percent of voters to set in motion a system of People's Initiative
to amend the charter.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission will decided PIRMA's fate next Friday
after it failed Thursday to hand down its decision on the
controversial petition of the group because its commissioners were
too tight-lipped to reveal their respective opinions during a
tense meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Election Commission's move has provoked a heat debate among
politicians since the country's Supreme Court last month denied
the PIRMA petition.
</P>
<P>
"What the Supreme Court says, goes. It is the final arbiter,
the ultimate interpreter of the law. The Election Commission can
only implement the law, it cannot interpret it," said Senator
Miriam Defensor-Santiago, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Constitutional Amendments.
</P>
<P>
She said that members of the Election Commission risk
impeachment should they insist on deliberating on the PIRMA
petition.
</P>
<P>
But Bernardo Pardo, chairman of the Election Commission
questioned the finality of the Supreme Court ruling on June 10
that there was no enabling law on People's Initiative to amend the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The six-six vote by the High Tribunal on the petition did not
provide a clear ruling on the absence of an enabling act, he said.
</P>
<P>
Filipinos are now waiting anxiously for another week to see
whether the Election Commission will give President Ramos a chance
to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts said that even if PIRMA's petition will
be rejected by the Election Commission, Ramos' hope for a second
term has not finally been dashed because the House of
Representative dominated by the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union
for Christian Democrats) is trying to convene the Congress into a
constitutional assembly.
</P>
<P>
Besides, President Ramos, who distanced himself from charter
change campaigns last year, are now openly supporting
constitutional amendments, though, he said, he does not favor the
lifting of his term limits.
</P>
<P>
With the strong support of President Ramos, the charter change
campaign will not stop until all political parties nominate their
presidential candidates in November, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Taxing Informal Sector Unfair: Chiluba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) - President Frederick Chiluba has said
that taxing people in Zambia's informal sector will be grossly
unfair because the government has not given them any support.
</P>
<P>
"The Post" newspaper today quoted Chiluba as saying on
Wednesday that "some of them make a lot of money but it is money
with a lot of risks."
</P>
<P>
"The lack of government support to the informal sector makes
it illegitimate for the government to ask for tax from them. We
have not provided them with any facilities, they can't borrow
from the banks, they lack government support... We haven't
provided them with a roof... It would be grossly unfair to go and
hunt for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that it will be very difficult to
collect taxes from people in this sector because they are not
organized.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia a large number of people are working in informal
sector.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Marks 60th Anniversary of July 7 Incidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and overseas scholars
gathered in Beijing today to mark the 60th anniversary of the July
7th Incident, the opening salvo in the nation's protracted armed
struggle against Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1937, Japanese troops marching on Beijing
encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces at Lugou Bridge
(Marco Polo Bridge) in the southwestern suburbs of the city.
</P>
<P>
The defeat of the Japanese after an eight-year-long war, in
1945, represented the first full victory over a foreign invader in
contemporary Chinese history. 35 million Chinese died in the
bloody war.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from a dozen countries and regions, including China,
Japan and the United States, attended today's meeting. Some said
that the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-45) had not only
changed the direction of Chinese history, but also exerted a great
influence on the situations in Asia as well as in the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Victory over Japan, as well as Hong Kong's return to the
motherland are two great events for the Chinese nation this
century -- they are milestones of the struggle of the Chinese
people to wipe out century-old humiliation," said Bai Jefu, a
Chinese scholar.
</P>
<P>
Hu Sheng, vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said that the
meeting provided an opportunity for the Chinese people to recount
history, look into the future, and invigorate the country.
</P>
<P>
"While China concentrates on its economic construction, it also
acts as an important force in safeguarding world peace," said Hu,
adding that, "the so-called `China Threat' spread by some
foreigners was groundless."
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the CASS in collaboration with
several Beijing-based history-study societies. It heralds the
start of a week-long commemoration of the war, which is expected
to push the nation's patriotic fervor to a new height after the
handover of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Imported Goods to Cost More in Wake of Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Prices of imported goods will rise
by up to 30 percent in the near future due to the Thai
government's decision to float the baht on Wednesday, retailers
expected.
</P>
<P>
Among items to be affected are computers and their accessories,
and imported alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
Computers and their accessories are expected to rise between 15
to 30 percent after local retailers sell out of their current
stock or can no longer keep prices down.
</P>
<P>
Some computer retailers have already begun working out new
prices, which could be at least 15 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers have already stopped distributing equipment due to
the price changes. They are waiting for the baht to stabilize and
to work out a new price range.
</P>
<P>
"The floated baht will hurt our business as our goods are
imported and the prices will go up," said a manager at ASL
(Thailand) Co.
</P>
<P>
Prices of alcoholic drinks, particularly wine, will also jump
after the present stocks run out, import agents and dealers say.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices, which ranged between 4,200 to 4,300 baht per
baht-weight (in Thailand gold weight unit is also called 'baht',
and one baht weight is about 15.2 grams) before the currency baht
was floated on Wednesday, were quoted on Thursday at 4,600 baht.
</P>
<P>
Consumers also worry that they would be badly affected if price
controls on commodity goods are not effectively imposed.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors to be affected include the automotive and
information technology industries.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The repatriation of some
100,000 Congolese (former Zaire) refugees, who crossed into
Tanzania during the war against Mobotu Sese Seko, is on hold
pending proper preparations, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A scheduled repatriation on Monday of 300 Congolese refugees
was postponed pending discussions between Dar es Salaam and
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs Bernard
Mchomvu told reporters here on Thursday that arrangements for the
safe return of the refugees being kept in camps in Kasulu
district in Kigoma, western Tanzania, were being made jointly by
Tanzania, Democratic Congo and the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
"There are procedures which guide the handling of refugees -
you cannot just let them trek home. We have to guarantee their
security," explained Mchomvu.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa's Press Secretary, Patrick Chokala
said, the delay in the repatriation was due to "technical
matters".
</P>
<P>
Chokala also said, "we don't send people home to problems."
</P>
<P>
At present, Tanzania is host to about 400,000 refugees
including 300,00o Burundian Hutus, who fled violence in the

LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson might never have a chance
to fight in Britain as The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC)
meets next week to decide whether to ban the American boxer
following his ear-biting assault on Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
And any British boxer who fights Mike Tyson in the future faces
having his licence revoked.
</P>
<P>
BBBC chairman Leonard Read is recommending the ban and wants
stiffer measures included to stop British fighters taking on the
former world heavyweight champion in any match held abroad.
</P>
<P>
Read, who described Tyson's attack as "cannibalistic", will
also write to the European Boxing Union asking them to extend any
ban to the whole of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The BBBC have already written to the Nevada State Athletic
Commission recommending a life ban when they meet to decide the
fighter's punishment on Wednesday.

Zhenhai Coastal Fort, located close to sites where British
invading forces met Chinese resistance, has opened to the public
in Zhenhai, near Ningbo in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, also Chairman of the Central
Military Committee, provided a calligraphic rendering of the
museum's name.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC), as well as Zhang
Zhen and Chi Haotian, vice-chairmen of the Central Military
Committee, also sent calligraphic tributes to the museum.
</P>
<P>
Zhenhai, at the eastern tip of coastal Zhejiang province,
witnessed several military exchanges between defending Chinese
people and forces and Japanese, British and French invading navies.
</P>
<P>
Exhibition halls in the museum, covering 20,000 square meters,
recount the history of those conflicts. On the southern side of
Zhaobao Mountain, Chinese soldiers, assisted by locals, fought a
fierce battle against British invaders.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the coastal defense museum began in April
1995 and was completed this June. It cost 18 million yuan (2.1
million US dollars), 10.5 million of which was donated by local
institutes and individuals.
</P>
<P>
Ruins of the Zhenhai coastal defense fort near the museum have
recently been listed as a site useful for patriotic education, and
they have been placed under state protection.

<HEADLINE> BBC Coming to Tanzania in Full Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) plans to enter into partnership with a local
radio station here so that it can broadcast on Frequency
Modulation (FM) wavelength, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
BBC Rebroadcasting Manager for Africa and the Middle East
Michel Lobelle told the press here on Thursday at an occasion to
mark the BBC 40th anniversary that the move aims to increase the
number of BBC listeners in the country.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the BBC Swahili Section's new program plans, he
said BBC has already entered into partnership with Tanzanian
private radio stations -- Radio Free Africa in Mwanza and United
Radio Station in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Lobelle's announcement came in the wake of reports that BBC
has been allowed to broadcast in Kenya for 24 hours daily on FM
wavelength.
</P>
<P>
The BBC rebroadcasting manager said that BBC could not apply
to have its own channel in Tanzania as it did in Kenya because of
the 1993 Broadcast Act which binds foreign corporations which
want to broadcast in Tanzania to seek partnership with local
stations.

NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is set to
outlaw through legislation all forms of discrimination against
people infected with HIV or those with AIDS, the Kenyan Times

for HIV will be voluntary with the informed consent of the
employee, a document from the Ministry of Health said.
</P>
<P>
The law will also ensure that insurance companies do not
decline compensation to those insured and were infected after
they bought their insurance papers.
</P>
<P>
Up to one million Kenyans may die of AIDS if the prevention
and control measures are not pursued more aggressively by the
early next century, said the document.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR Official Briefs On Public Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A principal official of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region said here today that there
would be continuity in the policy of managing public finance.
</P>
<P>
Kwong Ki Chi, secretary for the treasury of the Hong Kong SAR
said at a media briefing: "I'm so confident about it because all
the policies have, in fact, been enshrined in the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law provides that the Hong Kong SAR shall have
independent finances and practise an independent taxation system.
</P>
<P>
In Article 107, the mini constitution of the Hong Kong SAR
stipulates that the HKSAR shall follow the principle of keeping
expenditure within the limits of revenues in drawing up its
budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal balance, avoid deficits and
keep the budget commensurate with the growth rate of its gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the underlying philosophy guiding the
management of public finance in Hong Kong is to keep a small
government and live within our means."
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that small is beautiful. The main reason is that
we firmly believe that private sector is the engine of growth and
the government should not consume so much resources of the
community to squeeze out the private sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the secretary for treasury, the Hong Kong SAR will
continue to take strict control of the government expenditure so
as to achieve the goal of living within one's means.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the government expenditure should follow the
trend growth rate of the economy, and the GDP growth is based on a
five-year planning period, said Kwong. As to the revenue policy,
he added, a low, simple and predictable taxation system would
remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Kwong estimated that the financial reserves on March 13, 1998,
the end of this financial year would stand at about 48 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Promises Big Loans for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will lend China 2.5
to three billion US dollars annually for the three next fiscal
years beginning this month, according to the Bank's resident
mission in China.
</P>
<P>
The loans were approved by the Bank's board of executive
directors and will be used for infrastructure construction,
poverty reduction, environmental protection, and development of
human resources, the mission said.
</P>
<P>
Bank figures show that for fiscal year 1997, which ended on
June 30, the World Bank committed over 2.8 billion US dollars in
loans to 11 Chinese projects.
</P>
<P>
To date the bank has approved 27.97 billion US dollars for 184
projects in China, including nearly 9.2 billion US dollars in
concessional loans extended by the International Development
Association, the Bank cheap loan branch.
</P>
<P>
World Bank-funded projects in China, which resumed its
connection with the Bank in 1980, cover almost all sectors of the
economy but are mostly in agriculture, transportation, energy,
health, education, environmental protection, and industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry official said that the World Bank has not
only provided China with relatively cheap funds but has also
provided the advanced management necessary for China's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the Bank's China mission, said that
the bank and China have established a "mature and important"
cooperative partnership and that China is one of the best
countries in terms of implementation of Bank-supported projects.
</P>
<P>
To be more efficient, quicker and more tuned-in to China's
needs, the World Bank will reinforce its mission in China in a
program of reorganization in the Bank's headquarters in
Washington, Bottelier noted.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Smashes Car Syndicate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian police have detained
four suspects in connection with a syndicate in which motor
vehicles were being cleared by a fake International Police
(Interpol) office in Lusaka' Matero township.
</P>
<P>
While confirming the incident, acting police spokesman Binwell
Chimfwembe said, "our investigations revealed that there were
'Interpol Offices' in Matero compound where vehicles were being
cleared using forged Interpol clearance certificates, motor
vehicle Blue Books (licenses) and driving licenses."
</P>
<P>
The police raided the den in Matero last week in two separate
incidents and arrested the suspects.
</P>
<P>
In the raid, the police uncovered three clearing houses
complete with all official documents including Interpol clearance
certificates and Zambia Revenue Authority documents.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe said that some of the 85 vehicles impounded in
Lusaka by Interpol recently believed to have been stolen from
neighboring countries could have been cleared by the same
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Other items recovered in the raid were passports, national
registration cards, immigration documents, stencils used in the
forgery, official date stamps, needles for making depressions of
blue book numbers and unidentified chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Chimfwembe cautioned the public to verify any Interpol
clearance with the Interpol Office at the police headquarters in
Lusaka as the Interpol Office also processes Zambia Revenue
Authority documents, passports and national registration cards as
well as all kinds of immigration papers.

<HEADLINE> Baht Floating to Deal Blows to Auto, "IT" Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automotive industry will
be dealt a serious blow after the Thai currency was allowed to
float since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both local producers and completely-built-up (CBU) vehicle
importers will feel the pinch. While local-content manufacturers,
which supply 54-80 percent of various assemblers' requirements,
still use imported raw materials, they will have to pay a higher
price because of the weaker baht.
</P>
<P>
As a result, auto sales for this year may drop by 7-8 percent
on last year to 550,000, as against a total vehicle sales target
of 600,000 units, according to Surapong Paisitpatanapong,
spokesman for the Federation of Thai Industries' Automotive
Industry Club.
</P>
<P>
Wasan Pothipimpanon, whose Benz Thonglor group is the largest
Mercedes-Benz dealer in Thailand, said short-term benefits look
good as people will want to buy at the old prices, but the
long-term effect is a price increase of about 100,000 baht for
Mercedes-Benz products.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it may take three or four months for buyers to
accept the new prices.
</P>
<P>
The information technology (IT) industry will be another sector
that will suffer badly, especially for those companies that have
signed large contracts with the government and are committed to
provide equipment that will have to be paid for in US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The entire IT market would see a downturn, and many projects
might have to be canceled as the suppliers could not meet the
higher costs of equipment involved.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast that this year 30 percent of the 'IT' business
in Thailand is to be government contracts, but only 60 percent of
these contracts are likely to be honored.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects Israeli Accusation over Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has rejected Israeli claims that
the PNA is responsible for the continued violence in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with European Union peace envoy Miguel
Moratinos in Gaza on Thursday night, Arafat said he was doing
everything in his power to reduce the level and intensity of
violence and to prevent it from eruption.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the Israelis were the ones that failed to
honor the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos conveyed a message from Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu to Arafat, which asked the Palestinian side
to take firm actions to halt the escalation of violence in the
West Bank city Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Arafat, Moratinos had held talks with
Netanyahu, who strongly held the PNA responsible for the violence
in Hebron and accused Arafat of organizing the riots there.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier charged the PNA for violating the Hebron
agreement by not ordering its police forces to stop the
violence. He warned that Israel would not accept a situation in
which violence continued at the same time of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met with U.S. ambassador to
Israel, Martin Indyk, and Egyptian ambassador there, Mohammed
Bassiouny, Thursday to discuss the current situation. He also
urged the PNA to act firmly to quash the clashes in Hebron to
restore law and order.
</P>
<P>
Violence continued in Hebron Thursday, although at a
relatively lower level.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the recent wave of violence erupted,
Israeli undercover troops infiltrated the Palestinian
stone-throwers and arrested several of them. At least five
Palestinian stone-throwers were injured by rubber bullets fired
by Israeli soldiers during the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of clashes was sparked last week by the
leaflets, pasted in the Hebron area by a Jerusalem Jewish woman,
Tatiana Susskind, which depicted the Islamic prophet Mohammed as
a pig writing the holy Koran.
</P>
<P>
Susskind, 25, was charged at the Jerusalem District Court
Thursday with offending religious sensibilities and supporting a
terrorist group, the extremist rightist Kach movement.
</P>
<P>
The continued violence reflected the volatile situation caused
by the protracted deadlock in the peace process. The
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been frozen since March
when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> China's Legal Assistance For The Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wuhan, July 4 (Xinhua) -- As a sign of further legal
development in China, a 16-year-old boy recently won a case
brought against his father who had beaten him up and forced him
out of the home because he quarelled with his step-mother.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaolong could hardly believe it after his natural father
denied him financial support. But, fortunately he got help free of
charge when a lawyer, sent by the Wuhan University Legal Aid
Center For the Weak, successfully won the case when the court
decided that his father should provide him with a monthly
allowance and a place to live.
</P>
<P>
"We feel quite relieved to see justice done and 'small
patatoes' like Qiu getting legal protection through our help,"
commented Wan Exiang, a law professor and the founder of China's
first non-governmental legal aid society. It provides legal
services for the poor and the weak, especially women, children and
the disabled people.
</P>
<P>
Acting as public defenders, the center's lawyers have handled
216 cases and provided information for thousands of people in need
since it was founded five years ago in Wuhan, capital of Hebei
Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang is not alone in his efforts to introduce a legal
aid system to China, where the concept of the rule of law is
gaining wider acceptance.
</P>
<P>
The national judiciary formally approved the system on a trial
basis in 1994 in certain cities. In November of 1995, China's
first official legal aid office was founded in the southern city
of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Since then legal aid offices have been set up in over 50 cities
in 17 provinces and autonomous regions, financed by government and
donations from various organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, legal aid agencies in the big cities of
Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Zhengzhou have sent
public defenders on nearly 1,400 court cases.
</P>
<P>
The practice is set to become an institution. The revised
Chinese criminal procedure and lawyer laws that took effect
earlier this year allow for public defenders in court for those
who are unable to hire a lawyer for themselves.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce this, the Ministry of Justice set up a legal aid
center in May of this year, along with the China Legal Aid
Fund. Minister of Justice Xiao Yang has called for the
establishment of a sound legal aid system as a national network
within the next 15 years. Now institutes of law and university law
schools are being encouraged to participate in the legal aid.
</P>
<P>
Provisional rules on legal assistance say that a lawyer should
perform the public defender service a minimum of once or twice a
year free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the public defender means that it is no
longer just empty talk when we say everyone is equal before the
law," said Ma Kechang, a legal expert at Wuhan University, and "It
means a step further in building up a socialist democracy."

SHENYANG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning

The heavily industrialized province has become better known to

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Empowerment Tips Balance of Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Asian economic empowerment has
tipped the balance of the global economic order and would
eventually influence the global political arrangement, Malaysian
Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, the cultural re-empowerment of Asia will be a
tremendous force in the shaping of the new global cultural order,"
he said when opening a conference on "Globalization: The
Perceptions, Experiences and Responses of The Religious Traditions
and Cultural Communities in the Asia Pacific Region" in Shah
Alam, about 30 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Asian would not make any significant contribution
in the making of the new global culture if it remained asleep upon
its "treasure chest of wisdom, science and art, instead of drawing
from its infinitely variegated contents to give birth to new
expression," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader was of the view that globalization has
done Asian countries a good service, especially from an economic
point of view where "the table has been turned, with the dominator
fearing the loss of his domination".
</P>
<P>
"The technology driving the current phase of globalization must
serve as a vehicle that brings about our great re-awakening," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the present wave of globalization and information
revolution has transformed the global scenario while technology
has disrupted patterns and structures of dominance, "be it the
dominance of the North over the South or of the South elites over
their societies".
</P>
<P>
The impact is devastating at both the international and
domestic levels, he said, adding in fact the distinction between
what is domestic and what is foreign has blurred as every village
becomes globalized.
</P>
<P>
He said "globalization has become the buzzword in Europe and
North America as it is set to change their economic fortunes."
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic societies, encompassing Europe and North America,
are experiencing a rude awakening with the flooding of Asian
goods in their markets and their jobs threatened by global
competition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the rise of the Atlantic societies, Asia has had to
adjust itself to external elements and these centuries have
prepared them to accommodate externally induced changes.
</P>
<P>
However, this was not so for the Atlantic societies as "only
their elites were involved in moving and shaking the world, while
the rest of them have remained in their comfortable isolation,
oblivious to what was happening to the rest of the world," he
said.

<HEADLINE> India to Enhance Struggle Against Economic Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has decided
to activate an economic crime buster as part of the efforts to
enhance struggle against such crimes in the country, a government
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of economic reforms in the country six
years ago, cases of economic crimes have been on the rise. The
government has decided to reconstitute the Economic Intelligence
Council (EIC), formed in 1985, to strengthen coordination and
formulate an integrated strategy to combat economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the reconstituted EIC is slated to be held
here on July 22 and the focus of the meeting will be on
inter-agency coordination, as economic crimes usually involve
offenses relating to income-tax, violations of foreign exchange
rules and invoice manipulations.
</P>
<P>
The links between drug related crime and its implications for
narco-terrorism through laundering of black money would also come
under scrutiny, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks of the new EIC include exploring new measures to
combat economic offenses, formulating a coordinated strategy for
action by various enforcement agencies, advising on amendment of
laws and exploring measures to combat laundering of black money.

<HEADLINE> All-Stars Soccer Match Marks HK's Return to Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- An International Football
Federation (FIFA) All-Stars team scored a spectacle 5-3 win over
an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) All-Stars side in an
international soccer match here Thursday evening to mark Hong
Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Although the organizers had difficulties getting all the
players they had wished to invite to the match, the spectators
enjoyed a match which could be taken as of the world-class
caliber in the Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The AFC All-Stars team opened the score when Iranian Khodadad
Azizi found the net 16 minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
But the more skillful players of the FIFA All-Stars side
demonstrated their capability despite of the fact they had little
time to train together before the match.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's FIFA Footballer of the Year George Weah levelled the
score at the 18th minute when he drizzled the ball to the edge of
the goal zone and launched a tricky shot.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by goals by Spanish Miguel Alfonso at the 25th
minute and by Turkey's Hakan Sukur at the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
The two teams each put in two more goals in the second half,
which paved way for a 5-3 victory for the FIFA All-Stars team.
</P>
<P>
Scorers:
</P>
<P>
For FIFA All-Stars: George Weah (18th minute), Miguel Alfonso
(25th), Hakan Sukur (32nd), Claudio Reyna (53rd) and Jean-Pierre
Papin (68th);
</P>
<P>
For AFC All-Stars: Khodadad Azizi (16th), Moahmmed Salem Al

<HEADLINE> Regional Conference on Globalization Opened in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Acting Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today globalization entailed ethics of
co-existence among believers of different creeds founded upon
tolerance and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful co-existence demands understanding, tolerance and
mutual respect," he said when opening a three-day regional
conference on globalization with the theme "The Perceptions,
Experiences and Responses of the Religious Traditions and Cultural
Communities in the Asia Pacific Region" in Shah Alam, about 30
kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the overwhelming presence of a single
religion in the West has limited its ability to deal with the
"Other", the faithful of various persuasions in Southeast Asia had
learnt to live together harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader attributed this to the region being a
"fertile land where various strains of spirituality flowered".
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's multicultural background and historical
experience had nurtured in Malaysians an attitude of guarded
openness towards others which applied well to contemporary
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said it was somewhat ironical that globalization, which
tends towards uniformity, was happening in an era of pronounced
religious revival, resurgent nationalism and intense assertion of
cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
He said more than any other cultural force, religion would
become the singular most important force resisting the tendency
towards uniformity.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was also of the view that it was understandable that many
Asians were frightened by the prospect of being swamped by a
deluge of images from cultures that had lost a sense of the sacred
and marked by confusion of values, moral decay and the collapse of
family institution.
</P>
<P>
"But so long as we remain circumspect and discriminating,
globalization will be our ally rather than adversary," he said,
adding "We must not be filled with so much fear that we erect a
fortress around us."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, it was advisable to "don a cultural coat of
mail" so as not to be totally defenseless against the onslaught of
the globalizing cultures.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Israel to Launch Joint Oil Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The contract for the
construction of a 1.3 billion dollar joint Israeli-Egyptian oil
refinery at Alexandria has entered into force this week,
according to a report of The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Nimrod Novick, senior vice-president of the Kerhav Group, the
Israeli partner in the scheme, was quoted as saying that the
long-awaited construction work began actually some two months ago,
with Merhav's investment, the largest of any Israeli company in
Egypt. The project is the largest single Arab-Israeli joint
venture to date.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Merhav and the Hussein K. Salem Group of Egypt
both held a 40 percent stake in the project, with the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) holding the rest.
However, in January EGPC upped its share to 60 percent, while
the other partners reduced theirs. Through the sale, Merhav and
Salem have reduced their investments to some 70 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The refinery will produce an estimated 100,000 barrels a day,
or five million tonnes of crude oil a year, two-and-a-half times
the amount Israel annually imports from Egypt. The construction
contracts, worth 1 billion dollars, were awarded to a European
consortium and four American companies.
</P>
<P>
The refinery is being built by Technipetrol of Italy and
Technip of France. The technology will come from UOP and
Conoco-Bechtel of the U.S.. The project's insurers are brokers
Marsh &AMP; Mclennan from the U.S. and the Egyptian Missr
Insurance. Merhav, Salem, and EGPC, which collectively form Middle
East Refineries, called the project the most substantial joint
venture ever between Israeli and Egyptian private investors.
</P>
<P>
The project received long-term credit worth 300 million dollars
from the European Union's European Investment Bank.

workshops where there will be topics focusing on either life or
non-life insurance subjects, and participants are free to chose
workshops that fit their own areas of interest.
</P>

issues of managing insurance companies in the 21st century, he
said.

The AIC examines pertinent insurance issues by bringing
together senior and middle managers of the industry, Meyyappan
said, adding that the interaction between the region's insurance
professionals will foster and strengthen regional co-operation
within ASEAN.

Association of Malaysia (LIAM) and the General Insurance
Association of Malaysia (PIAM) under the auspices of the ASEAN
Insurance Council.

<HEADLINE> Children More Vulnerable to AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Children are becoming more
and more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS virus with 80 percent of those
catching the killer disease dying within five years, according to
statistics from the country's National AIDS Control Organization
(NACO).
</P>
<P>
Out of the 3,551 AIDS cases reported till May this year in the
country, nearly 150 cases are within the age group of 0-14 years,
accounting for 4.13 percent of the total number of reported cases,
NACO said.
</P>
<P>
The causes of infection in children are either that it passes
from the mother during delivery, the mother may pass on infection
through breast feeding or children may get infected through blood
transfusion, according to findings.
</P>
<P>
As high as 46 percent of the reported cases are infected
through transmission from the mother. Those being infected
through blood transfusion account for 42 percent of the total,
while the remaining may have got infected through breast feeding,
the NACO data said.
</P>
<P>
NACO has taken up a number of programs to create awareness
among the high risk groups and the general population on HIV/AIDS.
It has also taken up specific programs targeting mothers and
children, in addition to supporting workshops, focusing attention
on the vulnerability of women to HIV infection.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Firm on Inviting Three into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that he foresaw no circumstances under which he would
consent to inviting more than three new countries into the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with European journalists before his trip to
Madrid, Clinton said he would continue to resist French and
Italian campaigns to bring Romania and Slovenia into NATO.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I don't want America to dictate to Europe."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the U.S. upholds that the alliance invites
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in the first wave of
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to exclude anyone, but I think it is quite
important on principle that we not admit anyone until we're
absolutely sure that their democracy is stable and that they are
militarily capable," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 16-member NATO are to meet in Madrid on
July 8-9 to invite the first group of countries to join. At
least nine NATO countries insist that Romania and Slovenia
should also be invited at the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said,"A lot of the members of NATO have told
me they do not favor five, that they understand that politically
it's good to say... Quietly they say we know that you're right,
that this is the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
Analysts indicated that the U.S. fears that a larger expansion
would cost more and have more difficulties in getting approval of
the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Foreign Trade Deficit Continues to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia's foreign trade deficit
soared 38 percent to 29.86 billion koruna (963 million
U.S. dollars) in the first five months of this year over the same
period last year, the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said.
</P>
<P>
Exports were 119.3 billion koruna (3.84 billion dollars), while
imports stood at 149 billion koruna (about 4.8 billion dollars),
according to the latest figures released by the SSB.
</P>
<P>
The SSB blamed the deficit on the lack of competitiveness of
Slovakian products in Western markets and a huge rise in imports
by various domestic organizations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade deficit has become a serious problem for the
Slovak economy. The deficit was 64.5 billion koruna (2.08 billion
dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On May 1 this year, the government took a series of measures
restricting imports to cut the deficit, including quotas on
non-alcoholic drinks and agricultural and industrial products.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Food Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a food
drive in the whole country to combat any food shortages in the
future, according to Agriculture and Lands Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the main obstacle to the development of the
country was the on-going war against the Tamil rebels in the North
and the East but parallel to that an economic war was also being
fought.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Organization had forecast a famine in the year
2004. This forecast had been taken as a challenge by Sri Lanka and
launched the food drive to face the famine, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The obstacle for the food drive is the shortage of water. To
overcome the problem, a water conservation program had been
initiated with foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, the sources said thousands of small tanks
will be renovated while a large number of agricultural wells will
be sunk in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's paddy production was only 3.5 metric tons per
hectare and if this was increased by another 1.5 metric tons per
hectare, the country would be self-sufficiency in rice.
</P>
<P>
The government had banned the import of some food items such as
chili, potatoes and onions that could be grown locally. While
initially there was a shortage of these commodities, today the
country was self-sufficiency in them, the sources noted.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Sets Reference Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand will
set a reference rate for the baht against the US dollar on a daily
basis after the Thai currency began to float on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand,
said today that the reference rate is calculated from the average
interbank trading range of baht against major currencies, weighed
against volumes.
</P>
<P>
Setting a reference rate would protect retail buyers of
dollars, including exporters, because they would know the
appropriate exchange rate, said Chaiyawat.
</P>
<P>
The reference rate on Thursday, the first under the managed
float system, was set at 27.383 to the US dollar. It also set the
range for transactions at 26.66-28.90 baht.
</P>
<P>
The Thai market, where traders opted for caution and awaited a
clearer picture of the currency's true value, Thursday opened at
27.50-28.50 baht to the dollar and closed at 28.20-28.70.
</P>
<P>
In offshore markets, the baht reportedly swung sharply, peaking
at 29.50 before closing at 28.25-28-65 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the interbank rate hovered around 21-29 percent as
banks were uncertain of the baht's value and were cautious about
lending. The interfinance rate soared to 25-35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overnight repurchase rates were 26 percent, compared with a
regular quote of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the Thai Bankers' Association had set the band width
for trading against the dollar for interbank transactions at 75
satang during the settling-in period, some banks set a wider band,
more than 2.5 baht, for baht/dollar trade as they were unfamiliar
with the new system.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand hopes that the band width would narrow
when the baht's value stabilized, which may take two to three
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Not to Give Weapons to Azerbaijan, Armenia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Dmitriyevich Sergeyev said today that Russia will not provide
weapons to Azerbaijan, nor to Armenia before the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict is completely resolved.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told reporters after meeting with Azerbaijani
President Geidar Aliyev that his country will not repair any
technical weapons for the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia will
set up a committee to investigate the illegal sales of Russian
weapons to Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan has made several representations to Russia this year
about Russian weapon traffickings to Armenia, but the Russian side
denied the sales.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aliyev strongly demanded a resolution of
the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Nagorno-Karabakh autonomous
prefecture is in the Azerbaijani territory, but 80 percent of the
residents there are Armenians.
</P>
<P>
The conflict erupted in February 1988 when the Nagorno-Karabakh
claimed to merger into the Armenian Republic. But it was denied by
the Former Soviet government. The ethnic Azerbaijanis clashed with
ethnic Armenians, killing 32 and injuring some 200.
</P>
<P>
the Azerbaijani president arrived here Wednesday, the first to
Russia since he became the president in October 1993.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes Steps to Deal With Unemployment: Austrian Chancellor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The inclusion of a chapter on jobs
in a new European Union reform treaty is a significant step
forward in dealing with the bloc's jobless problem, Austrian
Chancellor Viktor Klima told the National Council today.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Austria and other members of the EU, a clause
covering employment was included in a EU reform treaty agreed in
Amsterdam on June 17.
</P>
<P>
The clause commits EU governments to greater coordination of
their strategies for employment and allows for small-scale job
creation schemes to be funded from the Union's budget.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the council on the EU's Amsterdam summit in mid June,
Klima said no single measure will be enough to solve the
unemployment problem in the EU, a series of measures will be
needed.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment across the 15-nation Union has remained stubbornly
high over the last year -- the EU-wide jobless rate was 10.8
percent in April, compared with 10.9 percent in April 1996, EU
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The overall jobless rate for April 1997 remained roughly double
the U.S. rate (4.9 percent in March) and triple Japan's (3.2).
</P>
<P>
An EU summit on employment will be held in Luxembourg this
November.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has set
dates for a second immunization program in an effort to eradicate
polio from the country by 2000, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Health Minister Radha Krishna Mainali Thursday declared
December 7 this year and January 18 next year as National
Immunization Days, as decided by all the seven South Asia
countries at the May summit in Male, capital of the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, around 3.7 million children under five years
old throughout Nepal will be administered free the polio vaccines,
Mainali said.
</P>
<P>
Polio, a crippling disease which mostly afflicts children, has
been eradicated from most countries through immunization programs.
</P>
<P>
However, the illness still affects a small number of children
in Nepal and few other underdeveloped countries.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has committed to eradicate polio by 2000
as called upon by the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
The first national immunization program was launched last year,
with some 3.7 million children given free polio drops.
</P>
<P>
Minister Mainali hailed the first program as a success, calling
for people from all walks of life to make the second program
successful as well.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Cut Baht Deposits Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore banks reacted to the
fall in value of the Thai currency by reducing interest rates for
baht deposits, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The OCBC (Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) Bank led the
way, slashing its three-month fixed deposit rate for the baht by
more than half from 28.75 percent on Tuesday to 10.75 on Thursday,
the Straits Times report said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the baht was promoted by the central Bank of
Thailand's (BOT) move on Wednesday to float the baht currency in
order to solve its economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Bank and the Overseas
Union Bank (OUB) lowered their three-month rates to 14.32 percent
and 13 percent respectively, from Tuesday's 18.5 percent and
16.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rates are indicative as they vary according to the amounts
deposited with the banks, the report explained.
</P>
<P>
The United Overseas Bank (UOB) was the only one of the Big Four
Banks that did not post any interest rates for the baht since its
de facto devaluation. But the bank resumed the exchange of baht
notes for Singapore dollars at its branches, following a one-day
suspension.
</P>
<P>
Since the Thai central bank announced the baht float, the
currency's peg to the US dollar has been uprooted from about 24.5
baht to the US dollar to 29 baht in the offshore markets. By
Thursday, the baht's fall had slowed after a 19 percent plunge on
Wednesday.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
warned that Indonesia could become a net oil importing country at
the turn of the century in the absence of new reserves.
</P>
<P>
"Our oil consumption continues to increase. If we fail to
discover new reserves early in the next century, we will not have
sufficient amount of oil for our needs," the president said
Thursday in Gresik, west Java, according to reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto urged the country to increase its utilization of coal
for its domestic energy needs.
</P>
<P>
"Our coal reserves is large, around 31 billion tons. We can
still increase the use of coal," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's coal production is expected to increase to 120
million tons by 2008 from 45 million tons in 1995, according to
government figures.
</P>
<P>
As one member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Indonesia now produces around 1.57 million barrels of
crude oil per day.

<P>
JINAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The people of Shandong Province are
going all out in their struggle with a drought, the most serious
in a century, which has engaged the efforts of more than 17
million laborers.
</P>
<P>
Provincial party and government officials, including Party
Secretary Wu Guanzheng and Governor Li Chunting, have gone to
areas severely hit by the drought and helped with diesel fuel,
machine, power, and water supplies. And the provincial government
has sent seven work groups to supervise the work.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guoping, deputy director of Flood and Drought Control
Headquarters of the provincial government, said that conditions
for dealing with the drought are better this year, with more water
having been stored in water facilities, about 1.2 billion cu m
more than previously.
</P>
<P>
Floodgates of reservoirs have been opened and other facilities
have been used to irrigate arable land and prepare for planting,
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Some 3.6 million hectares of crops have been affected by the
drought, 100,000 hectares of which have withered plants. And,
farmers can not grow summer crops on 600,000 hectares of
farmland. Not only that, but people and livestock in some areas
have had difficulties getting drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Autumn grain makes up a half of the province's yearly grain
output in this leading grain producer in China. Observers say that
it will be very difficult to reach the goal of having a good
autumn harvest if the current drought continues.

<HEADLINE> Setting Up Modern Enterprise System in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's major commercial center
has made considerable progress in a pilot program for a modern
enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 250 enterprises involved in the program showed that
their asset-to-liabilities ratio dropped an average of 2.2
percentage points from 1994 to 1996. The ratio for state-owned
enterprises went down 3.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The assets of the pilot enterprises were up 36.6 percent in the
two-year period to 423.9 billion yuan. Both business and profits
grew steadily during that period.
</P>
<P>
Profits in the mining sector in 1996 were 3.6 times the 1994
figure while those of the transportation and post and
telecommunications sectors were up 97 percent. In the commercial
and financial sectors, profits were up 50 percent for that period.
</P>
<P>
A municipal official says that the experimental program has
also resulted in a new employment method, and that in recent years
about 80 percent of a million displaced workers have been re-hired.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that, because the pilot program covers many
sectors, it is a great help to Shanghai in establishing a market
economy framework.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Central Bank Dumps Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Australia, the
country's central bank, has sold 167 tons of gold, or two thirds
of its reserves, during the past six months, it was reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The sales, worth 1.8 billion US dollars, were conducted
secretly over the past six months, during which time the gold
price has fallen from around 360 US dollars an ounce to less than
335 US dollars on ounce, the Australian Financial Review reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The move will earn additional income for the bank of about 75
million US dollars, the Sydney Morning Herald said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank made an announcement about the sales in a
statement embargoed until midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in the statement that it had reviewed the costs
and benefits of holding gold, and decided that "while there was a
case to hold some gold as a contingency against unforeseen
events," keeping a fifth of its international reserves in gold was
"no longer justified".
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sale, Treasurer Peter Costello said that
"gold no longer plays a significant role in the international
financial system."
</P>
<P>
Australia's gold industry is likely to regard the sales as a
significant blow, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was immediately slammed by gold producers, which
said the sales would send a "very odd signal" to the gold market.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lalor, managing director of major producer Sons of
Gwalia, said the decision was "extremely disappointing" at a
difficult time of the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The principal reason for this conclusion was that a country in
Australia's position, with large gold reserves in the ground and
high annual production, derives negligible diversification
benefits from holding such a significant proportion of its
international reserves in the form of gold," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Australia produced 273 tons of gold, with analysts
anticipating that the figure would be exceeded in the coming two
years.
</P>
<P>
The gold price hit a four-year low this week, falling to 332 US
dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Gold has traded as high as 850 US dollars an ounce in 1980 and
as low as 285 US dollars five years later, the Melbourne-based
newspaper The Age said.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Disinfects Tainted Soybeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan province agricultural
officials have used heat to disinfect the remnants of 10,000 tons
of diseased soybeans which were imported from the United States,
today's China Daily quoted a quarantine official as saying in
Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baosen, of the State Administration of Animal and Plant
Quarantine, said the beans, which were imported to China in early
March, were infected with soybean blight, a fungal disease that is
one of the key diseases listed for quarantine in China.
</P>
<P>
The beans, which have been processed for their oil, were
imported by Sichuan Jiali Cereal Corp and Oils Industries Co Ltd
from the United States. The oil-extraction process ensured the oil
was disease-free.
</P>
<P>
The heat-treatment was ordered last month by the Chengdu
Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine, which had handled
the case since March 7. The judgment also ruled that the soybeans
should not be used as seeds or sold.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Jiali was urged to take special measures to prevent
spilling the soybeans during transportation, loading, restoration
and processing.
</P>
<P>
Packages, soil, and other materials that might be infected also
were to be burnt.
</P>
<P>
The official declined to identify the US company that traded
the beans, and only would say the beans were brought from several
US states.

<HEADLINE> Machinery's Ink No Longer Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry, the
country's largest industrial sector that also props up the
country's State-owned economy, turned three years of red ink into
black, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The industry, whose production value constitutes one-fourth of
the country's total, has registered net profits in general for the
first time over the past three years although the profit volume
looks small for such a big sector.
</P>
<P>
The industry had been losing money as problems in State-owned
enterprises were projected to continue eroding their business and
internationally strong companies' entrance into China added to the
squeeze on domestic products at home markets.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, 1.6 billion yuan of net
profits were registered, indicating a 20 percent increase from the
same period last year. Industry officials expect additional
profits in May and June, but statistics will not come until later
this month.
</P>
<P>
However, senior officials from the Ministry of Machine-Building
Industry said there was not enough evidence to show the industry
had reached its low point under intensifying competition from
International giants.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ministry's department of production and
information statistics said they could not even say the industry
would pass its low point in a short time and then move into
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Profitable plants have increased gains this year thanks to the
so-called Three Major Campaigns the industry has launched to
invigorate product and service quality as well as technology and
product development.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Jianye, director-general of the department, pointed
out the number of enterprises losing money is increasing, and so
are their debts.
</P>
<P>
Orders that major plants have received this year indicate a
decline from last year. As a result, a big portion of the plants'
production capacity will continue to stand idle, and their shares
of the domestic market will remain low.
</P>
<P>
Wang cautioned that the industry will have to continue its
"hard struggle" against floods of imports to survive
internationalization.
</P>
<P>
Other ministry officials said the real danger lies in most
domestic plants' lack of effective means to compete with thriving
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Industry officials expect to see initial results in resolving
the competitiveness problem from the three campaigns.
</P>
<P>
By next year, the industry will try to verify good reputations
on brands of 400 major machinery products and 200 major
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the build-up of technology and better product
development, the industry will complete construction on 300
technical centers at major enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Through the campaigns, which are the central part of the
ministry's work in Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the industry
will build a new reputation by the early 21st century, Wang
said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Elevator Show Aims to Spark Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China opened its second
international elevator show in Shanghai yesterday in a bid to
stimulate the industry, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 190 businesses from 13 countries such as China, the
United States, Germany, Britain and Japan displayed their advanced
products at the show.
</P>
<P>
Among them were many well-known companies including Otis,
Mitsubishi, Schindler, Hitachi, Toshiba, Thyssen, Fujitec and LG.
</P>
<P>
The five-day show at the Shanghai International Exhibition
Center is co-sponsored by the China Elevator Assn, the China
National Tendering Center of Machinery and Electrical Equipment
and the China Council for Promotion of International Trade Beijing
Sub-council.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the show are newcomers such as Adams of the
United States, Hyundai of South Korea and 110 domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
"The show aims to promote economic co-operation and technical
exchanges between overseas and domestic elevator businesses," an
organizer said.
</P>
<P>
Kwon Young Guk, director of LGIS China Headquarters, said,
"Through the show, we hope to have more market shares in China."
</P>
<P>
LG (Lucky Goldstar) started business in China in 1993 and
generated sales of 110 million US dollars last year. Its factory
in Dalian, Liaoning province, cost 65 million US dollars and
produces 2,000 escalators and elevators a year.
</P>
<P>
But the Giant Elevator Company in Zhejiang's Huzhou, one of the
nation's State-owned producers, hopes to seek technical
co-operation with overseas counterparts at the show.
</P>
<P>
"We need overseas advanced technology to upgrade our products
so as to challenge overseas and domestic rivals," said Sun
Guangfeng, the company's sales manager.
</P>
<P>
China turned out 19,400 elevators and escalators between 1980
and 1995, becoming the third-largest producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
"But domestic markets are still challenged by overseas rivals,"
the show organizer said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China imported 6,631 elevators and escalators worth
621 million US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 19 people were killed and
12 others injured in an explosion on a cargo ship under
construction in the Spanish port city of Valencia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All the victims were workers on the ship, which caught fire
after a fuel leak on board triggered an explosion just after
midday (1000 GMT), a port official said.
</P>
<P>
The workers who died were trapped inside the boat's engine room
after the explosion at the Naval de Levante union shipyard. A
spokesman for the shipbuilders said many of the victims died as a
result of suffocation and smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
The 110-meter-long ship, named "Proof Spirit", was being built
for a Norwegian company to carry chemicals. It was expected to be
finished by September, but has been completely destroyed by the
fire.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major ship fire in Spain since May 1985 when
two oil tankers exploded killing 21. The Valencia government has
promised a full investigation into the accident.

CANBERRA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Reserve Bank of Australia, the central bank, has shifted
1.9 billion US dollar worth of its assets from gold into the
government securities, selling 167 tons of its 247 tons of gold
reserves in the past six months. The move is likely to sharply
boost the bank's profits.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government confirmed Thursday its willingness to
extend the debate on tax reform to a broadening of the income tax
base, including a crackdown on family trusts, which are growing by
about 50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The National Australia Bank's Managing Director Don Argus
has joined the growing band of high-profile businessmen
criticizing the federal government's economic management. Argus
said that Australia's high unemployment, which has remained stuck
above 8 percent since October 1990, was a chronic problem that
could prevent businesses from operating in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Employers are using the federal government's new non-union
employment contracts to strip away penalty rates, free up working
hours and break down union-enforced work practices and
demarcations. The first snapshot of the confidential Australian
Workplace Agreements shows that they have given employers
considerable flexibility.

<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- World number one Martina Hingis
and third seed Jana Novotna of Czech Republic sailed smoothly into
the Wimbledon women's singles final after beating their opponents
in straight sets, respectively, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Hingis, the youngest Wimbledon semi-finalist, enjoyed
an unexpected easy win of 6:3 6:2 over 16-year-old Russian Tennis
ace Anna Kournikova, who has beaten Anke Huber and French Open
Champion Iva Majoli over the past few rounds, but failed to create
another upset.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, commonly regarded as a tennis genius, totally dominated
the whole match with her accurated drops and sharp smashes,
forcing Kournanikova make a trail of errors.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't one of my best performances at this tournament,"
Hingis told reporters. "I tried to keep the ball in the game and
waited for the mistakes...she made more mistakes than winners."
</P>
<P>
Kournikova, nine months younger than her awesome opponent, said
"I did my best, but I have played a lot of tennis in the past week
and was tired. I didn't want to be scared. I just wanted to go for
my shots."
</P>
<P>
During the other women's singles semi-final clash, Novotna,
runner-up in the 1993 Wimbledon Championships, completely trounced
two-times Wimbledon fianlist Sanchez-Vicario in straight sets 6:4
6:2 by staging repeated fierce forehand attacks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the coming showdown with top seed Hingis due to
play on Saturday, a confideng Novotna said: We will see two
contrasts of style (on Saturday) which will make for good tennis."
</P>
<P>
In the men's events, world number one Pete Sampras, German
veteran Michael Stich, Austrilian doulbes specialist Tood
Woodbridge and French player Cedric Pioline entered the semi-final
stages after beating their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Three-time Wimbledon Champion Boris Backer, who lost 1:6 6:7
1:6 4:6 to top seed Sampras Wednesday afternoon, shocked the
tennis world by announcing that he is to retire from Wimbledon
and the world's other three Grand Slam competition.
</P>
<P>
"That was a my last time at Wimbledon," Backer told Sampras
seconds immediately after his convincing defeat.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his surprise decision, Baker told a press
briefing: "I'm the type of guy who likes to go into a grand slam
tournament with a chance of winning it and I don't feel I have
what it takes to go all the way any more."
</P>
<P>
"I feel very relieved. I feel I have come to the end of the
road with my head held high. I always like to out on top. Right
now I feel I'm on top of the mountain. I can only go down," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's hope of winning Wimbledon trophy was completely
dashed after two British players Tim Henman and Greg Rusedki were
ousted by 1991 Wimbledon Champion Stich and Frenchman
Pioline. Woodbridge, who ousted world number two Michael Chang,
secured his semi-final place after beating 19-year-old German
player Nicolas Kiefer.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Auto Makers Performs Better on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign car makers in the U.S.
showed better performance in their June sales than their American
competitors, according to a number of reports out these days.
</P>
<P>
The Audi of America, Inc. reported U.S. sales of 3,224 for the
month of June, representing a 48.2 percent increase over the same
month last year when sales were 2,176.
</P>
<P>
It was Audi's best June and best first half sales results since
1987. The German company has demonstrated this kind of
year-over-previous-year sales increase for 30 of the last 31
months.
</P>
<P>
So far in 1997, Audi has sold 17,019 automobiles representing a
34 percent increase over the same period last year when the total
was 12,702.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 2 percent decline in June
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. reported on Wednesday that it
reported a 28 percent sales increase in June to 27,062 cars and
trucks. The Mercedes-Benze unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG
posted a 15 percent sales increase in the month to a record
8,257 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American auto makers showed a weakness in
performance. The General Motors Corp. said its U.S. June sales of
light vehicles plunged 13.5 percent from a year earlier,
reflecting strikes at two assembly plants and an overall softening
in the auto market. GM's double-digit sales decline in June was
among its largest monthly sales declines this year, according to
market analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler Corp also reported a downward trend for June auto
sales which declined by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the No. 2 Ford Motor Co. may announce a narrow sales
increase. It may report another increase in light-truck sales,
offset by another decrease in car sales.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- All shares on Europe's major stock
markets ended higher on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
British shares gyrated wildly, plunging at the outset but then
rebounding to record peaks despite the view that Wednesday's
budget would lead to sharply higher interest rates. The FTSE-100
closed at 4,831.7, up 80.3 points.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices rose to drive the IBIS DAX index to
a new all-time high of 3,944.34 in late trade, with dealers'
sights firmly set on breaking the 4,000 level in the coming weeks.
The DAX-30 index closed at 3,887.39, up 32.63 points.
</P>
<P>
French shares closed almost one percent up, on the back of U.S.
employment data which confirmed the bullish mood in the Paris
market. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,936.98, up 27.53 points.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Finishes Lower on Unemployment Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar retreated to end
mostly lower on surprisingly weak U.S. jobs data and selling ahead
of the three-day July 4 weekend. The pound surged for the fourth
straight day.
</P>
<P>
Demand for pounds began to intensify Wednesday as more
investors speculated that the Bank of England would soon raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The pound settled in New York at 1.6906 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6705 U.S. dollars Wednesday and up nearly 3 cents for the week.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rate against the German currency fell to settle in
New York at 1.7535 marks, down from 1.7536 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also finished below 114 yen for the first time in a
week, settling at 113.80 yen in New York, down from 114.49.
</P>
<P>
The main force driving the dollar lower was the U.S. Labor
Department's report on June employment, which showed the jobless
rate rose to 5 percent after falling to 24-year lows of 4.8 percent
in May and 4.9 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The data provided new evidence that the U.S. economy has
slowed, further diminishing the prospects for rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday: 1.4697
Swiss francs, down from 1.4700; 5.9055 French francs, up from
5.9040; 1,705.00 Italian lire, unchanged; 1.3730 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.3774.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Cypriot Leaders Hold Successful Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Thursday that it hoped the talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities at the United Nations next week will lay the
groundwork for future negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clarides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash will meet on July 9 for a possible settlement
of disputes between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots which has
lasted more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
"These are the first direct talks between the two Cypriot
leaders since 1994, and we want to reaffirm our very strong
support for these discussions," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States hoped the two sides would work hard
to begin a process that will bridge the differences that divide
the two communities on the island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate objective of this process remains a comprehensive
settlement that will establish a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation
for Cyprus," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. presidential emissary Richard Holbrooke will meet
privately and separately with the Cypriot president and the
Turkish leader prior to the discussions.

<HEADLINE> France Countersigns Central African Cease-fire Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French ambassador to the Central
African Republic, Jean-Marc Simon, countersigned today in Bangui
an extended ceasefire agreement reached by the mutineers and the
inter-African peace keeping force, the MISAB, Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The six-point agreement guarantees security for the mutineers
"individually and collectively," and expects the mutineers to
withdraw with their weapons to their barracks from the Bangui
streets within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Talks will continue between the mutineers and the MISAB in the
next few days under the mediation of former Malian President
Amadou Toumani Toure on the application of the ceasefire
agreement, which also calls for the reintegration of the mutineers
into the Central African regular army.
</P>
<P>
Toure, who is president of the International Committee of
Follow-up of Bangui Accords, and General Francois Bozize, the
chief of staff of the Central African armed forces, will also
countersign the agreement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic experienced three mutinies within
one year by soldiers opposing President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Violent fighting broke out on June 20 and lasted for more than
one week between the mutineers and the French-backed MISAB, which
is deployed since January in Bangui.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 people were killed and 100 wounded in the fighting
which devastated many parts of Bangui and forces thousands to
flee.
</P>
<P>
France today called on the conflicting sides of the Central
African Republic to seek "national reconciliation" and to
implement "as rapidly as possible" their commitments made in the
ceasefire agreement.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Financing for Three Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of the financing totaling some 105 million U.S.
dollars for projects in three countries.
</P>
<P>
First credit of about 41.3 million dollars equivalent will be
provided for the second national agricultural services development
project in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The project will finance
training for farmers, particularly women, and farming advisors, in
crop production and animal husbandry as well as a program to
strengthen farmer organizations.
</P>
<P>
A loan of some 42.5 million dollars will help Indonesia's safe
motherhood project. This project will finance information,
education and communication activities to improve reproductive
health, and training, medical equipment, surveys and research to
improve maternal health services in the Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of some 16.7 million dollars equivalent is
earmarked for Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar services improvement project.
This project will finance construction of pipelines, reservoirs,
and other plumbing infrastructure to strengthen water supply
services and training for the water and sanitation company of
Ulaanbaatar.
</P>
<P>
The two credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending wing of
the World Bank for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Dispatch Green Berets to Africa for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States is going to
dispatch about 120 Army Green Berets to Uganda and Senegal for a
U.S.-sponsored program of training African troops in peacekeeping
and humanitarian missions, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They are to leave on July 21 and stay in Africa for two months,
spokeswoman Nancy Burt told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States has planned to form an African force of eight
to ten battalions from seven African nations. And the troops to be
trained by the U.S. Green Berets in Uganda and Senegal are part of
that force.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the force was said to have the capacity of
responding to upheavals on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The other five African nations that are to participate in the
U.S. training program are Ethiopia, Mali, Malawi, Ghana and
Tunisia, but it is still under discussion whether and when they
will join in.
</P>
<P>
There is a problem about financing the U.S.-sponsored program
as Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chairman of the Senate appropriations
subcommittee, which controls foreign aid spending, has cut all 15
million US dollars the Clinton administration sought for the
program for 1998.
