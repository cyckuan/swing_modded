<HEADLINE> Angola Criticises France for Sheltering UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The official Angolan National Radio
disclosed Monday that France is still allowing free activities of
the members of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) in France, saying that this has gone against the UN
sanction on UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Boaventura Cardos, Angolan Ambassador to
France, as saying that UNITA's representative Isaias Samakuwa is
still living in Paris, and is still moving freely with his Cote
d'Ivoire passport.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that Samakuwa is one of the important leaders of
rebel UNITA and what France is doing is against the 1997 UN
Security Council sanction, which demands the closure of all UNITA
branch abroad and the banning of UNITA leaders' trip outside
Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan ambassador has asked the French authorities to give
an explanation on the UNITA leader and has not received any
response.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the French government announced to expel
Samakuwa from France and banned his re-entry into the country.
Meanwhile, Cote d'Ivoire's Ambassador Etienne Ezo announced that
his government had revoked passports from UNITA Chairman Jonas
Savimbi and his followers.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's very limited nuclear
force is to safeguard national independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity and to ensure a peaceful life for the its
people, China said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Session of the Preparatory Committee for
the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Chinese delegate Sha Zukang
said China developed nuclear weapons with a view to safeguarding
world peace, thwarting nuclear blackmail and threat, preventing
nuclear war and ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China had always adopted a responsible attitude towards nuclear
disarmament and had made important contributions to international
nuclear disarmament, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
These included China had solemnly declared that it would never
be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any
circumstances, and China had undertaken unconditionally not to use
or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapons
states or nuclear-weapons-free zones, Sha continued.
</P>
<P>
China had never deployed nuclear weapons on foreign soil, nor
had it used or threateded to use nuclear weapons against any
countries, and China had shown utmost restraint in the development
of nuclear weapons, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
China had supported the countries concerned in their efforts to
establish nuclear-weapons-free zones on the basis of arrangements
freely arrived at among themselves and had provided unconditional
security assurances to the states parties to treaties of
nuclear-weapons-free zones, Sha added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Encouraged by Yugoslav Withdrawal, Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said on
Monday that he would not backdown from U.S. standing position of
demanding Yugoslavia's complete pullout from Kosovo despite he was
"encouraged" by Belgrade's statement that it was beginning partial
withdrawal from the province.
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged by any good word," the president said. "But I
think that the conditions that we set out are the minimal ones to
make this work."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army Supreme Command on Monday issued a statement
announcing that it ordered the beginning of the withdrawal from
Kosovo parts of army and police units effective as of May 9 at
22:00 Belgrade time (0000GMT).
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the partial withdrawal "little progress", and
said NATO would "bear down and keep working" to pressure
Yugoslavia into accepting a complete withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
He again repeated U.S. demands that besides the withdrawal,
Belgrade must agree to the deployment of an international security
force led by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that NATO
would continue its barbarous bombing against Yugoslavia despite a
good-will gesture from Belgrade of partial pullout of its troops.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Albright called the withdrawal a
"half-measure" falling short of meeting NATO's demands for the
Yugoslav force to leave their sovereign province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was a definition of a half-measure, this is it,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She repeated the U.S. position that there must be a
"demonstrable, verifiable withdrawal of forces before we consider
any suspension."
</P>
<P>
Deliberately ignoring violation of the U.N. Charter and the
Geneva Convention by U.S.-led NATO's atrocious bombing of China's
embassy in Belgrade that killed three Chinese journalists and
NATO's killings of thousands of Yugoslav civilians, Albright
dwelled at length upon the wave of refugees, which had resulted
from the NATO bombing of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Credit Rises 1.4 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer credit rose at an
annual rate of 1.4 percent or 1.6 billion dollars in March, the
smallest increase in more than a year, according to the Federal
Reserve Board's report.
</P>
<P>
The rise followed a 8 percent or 8.7 percent gain in February.
March's increase was the smallest monthly gain by dollar amount
since November 1997, the Fed said. The slower pace of growth in
credit suggests that some consumers may have scaled back their
credit-card purchases in March.
</P>
<P>
Revolving credit, which includes retail and bank card
borrowing, fell an adjusted 1.6 percent or 800 million dollars,
compared with a rise of 2.4 billion dollars in the previous month.
Meanwhile, auto credit outstanding expanded an adjusted 9.9
percent or 3.8 billion, following February's jump of 5 billion
dollars, the Fed said. Miscellaneous credit fell 6.1 percent or
1.5 billion dollars in March, following a 1.4 billion dollars rise
in February.

LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts from Angola and Zambia
started Monday their talks in Mbabane, Swaziland, to find ways to

<HEADLINE> Habitat Improves Financial Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Klaus Toepfer, acting executive
director of the United Nations Center for Human Settlements
(Habitat), has announced that the Habitat achieved a modest
budgetary balance at the end of 1998 thanks to improved financial
management.
</P>
<P>
Since he assumed office for Habitat early last year, Toepfer
has increased his fund-raising efforts and applied strict
expenditure regulations, thereby putting the center on a sound
financial basis.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer requested last weekend the 17th session of the
Commission on Human Settlements to write off a debt of two
million U.S. dollars which had been incurred by the Istanbul
Habitat Conference organizing committee in 1996, according to a
Habitat release obtained here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conference owes the debt to the Habitat and Human
Settlements Foundation, which is funded by the commission's
member states through voluntary contributions, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
While presenting the work program of the center for the
biennium 2000- 2001, the head of Habitat told the commission that
Habitat had been undergoing a revitalization process, which
required the center to transform into a global advocacy agency.
</P>
<P>
The Habitat has adopted a new strategic focus on the two global
 campaigns on Security of Tenure and Urban Governance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The overall purpose of the work program is to address problems
of urbanization, including its impact on rural settlements,"
Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
This 10-day session of the Commission on Human Settlements
will end on May 14. The commission, comprising of 58 member
states, is the Habitat's governing body, which meets every two
years.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S.-British Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes Monday
continued their bombardment of Iraqi civilian targets in the
northern no-fly zone, injuring one civilian, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 9:55 (0555 GMT), 12
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over the provinces of Dohuk,
Erbil and Neineva.
</P>
<P>
They attacked a civilian target in the region, but were
repelled by Iraqi anti-aircraft units at 12:10 (0810 GMT), the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four formations of enemy planes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases also violated southern Iraqi airspace at 10:20 (0620
GMT) and 17:14 (1314 GMT) over Basra, Muthana and Thi-Qar
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets, leading to severe
civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied planes violating
its airspace.

agreement on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), recently
signed in Sirte, Libya, a visiting Libyan official said.
</P>
<P>
Ali Teneki, General Secretary of External Liaison and

Angolan president expressed his longing for the realization of
peace in DRC and said that Angola would like to contribute to
peace in the central African country.

President Muammar Ghaddafi to dos Santos and discussed the

<HEADLINE> ACP-EU Trade Agreement Talks Slow: ACP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The African, Caribbean and Pacific
group of developing countries (ACP) Monday said negotiations for a
new trade agreement with the European Union (EU) will not likely
be finalized by the end of this year as envisaged.
</P>
<P>
ACP Deputy Secretary-General Carl Greenidge said the process
was moving slowly, much to the concern of the ACP whose
preferential trade protocol with the EU, commonly known as the
Lome IV Convention, would end in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said this at a two-day Southern African Development
Community (SADC) workshop on negotiations on a post Lome IV
agreement which started in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
Greenidge said ACP ambassadors were working with the European
Commission in preparations for new ministerial negotiations
because there were still a number of problematic trade areas such
as making a choice of Regional Economic Partnership Agreements
(REPAs).
</P>
<P>
REPAs are proposals for Free Trade Agreements between the EU
and ACP sub- regions.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU, details of the proposals of these REPAs
are to be negotiated between the year 2000 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
Greenidge said there was "trouble on all fronts" of trade
discussions.
</P>
<P>
He added the areas of financial and technical cooperation faced
 difficulties in the reduction of instruments because many of the
ACP countries were trade dependent, and for the past three years
exports had suffered.
</P>
<P>
"ACP countries must prepare what they want on the trade front
and at least get as good an access as they are enjoying into the
EU. The instruments should reflect the EU objective of poverty
alleviation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lome Convention is an Agreement between 71 ACP countries
and the 15- member EU which encompasses trade, financial and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>

LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Delegation of Zambian ministers left

Swaziland has been mandated by the Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) to defuse the tension between the two African
countries arising from the allegation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Agricultural Trade Volumes Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Agricultural Commodity
Exchange (Zimace) has recorded an all time high total in trade
amounting to more than 1.135 billion Zimbabwean dollars (29.8
million U.S. dollars) for the year ending March 31, 1999, an
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimace administrator Ian Goggin told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that this was from volume trade of 271,000 tons compared with
130,000 tons for the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"It's of fundamental importance that people are beginning to be
aware of the free market system because when Zimace began
operating a few years back there was a lot of speculation whether
it was going to work since it was the first such commodity
exchange in Africa," said Goggin.
</P>
<P>
He said forward contracting, a very important aspect of trading
at the commodity exchange, had taken off well as farmers now
appreciated it, but distortions in the market on price controls
especially on such commodities as wheat and maize had affected its
performance.
</P>
<P>
Zimace was established as a private sector initiative to fill
the vacuum left by the dismantling of state controls in the
marketing of agricultural produce.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Following Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai's visit to China, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)
further underscores the importance of travel and tourism relations
between the two countries, a TAT press release said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release said that China has emerged as Thailand's third
largest visitor-source market, after Malaysia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 571,061 Chinese visitors came to Thailand,
up 29.8 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the fastest growing markets especially in view
of the extensive airline contacts between the two countries and
the visa-on-arrival facilities that have been granted to Chinese
visitors at Thai border checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has launched the latest promotional campaign in China's
southwestern cities of Kunming, Chongqing and Chengdu, which have
good aviation links with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The promotion is expected to see another 13,200 tourists from
China which in return will create revenue of 500 million baht
(13.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As part of the continuing Amazing Thailand promotional
campaign, a number of special-priced packages were offered to
Chinese tour operators, centering on the Amazing Shopping
Paradise, Amazing Thai Arts and Life, and Amazing Taste of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The packaging of holidays is made easier by additional flight
capacity as Thailand's second designated carrier, Angel Airlines,
has started flying three times per week between Bangkok and
Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
This service is in addition to the twice flights weekly
operated by China Southern Airlines.

BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A new transnational highway linking
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar will substantially benefit
countries in the region, Thai News Agency (TNA) Monday quoted a
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
TNA said the highway, which is part of the East-West Corridor
project, will include the construction of a second Thai-Laotian
bridge across the Mekong river in Thailand's northeastern province
of Mukdaharn.
</P>
<P>
It would eventually link Danang, a deep-sea port in Vietnam
with another deep-sea port in either Yangon or Kaleguak in Myanmar
via Laos and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The route would serve as a short-cut for land cargo movements
between Southeast Asia, East Asia and the Middle East, eliminating
the necessity of sending them by ship, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The project, supported by the Asian Development Bank, is also
expected to help develop rural areas in central Vietnam and
various communities along the route.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Paper Accuses NATO of Creating Humanitarian Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, has lashed out at the U.S.-led NATO as the
archcriminal of the ongoing humanitarian disasters in Yugoslavia
and called on the international courts to bring it to justice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO outrageously attacked the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia with missiles on May 7, killing three Chinese
journalists and injuring more than 20 Chinese diplomatic
functionaries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a rare barbaric crime in the history of international
relations. The inhuman atrocity of trampling on the international
law has incited extreme indignation in the Chinese people and
strong condemnation from the international community," said the
newspaper in a commentary to be published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Archcriminal of Humanitarian
Disasters", said that amidst denunciations and condemnations, NATO
was still going ahead with its violent bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The bloody facts have stripped the U.S.-led NATO of its mask
as a humanitarian fighter and thoroughly exposed its true nature
of ravaging humanity with force. Facts have shown that the
archcriminal that produces the humanitarian disasters is no one
else but the U.S.-led NATO," noted the commentary.
</P>
<P>
It said that NATO waged the air raids against Yugoslavia on the
pretext of avoiding humanitarian disasters. Over the nearly 50
days since the air raids, however, it has been inflicting
humanitarian calamities every single day.
</P>
<P>
NATO has targeted its missiles at bridges, oil refineries,
power plants, television stations, and even hospitals and
residences, killing more than a thousand innocent civilians and
displacing over 800,000.
</P>
<P>
All these have revealed that the U.S.-led NATO had been doing
the most inhuman deeds under the banner of "avoiding humanitarian
disasters," said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
NATO is not unknowing of the fact that it is an evil brutality
to use bombs against peaceful people. Therefore, whenever it
imposes tragedies on the civilians, NATO would stall around,
saying they were "mistakes".
</P>
<P>
The commentary went on to say that after attacking the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, the U.S. authorities again cooked up
chicanery, saying it was a "mistaken attack" and that "there is no
way to avoid collateral damage or unintended consequences" in
fightings.
</P>
<P>
Six days prior to her death in NATO's barbaric raids against
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, Shao Yunhuan, a correspondent with
Chinese official Xinhua news agency, wrote an article entitled "
When will NATO Stop its 'Accidental Mistakes'?", in which she
angrily questioned: "With its continued air raids, how many more
'mistakes' will NATO make? How many more innocent civilians in
Yugoslavia will be killed in these 'unavoidable mistakes?'"
</P>
<P>
The commentary pointed out that as a matter of fact, the cruel
nature of aggressors was exactly to inflict calamities upon
peaceful people. The flagrant attacks against the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade were completely out of NATO's deliberate calculations.
They also exposed NATO's aggressive nature.
</P>
<P>
Such sophistries as "mistake" or "accident" will not cajole
anyone, the commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
While the international community strongly condemned NATO's
raids on the Chinese embassy as a savage act, the United States
denied the charges, claiming that the raids "are not savage act,"
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
This kind of chicanery of the U.S. exposed again its hegemonism,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Because of NATO's inhuman atrocities, three Chinese mothers
lost their children and a Chinese son lost his mother on the
Mother's Day, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
A tearful father of Zhuying, one of the three killed, cried in
a burst of agony: Why did the U.S-led NATO bomb the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia? Why did they kill my daughter and my son-in-
law?
</P>
<P>
This is the indictment of a father against the NATO attacks and
a cry for peace.  It expressed the heartfelt wishes of the
Chinese people and all peace-loving people across the world: the U.
S.-led NATO should be held responsible for all the consequences of
its raids and must stop creating humanitarian disasters in
Yugoslavia immediately, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
A just cause gains great support while an unjust one gains
little, the commentary said, noting NATO's barbaric acts are
drawing increasingly stronger opposition from peace-loving people
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. high commissioner for human rights believed NATO
should be held responsible for its war crimes against Yugoslavia,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Even media in the U.S. criticized NATO for its anti-humanism
crimes, saying NATO's intentional killings of civilians and
bombing of civil structures should be viewed as felonies for
which NATO should be tried by the international court of justice
and the international criminal tribunal, it said.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, people of all countries long for
a stable and affluent life. However, the world is not peaceful,
the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, to push its social model and values, goes so
far as to launch wars and create humanitarian disasters, the
commentary said, noting that humanitarian disasters will not end
if people do not resolutely fight against hegemonism and power
politics.
</P>
<P>
The hegemonist act and power politics of the U.S.-led NATO are
certain to face ever stronger opposition from the peace-loving
people throughout the world, the commentary warned.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- At the request of the
Chinese Mission to the United Nations, the United Nations Security
Council will meet late Monday afternoon on NATO's missiles
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Council is expected to discuss a draft presidential
statement proposed by China, which condemns NATO's barbaric
attack on the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
The draft statement points out that such an act by NATO is a
blatant encroachment on the sovereignty of a UN Member State and
wanton trampling on the Charter of the United Nations and basic
norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
The Statement says the act of NATO has severely violated the
Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against
Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents,
the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention of 12 August
1949 relating to the Protection of Victims of international Armed
Conflicts, Customary international norms applicable to armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The statement requests NATO and parties directly involved to
bear all responsibilities for the casualties and property damage
it has caused. It also requests that all individuals
responsible for the incident be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
NATO struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday, which
killed three people and wounded more than twenties.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman's office, Qin Huasun, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations is scheduled
to meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan this afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Boere Weerstand
Beweging (BWB, Boer Resistance Movement) Monday offered to send a
force of volunteer soldiers to Yugoslavia to help defend Serbia
against NATO aggression, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the right-wing group, Andrew Ford, sent a letter
to the Yugoslav embassy in Pretoria Monday, saying it was prepared
to send 100 men, including combatants, medics and technical
personnel to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The force would also include five helicopter technicians and
five pilots.
</P>
<P>
Although its mission was mainly humanitarian, the BWB would
also send 34 combatants to protect the other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
The BWB said in its letter it wanted to send the group to
Yugoslavia to "support its people in the crisis in the country
caused by the inhumane actions and aggression of NATO."
</P>
<P>
"We want to help the Serbians because they are nationalists and
 Christians like us," Ford told SAPA.
</P>
<P>
NATO was wrong to attack a sovereign country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization decided to send the force at a meeting of its
general staff Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ford said all the members of the force were former South
African Defense Force and South Africa police members and fully
trained in combat situations.
</P>
<P>
Ford told SAPA that the BWB had contacts in Yugoslavia and was
confident of raising money for the mission.
</P>
<P>
The BWB also wrote to South African Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, asking for his approval for the force.
</P>
<P>
"We want to emphasize that this is not a mercenary expedition
but a sincere attempt to support a country and its people in a
time of need," Ford said in the letter to Buthelezi.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Oil Production Next Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced on Monday that its
oil production will exceed 3 million barrels per day (bpd) during
the first half of next year from the current level of 2 million
bpd.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Ministry Undersecretary Faez Abdulla Shaheen said in
a statement that the oil ministry had started executing many oil
projects that had been suspended since the 1991 Gulf War due to
bombardment or lack of spare parts caused by the U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying that Iraqi oil
workers are building production units for moist oil, a kind of
crude oil, and digging new oil wells.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has agreed with a number of Russian oil companies to
resume implementing oil projects that were suspended in 1990,
including the first phase of developing the western Qurna oil
field and southern Rumaila oil field, said Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
He said that many Russian oil delegations will visit Iraq in
the coming weeks to discuss on how to implement those suspended
projects, adding that the joint Iraqi-Russian committee for
economic cooperation will hold a meeting in Baghdad in June.
</P>
<P>
Shaheen stressed that negotiations were under way with other
foreign oil companies to further increase its oil production to 6
million barrels per day in the long term.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Iraq needs 15 billion U.S. dollars
to increase its oil production to 3 million bpd from the
current production level, and that it needs another 15 billion
dollars to reach 6 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with foreign oil companies to invest in the
exploring areas in the western desert area of Iraq were
encouraging, Shaheen added, without elaborating any further.
</P>
<P>
He said that work for reopening the Iraq-Syrian oil pipeline
inside Iraq had been finished, and joint work between Iraqi and
Syrian technicians is underway inside Syria.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The overseas Chinese and Chinese
students in Germany on Monday slamed the NATO's missile attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as a gross violation of the
international laws and human rights.
</P>
<P>
"The barbaric attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by the
U.S.-led NATO, especially the killing of the Chinese citizens,
violently hurt the feelings of all the Chinese people, the human
rights and the international laws," said the protest letter
presented by the Union of Chinese and Chinese Associations in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The raid, which violated the dignity of all the Chinese people,
is absolutely unacceptable, said Sun Huanran, chairman of the
association.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the overseas Chinese in Germany will hold a
demonstration in Bonn on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese were killed and more than 20 injured in the NATO
brutal attack around midnight of May 7.
</P>
<P>
Associations of Chinese students in Germany said the attack is
an open infringement on the Chinese sovereignty, and is
intolerable to every Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The NATO countries must compensate for all the losses, openly
apologize to China, and stop their barbaric bombing against
Yugoslavia immediately, said the letter.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Many of Hong Kong's mass
organizations have issued statements strongly condemning the U.S.-
led NATO's missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia at
midnight last Friday.
</P>
<P>
These include the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the
Newspaper Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Chinese
Importers' and Exporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
They all expressed firm support for the Chinese Central
Government's solemn statement and the speech made by Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao on television about the incident, and urged
the U.S.-led NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia immediately so as to
find a solution to the Kosovo problem by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce said NATO's assertion
that "an accident" or "faulty intelligence" led to the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia is "absolutely a gross flouting
of the wisdom of the Chinese people" and "an extremely ridiculous
and shameful defense."
</P>
<P>
The Newspaper Society of Hong Kong expressed deep condolences
over the death of three Chinese Journalists in the NATO missile
attack, adding that NATO's bombardment, conducted in utter
disregard of the safety of journalists, has "brutally trampled on
the freedom of the press."
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters' Association
lodged a strong protest against NATO's attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that NATO headed by the U.S. has used force to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs, violating the
Charter of the United Nations and constituting an out-and-out act
of aggression.
</P>
<P>
In their statements, they all demanded the U.S.-led NATO make a
formal apology to China and compensate for all losses caused by
severe damage to the embassy and casualties among Chinese
diplomats and staff members.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 local residents from a dozen mass organizations,
holding the five-star red flags and shouting slogans "Oppose
Hegemonism" and "Safeguard Sovereignty of the Motherland," marched
on to the U.S. Consulate Monday to voice their extreme indignation
at and strongest condemnation of the act of atrocity committed by
the U.S.-led NATO.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parties Condemn NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- India's two Left parties Monday
joined the government and the Congress party in condemning NATO's
air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Following the condemnation statements of the government and the
Congress party, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the
Communist Party of India (Marxists) (CPI-M) issued separate
statements condemning the U.S.-led NATO for its air attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Politburo of CPI-M said in its statement: "The bombing of
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade highlighted the indiscriminate
manner in which the bombing is being done irrespective of the
civilian casualties that it is causing. U.S. President Bill
Clinton will be held responsible by history for unleashing what
must be considered as the most gruesome unilateral attack against
a sovereign country."
</P>
<P>
The Politburo said the CPI-M strongly condemns the continued
U.S.-NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. imperialist arrogance has reached such heights that
even while negotiations for a settlement are on the unilateral
bombing has not ceased. International law and the will of the
people are being violated with impunity in this continuing bombing
which has already claimed the lives of many innocent people," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Politburo of the CPI-M calls for an immediate halting of
NATO's "barbaric bombing" and calls upon the United Nations
Security Council to exercise its authority and put in motion
proposals for peace and normalcy that have been advanced by many
countries, especially Russia.
</P>
<P>
The CPI in its statement expressed the same feeling and called
for an immediate halt to NATO's air attack. It said that
"imperialist arrogance must be rebuffed."
</P>
<P>
The Observer of Business and Politics daily here in its
editorial said Monday that NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade over the weekend is an example "how the
Western alliance's reckless adventurism has gone astray."
</P>
<P>
"NATO's 'regret' over the incident -- not a categorical,
dignified apology -- does not carry much conviction," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, now the only option open to the alliance is to
discontinue the bombings and embark on a diplomatic initiative.
NATO has learnt the hard way that bringing peace to conflict-torn
places cannot be accomplished without the cooperation of major
powers like China and Russia. And the active involvement of the
United Nations is as important," it said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Kazakhstan Condemn NATO Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of overseas Chinese in
Kazakhsatan and 29 China-funded companies have held demonstrations
and issued a joint statement to condemn NATO's U.S.-led barbaric
attack against the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, expressed
grievances over the three journalists killed in the attack and
offered condolences to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all Chinese industrial and financial
businesses and employers based in Kazakhstan were filled with
indignation and firmly supported the Chinese government's stern
pronouncement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
They also demanded NATO to bear all consequences arising from
the raids against the Chinese embassy and called for the
punishment of war criminals and murderers.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that NATO grossly trampled the norms of
international law, gravely infringed on Chinese sovereignty and
flagrantly provoked the peace-loving Chinese people and the people
all over the world in its unwarranted attack against the Chinese
embassy.
</P>
<P>
The hideous atrocity has exposed NATO's imperialist and
hegemonic nature and completely torn apart their hypocritical veil
of "democracy", "human rights" and "humanitarianism."
</P>
<P>
The statement went on to say that NATO's frenzied aggressive
war against Yugoslavia was targeted not only at the Yugoslav
people but world peace and ran counter to the historical trend.
All aggressors will be punished by history, it noted.

</P>
<P>
Jiang, Yeltsin Discuss NATO Attack on Phone
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin called Chinese President Jiang
Zemin through hotline this noon to express his utmost indignation
over the U.S.-led NATO's barbarous act of attacking the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the U.S.-led NATO's attack on Chinese Embassy
was an utmost barbarous act, and a gross violation of Chinese
sovereignty, which is rare in the diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
 "U.S.-led NATO should bear all the responsibilities arising
therefrom," he told Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the military attack of the U.S.-led
NATO against Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, by bypassing the
United Nations, is demonstration of an "absolute gun-boat policy".
</P>
<P>
 Chinese FM Lodges Serious Representation to U.S.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan here this afternoon again
lodged a serious representation with James Sasser, U.S. ambassador
to China, in which he put forward four requirements to U.S.-led
NATO after their attack against the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Tang issued the following
solemn requests to U.S.-led NATO:
</P>
<P>
1. To make an open and official apology to the Chinese
government, the Chinese people, and relatives of the Chinese
victims;
</P>
<P>
2. To carry out a complete and thorough investigation of the
NATO missile attack on China's embassy in Yugoslavia;
</P>
<P>
3. To promptly publicize the detailed results of the
investigation;
</P>
<P>
4. To severely punish those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that U.S.-led NATO wantonly used missiles to attack
the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which
caused many casualties and left the embassy building devastated.
</P>
<P>
"This is an open defiance and serious destruction of the U.N.
Charter and norms of international relations, and a gross
encroachment on Chinese sovereignty," he told Sasser.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already issued a solemn statement
on the matter, in which it expressed utmost indignation and
extreme condemnation of the brutal act, and presented the
strongest protest to U.S.-led NATO, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has demanded that U.S.-led NATO bear
all responsibilities for this incident, he said, adding that the
Chinese side will continue to pay close attention to the
development of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that "it must be clearly stated that the military
operation of U.S.-led NATO against Yugoslavia has brought abysmal
disaster to people in the region,"
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO must stop military operation against Yugoslavia
immediately so as to bring the Kosovo issue back to the track of
political solution as soon as possible," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side also presented an official note on the matter
to the U.S. side.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Still Praying For Return Of Her Journalist Granddaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A 79-year-old woman in the Chinese
city of Tianjin has been praying in the direction of Belgrade for
the safe return of her granddaughter - but the only thread of hope
was cut.
</P>
<P>
Her 27-year-old granddaughter Zhu Yin was killed by a NATO
missile in the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia Friday.
</P>
<P>
Family members kept the news from Shi Lianfang, however,
because she was in a local hospital when the bombing took place.
She struggled to piece the story together when she heard the news
of the missile attack the next day, and told her daughter, Zhu
Ying's mother, who was at her bedside: "I am 79. My granddaughter
and her husband are less than 60 together. May God keep them safe
and sound."
</P>
<P>
But, both were already dead.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot tell her the truth. Whenever her granddaughter's name
is mentioned, she starts crying and saying 'I love her the most
and I'm waiting her to come back,'" Zhu Yin's mother said.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the old woman's hopes alive, the family
members moved her to one of her daughter's apartments where
television and radio reception was "bad", they said.
</P>
<P>
Since she can't go downstairs, she busies herself by putting
her granddaughter's photographs in an album and kneels down and
prays for her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
Three long days have passed since the Embassy attack and still
she has no idea about her granddaughter's fate. She prolongs her
prayers each day and has even added a curse: "My Yin and her
husband are the best persons in the world. May those who hurt them
get what they deserve."
</P>
<P>
"We are fighting to keep back our tears in front of grandma,"
her daughter said, "We have to set up a small family mourning room
in another place, so that we can go their and cry for my daughter,
" and, holding a picture of Zhu Ying and her husband Xu Xinghu,
she says, "I don't know where this will end."

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Vows to Fight On for WTO Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, the Thai candidate for the World Trade Organization
(WTO)'s top post, reaffirmed on Monday that he would continue to
fight in the race to maintain justice and protect the interests of
the third world in the global trade watchdog.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who just returned from Geneva where the WTO
headquarters is located, said that it is high time to make some
changes in the world trade body so that its justice, transparency
and creditability would be realized and restored.
</P>
<P>
He said this is why he chose to fight until the end of the
selection process instead of withdrawing from the race.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is also Thailand's commerce minister, thanked the
Thai people and the government, especially Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, for encouraging and throwing full backing behind him.
</P>
<P>
He said this matter also reflects the significance and benefit
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to address
and counter misconduct and prevent the grouping from being taken
advantage by outside forces.
</P>
<P>
Supachai is believed to be hard pressed in the race as the
United States, the largest financial supporter of the world trade
body, strongly backs his opponent, New Zealand's Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
The selection process for the WTO's new leader is in a deadlock
at present, with tension mounting between those supporting
Supachai and those backing Moore.
</P>
<P>
The selection process is expected to be resumed on May 17.

<HEADLINE> Israel Orders to Close PLO Jerusalem Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu issued a closure order Monday to shut down three
offices in the Orient House, the unofficial headquarters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said all efforts to seek compromise solutions had
been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said that the prime
minister made the decision along with senior cabinet ministers
following "exhaustive and necessary legal procedures."
</P>
<P>
After the decision, however, Public Ministry officials met
with PLO lawyer Jawad Boulous in a last-ditch effort to avert a
showdown between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Boulous said he would present a draft compromise proposal to
Faisal Husseini, top PLO representative in Jerusalem, and then
give an answer to the Israeli side before 19:00 (1600 GMT), the
second deadline set by Israel for the Palestinians to reach an
agreement with Israel or face a closure.
</P>
<P>
The last deadline at 19:00 (1600 GMT) Sunday was passed with no
results in bilateral talks on the issue and no closure was carried
out.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Israel called the
situation in Jerusalem "extremely sensitive" and urged the two
sides to defuse the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Washington is reviewing the Israeli decision.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Netanyahu's legal adviser Yitzhak Molcho met with
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat in
Ramallah over the Orient House issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel is
determined to close down the three offices, over which Netanyahu
first issued a closure order more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of conducting diplomatic
activities in the offices in violation of signed agreements
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians argued that their activities are in line with
those agreements since they are not linked with the Palestinian
National Authority.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Humanitarian Situation "on Verge of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Assistance and
Social Reintegration Albino Malungo said here Monday that the
country's humanitarian situation is "very grim", even on the verge
of a "disaster".
</P>
<P>
While briefing the National Assembly on the current social
situation, Malungo said a large number of Angolans have been
displaced due to rampant violence brought by the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
forcing them to seek protection and aid from the government.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he said, the number of refugees all over the
country has exceeded 1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, those directly affected by the war are about 3.5
to four million and residents in Kuito City in central Angola,
Malange City in the north and Luena City in the east suffered most
from the war. Currently the national population is only 11
million.
</P>
<P>
Since April this year, the number of refugees in the capital
Luanda, both new and old, has increased sharply to 220,000, 90,000
of them are in difficult condition, sleeping in streets and
begging for food.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry is making every effort to help
the refugees, citing that in April alone, they transported 2,516
tons of food to the worst-hit areas in about 146 flights , under
the help of the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
But the humanitarian aid has met obstacles by the UNITA men who
have laid land mines on the roads, destroyed bridges and ambushed
the relief vehicles, resulting in the deaths of 20 civilians in
April alone.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of refugees has become a major problem for
the country, which was thrown into fresh civil war by the end of
last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 340,000 Angolan refugees abroad, who are
mainly in Zambia, Congo (B), Namibia and the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC).

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The funeral of three Chinese
journalists killed in NATO's missile attacks on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade was held here Monday at a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
All functionaries of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, relatives
and friends of the dead, overseas Chinese and representatives from
some Chinese agencies, attended the funeral which was organized by
the Chinese special mission coming to investigate the attack.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guozhang, the head of the mission, said in his memorial
speech that the U.S.-led NATO wantonly tramped on principles of
international law and brutally infringed on China's sovereignty by
hitting the Chinese embassy with missiles on midnight Friday.
</P>

The missile attacks, which killed Xinhua journalist Shao
Yunhuan and Guangming Daily journalists Xu Xinghu and Zhuying,
aroused great indignation of the Chinese people and met with their
strong protest and condemnation.

Pan Zhanlin, China's ambassador to Yugoslavia, praised the
three as excellent sons and daughters of China, adding that the

here to bring you home.
</P>
<P>
Some Yugoslav citizens joined the mourners. A 10-year-old Serb
girl, accompanied by her grandfather, wrote down on the visitor's

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM to Visit Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
is expected to pay a two-day official visit to Kuwait on May 22
with the aim of promoting bilateral ties, the independent Central
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait will be the fourth Arab country Hoss will visit since he
took office from his predecessor Rafik Hariri last December.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Saudi Arabia and Egypt in February, and Qatar
and United Arab Emirates in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the prime minister's palace said that Hoss will
hold talks with Kuwaiti leaders on ways of promoting investments
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He will also brief Kuwaiti leaders on the lastest developments
of military conflicts between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli
troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, an Israeli soldier and one member of
its allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and at least five
Israeli soldiers were wounded in separate bomb blasts carried out
by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes and artillery forces pounded
villages and hills in the country's eastern and southern areas
for several days, wounding at least two Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli occupation forces
and SLA out of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Minerals and
Energy Minister Penuell Maduna Monday launched a one-week campaign
to encourage people in the country to save energy and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said the energy week would be aimed at persuading
households to conserve energy, provide information on how to do
it, and creating awareness about the need to use energy
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minerals and Energy Department, the domestic
sector, which accounted for about 30 percent of the country's peak
electricity demands, is the second largest consumer of energy and
electricity in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to increase as more customers gain access to
electricity, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said that the government would like to promote the use
of solar energy and the use of fluorescent lamps which provide the
same amount and quality of light as incandescent lamps but require
only 20 percent of the electricity.
</P>
<P>
Lighting reportedly made up about 80 percent of the electricity
bills of many homes.

<HEADLINE> China Says Nuclear Disarmament Linked to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons were complementary to each
other and their progress was closely linked to international peace
and security, China stressed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Session of the Preparatory Committee for
the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the
Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Chinese delegate Sha Zukang
said at this very moment, hegemonism and power politics were
seriously jeopardizing certain countries' sovereignty, security
and even their very existence.
</P>
<P>
Innocent civilians were under brutal and indiscriminate
bombardment by U.S.-led NATO and even diplomatic missions could
not be spared, and it was hard to imagine that under the above
circumstances, discussion on nuclear disarmament and
non-proliferation at this forum could lead us anywhere, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
People had every reason to worry that if the United States,
instead of changing its course, continued to threaten or bully
other countries, those countries would be forced to resort to
every possible means to protect themselves, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
This might eventually result in the collapse of existing
international regimes on disarmament, including those aiming at
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, he
said.
</P>
<P>
If that happened, the bombardment by the U.D-led NATO was the
only thing to blame and it was the U.S. and NATO which had
provoked the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Sha
said.
</P>
<P>
Their acts not only undermined international peace and
security, but also impaired international efforts towards nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation, Sha added.

including the United States, have striken their attitude on NATO's
barbaric attacks against the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last
Friday, which have caused casualties and serious damage to the

<P>
In a speech at the White House on Monday, Clinton again
apologized to the Chinese leaders and the people of China for the

Chinese embassy and said that NATO would provide China with a full
explanation for the incident.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Albright, along with some other U.S. high-
ranking officials, went to the Chinese embassy in the United
States and apologized to the Chinese government for the incident.
</P>
<P>
She said that President Clinton, she herself and the U.S.
government were deeply sorrowful and regrettable for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to China James Sasser issued a statement on
Sunday, expressing his deep mourning to the Chinese people for the
incident and most profound condolences to the relatives of those
killed in the incident.

<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said on Saturday that
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy was a "tragic mistake", and
extended deep grievances to the Chinese government and the family
members of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from such other NATO countries as Canada, Germany and
Italy have also separately sent letters or oral messages to the
Chinese leaders to express their deep regrets over NATO's bombing
of the Chinese embassy and condolences to the relatives of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States and NATO have made various
justifications of the strikes against the Chinese embassy and said
they would still continue their bombardment of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Pilot Sentenced for Cable Crash Impediment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Marine pilot Capt. Richard Ashby
was sentenced on Monday to six months in prison and dismissed from
the corps for helping hide a videotape shot during a flight in
which 20 people died when his jet clipped a gondola cable in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Ashby flew a low-fly mission on Feb 3, 1998 when his EA-6B
Prowler anti-radar jet cut the gondola cable at Cavalese, Italy.
Twenty people died when the gondola crashed 370 feet to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Ashby was acquitted in March of 20 counts of involuntary
manslaughter. The verdict enraged and embittered relatives of the
victims, as well as Italian leaders, who said they would explore
options in pursuing their own case against the crew.
</P>
<P>
The jet's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, pleaded guilty
earlier to obstructing justice and was sentenced to dismissal from
the service but no prison time.
</P>
<P>
Once Ashby landed the crippled jet at the NATO air base at
Aviano, Italy, he took out the videotape, which was made earlier
in the flight and was intended as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
He testified that he later gave it to Schweitzer at the
navigator's request. Schweitzer said he later threw it into a
bonfire because he was afraid his face was on the tape and could
be used by Italian media.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commission Rejects Stainless-Steel Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. steel industry suffered
a setback on Monday as the independent International Trade
Commission refused to approve punitive tariffs on imports of some
stainless steel products.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department determined earlier that Canada, India,
Japan, South Korea, Spain and Taiwan province of China illegally
dumped stainless round steel in the United States at prices below
production costs.
</P>
<P>
The department had proposed tariffs of as much as 36 percent.
But before it could impose tariffs, the commission had to find
that the dumping has hurt or threatens to injure U.S. producers.
</P>
<P>
The commission ruled, on a 6-0 vote, that imports of stainless
steel have not posed injury or threat on U.S. industry.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Commerce Department concluded that Japan dumped
a more common steel product, hot-rolled carbon steel. Japanese
representatives denounced the ruling as unjustified and
politicized and looked to the trade commission for what they
consider will be a more independent review.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the commission, Commerce is an arm of the Clinton
administration and has been under pressure by domestic producers
and steelworkers to combat the low-priced imports.
</P>
<P>
The country's steel imports reached record levels in 1998 in
the wake of the Asian economic crisis, which lowered demand for
steel abroad and forced foreign producers to turn to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
Domestic producers say the imports come in illegally because
they are sold at prices that do not reflect production costs or
home-market prices. Although foreign producers deny they dump
steel, until Monday the U.S. steel industry had not lost a
significant ruling in the complaints it filed to block the
imports.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Launches Water Assessment Project in Kenya's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- As part of an initiative by the
United Nations Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS) and United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to reinforce their support to
their host city of Nairobi, the two UN organizations launched a
water quality monitor project Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by delegates attending the ongoing 17th session of
the Commission on Human Settlements and Kenyan officials, Klaus
Toepfer, chief of the Habitat and the UNEP, presented 24 water
testing kits to the Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA),
comprising of many high-quality football teams from Mathare, a
slum settlement area.
</P>
<P>
Working with Kenyan partners, MYSA will distribute the kits to
six schools in the area, said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
The water testing kit is small, portable and durable, yet still
measures 14 key water quality parameters, according to U.N.
officials.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said that over 55 percent of Nairobi's population live
in informal settlements which occupy just 5 percent of the
residential land in the city.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mathare is one of the largest such settlements in
the city, "an example of the urban development challenges that
confront us".
</P>
<P>
After the presentation ceremony, Toepfer joined the activity to
remove stinking garbage from the street into the dust-collecting
truck with a spade offered by the MYSA, a successful
non-governmental organization which sponsors many good football
teams .
</P>
<P>
With support from Habitat and UNEP, it is hoped that the
Mathare project will help the community and local authorities to
assess and address the critical problem of adequate and
affordable access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
A successful demonstration and use of the kits by the youth in
Mathare slums will inspire similar efforts by schools in other
communities and countries of the East Africa region. Their
findings could help refocus water policy and budget priorities
throughout Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges EU to Lift Ban on Hormone-Treated Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration made
a last-minute attempt Monday to persuade the European Union (EU)
to end a 10-year ban on hormone-treated U.S. beef.
</P>
<P>
EU should "take the steps necessary to comply with its
obligations and frankly to allow European consumers the right to
decide whether or not they want to purchase and consume U.S.
beef," said Peter Scher, U.S. trade negotiator on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The EU faces in four days a deadline to end the ban or face
U.S. trade retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"There is still time to do that," Scher said. "We are still
very open to working with the EU in that direction."
</P>
<P>
But even as Scher and other U.S. officials made a final
overture toward the EU, a European official said the ban would
continue.
</P>
<P>
"We will not lift the embargo on May 13," the Associated Press
quoted Deputy Trade Minister of Belgium Elio Di Rupo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the deadline set by the World Trade Organization
for the EU to lift the hormone-treated meat ban. In its ruling a
year ago, the WTO said the ban is illegal and is not supported by
the proper risk analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has threatened to impose 100 percent
tariffs on more than 900 million U.S. dollars worth of European
products to retaliate for the ban.
</P>
<P>
Last week the EU issued a report that contended one growth
hormone used by the U.S. cattle industry may cause cancer -- a
finding that has been widely disputed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones
approved by the Food and Drug Administration to make cattle grow
faster and bigger.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the United States has exported only hormone-free
beef to Europe because of the EU's ban. The cattle industry has
put lost export sales at 500 million dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Benefit From Kosovo Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 10 (Xinhua) - News of the Kosovo conflict might be
approaching some sort of peaceful resolution boosted European
stock markets Monday, after a session spent almost entirely in the
red.
</P>
<P>
UK shares recovered most of the day's losses to close only a
fraction weaker after Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said troops are
pulling out of Kosovo and Wall Street rebounded.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended the session at 6348.8, for a decline of
a meager 7.2 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers were focused mostly on the banking sector after HSBC
announced a $10.3bn to buy a raft of US and European banks from
Republic New York Corporation and its sister company Safra
Republic Holdings.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares rallied after Tanjug said police and troop
units began withdrawing from Kosovo overnight. The Xetra DAX
closed at 5,261.01, down 15.49 from the previous close having
traded a range of 5190.11/5322.61.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the news of the Kosovo troop withdrawals late in
the afternoon brought an immediate reaction in the market, lifting
the euro and pulling shares off from near their lows after a
largely gloomy day's trade.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks jump more than one percent in the final 20 minutes
of trade after Tanjug's report. The CAC-40 index closed at 4347.15
points, up 57.59 or 1.34 percent.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia, Italian Presidents Calls for End to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov on Monday called
for an end to NATO bombing on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents made the appeal at a press conference held
after their meeting in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, where
Scalfaro was on a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia which have
deviated from attacking military targets to bombing civilian
targets must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy was extremely "concerned" about the present
situation of NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president said that Italy knows very well the
Kosovo issue and the disasters which have been taking place in the
southern Serbian province of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that violence and bloodshed should stop now," he
said. "We are making efforts for peace and this is our
responsibility for Europe."
</P>
<P>
Gligorov said: "We are witnesses to a war in which 19 NATO
countries have taken part and all this has made us to look
backward. We are very concerned about it and our position is that
we should try every means to stop the war."
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro announced to provide an 11-billion-Italian-lira
assistance to Macedonia to support Macedonian families who have
hosted Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 Kosovo refugees have entered Macedonia since NATO
started air strikes on Yugoslavia on March 24.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Portuguese Leaders Call For Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Ministers of Greece and
Portugal Tuesday urged the speediest possible solution to the
crisis in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his Portuguese counterpart Antoniou
Guterres in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis said that the two countries desired a
peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"It is our common conviction that peace is needed right now,
because the problem of continuing hostilies is complicating the
procedure, and talks will provide the solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides stressed that last week's draft agreement by seven
Western countries and Russia, known as the Group of Eight,
constituted a good basis for a final settlement of the crisis and
should be implemented without delay.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the Yugoslav crisis had proved that the
European Union (EU) needed a common foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
Simitis also hailed Belgrade's partial troop withdrawal from
Kosovo as "a positive step", saying that this opened the window of
hope for a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also added that Belgrade's positive act should be
accompanied by further actions such as an end to NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Quterres, who arrived in Greece Sunday for a
working visit, said that NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade was "an example of military activity that is not
expedient."

<HEADLINE> Israeli High Court Postpones Decision on Orient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court of Justice
Tuesday issued an injunction to delay for one week a decision on
whether to close down three offices inside the Orient House in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The High Court of Justice will meet on May 18 to make its final
decision on whether to close down the offices in the Orient House,
the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),
the court said.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decision after hearing a petition filed by
10 Israelis against the closure orders delivered to the Orient
House by Israeli police Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The petition argued that as the Israeli May 17 general
elections draw near, the closure of the Palestinian offices will
cause violence not only in Jerusalem, but also in the whole
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The court injunction also asked representatives from the
Public Security Ministry and the Orient House to respond to the
petition in a week.
</P>
<P>
The court's injunction has apparently rejected the Israeli
government's closure orders on the Palestinian offices,
forbidding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to use it for
political purpose in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the court injunction is expected and the
government has to follow it, adding that the government's
decision to close the Palestinian offices is a legal action and
not for political purpose.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his government will not allow Palestinians
to conduct political activities in East Jerusalem, although the
High Court's injunction barred the government from closing those
Palestinian offices for the time being.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its eternal and
undivided capital while the Palestinians want it to be the capital
of their future state, should be decided in the final-status talks
that has yet to start.
</P>
<P>
One Israel, a newly formed political alliance headed by
opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak, welcomed the court
injunction, saying it has prevented the bloodshed from happening.
</P>
<P>
One Israel also said that Netanyahu's intention to close the
offices is to draw voters for the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian top representative in Jerusalem,
whose office is on the closing list, said the court's injunction
has prevented the possibility of bloodshed and "it is triumph for
all peace-lovers in the entire world."
</P>
<P>
The Orient House is to hold a celebration Tuesday evening
inside the house to express its welcome to the court injunction.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Emphasizes Academic Degree Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said today
that there needs to be a greater effort in academic degree work to
improve China's overall strength.
</P>
<P>
Because of its role in invigorating the country through science
and technology, academic degree work has the task of improving
quality, Li told the 17th meeting of the State Council's Academic
Degrees Committee, of which he is chairman and which opened in
Beijing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the international situation and China's economic
and social progress all call for the country to accelerate
education to increase national strength and that it is only in
this way that China can be able to maintain world peace, oppose
power politics and hegemony, and stand firm in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Li said that academic degree work must create an environment
and opportunities for more young people to make full use of their
skills.
</P>
<P>
Through international cooperation and exchanges, China has got
a good number of talented people back from overseas and they have
played a significant role in the country's modernization drive and
China must continue this work, he said, but a larger number of
skilled people need to be produced by the schools in China and
better academic degree work goes along with this. He emphasized
the need to reform science and education and to make scientific
developments productive, calling this is most urgent task in China.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting approved a statement on approving
doctoral and master degrees and expressed their opinions on
changes to a draft of an academic degree law.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Promises to Ensure Stable Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that the Department of Energy (DOE) is doing all it can to
ensure that prices of petroleum products remain reasonable,
despite the deregulation of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said at a regular press
briefing that the DOE has asked Caltex Philippines Inc., one of
the Philippines' three major oil companies, to explain the basis
for its price adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Caltex raised the prices of its oil products by an average of
17 centavos (about 0.425 U.S. cents) per liter Monday, barely a
month after it lifted its prices by an average of 43 centavos
(about 1.075 cents) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The oil company claimed the new price adjustment was necessary
to recover its losses.
</P>
<P>
Barican said he was puzzled over the price adjustment and
echoed the views of Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui that "oil
companies still have inventories based on a crude oil cost of
about 12 U.S. dollars a barrel, which can last for at least two
more weeks."
</P>
<P>
He said this is surprising, considering that domestic petroleum
product prices were up by 40 to 50 centavos (1 cent to 1.25 cents)
per liter beginning April 21 because crude prices had risen from
10 U.S. dollars a barrel in January to more than 12 U.S. dollars a
barrel in March.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Tiaoqui has therefore, asked Caltex to explain the
basis for its price adjustment. Although prices of crude oil as of
yesterday reached 16 U.S. dollars a barrel, the DOE has asked
Caltex to submit documents to support its price hike decision and
its timing," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Although the oil industry has already been deregulated, the
spokesman said, the DOE can still act on the matter, adding that
the department is "mandated under the Oil Industry Deregulation
Law to ensure that petroleum product prices remain reasonable."
</P>
<P>
"The DOE-Department of Justice Task Force is likewise
intensifying its efforts to ensure that consumers get the
petroleum products at the quality and the quantity they pay for,"
Barican said.

of Commerce recently as part of the efforts to seek closer

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) is running short of money needed for Kosovo
refugees, said a UNHCR spokeswoman here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has made an appeal for a total of 143 million U.S.
dollars for the period from January until the end of June this
year, but only about half the amount has been received from donors,
and all of it has already been spent or committed, according to
UNHCR spokeswoman Judith Kumin.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR chief Mrs. Sadako Ogata warned that the cash shortage
could seriously set back efforts to help the estimated 750,000
people from Kosovo who have fled to nearby regions such as Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
"The response by many donors, especially private donors, has
been good, but we do need more. We are providing only the most
basic needs of the refugees and there is so far no end to the
conflict in sight, or to the human suffering," Ogata said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal in particular to countries in Europe and the
European Commission. This is a European tragedy. It is essential
that they bear a larger part of the burden," she said.
</P>
<P>
"If there are no new contributions, it means that we're not
able to continue to procure relief supplies ,which the refugees
need," she said, citing tents, mattresses, blankets, cooking
supplies and sanitation equipment.

</P>
<P>
But after an hour delay caused by downpour, Graf fought back
and lashed a forehand passing shot down the line on her first

</P>
<P>
Graf, now the world No. 6, finally turned around the match when
she trailed 0-1 and 15-40 in the final set after two straight

<HEADLINE> UN Report: AIDS, Fourth Major Killer in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The killer disease HIV/AIDS has
moved up to the fourth place among all causes of death worldwide
from the seventh place in the previous year, according to the
latest annual World Health Report released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has been with us for just 20 years and already it is
killing more than any other infectious disease," the report quoted
Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report based on estimates from the UNAIDS and
the World Health Organization, heart disease, strokes and acute
lower respiratory infections are the only three causes of death
surpassing HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that HIV/AIDS is currently the number one
overall cause of death in Africa, responsible for one in five
deaths in Africa in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"HIV is unusually catastrophic for two reasons: AIDS targets
young adults, and the number of deaths are accelerating rapidly,"
said Piot. "Even if we stopped HIV today, because of the millions
of people now living with the infection, the burden of AIDS will
continue to be severely felt. This is only the tip of the iceberg.
"
</P>
<P>
Piot called on the international community to make better use
of the tools existing to reduce the impact, including prevention
and care, of AIDS, and speed up the search for an AIDS vaccine.

<P>
Jiang Zemin Meets Chernomyrdin on NATO Attack
</P>
<P>
The missile attack by the U.S.-led NATO forces against China's

sovereignty and a clear explanation must be given to the Chinese
people according to the solemn requests of the Chinese government,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The precondition for solving the Kosovo crisis is that NATO

Yugoslavia," said Jiang while meeting with Victor Chernomyrdin,
special envoy of the Russian president, who conveyed regards to
Jiang from President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>

The special envoy said that President Yeltsin asked him to come

 Chinese Premier Meets Chernomyrdin
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told Victor Chernomyrdin, special
envoy of the Russian president, that U.S.-led NATO's barbaric act
of attacking the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia constituted a gross
violation of China's sovereignty and humiliation of the dignity of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The reality has demonstrated to what extent the logic of
hegemony and power politics have developed.
</P>
<P>
"It is very obvious that the idea of safeguarding human rights
and democracy, as well as opposing ethnic cleansing, which they
are chanting loudly, is only a fig leaf," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China has demanded that a complete and thorough investigation
of the missile attack be carried out, and those who have designed
and carried out the attack must be severely punished, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN Security Council can not impose a political
solution on a sovereignty state without its approval while the
bombing on it continues.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin Exchange Views on Kosovo Issue
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen held talks with Victor
Chernomyrdin, special envoy of the Russian president, here today
and exchanged views on a political settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Qian thanked Chernomyrdin for his briefing on the Russian stand,
and said that China has noticed the immediate reaction of Russia
on NATO's world-stunning missile attack against the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said that China has always upheld resolving
the Kosovo crisis in a peaceful way. NATO's rampant bombing of
Yugoslavia has not only violated the UN charter, but is also
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the special envoy the two prerequisite conditions for
a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo crisis which China advocates.
First, NATO must stop bombing immediately, and secondly, any
resolution plan must obtain approval from Yugoslavia, a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
Qian remarked that his discussion with the Russian envoy shows
China and Russia share wide common grounds on the resolution of
the Kosovo crisis, and the two countries should step up
consultation and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Port Says Cooperation With China Smooth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the PSA (Port of
Singapore Authority) Corporation Limited Yeo Ning Hong said here
Tuesday that his group enjoys good cooperation with its Chinese
partners and such cooperation has yielded good results.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held to announce PSA's performance in
1998, Yeo said his group and its Chinese partners, the Port of
Dalian Authority in northeast China and the Fuzhou Port Authority,
had worked together smoothly and cooperated fruitfully through
establishing harmony, building up mutual understanding and
bridging gaps in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said PSA's joint ventures in Dalian and Fuzhou had made
profits and their profits are expected to grow more rapidly this
year compared to 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released at the conference, the PSA
took equity in the terminal, management and operation of four
container berths at the Dalian Container Terminal in July 1996 and
the joint venture port handled 475,104 TEUs (Twenty-Foot
Equivalent Units) in 1998, an 11 percent growth over 1997 despite
the Asian economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The PSA also took equity in the project under the Fuzhou Port
Authority in 1998 and began to jointly manage the existing
container terminals at Qingzhou and Taijiang in May. The joint
venture handled 177,568 TEUs in 1998, a 17-percent growth over
1997, and has the potential to become an advanced container port
tapping on the rapid economic and industrial growth in south
China.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven overseas terminals participated in by the PSA,
the port ventures in Dalian and Fuzhou enjoyed the highest growth
last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that the PSA handled a record 15.1 million
TEUs in 1998. This represented a 7-percent growth in container
traffic over 1997's throughput of 14.1 million TEUs and made
Singapore the world's number one container port.
</P>
<P>
The PSA also announced that the group's net profit after tax in
its first 15 months of operation since its corporation on October
1, 1997 was 931 million Singapore dollars (547.6 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
With an increase in laden boxes arrival in the past few months,
Yeo said he was optimistic that growth this year would stand at a
healthy 6-7 percent, about the same level of last year.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish First Minister Says Peace Process Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The current state of the Northern
Ireland peace process was "not particularly encouraging", Northern
Ireland First Minister David Trimble said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, who is also leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, was
speaking following a one-hour meeting with Prime Minister Tony
Blair at Downing Street No. 10.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I'm afraid that following the Sinn Fein conference at
the weekend things do not seem to be particularly encouraging."
</P>
<P>
"The most optimistic thing we can do at the moment is keep
pressing away and hope that in time -- and I hope not too long a
time -- the republican movement will start to implement its part
of the agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Blair is due to meet the Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams on
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Trimble refused to speculate on the likely outcome of the
meeting, but said that his own talks with Sinn Fein on Monday had
been "disappointing".
</P>
<P>
The peace process is stalled because Ulster Unionists will not
form an executive in the Northern Ireland Assembly with Sinn Fein
without the prior decommissioning of IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein insists last year's Good Friday Agreement does not
require the disarming of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein leader Adams also gave a pessimistic
outlook to the peace process in the province, saying the Northern
Ireland peace agreement was "in tatters."
</P>
<P>
The "hand of history" was now needed to make sure the agreement
is "not destroyed, is not narrowed, not eroded or subverted by
those who do not want any process to be made", Adams said.

<HEADLINE> India Again Criticizes NATO Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday again rapped NATO's
approach over the Kosovo crisis and called for a peaceful solution
to the problem.
</P>
<P>
An External Affairs Ministry spokesman said in a statement that
the call by India and a number of other countries for an immediate
end to all hostilities has regrettably remained "unheeded" and
"there is mounting human and material devastation."
</P>
<P>
"The very fundamentals of NATO's approach on the Kosovo crisis
are wrong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This all-round human tragedy has led to rising tensions and
created instability in the region," the statement said, adding
that a solution to the problems relating to the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia cannot be found through military means.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution so arrived at must ensure the sovereignty, unity
and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"
it stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, the spokesman said the Indian
government is concerned over the Defense Capabilities Initiative
of the new strategic concept of NATO that permits operations
beyond the Euro-Atlantic region and outside the territory of the
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Such action, if undertaken, would contravene international
law, norms of peaceful co-existence between nations and the United
Nations Charter," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is an alliance of a few countries and cannot seek to
disregard the universal organization which is the United Nations.
The propensity of NATO to extend its areas of operation is a
source of concern to all countries, big and small," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou warned Tuesday that the existing borders in the Balkan
region should not change due to possible problems.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day business forum on southeastern Europe in
the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Papandreou said that the
borders in the Balkan region could not change because that would
create explosive problems in the region, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece had advanced a plan for peace in Yugoslavia
and was intensifying its efforts, together with the European Union
(EU), to end the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister also stressed that Greece would do what it can for
the Balkan reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Hailing Yugoslavia's announcement of a partial troop pullout
from Kosovo as "a first step in the right direction," he said that
Greece was waiting the next steps.
</P>
<P>
However, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo described the
Yugoslav act as "trying to gain time in order to cause a rift in
the international community."
</P>
<P>
Milo supported NATO in continuing the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macedonian Foreign Minister Alexander Dimitrov
complained that the humanitarian disaster and the 250,000 refugees
in Macedonia posed a threat to the country's political stability.

The Chinese government and people strongly demand the US-led
NATO to halt its aggression and air strikes against Yugoslavia
immediately and bring the Kosovo issue back to the track of a
political settlement as soon as possible, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The United States has always flaunted itself as "human rights
defender" and yet has created such atrocities; it talks
excessively about preventing "racial cleansing" but never
discusses the serious humanitarian disasters caused by NATO's
bombing, Zhu said.

FM Spokesman: NATO Should Bear Responsibilities for Embassy
Bombing
</P>
<P>
China demanded here today the U.S.- led NATO bear all the
political, ethic and legal responsibilities, as well as relevant
criminal and civil responsibilities for the result of its attack
on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remark
in today's regular news conference, when asked to comment on
NATO's explanation that "the attack is a systematical mistake with
no personal responsibilities". The conference is the first one
held since the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy late
last week.
</P>
<P>
FM Spokesman: China Protects Foreigners, Their
Institutions
</P>
<P>
China has always protected foreign institutions, foreign
nationals in China, and foreigners who come to China for economic
and trade, or educational and cultural activities in accordance
with relevant international laws and norms as well as Chinese laws,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao at a regular
press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It is a complete misunderstanding to say that some extremist
actions are the results of the support of the Chinese government,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia Consultation Helpful: FM Spokesman
</P>
<P>
Consultation between Chinese leaders and Victor Chernomyrdin,
special envoy of the Russian president, was helpful, said Chinese
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao at today's routine press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the consultation can help China and Russia increase
mutual understanding. China and Russia will, as always, further
develop cooperation in various fields and further consolidate the
strategic cooperative partnership, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nato Explanation Unacceptable: FM Spokesman
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that
NATO's explanation of its attack on Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
as a "mistake" is totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question at today's routine press conference,
Zhu said he had noticed that a report from a western news agency
also questioned NATO's quibbling.
</P>
<P>
How could the joint intelligence source of a powerful military
alliance mis-identify such a residence of a diplomatic corp, which
has a broad courtyard, hangs with clear house mark, and flys with
national flag, he quoted the report as saying.

It was Sampras' first clay-court appearence since the second

<HEADLINE> DPRK Slams NATO Missile Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement
Tuesday, lashing out at the U.S. and NATO missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We, together with peace-loving people all over the world,
strongly denounce the outrageous bombing of the U.S. and NATO
against the present international relations tending toward
independence and peace, and express solidarity with the measures
taken by the Chinese government and people in protest against it,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The missile attack shows that "the United States and NATO, much
satisfied with their bomb policy, are recklessly and arrogantly
applying the strong-arm and arbitrary policies to big countries as
well as small nations regardless of the international law and
elementary common knowledge."
</P>
<P>
"There is no one who will believe that the United States,
boasting of intelligence network and precision bombing technology,
so frequently repeat similar mistakes in a systematic way.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of other country's embassy is a shameless criminal
act and directly infringes upon its sovereignty. Such an
outrageous act of the United States and NATO surpasses all the war
crimes recorded in the current century," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO late Friday dropped three missiles from
different angles on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three
and wounding more than 20 others. The embassy complex was
destroyed.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Yugoslav government announced a partial withdrawal of
troops and special police units from Kosovo Monday, but the United
States and its NATO allies dismissed the move as insufficient and
declared that air attacks on Yugoslavia would continue until
Belgrade meets all their conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. rockets have suffered six serious failures in the last
nine months, the worst string of launch disasters in more than a
decade, raising concerns that the nation lacks reliable access to
Earth orbit, and triggering a general reassessment by military and
civilian agencies and the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO air commanders plan to open two new fronts in the
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, sending strikes from Turkey
and Hungary in an effort to surround Yugoslavia militarily and
further isolate it politically, according to allied officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds people demonstrated Monday in Riverside, California
against a decision not to prosecute four white police officers who
fatally shot a black woman they found sitting in a car with a gun
in her lap.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
sharply reduced their oil output in April, but the cuts fell short
of the promises they had made in March, the International Energy
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. federal regulators announced Monday broad safety
standards for passenger railroads to make cars and locomotives
stronger, more fire-resistant and easier to escape from an
emergency.

<HEADLINE> China's Military Strategists Say NATO Attack On Chinese Embassy Not Accidental (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Considering the U.S.'s conduct over
the past few years, the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy appears
to be far from isolated or accidental, Chinese military
strategists said here today.
</P>
<P>
They said that it needs to be viewed against the world
situation and U.S. global strategy.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, they said, the U.S. has strengthened its
military presence in East Asia by increasing cooperation with
Japan and establishing of Theater Missile Defense system, putting
Taiwan under its umbrella of protection.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that actions similar to the Chinese embassy
attack occurred several times in the past few years, where the U.S.
trampled on Chinese sovereignty outside China.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the U.S. tracked a cargo ship, the "Yinhe", using the
excuse that it was carrying dangerous chemicals. The ship was made
to wander the seas for more than 20 days. In 1996, the U.S. sent
two aircraft carriers an support ships to near the Taiwan
Straights to "monitor China's military maneuvers and to protect
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Considering this, one senior researcher said, the reason the U.
S. repeatedly found excuses to interfere in Chinese affairs is the
fact that the cold-war mentality still lives on in the U.S. and
the U.S. still sees China as the largest block to its hegemonic
ambitions in the next century.

<P>
And, the U.S. has never changed its policy on containing China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. offered plausible explanations for its attack on the
Chinese embassy, saying that the information provided by the
Central Intelligence Agency was inaccurate. But, one researcher
said, this attack testifies to the fact that its hegemonic
ambitions have swollen to such a degree that the country has been
blinded by lust.
</P>
<P>
China opposes the use of force, he said, and favors political
settlements, no wonder this arouses so much hatred from the U.S.
and the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy has the purpose of
weakening the determination of those who favor peace in Kosovo and
to intimidate the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The strategists said the attack was very wrong because China
has always advocated peace and has won respect and trust all over
the world for its image as a bringer of peace.

Yugoslavia's decision to start a unilateral pullout of its troops
and security forces from Kosovo, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, He said the latest move by
Belgrade "is a signal of readiness to a political settlement."
</P>
<P>
"We think that if NATO doesn't react to this move by Belgrade,
it will demonstrate not only the absence of readiness for a
political solution, but show (that it has) some other purposes,
which have not yet been mentioned in Brussels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov urged NATO to "treat those actions by Belgrade most
seriously and to stop the airstrikes" to create "favorable
conditions" for the continuation of talks and for negotiations on
political agreements (for the Kosovo issue)."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Regrets NAM's "Silence" Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Embassy in Jakarta
Tuesday expressed regret over the "silence" of the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) regarding the U.S.-led NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, one of NAM's founding countries, despite the fact that
the brutal attacks have killed and wounded thousands of innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
"There is no condemnation of the (NATO) aggression from the
NAM, We hope that the NAM would issue a statement of condemnation
and support a political solution to the Kosovo crisis," the
embassy's minister plenipotentiary and charge d'affairs, Dusan
Stojkovic, said at a press conference held at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
NAM was founded following the Asian and African Conference,
which was initiated by, among others, the late Indonesian
president Soekarno, and held in Bandung, West Java in 1955.
</P>
<P>
The NATO air attacks, which have been going on for 47 days,
have heavily damaged various military and non-military objects,
including schools, hospitals, bridges, TV stations and other
telecommunication centers, and national parks.
</P>
<P>
Dusan said NATO's fighter planes, which have so far launched
some 12,000 air attacks, dropped 3,000 cruise missiles and used
10,000 tons of bombs, have killed some 1,200 civilians and wounded
5,000 others, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But NATO cannot destroy the spirit of the Yugoslavian people
against its aggression. There is no way that NATO can win in
Yugoslavia," he said, adding that the military grouping has
suffered huge losses during the aggression.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has lost its moral and political credibility because it
fights without honor and kills women and children," Dusan said.
</P>
<P>
Dusan refuted the allegations of massacre and ethnic cleansing
of Muslim Albanians, saying his country is a pluralistic country
where people with 28 different nationalities live.
</P>
<P>
On ways of tackling the Kosovo problem, Dusan said his
government has offered a "high-level autonomy" to the Albanians in
Kosovo, but wants NATO to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The government and Albanian party leaders need to begin a
negotiation. Then, the refugees can come back (to their land)
without fear," he added.

<HEADLINE> French President to Discuss Yugoslav Crisis With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
make a one-day working visit to Russia on Wednesday to discuss
with President Boris Yeltsin political ways to end the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will reaffirm his support for the participation of
Russia and Ukraine in a future U.N.-led international peacekeeping
force in Kosovo, said French officials.
</P>
<P>
The French president, who is on a visit in Finland, told his
Finnish counterpart Martti Ahtisaari in Helsinki on Tuesday that
Russia should be closely associated with a political solution
regarding the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is a great country whose position is key to the future
of a secure, democratic and pacific Europe. We can do nothing
serious without an agreement with Russia," Chirac said in an
interview with Finnish television on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Moscow, Chirac may also meet with Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov and Russian presidential envoy for
the Balkans, former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, said

<HEADLINE> China's Military Strategists Say NATO Attack On Chinese Embassy Not Accidental (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Considering the U.S.'s conduct over
the past few years, the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy appears
to be far from isolated or accidental, Chinese military
strategists said here today.
</P>
<P>
They said that it needs to be viewed against the world
situation and U.S. global strategy.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, they said, the U.S. has strengthened its
military presence in East Asia by increasing cooperation with
Japan and establishing of Theater Missile Defense system, putting
Taiwan under its umbrella of protection.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that actions similar to the Chinese embassy
attack occurred several times in the past few years, where the U.S.
trampled on Chinese sovereignty outside China.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the U.S. tracked a cargo ship, the "Yinhe", using the
excuse that it was carrying dangerous chemicals. The ship was made
to wander the seas for more than 20 days. In 1996, the U.S. sent
two aircraft carriers an support ships to near the Taiwan
Straights to "monitor China's military maneuvers and to protect
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Considering this, one senior researcher said, the reason the U.
S. repeatedly found excuses to interfere in Chinese affairs is the
fact that the cold-war mentality still lives on in the U.S. and
the U.S. still sees China as the largest block to its hegemonic
ambitions in the next century.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consulate in Chengdu Well Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Staff members of the U.S. Consulate
in Chengdu in Sichuan Province had a carefree afternoon in the
consulate's courtyard, while armed police patrolled the perimeter
and pedestrians came and went along the clean streets.
</P>
<P>
But, three days ago, an estimated 170,000 college students had
gathered outside the consulate to demonstrate with the approval of
the public security bureau after hearing the news about the
missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Students and onlookers besieged the consulate and some
protesters vented their rage by throwing bottles and stones,
according to He Jiansheng, a police official in charge of security
at the consulate.
</P>
<P>
A security station near the consulate's entrance was set on
fire on the evening of May 8 and fire fighters were called to the
scene, he said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government increased protection around U.S. and
other NATO countries' organizations in Chengdu on May 9. Han Jie,
a policeman guarding the U.S. consulate, said that he had mixed
feelings because, as a Chinese, he condemned the brutal NATO act,
but his duty was to ensure the safety of foreign consulates and to
stop protesters from taking very drastic action to show the world
that China is a civilized country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 policemen have been assigned to guard the U.S.
consulate in Chengdu over the past few days and there has been no
instance of public disorder near the U.S. consulate since May 9.
Foreign nationals have led a normal life and U.S. businesses in
Sichuan are operating as usual, with KFC and Coca-Cola shops still
doing a brisk business.
</P>
<P>
Some U. S. diplomats returned to the consulate this morning to
wait for orders to reopen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. National Condemns NATO Attack on Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An American national has strongly
condemned the attack on Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by U.S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), saying "this is
terrorism pure and simple."
</P>
<P>
Wayne Hocking, the project manager of the U.S. Locheed Martin
Co. in Cairo, said in an e-mail to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
White House available to Xinhua Tuesday that "the president has
become the first criminal with the Friday night targetting of a
hotel and the (Chinese) Embassy in Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
The letter reads, "the Chinese people were one of the few
groups abroad that truly had good fellings toward America and
Americans overall. The incredibly incompetent actions by NATO have
undone years of work in a second."
</P>
<P>
Three missiles launched by NATO hit the Chinese Embassy from
different angles last Friday night, killing at least three
Chinese people, all journalists, injuring at least 26 others, six
in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Terming the attack as "mistake", the NATO has claimed that they
used a map of four years ago, which did not locate the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Hocking ridiculed that "if they can not read a map, they should
not be in this business," adding that "... if NATO had not been
overhead bombing everything in sight, this would not happen."
</P>
<P>
"Milosevic is not responsible, NATO and the U.S. president
are, " he asserted.
</P>
<P>
He asked the U.S. President to immediately remove the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, the Head of NATO and those involved in this
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
Hocking also questioned, "does the U.S. government not realize
that this kind of action is just what encourages countries around
the world to build up nuclear and missile forces? If we were not a
threat to their lives, they would not have a need."

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Officials showed their
thumbs up but kept a careful eye on the dominance their divers
stamped in the Florida Grand Prix which closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, a traditional diving powerhouse, almost made a clean
sweep by grabbing six golds and three silvers from eight events of
the grand prix, one of the most high-profile event among the 14-
leg Grand Prix series.
</P>
<P>
Xue Li, vice president of China Swimming Association, lavished
praises on the performances of women divers who showed their
superiority by taking all four titles.
</P>
<P>
Cai Yuyan and Li Na made a 1-2 sweep in the 10-meter platform
before they won the synchronized diving event. Liang Xiaoqiao and
Guo Jingjing also beat Russia 's Lashko and Yulia Pakhalina in the
women's three-meter springboard synchronized event.
</P>
<P>
Fu Mingxia, the defending Olympic champion, showed no sign of
rustiness after a two-year absence in international events since
1996 Atlanta Games as she outpointed Russian Irina Lashko to win
the three-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
"Our strength is still in women's events. We are confident to
win the titles in the Sydney games." Xue Li said in a fax on
Monday from Florida.
</P>
<P>
But she was more impressed by the intensity of the events and
keeps a careful eye on their divers' impressive preformances.
</P>
<P>
"It smacks of the Olympic competition." Xue said. " If Chinese
divers want to stand the test of the Olympic Games, they still
have a lot to do, especially in men's events."
</P>
<P>
Though unheralded Huang Qiang, 17, upset Russian Olympic
champion Dmitri Sautin in men's 10-meter platform, some experts
warned that Sautin is still the biggest hurdle for China in Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Russian showed a remarkable recovery even through his
training had been affected by injuries as he finished runner-up in
men's 10-meter platform and beat Chinese veteran Xiong Ni in the
three-meter springboard.
</P>
<P>
The former Olympic champions Xiong Ni still has not fully
recovered and need more time to find form than expected as he made
his international debut here since he resumed training late last
year.
</P>
<P>
He fell to Sautin in the three-meter springboard by a magin of
about 11 points before he, pairing with Zhou Yilin, lost again in
men's three-meter Synchronized event to Justin and Troy Dumais of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Xue was also circumspect about the syncro events where China
has been held as the biggest beneficiary after it was incorporated
into the Sydney games.
</P>
<P>
" China should keep vigilance on synchronized events, for it is
not a formality for us to win the titles. we need to study how to
make the pairing more reasonable and scientific." she warned.

<HEADLINE> Australia Foreign Aid Little Changed Except For E.Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The political upheaval in East
Timor and a new embassy in Croatia dominate Australia's foreign
aid budget for the coming financial year starting on July 1, 1999,
it was revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said funding for
action to meet the historic foreign policy challenge of
developments in East Timor is the key feature of his department's
1990-2000 overseas aid budget.
</P>
<P>
In the coming financial year, Australia will provide a total of
990 million U.S. dollars as official development assistance, an
increase of 14.5 million U.S. dollars over the current year and
about 0.25 percent of the country's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The budget contains an additional 17.6 million U.S. dollars
over four years for a new Australian consulate in Dili, which was
agreed to earlier this year by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Australia has pledged 13.2 million U.S. dollars towards the
U.N.-sponsored ballot on self-determination for East Timor planned
for August, which is additional to the 4.2 million U.S. dollars in
direct aid for the province.

<HEADLINE> UNA-China Protests NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It says that the bombing is not an isolated incident. On 24th
March, in disregard of the UN Charter and basic international
norms of conduct, and without the authorization of the security
council, NATO began airstrikes against a sovereign member state of
the UN, Yugoslavia, which committed neither threat nor aggression
against any other states.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that failing to achieve its aims of coercion
and turning a deaf ear to international warnings and appeals for
ceasing the aggression and returning to political settlement, NATO
insisted on expanding its wanton bombings from military to
civilian targets, including refugee convoys, trains, buses,
residence and infrastructures like bridges, power stations,
refineries and even TV stations, resulting in thousands of
casualties of innocent civilians and a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
Shockingly enough, then it went so far as to attack the Chinese
diplomatic mission, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
UNA-China strongly demands that NATO apologize to the Chinese
people, make a responsible account of the bombing and bear all
responsibilities thereof, and stop all military actions, the
statement says.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, it says UNA-China is convinced that the UN
Charter, the basic principles of international relations and the
international laws will prevail over hegemonism and power politics
in the end.

<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Association (UNA)
-China issued a statement here today to protest the US-led NATO
attack on Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement says UNA-China expresses its utmost indignation
and severe condemnation of the US-led NATO's barbarous act of
bombing the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, in which three Chinese
correspondents were killed and more than 20 of the Embassy staff
were injured.
</P>
<P>
The statement says at midnight, 7th May, US-led NATO forces
fired three missiles from three different directions at the
embassy premises and seriously damaged the building, which is
located in a residential district in Belgrade with no military
targets around.
</P>
<P>
The bombing is a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty, rare
in diplomatic history, which constitutes a serious provocation
against the Chinese people and trampling on the UN Charter, the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally
Protected Persons Including Diplomatic Agents as well as the basic
norms of international relations, the statement stresses.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Some major U.S. and European
companies in China say that things are normal and that they
believed the students and civilian protests against the NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade are not directed towards
their businesses or staff members.
</P>

Many company employees told Xinhua that they were shocked when

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The relatives of the people who
were killed by the NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia and people elsewhere today said they weren't satisfied
with the so-called "apology" of U.S. President Bill Clinton and
other NATO leaders and voiced their support for the Chinese
government stance as explained by President Jiang Zemin in talks
with Russian President Boris Yeltson.
</P>
<P>
The apology is just a performance by NATO which is under
pressure by people asking for justice and is not the open and just
apology demanded by the Chinese government, they said, and that
there is no sign of NATO earnestly investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
They said that more disasters will result if NATO continues
airstrikes against Yugoslavia and that the Chinese people can
never accept this kind of apology.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that NATO must take all responsibility for
the incident and that the Chinese people will not accept anything
else.
</P>
<P>
Xu Changyin, the vice-director of Xinhua's Reference News
Department, said that Jiang's words represent the will of the
people and that many people have expressed their support on the
phone, especially young students, who are not satisfied with the
apology and demand severe punishment for those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Xu showed a letter from the 76-year-old father of Shao Yunhuan,
one of the three journalists killed in the attack, who is ill in
bed but who said, "My family and I resolutely protest the evil
atrocity committed by NATO in the attack on the Chinese embassy,"
and "My daughter sacrificed herself for the cause of the country,
the Party, and the people and I feel proud of such a daughter." (

<HEADLINE> Angolan Military Chief Inspects Northern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Joao de Matos, Chief of Staff of
Angolan armed forces has inspected Malange, an important city in
northern part of the country, where he expressed satisfaction with
the government soldiers resistance against the months-long siege
by the UNITA forces.
</P>
<P>
The official Angolan Daily reported Tuesday that the fact that
Matos reached there by a small plane shows that the government
forces have enlarged their front there and have taken control of
the airport of the city.
</P>
<P>
The military forces of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) were forced to back out several
kilometers from their front, where they had launched assaults to
the city from months, the government military sources said.
</P>
<P>
Malange is one of the three cities where fierce fighting have
been waging in the past months, along with Huambo City and Kuito
City in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
After four months of fighting, many of the buildings in the
sieged city have been destroyed and tens of thousands of citizens
have been living in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The military source said that the airport in Malange is safe
for aid flights, but the only international organization which has
been offering humanitarian aid to the city, the World Food
Program, has suspended its food relief flights to the city.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 102 UNITA soldiers in southern Angola's
Cuando Cubango, surrendered to the government Sunday, bringing
with them about 2, 000 citizens UNITA had kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA Renovation Committee, a break-away organization from
the UNITA, called all UNITA men to show their "courage" and "make
compatriotic decision" to abandon UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> HKMC Achieves Good Business Results in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Mortgage
Corporation (HKMC) has successfully launched its core business of
acquiring mortgages and funding the purchases through the issuance
of debt securities over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Annual Report of the HKMC, published here Tuesday,
said: "Notwithstanding the start-up costs in the first full year
of operation, the HKMC achieved a low cost-to-income ratio of 33.9
percent and an after-tax profit of 106 million HK dollars (13.58
million U.S. dollars)."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the corporation purchased 11.4 billion
HK dollars of mortgages in 1998, exceeding the target of 10
billion HK dollars (1.28 billion U.S. dollars) set for the year.
</P>
<P>
On the funding side, the HKMC successfully launched the Hong
Kong dollar Note Issuance Program and the Hong Kong dollar Debt
Issuance Program in 1998, which provide a comprehensive coverage
of the investor base of the Hong Kong dollar debt market.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.2 billion HK dollars (666.66 million U.S. dollars)
debt securities under the two programs were issued, making the
HKMC one of the top corporate issuers of Hong Kong dollar fixed
rate notes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The HKMC has achieved the good business results amidst the
difficult operating environment created by the Asian financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, chairman of the Board of Directors of the HKMC,
said in the report: "The HKMC will continue to work closely with
the banks, the capital market participants and the insurance
industry to further develop the secondary mortgage market in Hong
Kong."

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kim Hong Il, a member of the
National Assembly of the Republic of Korea (ROK), said here today
that his country's investment in China is worth 4 billion U.S.
dollars and is larger than in all other countries where Korea is
investing.
</P>
<P>
Kim is on a three-day visit to Beijing and spoke on "Sino-ROK

where he said that trade between the two countries increased from
6.4 billion U.S. dollars worth in 1992 to 18.4 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
Because of the Asian financial crisis, the trend is to decrease
investment in China but many ROK enterprises still have a
considerable amount of interest in China's infrastructure
construction, electric power, automobile parts, and electronics
goods. He praised China's contributions to keeping the yuan stable
in the face of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The rich natural resources and agricultural products of the
northeastern part of Asia will account for 20 percent of Asia's
total economy, Kim said, and the development of the Tumen River
area there will bring good business opportunities to the region.

<HEADLINE> HK's External Trade Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's external
trade in March this year saw a sharp decline over a year earlier
due to the weaker demand in the immediate region and in some
countries of the European Union, the latest official statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
The value of Hong Kong's re-exports in March dropped by 9.5
percent over a year earlier to 85.1 billion HK dollars (10.91
billion U.S. dollars), and that of domestic exports by 17.5
percent to 11.9 billion HK dollars (1.52 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of import fell by 12.4 percent to 108.3
billion HK dollars (13.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of this year, the value of Hong Kong's
exports were down 9 percent to 283 billion HK dollars (36.28
billion U.S. dollars) with re-exports falling by 8.5 percent and
domestic exports down by 12.2 percent. The imports dropped 13.8
percent to 296 billion HK dollars (37.94 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lan K Perkin, chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber
of Commerce, commented that Hong Kong's overall export trade
appears to have been mostly affected by the poorer economic
performance of a number of economies.
</P>
<P>
He said although both Hong Kong's re-exports and domestic
exports to the United States were down on a year earlier, they
showed a far more modest drop than exports to other major markets.
</P>
<P>
Within the Asian region, only the improving economy of South
Korea showed the significant growth in its absorption of Hong Kong
exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong's overall trade deficit with the rest of
the world was slashed to 12.9 billion HK dollars (1.65 billion U.S.
dollars) for the first quarter of this year from 32.6 billion HK
dollars (4.18 billion U.S. dollars) a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Macao Students, Teachers Condemn NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of students and teachers of
the University of Macao Tuesday gathered on campus to protest
against NATO's air attack on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia
last week.
</P>
<P>
Clarence Fernandes, president of the university student
government, read out a statement condemning NATO's brutal attack
on the Chinese embassy on May 7, in which three people were killed
and more than 20 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO bombing of (the Chinese embassy) is a gross violation
of international norms and aggression of Chinese sovereignty,"
said Fernandes, a Macao resident whose father is a Portuguese and
mother an Indian.
</P>
<P>
There is a wise saying: "With great power comes great
responsibility," he said. "But unfortunately, some of the powerful
nations of the world do not practice nor take responsibility for
their actions."
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said he and his fellow schoolmates are enraged by
NATO's self-contradictory and apparently irresponsible remarks
following the attack and by its attempt to cover up the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have anything against the American people, but I do
believe that the fault lies with the American government and its
leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gao Long, associate professor of law, pointed out that it
is known to everyone that diplomatic missions are part of a
sovereign country and the explanations of NATO and of the leaders
of some of its member states of the brutal attack are insincere
and unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"The stubborn, arrogant and contemptuous attitude of the U.S.-
led NATO only indicates that the bombing was not an isolated,
accidental incident, but instead a planned provocation with
ulterior motives," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he fully supports the Chinese government's solemn
stand and statement and Vice Chairman Hu Jintao's televised speech
regarding the issue.
</P>
<P>
The protests of students and residents throughout China and in
many parts of the world are an expression of the Chinese people's
utmost indignation at NATO's barbarian act, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Leong Wan Chong said in a written speech, "The
bombing (of the Chinese embassy) is a mad provocation to the good
wishes of peace-loving people around the world and will go down as
a rare, monstrous crime committed by the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Facts speak louder than words and NATO's random bombing of
Yugoslavia in the past 50 days and the Chinese embassy last week
unmasks the cover of some western powers that have habitually
intervened in the internal affairs of other nations under the
pretext of human rights," Leong said.
</P>
<P>
Both student and teacher representatives said some Western
powers are fearful of a stronger China and therefore attempt to
prevent China's development by all attempts and the latest
incident has highlighted the urgency for China to get more united
and grow stronger.

<HEADLINE> French Cyclist Detained for Questioning over Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- French cyclist Richard Virenque was
sent into custody for questioning by judicial police here on
Tuesday for doping offenses.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer Bertrand Lavelot, who police claim is one of the
principal suppliers of banned substances, had been remanded in
custody on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Virenque, who can be held for up to 48 hours, was due to
undergo blood, urine and hair tests to show if he had taken
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Virenque, 29, runner-up to Jan Ullrich in the 1997 Tour de
France and four-time King of the Mountains, on Monday persisted in
his innocence in the other ongoing investigation into the doping
scandal that rocked last year's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
The top cyclist, along with his former Festina team boss Bruno
Roussel and the team's masseur Willy Voet, was called to the Lille
chambers of Judge Patrick Keil, who is handling the criminal probe
into the Tour scandal.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted on the eve of last year's Tour de France
when French customs officials found a stash of anabolic steroids
and erythropoietin (EPO) in a Festina team car.

<TEXT>
<P>
The meeting was originally scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Swazi Foreign Minister Albert Shabangu confirmed that the two
delegations, including the countries' heads of intelligence, had
arrived and were due to hold a two-day meeting at the Royal Swazi
Convention Center near Mbabane, according to South African Press
Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Shabangu as saying in an interview that Swaziland
would attend the meeting only as the facilitator, but would be
ready to participate in the discussions if requested to do so by
the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He said he assumed the two sides would aim to first clear up
rumors about transportation of arms through Zambia to UNITA (the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).
</P>
<P>
If it was proved that arms were passing through Zambia to
UNITA, the next step would be to prove whether or not the Zambian
government was aware or involved.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has repeatedly denied allegations that it was assisting
UNITA to fight the Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Macao People Able to Govern Macao Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Macao people have the ability to
govern Macao well after it returns to the motherland on December
20 this year, according to a respected figure here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first chief executive of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region is to be elected in a few days and Macao
people from all walks of life have full confidence in "Macao
people governing Macao," Vai Tac Leong, member of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the Macao SAR, told Xinhua
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Leong, also president of Seng San Enterprises Ltd., expressed
his appreciation of the performance of the two candidates running
for the office of the chief executive, Edmund Ho Hau Wah and
Stanley Au Chong Kit.
</P>
<P>
The platforms of both candidates are aspiring, reflecting the
pioneering spirit of keeping forging ahead, something lacking in
Macao during its hundreds of years of colonial rule, Leong said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever will be elected on the 15th of this month will bring
about a new scene in Macao." he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao does not lack gifted people but the systems and practices
in Macao did not provide much development room for young Macao
residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is going to be a rarely good opportunity for the young,
open-minded Macao residents to bring into full play their
intelligence as Macao will return to the motherland and become a
special administrative region, the 36-year-old Leong said.
</P>
<P>
"Forty-six of the 199 members of the Selection Committee are
around my age and we know very well that we are trusted and feel
the responsibilities on our shoulders," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We the younger generation are confident about bearing the
great task of building Macao well under the leadership of the
future chief executive (of the Macao SAR)," Leong noted.
</P>
<P>
As the date to elect the first chief executive of the Macao SAR
draws close, Leong said he is concerned with Macao's future
development.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have a global perspective and integrate more with
the world to achieve an economic takeoff in Macao," he said,
adding that the future Macao SAR government should pay greater
attention to education.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to the motherland in a little more than 200
days and the younger generation should get prepared for the
arrival of a new era, Leong said.

<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia condemned NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia here on Tuesday, saying that they are
undermining the international system of peace since World War II.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side strongly condemns NATO action against
sovereign Yugoslavia, which continues to bring casualties among
the civilian population, to aggravate the humanitarian crisis in
this region and undermines the post World War II system of
international relations," Russian Ambassador Vasily Sidorov said
at the opening meeting of the second part of the 1999 session of
the Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Sidorov expressed his deep condolences to the

citizens in Belgrade as a result of the "barbaric bombings by NATO
".

military action against Yugoslavia and for the political

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Rejects Pardon for Former Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Tuesday turned down a call by 146 lawmakers for an
amnesty to the former mayor of Tehran who was jailed on graft
charges.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Iranian Majlis (parliament), Khamenei said
that the settlement of reformist mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi's
case lies within the authority of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
It is to the benefit of the country and the nation that legal
rulings are not affected by different motives, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 146 deputies from the 270-seat Iranian Majlis earlier this
week called on Khamenei to grant amnesty to Karbaschi by taking
into account the services of the former mayor and to issue an
order to solve Karbaschi's problem.
</P>
<P>
"After two years of judicial inquiry into Karbaschi's case, he
was found guilty of granting 20 percent discount in selling five
plots of land to the directors of Tehran municipality and was thus
sentenced to two years in prison," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers argued that granting the managers with such
bonuses at the government offices is an ordinary procedure.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei said that defending executive managers
should be in its right place and would not lead to immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He called on judiciary officials to provide the public with
adequate information on the case to clear all possible ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader also called on the Majlis deputies and
other officials "not to disturb public opinion as sought by the
enemies."
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi has been jailed since Thursday after Iran's supreme
court confirmed the verdict on him.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a strong supporter of President Mohammad Khatami,
was publicly tried on charges of graft last July and received
five years in prison, a 20-year ban from holding government posts.
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court in December reduced his prison term from
five years to two years and the period Karbaschi was banned from
taking public office from 20 years to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's imprisonment was seen here as a political move by
the powerful conservatives, who are still controlling the
country's judiciary and legislative bodies, to marginalize the
moderate reformists, the main supporters of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami on Saturday expressed regret over Karbaschi's
imprisonment in a telephone conversation with his wife.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Karbaschi was temporarily jailed for over 10 days,
but released after President Khatami appealed to Ayatollah
Khamenei to calm down a political disturbance in the country
caused by his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Chernomyrdin on NATO Attack (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The missile attack by the U.S.-led
NATO forces against China's embassy in Yugoslavia is a severe
aggression against China's sovereignty and a clear explanation
must be given to the Chinese people according to the solemn
requests of the Chinese government, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The precondition for solving the Kosovo crisis is that NATO
must immediately stop the bombing of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia," said Jiang while meeting with Victor Chernomyrdin,
special envoy of the Russian president, who conveyed greetings to
Jiang from President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy said that President Yeltsin asked him to come
to China specially to brief Chinese leaders on the efforts Russia
has made for a political solution to the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Expressing "deep sorrow" for the family members of the Chinese
victims, Chernomyrdin said before the briefing that NATO's missile
attack on China's embassy in Yugoslavia is an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
This incident demonstrated once again that the Kosovo crisis
must be solved through political means within the range of the
United Nations. However, the special envoy stressed, NATO must
first stop bombing.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed gratitude to Chernomyrdin for his briefing and
said that President Yeltsin and himself both condemned the attack
during their telephone conversation on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"I highly appreciate the clear stand of President Yeltsin for a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president pointed out that the Chinese government
and people firmly oppose from the very beginning the brutal
bombing of a sovereign country by U.S.-led NATO, which has ignored
the UN Charter and relevant international laws and conventions.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of NATO's military action to the extent that it
attacked the Chinese embassy is a severe aggression against
China's sovereignty, and a deliberate provocation of the 1.2
billion Chinese people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the Chinese people have
expressed their strong indignation in various forms including
demonstrations, gathering, forums and statements for the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
"This has demonstrated the enthusiasm, will, and power of the
great patriotism of the Chinese people," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The whole country is now determined to study and work harder,
so as to develop the national economy continuously, enhance
national strength, and fight back with concrete deeds against the
barbaric act of U.S.-led NATO," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The great People's Republic of China is never to be bullied,
the great Chinese nation never to be humiliated, and the great
Chinese people are to be invincible forever," Jiang stressed. (

<HEADLINE> UNIDO-Sponsored International Pesticide Conference Convenes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 pesticide experts
from China, the United States, Britain and several other nations
gathered in Nantong city, east China's Jiangsu province here
Tuesday to discuss the development of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, experts will give lectures, issue
thesis and hold group discussions on topics like the development
of new pest killers, on the form of pesticide and applied
technology, bio- and plant pesticide, poison and environmental
monitoring, property rights and relevant international regulations.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also make a review on the just-finished
project in China that the United Nations Industrial Development
Organization (UNIDO) aided since 1992. The project included the
establishment of a state pesticide form laboratory and a middle
test base in Nantong city.
</P>
<P>
The UNIDO began cooperation in the pesticide field with China
since the 1980s when it started to aid the establishment of a
pesticide bio-monitoring and poison center in Shenyang city,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, which was
completed in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Supports Thailand's Candidate for WTO Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is supporting
Thailand's candidate, Supachai Panitchpakdi, for the post of
director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai deputy prime minister not only understands the needs
of developed countries but also those of developing countries, and
this is what makes Supachai the right candidate, she told
reporters in Kuala Kangsar north of here, according to Malaysian
news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"This time, it is obvious that we would like to see a candidate
from a developing nation to take up the post of director-general
and it so happen that the person (Supachai) is suitable," she was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said Malaysia does not regard New Zealand's former Prime
Minister Mike Moore as an unsuitable candidate for the post, but
as a developing country, the Thai candidate is Malaysia's choice.
</P>
<P>
Supachai and Mike Moore are the only candidates for the WTO
post.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said each WTO member should use its vote to make a
stand. "If a vote is cast, there is no need for us to state whom
we had voted for as a vote is secret," she added.
</P>
<P>
She dismissed the claim that developing countries would face
the consequences like less investments in their countries if they
refused to adhere to the developed countries' choice.

<HEADLINE> Canadian AIDS Sufferer Wins Right to Use Marijuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Toronto social activist suffering
from AIDS has won the right to grow and smoke marijuana for
medical purposes, National Post newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Justie Harry LaForme of the Ontario Superior Court Monday
granted Jim Wakeford a constitutional exemption from criminal
prosecution under Canada's drug laws.
</P>
<P>
The ruling temporarily allows Mr. Wakeford to use marijuana
until Allan Rock, the Canadian Health Minister, decides whether to
grant Wakeford a special exemption under the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wakeford's application is bona fide, for a legitimate
medical purpose, and one which merits genuine consideration,"
wrote Judge laForme, whose ruling implied that he expected
Minister Rock to eventually grant a permanent exemption.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Wakeford's victory will open the door to other terminally
ill patients who seek relief from the courts, said Alan Young, an
Osgoode Hall law professor and lawyer for Mr. Wakeford.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who is in a similar situation to Jim's could apply for
a constitutional exemption while the government scrambles to
figure out its marijuana policy," said the lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Fund Extra Customs Checks for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia will allocate a total of
A$6.5 million (US$4.4 million) to extra customs checks as visitors
flood in for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, a senior official said
in a statement on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This funding will provide Customs with the additional
resources to effectively meet the heavy demands which the Games
will impose on passenger and cargo processing activities," said
Sport and Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly.
</P>
<P>
The extra money, allocated in the national budget for the year
to June 30, 2000, raised total federal government support for the
Games to more than A$500 million.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the federal government would forgo the
estimated A$50 million it could have levied on tickets for the
Games and the Paralympic Games under the 10 percent goods and
services tax which it plans to introduce in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
The new tax had threatened to further complicate the task of
the Games organisers, who are already struggling to meet revenue
targets.

<HEADLINE> China to Host International Fast-Food Equipment Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will hold an international
fast-food equipment exposition here from April 18 to 21 next year,
according to sources from the State Administration of Internal
Trade (SAIT).
</P>
<P>
The exposition, co-sponsored by SAIT and the Beijing Equipment
Service Center, is expected to attract some 200 companies from
both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
A symposium on the development of the fast food business will
also be held during the exposition. China has organized five such
symposiums so far.
</P>
<P>
China's fast-food industry has been maintaining a double-digit
growth rate for the past several years, and sales volume for the
industry hit 278.3 billion yuan (33.5 billion U.S. dollars) last
year, up 15.7 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the industry's sales volume
grew by more than 20 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Huang Hai, general economic counselor of SAIT, said that
compared with neighboring countries, food takes a larger
proportion in China's overall consumer spending. Many products
such as frozen food, health food, and microwave food have huge
market potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
But a low level of technology in this sector is a major problem
hindering the development of the nation's fast-food industry,
Huang said, adding that China will enhance efforts to creating its
own name-brand fast-food to compete with foreign brands.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reaps Windfall from Oil Price Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government may be
reaping a daily windfall of about 14.04 million U.S. dollars from
oil export last week because of the recent good performance of
crude prices at the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil chalked an impressive 16-month high of
16.80 dollars per barrel last week, the highest since December
1998, The Post Express reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted observers as saying that the government may be
able to slice off a sizeable chunk of the projected 4.2 billion
dollars overall fiscal deficit for 1999 if the oil price firms up
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
Though expected earnings from oil were based on crude oil
production level of 2.035 million barrels per day at nine dollars
per barrel, the current daily production quota allowed by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) leaves
Nigeria with a daily production quota of 1.8 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the close of the 1998 financial year, the average
selling price of crude oil dropped from between 16 dollars and 17
dollars per barrel to about 12.8 dollars by October while the
crude deliveries for January this year further slumped to less
than 11 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The development prompted the Nigerian government to peg its
budget estimates at nine dollars per barrel with 4.8 billion
dollars as total revenue expected to accrue from oil and gas
sources this year.
</P>
<P>
Last December, deliveries of Brent North Sea crude went for
less than 10 dollars, but by mid-March, the price surged to above
13 dollars following the agreement by the world's biggest oil
producing nations to implement a production cutback of more than
two million barrels per day from April.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent cutbacks of oil production impacted positively on
crude oil price movements, resulting in predictions by economic
experts of the prospect of achieving a 15-dollar per barrel mark
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the development presents the picture of
a rosy future for Nigeria, which has been grappling with
difficulties in funding capital investment projects critical to
the development of oil and gas industry, and the economy as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> European Union to Lift Sanctions on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, MAY 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to lift
sanctions on the training of Nigeria's military personnel and sale
of arms and ammunition to Nigeria on June 1 after the hand-over of
power to a civilian government in the country.
</P>
<P>
Armin Hiller, German ambassador to Nigeria, said Monday at a
diplomatic forum that the June 1 date was the recommendation made
to Brussels by European Union ambassadors in Nigeria after their
recent meeting in Lagos, The Punch newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed multilateral sanctions against the government of
late General Sani Abacha after the killing of Ken Saro-Wiwa and
eight other Ogoni activists in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The union lifted sanctions on sporting contact, issuance of
visas to members of the military government, development projects
and related aids following the successful conduct of February 27
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions on the training of military personnel and sale of
arms and ammunition to Nigeria by EU members were kept on hold
until President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo takes office.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said now that Nigeria's return to democratic rule has
become a reality, Germany no longer had room for asylum seekers
from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This year alone, about 122 Nigerians had been repatriated from
Germany, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy said to Grow by 3 Pct in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy is expected
to grow by about 3 percent in the coming fiscal year of 1999-2000,
slowing from an estimated 4.25 percent this fiscal year ending on
June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The budget papers released Tuesday night by the Australian
Treasury predict a slowing Australian economy for the next fiscal
year as a result of moderating world growth, which is expected to
hit the Australian economy hardest in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy grew by 4.7 percent in calendar year
1998 despite the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under an economic blueprint for the coming fiscal year by
Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, Australia will enter the new
millennium with a booming budget surplus of 3.6 billion U.S.
dollars, strong economic growth, low inflation and slashed
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before he delivered his 1999-2000 budget to the
Australian Parliament on Tuesday night, Costello said he hoped
that the Asian crisis had bottomed and that Australia could lift
the speed limit on its economic growth, therefore lowering the
jobless rate next century.
</P>
<P>
But he said that while there was reason for optimism, Australia
needed to remain cautious and recognize the need for a continued
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
The budget papers paint a positive outlook for jobs,
forecasting 7.5-percent unemployment next year, down from an
expected 7.75 percent for this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain subdued, with the consumer
price index (CPI) seen rising by a lower-than-forecast 1.25
percent this year before averaging 2 percent in the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Australia's current account deficit is expected to narrow
marginally to 21 billion U.S. dollars, or 5.25 percent of its
gross domestic product, in 1999-2000 as exports respond to a
gradual strengthening of the world economy and terms of trade
improve slightly from the 21.4 billion dollars expected for this
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Party Secretary, Mayor Meet Motorola Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Lichang, Secretary of Tianjin
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of China, and Mayor Li
Shenglin met here today on two separate occasions with a visiting
delegation headed by Gary Tooker, chairman of Motorola Inc. of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings, both leaders said Tianjin's nine million
people were indignant at the recent U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and they all support the righteous
statement made public by the Chinese Government regarding the
attack, and the solemn demands put forward by the Chinese
Government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and Li, however, reassured Tooker and his delegation that
the incident would not affect Tianjin's resolve and policies to
open to the outside world, and that Tianjin would protect and
support foreign investors' cooperation with China, as well as
foreign nationals engaged in economic and business activities in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has a fine basis of cooperation with Tianjin, the two
officials said. They also pledged to support an expansion of the
friendly ties with Motorola.
</P>
<P>
Gary Tooker said he and all the Motorola company workers were
sorry for the recent tragic incident and apologized for it, and
showed a deep understanding of the angry feeling demonstrated by
the Chinese people. He said he hopes the incident can be
satisfactorily solved through diplomatic and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has achieved success in Tianjin thanks to governmental
support, and values the friendship formed in the past decade, said
Tooker, who has paid numerous visits to Tianjin since 1988. He
said he hopes Motorola will be able to penetrate deeper into
China's modernization.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meetings, Tooker and his delegation visited a
computer-chip project that will require an increased investment of
1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the Xiqing Development Zone in Tianjin,
and he pledged that the planned investment increase will not be
changed.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also visited Motorola (China) Electronics Ltd.
in the Tianjin Development Zone in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, the largest U.S. investor in China, has set up eight
manufacturing enterprises in this north China port city and seven
in other parts of the country, with actual investment exceeding
one billion U.S. dollars, and annual output value exceeding 25
billion yuan.

At his meeting with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the
presidential palace Blue House, Li said the missile attack by the
U.S.-led NATO on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia is not only a
serious provocation against the Chinese people but also a serious
sabotage of world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was "indignant at the barbaric act and the crime is
intolerable." If things go like this, are there any justice, any
humanitarianism, any human rights or global order and tranquillity
to speak of?" Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman arrived here Sunday for a five-day visit at
the invitation of the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese President Jiang Zemin has further
expressed China's solemn and just stand when he spoke to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin over phone Monday, during which Jiang
voiced his utmost indignation at last Saturday's NATO missile
attack against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that the U.S.-led NATO should bear all the
responsibility arising from the barbaric act.
</P>
<P>
In response, President Kim said the ROK government expressed
regret over NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy and such an
incident should not happen again.
</P>
<P>
The president also added that he could understand the position
of the Chinese government and the feeling of the Chinese people on
the incident.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- India registered an industrial
production growth rate of 3.8 percent in fiscal 1998-99 (April 1,
1998-March 31, 1999) lower than the 6.6 percent in the previous
year, the latest index of industrial production (IIP) showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the index released by the Central Statistical
Organization here Tuesday, the poor performance of industrial
production has been on account of a negative 1.7 percent growth in
mining during the year compared with 5.9 percent in 1997-98. The
manufacturing sector, which accounts for about four-fifths of the
total weight of IIP, also slipped during the year to 4.1 percent
from 6.7 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer goods and basic goods sectors fared poorly during the
year, recording growth rates of 2.1 percent and 1.6 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Israeli High Court Postpones Decision on Orient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court of Justice
here on Tuesday issued an injunction for one week to decide
whether to close down three Palestinian offices inside the Orient
House in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Court will meet on May 18 to make its final decision on
the issue, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The court made the decision after hearing a petition filed by
ten Israelis against the closure orders delivered to the Orient
House by Israeli police Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The petition argued that as the Israeli May 17 general
elections draw near, the close of the three Palestinian offices
will trigger violence not only in Jerusalem, but also in the
whole Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The court injunction also asked the representatives from the
Public Security Ministry and the Orient House to respond to the
petition against the closure orders issued by the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
The court's injunction has apparently rejected the Israeli
government's closure orders against the Palestinian offices,
forbidding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to use it for
political purpose in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police delivered Monday night the closure orders
against the three offices in Orient House to Jawad Boulous, an
attorney for the Palestinians in the Orient House, informing him
that he has 24 hours to appeal before the office closures are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the closure orders were issued after the Israeli
government and Palestinian officials failed to reach a compromise
during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday night that he
"tried a last-ditch effort to find a compromise" by sending his
lawyer Yitzhak Molcho to talk with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Ramallah on Monday over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting did not bear any fruit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, the tension inside and around the Orient House
has been running high. Netanyahu has repeatedly asked Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani to issue closure orders against
the three Palestinian offices inside the House no matter what
happens in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For fear of violence, Kahalani has been trying in the last two
days to work out a compromise with the Palestinians, asking them
to move two of the three offices, one for national institutions
and another for settlement constructions investigation, to Abu
Dis, east of Jerusalem. But the Palestinians rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has set deadlines on Sunday and Monday evenings for
the closure, but postponed both times. Netanyahu was reportedly
angered over Kahalani's decisions to postpone executing the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Another office subjected to closure is the office of national
research, headed by Palestinian National Authority Minister in
Charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that this House has been used for
promoting the peace process and nothing was illegal as accused by
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has started from the Orient House...and the
Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference left for the
first time from this House," Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erikat said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli defense officials warned the government
that closing the Orient House may lead to violence not only in
East Jerusalem, but to the whole Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The country's intelligence organization Shin Bet chief Ami
Ayalon warned the security cabinet the same day that violence at
the Orient House might send shock waves throughout the
territories, setting off a series of clashes.
</P>
<P>
"It seems the prime minister is more concerned with the
question of how he can influence the voters at home than with the
serious security repercussions of a police incursion into the
Orient House," Tuesday's Ha'aretz daily quoted a senior defense
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu may not be prime minister after the elections, but
whoever is will have to deal with his imbroglio," it added.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid on Monday railed at
this closure decision, saying Netanyahu seems to have decided that
only a major conflagration in Jerusalem can save his re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Washington also got involved in this issue, asking the two
sides to settle this issue peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely sensitive situation and both sides have a
responsibility to defuse it," the State Department spokesman James
Rubin reportedly said in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
United States Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross also
worked all weekend as go-between to try to help settle this
dispute.

<HEADLINE> HK Media Voice Support to Chinese Government's Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers voiced
support in their editorials and commentaries Tuesday to President
Jiang Zemin's speech and the Chinese government's four demands on
the U.S.-led NATO concerning NATO's missile attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO's 'gunboat diplomacy' cannot scare the
Chinese people," Wen Wei Po said in an editorial. It said that the
U.S.-led NATO must take prompt measures according to international
laws and shoulder their responsibilities so as to ensure a
legitimate and reasonable settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described the Chinese government's four demands
as "just and in conformity with international laws."
</P>
<P>
In his talk with Russian President Boris Yeltsin through
hotline Monday, President Jiang accused the U.S.-led NATO of using
"gun-boat policy" in handling international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy,
saying that it was an act of "extreme barbarity" and a "gross
violation of China's sovereignty" that is rarely seen in
diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Monday demanded that the U.S.-
led NATO make open and official apology to the Chinese government,
the Chinese people and relatives of the Chinese victims; carry out
complete and thorough investigation of the attack; promptly make
public the detailed results of the investigation; and severely
punish those who are responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO must satisfy the solemn demands raised by
the Chinese government, otherwise it would make a mistake of the
times and would be punished by the history," an editorial carried
by the Ta Kung Pao said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial daily said that the government's demands
are "absolutely reasonable." It noted that NATO's apology should
be sincere and investigations true, and that those who are
responsible must be punished.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental Daily News said the demands "spoke out sternly
from a sense of justice," and showed the central government's
decision-making is "reasonable, correct, sober-minded and
appropriate."
</P>
<P>
"Once NATO's 'war pattern' is recognized, any problem such as
nationality and religion in any country could become an excuse for
the hegemonists to launch military invasion," said Tin Tin Daily
News in an editorial.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Tuesday assured Iraq
of its support to get the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions against
Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad during his meeting with visiting Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yasseen Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
Taha told a news conference after the meeting that Mahathir
assured him that Malaysia's position has always been to support
Iraq in its bid to get lifted the U.N. sanctions, imposed nine
years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"Today he (Mahathir) stressed the same position and pledged to
help Iraq get the sanctions lifted," Taha said.
</P>
<P>
Taha expressed confidence that Malaysia will play a positive
role in the U.N. Security Council to ensure that economic
sanctions against Baghdad are removed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council,
has assured his country that it would do its best toward that end,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Chernomyrdin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji told
Victor Chernomyrdin, special envoy of the Russian president, that
U.S.-led NATO's barbaric act of attacking the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia constituted a gross violation of China's sovereignty
and humiliation of the dignity of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The reality has demonstrated to what extent the logic of
hegemony and power politics have developed, because "if you are
not favorable to the applying of military force, you will be
treated by military force," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very obvious that the idea of safeguarding human rights
and democracy, as well as opposing ethnic cleansing, which they
are chanting loudly, is only a fig leaf," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China holds that the atrocity of the U.S.-led NATO attack has
violated many international laws including the UN Charter, the
Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations, and the Geneva
Conventions, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China has demanded that a complete and thorough investigation
of the missile attack be carried out, and those who have designed
and carried out the attack must be severely punished, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the United States and NATO make an open and
official apology to the Chinese government and the Chinese people,
" he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhu added that the bombing of Yugoslavia must be halted.
</P>
<P>
"After 50 days of bombing, transportation and
telecommunications facilities, as well as energy and public
facilities in Yugoslavia have been destroyed," he said. "If the
bombing continues, what target will they attack besides innocent
civilians!"
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN Security Council can not impose a political
solution on a sovereignty state without its approval while the
bombing on it continues.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin discussed the stances of Russia and other relevant
countries on the Kosovo crisis and passed on regards to Zhu from
President Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He called NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy AN aggressive
behavior and a brutal act, and expressed his condolence for the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kosovo crisis must be solved within the UN
Security Council through political negotiations, NATO must halt
the bombing, and the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia must be respected.

The Chinese people, especially the students, expressed their
patriotic enthusiasm and sense of justice through various
legitimate forms to protest the atrocities committed by US-led
NATO, which has demonstrated the unified spirit of the Chinese
nation in defending their national interests and the patriotic
tradition of the "May Fourth Movement," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have conscientiously maintained their country's
image of civilization and the rule of law despite the fact that
they are in a very angry mood, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
"We support the just actions of the Chinese people and we will
certainly continue to adhere to our reform and opening up policy,"
Zhu said, adding that China will continue to develop its friendly
and cooperative ties with all nations around the world and
dedicate itself to safeguarding world peace and reinforcing
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The premier pointed out that China and Russia share extensive
consensus on the Kosovo issue. The two countries opposed the use
of force in the first place, and demand that NATO halt bombing to
settle the Kosovo crisis by political means, he said.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia should continue to strengthen their links and
consultations, which will not only conform to the interests of the
two countries, but will also serve world peace, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked Chernomyrdin to convey his greetings to President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov.

the Defense Ministry announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The troops killed 28 Tamil rebels in three separate clashes in

</P>
<P>
However, four elite Special Task Force (STF) personnel were

Prabhakaran is seriously ill with heart trouble and attempting to
go to India for medical treatment.
</P>

<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO air strikes
against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia is threatening
international peace and security, said the Kenyan ambassador here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening meeting of the second part of the 1999
session of the Conference on Disarmament (CD), Kipkorir Aly Azad
Rana said that the use of force "has indeed led to an escalation
of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of civilians have been hit directly or indirectly,
and killed in the fighting," said Rana, Kenya's Permanent
Representative at the CD. "More are likely to suffer a similar
fate should the military strikes be left to continue unabated."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed sincere condolences to the Chinese people
with regard to NATO missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade late Friday, which killed three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
Rana cited Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi as saying in a
press statement that "the current conflict runs the risk of
threatening the very international system that has maintained
peace since World War II".
</P>
<P>
"Diplomacy and negotiations should be given a chance to address
the causes of the crisis," said the Kenyan president. "Solutions
based on the use of force are only likely to worsen the situation.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Workers: Potential to Increase Consumer Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Smart entrepreneurs are turning to
a long-neglected population of potential consumers: migrant
workers across China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the country now has some 70 million
migrant workers, accounting for one-tenth of China's total working
population.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, half of the migrant laborers worked in cities for more
than six months, earning 220 billion yuan, or an average of 6,206
yuan each.
</P>
<P>
And more importantly, these workers enjoy a per capita
disposable income of 2,500 yuan annually. However, these workers
actually spend 1,250 yuan, 775 yuan less than urbanites, the China
Township Enterprises Daily said, indicating that the consumption
potential for migrants amounts to 55 billion yuan, a huge market
for businesses to develop.
</P>
<P>
Migrant workers in cities spend as little as possible, and
almost nothing on recreational activities. But expenses on post
and telecommunications are necessary, since they usually send the
majority of their income back to their home towns for family
subsistence, children's schooling, marriages, and business.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court Tuesday
confirmed the death sentence awarded by a trial court earlier to
four persons, commuted the death penalty of three to life
imprisonment and acquitted 19 others connected with Rajiv Gandhi's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on
May 21, 1991, when he was in election campaigns at Sriperumbudur
of Tamil Nadu. The assassination case lasted about eight years
before it was cleared by the court.
</P>
<P>
Four activists of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
including an Indian Tamil woman, Nalini, will face the gallows for
participating in the conspiracy to kill Gandhi by a LTTE human
bomb.
</P>
<P>
The charge sheet was filed in a record one-year time on May 20,
1992, a day before the first anniversary of Gandhi's
assassination. Pre-trial in the designated court at the high
security prison began on May 5, 1992, and ended on November 2,
1993. After the charges were framed against the accused, in-camera
trial and examination of witnesses began on January 19, 1994, and
ended on November 5, 1997.

<HEADLINE> China, ROK Satisfied With Advancement of Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Both China and the Republic of Korea
(ROK) today expressed their satisfaction over the development of
the bilateral relations and promised to take actions to push ahead
the Sino-ROK cooperative partnership oriented towards the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
ROK President Kim Dae-jung and one of China's top leaders Li
Ruihuan made the remarks at their meeting this morning. Li,
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is on a five-day
official visit here at the invitation of the ROK government.
</P>
<P>
The joint decision to establish a Sino-ROK cooperative
partnership oriented to the 21st century was reached when
President Kim visited China last November. It had charted the
orientation of the bilateral relations, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he stated, the two countries are taking measures
in the spirit prescribed in the Joint Communique between Kim and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to advance the cooperation in an all-
faceted manner. China is satisfied with development of the
bilateral relations in such directions, He stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kim shared Li's view on the Sino-ROK relationship, saying he
was also satisfied with the development of the bilateral ties. His
successful China trip last November established the cooperative
partnership oriented to the 21st century. He believed that Li's
ongoing visit to ROK would provide a new opportunity for
furthering and strengthening the cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said China and ROK have similar experience of suffering from
foreign aggression this century. "We should treasure today's
independence and self-confidence and self-reliance, safeguard the
current situation of peace and development, and make unremitting
efforts to create a bright new century," Li said.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan security forces have not
got any information that Tamil rebel leader Vellupillai
Prabhakaran is sick and seeking medical treatment abroad, military
spokesman Brigadier Sunil Tennakoon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said Prabhakaran, leader of the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), is getting unnecessary publicity through
the media and this can cause an adverse effect on the country.
</P>
<P>
"Because the LTTE might take advantage of it and collect funds
from abroad," he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently there were local media reports that Prabhakaran was
seriously ill with heart trouble and intended to go to India for
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels led by Prabhakaran have been fighting the Sri
Lankan government since 1983 for an independent Tamil homeland in
the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Qian, Chernomyrdin Exchange Views on Kosovo Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
held talks with Victor Chernomyrdin, special envoy of the Russian
president, here today and exchanged views on a political
settlement of the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin strongly condemned the U.S.-led Nato attack on
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, which, he said, is an extremely
barbaric action. Nato's attack has been broadly criticized by
international society, he said, asking Qian to extend his
condolences to the families of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin informed Qian about his latest political mediation
with Yugoslavia, Nato countries, and the UN Secretary General on a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, while parties concerned have gotten
closer on some problems, there are still divergences, even
principled divergences, among them on others.
</P>
<P>
Russia's stance is that Nato should first of all stop its
bombing, and then relevant countries must carry out political
negotiations on issues such as the withdrawal of the Yugoslav
troops, the refugees' return, and an international presence in
accordance with the agreement reached by Russia and seven other
industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis can never be settled by wanton bombing and
destroying a sovereign country, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
Qian thanked Chernomyrdin for his briefing on the Russian stand,
and said that China has noticed the immediate reaction of Russia
on NATO's world-stunning missile attack against the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, and many
other Russian officials have made statements and speeches sternly
condemning the brutality of NATO and their profound condolences
over the death of Chinese citizens, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
China is deeply grateful for the aforementioned friendly
attitude of Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
" NATO, by its brutal attack on the Chinese embassy, has
trampled on norms of international laws and seriously infringed
upon China's sovereignty and dignity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has made solemn and just statements on
the attack and launched the strongest indignation and protest
against U.S.-led NATO. Chinese people, on the other hand, have
also launched various protest and demonstrations over the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said that China has always upheld resolving
the Kosovo crisis in a peaceful way. NATO's rampant bombing of
Yugoslavia has not only violated the UN charter, but is also
illegal.
</P>
<P>
"It is not protection of human rights; instead, it is creating
a humanitarian catastrophe," Qian said. " NATO, therefore, has
been denounced as a matter of course. Issues like the Kosovo
crisis should be resolved within the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Qian told the special envoy the two prerequisite conditions for
a peaceful resolution to the Kosovo crisis which China advocates.
First, NATO must stop bombing immediately, and secondly, any
resolution plan must obtain approval from Yugoslavia, a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
Qian remarked that his discussion with the Russian envoy shows
China and Russia share wide common grounds on the resolution of
the Kosovo crisis, and the two countries should step up
consultation and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> CPAPD Condemns NATO's Attack On Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Peace and Disarmament (CPAPD) held a symposium here today to
condemn NATO for its attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
capital of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 officials from the All-China Trade Unions, All-
China Women's Federation and religious groups said that they fully
support the statement of the Chinese government and the speech by
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao, and urged Chinese at home and
abroad to unify for achieving peace and justice.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice chairwoman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee and CPAPD president, said the international
situation has tended to ease after the Cold War, but US-led NATO,
however, has insisted on Cold War thought, and has managed to
expand its military alliances in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out that NATO's act will constrain momentum on
disarmament and economic development, and is likely to arouse a
new round of arms race.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has destroyed the national economy of Yugoslavia and also
brought about financial burdens to its member-states as well," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they will work hard in their positions to
improve China's comprehensive strength and safeguard the country's
sovereignty and national dignity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in Tanzania Protest NATO'S Embassy Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is brazen contempt for and severe violation of the United
Nations Charter and basic norms of international relations and
gross invasion of China's sovereignty," a group of Chinese at the
gate of the U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam said in a letter of
protest in the morning.
</P>
<P>
They delivered the letter to the U.S. embassy here.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the so called 'human rights' as professed by
your government are nothing but a pack of tricky lies and a
pretext to cover up your killings and aggression," the letter
charged.
</P>
<P>
The letter was handed over by Zeng Zongbiao, a Chinese expert
working at the Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), who led
a dozen of people to protest the barbaric attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was hit by three missiles from
different directions fired by NATO forces last Friday, killing a
female journalist of Xinhua and a newly-married couple of China's
national Guangming Daily reporters. More than 20 people were
injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Dudley Sims, director of the United States Information Service
(USIS) in Tanzania, received the letter on behalf of the U.S.
embassy.
</P>
<P>
Sims said the U.S. government has expressed "sincere apology"
after the incident, while Zeng noted that this is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
"The demands made by the Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan
on the matter must be met," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Chinese people don't want to wage a war with
Americans and people in both countries should seek peace and
create a better future for the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
The letter, prepared by more than 400 Chinese citizens residing
and working in Tanzania, also mentioned the terrorist bombing of
U.S. embassy in Dar es Salaam last August. It noted that at that
time it was widely condemned by people including the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the letter said, the attacks on the Chinese embassy
should be condemned. It asked,"Shouldn't this barbaric and mean
act be spurned by all human beings?"
</P>
<P>
The letter also urged people to think who is keen on war while
people in the whole world want to make peace.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, more than 200 enraged Chinese gathered at a seminar
in Dar es Salaam and denounced NATO bombings of Yugoslavia and
attacks on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Their purpose is very clear. They want to weaken China's
status as a big power, and want to damage the peaceful environment
for economic development in China," one analyzed.
</P>
<P>
"A handful of forces are doomed to failure before the people of
the whole world," another said.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, people raised their arms and shouted: "Oppose
hegemonism! ", "NATO stops bombings!", "We want peace and no war!"
</P>
<P>
The Western alliance has been bombing Yugoslavia since March 24
in an attempt to force Belgrade to sign a peace agreement,
granting greater autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo Province.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Major Bank to Close 15 Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Kenya (NBK),
one of the five major banks in the country, plans to close 15
outlets by August this year as a move to restructure the troubled
bank, its managing director Reuben Marambii has said.
</P>
<P>
So far the bank has suffered a 16.8-billion-shilling (about 258
million U.S. dollars) non-performance debt.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Tuesday quoted Marambii as
saying that the closure and merger will be confined to branches
considered uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
The move will help cut the cost of the bank, Marambii noted.
</P>
<P>
Customers who will seek alternative banking facilities because
 their deposits in branches will be closed, will be offered the
necessary assistance to open accounts at branches of their choice,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to improve the liquidity of the National Bank of
Kenya, the Kenyan government, which has 22 percent of the bank's
share-holdings, pumped two billion shillings (33 million U.S.
dollars) in late 1998 and injected another 4.5 billion shillings
(71 million dollars) into the bank this year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Launch New Taxation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is planning to introduce a
value added tax (VAT) system to reduce the country's heavy
reliance on Customs duties as a main source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star reported on Tuesday that Lebanese Minister of
Finance George Korom said the European Union (EU) will give
Lebanon around 5.3 million U.S. dollars to finance the VAT
project, which he hopes will come into effect in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The new system is intended to gradually replace Customs
duties, which account for around half of the government's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Both EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will work
jointly to introduce the VAT and the finance ministry will draft
a plan in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Although the VAT rate has not been set yet, Korom said that it
will be determined on the basis of detailed economic and financial
studies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of finance has prepared a preliminary report on
VAT which will be tabled to the Cabinet before being submitted to
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is coordinating with the country's Civil Service
Council to conduct tests to hire new staff for the VAT
department. Some of the ministry's staff will also receive
training on the new tax system.
</P>
<P>
Rene Milas, head of a visiting EU delegation, said the gradual
removal of Customs duties and the introduction of VAT will prepare
Lebanon to join the Euro-Mediterranean program and put it on equal
footing with the rest of the member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Med program, which involves the 15 member states of EU
and 12 countries in the Mediterranean basin, aims to foster
economic, political and cultural ties and eventually create a
free-trade zone.

JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African National

DHAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the second largest political party in the country, has
strongly condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade on May 7.
</P>
<P>
"We in our strongest words severely condemn this very incident
of most reckless bombing by the NATO aircraft," Lt. Gen. Mahbubur
Rahman (retired), vice president and advisor of national defense
of the BNP, said on Sunday in separate messages to Chinese
Ambassador to Bangladesh Wang Chungui and Chinese National Defense
Minister Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and more than 20 others were injured

"It is with utmost regret I, on behalf of... all members of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, convey our deepest sympathy and
heartfelt condolence to the Chinese government and the people in
general and to the bereaved families of the victims in particular
in the recent bombing incident... causing wanton destruction and
loss of valuable human lives," Rahman said.

against China and her people. Bangladesh, as an ever good friend,
will always stand by China in all her weal and woe," he noted.

of NATO," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian FM Expresses Condolences to Chinese Victims of NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Namhong Tuesday expressed his condolences and sympathy to the
Chinese people killed or injured in Belgrade by NATO missile
attack.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, Hor
Namhong said, "I have learned with great sadness about the
arrogant missile attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of
China in Belgrade, which resulted in deaths, serious casualties
and damage."
</P>
<P>
Three journalists were killed and more than 20 people injured
in the NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday.
And the building of the embassy was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the royal government of Cambodia and my own, I
would like to extend my profound condolences and sympathy to the
victims and their bereaved families and wish the wounded a quick
recovery," Hor's message said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "this missile attack constitutes a flagrant
infringement on the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China
and an unacceptable violation of the letter and spirit of the U.N.
Charter and international law."
</P>
<P>
"I am of the opinion that the continuation of violence and
air-strike in Yugoslavia leads not only to the further escalation
of international tension, but also inflicts greater suffering on
innocent civilians," Hor Namhong added.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Petition High Court Against Orient House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ten Israelis petitioned High Court
Tuesday morning against the closure orders of Orient House in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ten Israelis, including lawyers and representatives of
different peace groups, submitted their petition against the
closure orders of the High Court at 8:30 AM local time (1030 GMT),
asking the court to block the orders issued by Public Security
Minister Avidgor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police delivered Monday night the closure orders
against three offices in Orient House to Jawad Boulous, an
attorney for the Palestinians in the Orient House, informing him
that he has 24 hours to appeal before the office closures are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the closure orders were issued after the Israeli
government and Palestinian officials failed to reach a compromise
during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday night that he
"tried a last-ditch effort to find a compromise" by sending his
lawyer Yitzhak Molcho to talk with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Ramallah on Monday over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting did not bear any fruit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, the tension inside and around the Orient House
has been running high. Netanyahu has repeatedly asked Kahalani to
issue closure orders against the three Palestinian offices inside
the House no matter what happens in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For fear of violence, Kahalani has been trying in the last two
days to work out a compromise with the Palestinians, asking them
to move two of the three offices, one for national institutions
and another for settlement constructions investigation, to Abu
Dis, east of Jerusalem. But the Palestinians rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has set deadlines on Sunday and Monday evenings for
the closure, but postponed both times. Natanyahu was reportedly
angered over Kahalani's decisions to postpone executing the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Another office subjected to closure is the office of national
research, headed by Palestinian National Authority Minister in
Charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that this House has been used for
promoting the peace process and nothing was illegal as accused by
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process has started from the Orient House...and the
Palestinian delegation to the Madrid Peace Conference left for the
first time from this House," Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erikat said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli defense officials warned the government
that closing the Orient House may lead to violence not only in
East Jerusalem, but to the whole Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The country's intelligence organization Shin Bet chief Ami
Ayalon warned the security cabinet the same day that violence at
the Orient House might send shock waves throughout the
territories, setting off a series of clashes.
</P>
<P>
"It seems the prime minister is more concerned with the
question of how he can influence the voters at home than with the
serious security repercussions of a police incursion into the
Orient House," Tuesday's Ha'aretz daily quoted a senior defense
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu may not be prime minister after the elections, but
whoever is will have to deal with his imbroglio," it added.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid on Monday railed at
this closure decision, saying Netanyahu seems to have decided that
only a major conflagration in Jerusalem can save his re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Washington also got involved in this issue, asking the two
sides to settle this issue peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely sensitive situation and both sides have a
responsibility to defuse it," the State Department spokesman James
Rubin reportedly said in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
United States Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross also
worked all weekend as go-between to try to help settle this
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The High Court is expected to make its decision on the issue
soon.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Launch New Taxation System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is planning to introduce a
value added tax (VAT) system to reduce the country's heavy
reliance on Customs duties as a main source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star reported on Tuesday that Lebanese Minister of
Finance George Korom said the European Union (EU) will give
Lebanon around 5.3 million U.S. dollars to finance the VAT
project, which he hopes will come into effect in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The new system is intended to gradually replace Customs
duties, which account for around half of the government's
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Both EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will work
jointly to introduce the VAT and the finance ministry will draft
a plan in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Although the VAT rate has not been set yet, Korom said that it
will be determined on the basis of detailed economic and financial
studies.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of finance has prepared a preliminary report on
VAT which will be tabled to the Cabinet before being submitted to
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is coordinating with the country's Civil Service
Council to conduct tests to hire new staff for the VAT
department. Some of the ministry's staff will also receive
training on the new tax system.
</P>
<P>
Rene Milas, head of a visiting EU delegation, said the gradual
removal of Customs duties and the introduction of VAT will prepare
Lebanon to join the Euro-Mediterranean program and put it on equal
footing with the rest of the member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Med program, which involves the 15 member states of EU
and 12 countries in the Mediterranean basin, aims to foster
economic, political and cultural ties and eventually create a
free-trade zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and four others wounded Tuesday
morning in south Lebanon by Lebanese guerrillas' roadside bombs.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a roadside bomb targetting a SLA
armored patrol exploded on a road at Birashit in the western
sector of the Israeli occupied zone in south Lebanon, the Voice of
the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack and another bomb blast, which took
place near a school in Jezzine, just north of the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The blast, also targetting a SLA patrol, didn't inflict any
human casualties, but SLA said in a statement that the bombing
caused some damages to the school and sparked panic among students.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli forces pounded villages and hills near
Birashit. So far no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its ally SLA out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Iran After Headscarf Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is expected to submit a note
to Iran in protest against a weekend rally in Tehran in support of
a disputed deputy of Turkey's pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP).
</P>
<P>
The local Daily News Tuesday quoted Turkish officials as saying
 Ankara is preparing to convey its concerns to the Iranian
government and indicates that the Turkish Embassy in Tehran will
be assigned to relay those concerns.
</P>
<P>
Iranian women wearing headscarves on Saturday took to the
streets of Tehran, urging the Turkish government to ease its
restrictions on FP deputy Merve Kavakci.
</P>
<P>
Kavakci entered the parliament hall for the swearing-in
ceremony wearing a headscarf on May 2, causing chaos in the
parliament and protests from other political parties.
</P>
<P>
She finally walked out of the parliament without taking oath.
</P>
<P>
Women wearing headscarves according to the Islamic custom are
forbidden from entering public institutions in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Prime Minister-designate Bulent Ecevit on Sunday
accused Iran of trying to "export" its Islamic administration to
Turkey, a Muslim-populated but politically secular country.
</P>
<P>
He also charged Iran with assisting the Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), outlawed by Turkey for its 14-year separatist fighting for
an independent Kurdish state in south Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Also during the weekend, Turkey's Ambassador to Iran Sencer
Ozsoy was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to explain
earlier remarks by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel criticizing
headscarved Kavakci.

He said the consultation can help China and Russia increase
mutual understanding. China and Russia will, as always, further

<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO remains sceptical about the announcement by
Yugoslavia to partially withdraw troops from Kosovo, the attack on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO missiles has weakened the
consensus of the pro-NATO alliance in Europe. For a second time in
two days, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro called for a stop
of NATO strikes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- The Chinese people remain absolutely convinced that that
attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by NATO was a deliberate
attack by the United States. The most accepted hypothesis in China
is that ``some elements'' in NATO want to sabotage the process for

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Condemns NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Secretary of the French
Communist Party Robert Hue Tuesday condemned the NATO attack on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We should condemn the bombing of an embassy in a country,
which is a place of sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French government should also make a formal
condemnation of the attack.
</P>
<P>
He urged the French government to call for a stop of the NATO
bombings in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"France, from today, should ask its partners of NATO to stop
the bombings," said Hue in an interview with LCI television
station.
</P>
<P>
He said that the announcement by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to partially withdraw troops from Kosovo provides a
chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
"We should take an initiative. Seize the chance of peace," he
said, while stressing that the withdrawal of Serb forces should be
verified.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Americans are having difficulty forcing its
military strategy upon Europe after nearly 50 days of bombings
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"France has its role to play. It does not have to wait forever
the decision of its chief, the Americans," he said.

<HEADLINE> Interest-Free Loans Available in East China Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents in east China's Hangzhou,
Ningbo and Wenzhou cities can now borrow bank money free of
interest, a fond dream for many in the past.
</P>
<P>
Under a program recently announced here by the Guangdong
Development Bank, individuals in the three cities may get 60-day
interest-free consumer credits from the bank for purposes such as
interior decoration, purchases of home appliances and furniture,
and travel.
</P>
<P>
This service is a joint effort by the bank and some local
businesses, and according to an agreement between them, the
businesses will pay the bank for its loans to consumers.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman referred to the move as a further step toward
increasing credit consumption among ordinary people amid growing
market competition.
</P>
<P>
China began nationwide banking reform a few years ago,
prompting banks to improve their services for more profits and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Banks in China used to restrict their loans to industries, but
are now providing individuals with credit services, thus allowing
more Chinese to spend on future income.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Development Bank has chosen these three cities
for their trial run of this new service because they are
relatively more developed than many others.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Urges NATO to Stop Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government and people
strongly demand the US-led NATO to halt its aggression and air
strikes against Yugoslavia immediately and bring the Kosovo issue
back to the track of a political settlement as soon as possible,
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
 The US-led NATO will encounter even stronger condemnation and
opposition from the people world over, including those of China,
America and NATO member states, if it insists on its bombing
against Yugoslavia and running counter to the historical trend,
Zhu stated.
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman made the remarks when asked to comment on
NATO's air strike against Yugoslavia that has lasted nearly 50
days under the pretext of "human rights" and "humanitarian aid".
</P>
<P>
 Since its bombing against Yugoslavia on March 24, the air
strikes of the US-led NATO have expanded from military targets to
civilian establishments, destroying hospitals, bridges, television
stations, refinery plants, power stations and resident houses, Zhu
said, adding that NATO has now gone so far as to attack the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
 NATO's bombing has not only killed lots of innocent civilians
including Albanians, but also slaughtered and wounded journalists
and foreign diplomats working in Yugoslavia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
 The United States has always flaunted itself as "human rights
defender" and yet has created such atrocities; it talks
excessively about preventing "racial cleansing" but never
discusses the serious humanitarian disasters caused by NATO's
bombing, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
 Facts have shown that the US-led NATO is not trying to end
tragedies but instead is creating catastrophes, the Spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Petition High Court Against Orient House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Ten Israelis petitioned High Court
Tuesday morning against the closure orders of Orient House in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ten Israelis, including lawyers and representatives of
different peace groups, submitted their petition against the
closure orders of the High Court at 8:30 AM local time (1030 GMT),
asking the court to block the orders issued by Public Security
Minister Avidgor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police delivered Monday night the closure orders
against three offices in Orient House to Jawad Boulous, an
attorney for the Palestinians in the Orient House, informing him
that he has 24 hours to appeal before the office closures are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the closure orders were issued after the Israeli
government and Palestinian officials failed to reach a compromise
during the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday night that he
"tried a last-ditch effort to find a compromise" by sending his
lawyer Yitzhak Molcho to talk with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in Ramallah on Monday over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
But the meeting did not bear any fruit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, the tension inside and around the Orient House
has been running high. Netanyahu has repeatedly asked Kahalani to
issue closure orders against the three Palestinian offices inside
the House no matter what happens in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For fear of violence, Kahalani has been trying in the last two
days to work out a compromise with the Palestinians, asking them
to move two of the three offices, one for national institutions
and another for settlement constructions investigation, to Abu
Dis, east of Jerusalem. But the Palestinians rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani has set deadlines on Sunday and Monday evenings for
the closure, but postponed both times. Natanyahu was reportedly
angered over Kahalani's decisions to postpone executing the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Another office subjected to closure is the office of national
research, headed by Palestinian National Authority Minister in
Charge of Jerusalem Affairs Faisal Husseini.

<HEADLINE> China's Earliest Gold-Printed Garment Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A garment made of fabrics with
dazzling gold foil sewn on applique work dating back to the Han
Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.) was recently unearthed from a tomb in
Lop Nur, a desolate wasteland in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists believe this is the earliest woven
material with gold prints ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery pushes the history of fabric-making with gold
back 1,000 years earlier than previously believed," said Li
Wenying, a female archeologist participating in the excavation.
</P>
<P>
The gold foils were sewn using two different methods. One was
to cut colored silk in the shape of flower buds, petals, stamen
and fruits, which were pinned up on the collar, sleeves, lower hem,
and back of the garment. Then gold foils were pasted on the silk
designs. The other way was to spread gold powder onto the design.
</P>
<P>
One archeologist, Zhou Jinling, described the embroidery as "
distinctive, dazzling and harmonious in color."
</P>
<P>
This garment was one of the 200-plus rare cultural relics
unearthed from 32 tombs built in the period between the Han and
Jin dynasties (206 B.C.-420 A.D.) at the Yingpan Ruins in Lop Nur.
</P>
<P>
The site lies 200 km east of Loulan, one of the busiest
commercial cities on the ancient Silk Road which served as a
transportation hub for the flow of goods from China to the West
over 2,000 years ago. The flourishing trade route began to decline
in the fourth century.
</P>
<P>
The recent excavation, which lasted for more than a month, was
the continuation of a protective excavation begun in 1995. During
the three-year period, Chinese archeologists opened 32 ancient
tombs and cleared more than 100 robbed tombs over an area 1.5 km
long and several meters wide.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the unearthed objects were burial accessories
including garments, wooden, bronze, and lacquer wares, gold and
silver ornaments, and pearls.
</P>
<P>
The most significant finding was three woolen robes with
designs of flying men, eagles, and snakes woven with a jacquard
technique. These bear the cultural characteristics of Greece and
Persia.
</P>
<P>
"The unprecedented designs offer clues for the study of woolen
products manufactured in ancient times," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Other articles which have aroused interests among the
excavators included a mask never seen in tombs previously
unearthed in China, and a piece of colored brocade with Chinese
characters similar to those found at the Niya Site, a city which
disappeared nearly 2,000 years ago in the desert of northwestern
China.
</P>
<P>
"The current excavation opens a new chapter in archeological
research at Lop Nur. It has provided new materials not only for
the study of cultural development at the Western Regions -- an
ancient term for the area west of Yumenguan which includes what is
now Xinjiang and parts of Central Asia -- but also for an
understanding of commercial, cultural and communication exchanges
between China and the West on the ancient silk road," Li said.

<HEADLINE> China Newspapers Assn. Condemns U.S.-Led NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Chinese
Newspapers today publicized a statement to strongly condemn the
crime committed by U.S.-led NATO in wantonly encroaching on
China's sovereignty and in slaying Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the association on behalf of its 1,500
member organizations and more than 300,000 journalists and staff
members, denounced the ugly act of the U.S.-led NATO forces in
trampling on human rights under the cloak of safeguarding human
rights.
</P>
<P>
At midnight Friday, the U.S.-led NATO forces fired missiles on
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese
journalists working there, injuring 20 others, and severely
damaging the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the association said all its members and
journalists were indignant at the way the three journalists were
killed, and sent condolences and sympathy to the relatives of the
victims and to the Xinhua News Agency and Guangming Daily Group
that employed the three.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Shao Yunhuan of Xinhua, and Xu Xinghu and
his wife Zhu Ying, both from the Guangming Daily, demonstrated the
dedication and lofty sacrificial spirit of Chinese journalists in
the face of dangerous situations, and set a good example for all
Chinese journalists to follow.
</P>
<P>
It called on Chinese journalists to firmly support the
righteous stance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government
toward the brutal act, and to endorse the spirit of the televised
speech made by Vice-President Hu Jintao on the incident.
</P>
<P>
The association also urged journalists to turn sorrow and anger
into force and take the initiative to conscientiously safeguard
the situation of stability and unity, work hard to provide the
world with faster, better and accurate news reports to
counterpunch the lunatic provocation of U.S.-led NATO on
journalists' safety and rights.
</P>
<P>
The barbarous act of U.S.-led NATO caused huge losses to the
relatives of the three journalists killed and the organizations
that employed them, and seriously affected the normal work in
these organizations, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
the association strongly demanded the punishment of those
responsible for the brutal act and compensation for all the losses
suffered by the relatives of the dead ones and by the
organizations where they worked in a bid to safeguard the
legitimate rights of the association's member organizations, the
journalists and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
The association also called for unity in the journalistic
community of the world and urged colleagues worldwide to
unanimously condemn the barbarous act of U.S.-led NATO in killing
Chinese journalists, as well as to make efforts to uphold justice
and ensure journalists' safety and their right to work.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China demanded here today the U.S.-

As pointed out in Chinese government's declaration, the U.S.-

specific persons who created the tragedy should bear criminal
responsibilities as stipulated in international laws.

<HEADLINE> Motorola's Plan to Increase Investment Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Gary Tooker, chairman of Motorola
Inc. of the United States, said here today that his company will
not change its plans to increase investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Tooker, who is heading a mission to the north China port city
of Tianjin, made this pledge to Tianjin's Party Secretary Zhang
Lichang and Mayor Li Shenglin.
</P>
<P>
Tooker and his delegation visited a computer-chip manufacturing
project inside the Xiqing Development Zone in Tianjin this morning,
Motorola's largest project in China.
</P>
<P>
Corporate sources said that the plan involves 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars of increased investment and the money will all be paid in
by late next year.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, workers were seen arriving at Motorola (
China) Electronics Ltd. inside the Tianjin Development Zone in
shuttle buses coming from different directions.
</P>
<P>
Inside the main hall of the office building, an open letter
signed by P.Y. Lai, president of Motorola (China) Electronics Ltd.
was displayed.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, P.Y. Lai, on behalf of the managerial staff of
the Motorola (China) company, extended regret over the U.S.-led
NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia which killed
three journalists and injured 20 others.
</P>
<P>
While expressing condolences and sympathy to relatives of the
victims of the raid, P.Y. Lai said he hopes that the incident will
be resolved through peaceful and diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yonggang, a worker at the Motorola-financed venture, said
the workers will turn grief into strength, conforming with the
guidelines of the televised speech delivered by Chinese Vice-
President Hu Jintao on Sunday afternoon, and work harder still to
master modern technology and keep to their workposts with the
purpose of making China prosperous as quickly as possible, and
further promoting its reform and open-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has eight manufacturing facilities in Tianjin and
seven in other parts of the country, worth one billion U.S.
dollars of investment, and making Motorola the largest U.S.
investor in China.
</P>
<P>
Before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China last June,
P.Y Lai announced that the Motorola company would add an
additional 1.5 billion U.S. dollars of investment in China.
</P>
<P>
This increased investment will be used mainly to expand
production of the most sophisticated semiconductor integrated
circuit chips used in automotive electronic components, energy
products, and other telecommunications components at a plant in
the Xiqing Development Zone in Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Doctors Launch General Strike Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's doctors Tuesday
launched a general strike in a protest against a "complete lack of
progress" in wage talks with the country's finance ministry.
</P>
<P>
Most of the public hospitals and health fund clinics of the
country were shut. Only emergency rooms and dialysis, oncology,
intensive care and neonatal services will operate on regular
schedules.
</P>
<P>
The doctors, belonging to Israel Medical Association (IMA), are
trying to win a new contract that would update their salaries, set
in a 1994 contract that expired in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministry claimed that, under the old contract, the
doctors enjoyed a 50 percent hike in real wages. The ministry is
opposed to a new contract, fearing this will set off an avalanche
of wage demands in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
IMA decided to launch a general strike after it saw "absolutely
no advance" toward reaching a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with the officials of the finance
ministry, IMA Chairman Yoram Blachar said on Monday night
"we discover today that the finance ministry doesn't have the
ability to resolve the crisis."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, IMA will also hold a demonstration in front of the
office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem to
protest against Netanyahu's refusal to get involved in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The officials of the finance ministry have accused the doctors
of exploiting the coming general elections to blackmail the
government.
</P>
<P>
The general elections for premiership is due to held in Israel
on May 17. Until now, politicians from all the parties have
avoided commenting on the strike.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong Draws Technology Development Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, an emerging
financial and economic zone in Shanghai, has drawn scores of
technology development organizations from both home and abroad in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
These organizations include a state-level human-gene research
institute, a pharmaceutical development center, a software
industrial park, and an international life and health sciences
center.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attribute the new trend to a fast-improving
business environment in the area and its prospects of becoming one
of the world's most vigorous economies in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Since it was set up in 1990, the Pudong New Area has completed
ten major infrastructure projects, with another ten under
construction, including an international airport, a subway and a
pedestrian tunnel across the Huangpu River that separates the area
from downtown Shanghai. At least 200 billion yuan has been used
for infrastructure construction to date.
</P>
<P>
Investors from over 60 countries and regions have launched more
than 5,400 projects in Pudong, with a total investment hitting 28
billion U.S. dollars. Eighty-eight of the top 500 multinationals
in the world have opened 140 subsidiaries in the area.
</P>
<P>
These projects cover such sectors as telecommunications,
electric appliances, biological engineering, automobiles,
computers, and machinery and electronics, turning the area into a
high-tech industrial center.
</P>
<P>
One of the projects, the Shanghai General Motors Corp., a China-
U.S. joint venture at a cost of 1.52 billion U.S. dollars, has
established an automobile technology center. Experts at the center
have made more than 600 technological innovations in the Buick car
model, the company's main auto.
</P>
<P>
Many major Chinese enterprise groups, such as the Chunlan Group
based in neighboring Jiangsu Province and the Shanshan Group in
Zhejiang Province, have also moved their technological and
information centers to Pudong.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch New Anti-Forgery System for Value-added Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China will soon introduce a new
anti-forgery system to strengthen control on value-added tax
collection, according to the State Administration of Taxation (SAT)
.
</P>
<P>
The new system, using a special code to read computer-printed
invoices, will effectively block the way for invoice
counterfeiting, sources from the administration said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Faguang, deputy director of SAT, said the new system will
first be applied to value-added tax invoices worth more than 100,
000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Enterprises joining the anti-forgery network will write
invoices using the new system beginning January 1 next year, and
handwritten invoices valued at more than 100,000 yuan will be
excluded from circulation, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
The new system is patented by the China Aerospace Corp. and has
gone through strict tests in several provinces including
Guangdong and Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of this system will also promote computerization
in the taxation sector in addition to curbing tax evasion and
other related crimes, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Help PAL Look for New Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will help
the debt-ridden Philippine Airlines (PAL) look for new investors
if its present management fails to raise the needed funds to keep
the flag carrier in business, the Presidential Palace said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said President Joseph
Estrada has reiterated his directive to the cabinet to look for
ways short of a government bailout, to keep PAL flying.
</P>
<P>
"The president has told us that as much as possible, we must
keep PAL flying," Zamora said in a radio interview this morning.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said the president has
directed concerned government agencies to take over the task of
looking for new investors in PAL, if its chairman, Lucio Tan,
fails to meet the June 4 deadline of infusing at least 200 million
U.S. dollars in fresh capital into the airline.
</P>
<P>
"The takeover that President Estrada is saying does not refer
to a physical takeover of PAL but to the takeover of looking for
new investors if Tan fails to look for new ones before the
deadline," Barican said in a separate radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the government would also study how government
financing institutions can invest in PAL on a purely commercial
basis without bailing out the airline through a doleout.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the president earlier stressed that the
government would not bail out PAL because the airline remains a
private business entity.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the president is aware of PAL's importance to small
business groups, including farmers and fishermen who rely on PAL
to transport their produce to other points in the country.
</P>
<P>
PAL, Zamora added, is also important to the export sector,
which he said, relies heavily on the airline's cargo transport
services.
</P>
<P>
"That is our top principle. We must keep PAL flying," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also said that while PAL has received offers from some
Middle East investors, Tan is also discussing a possible deal with
German airline Lufthansa.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is expected to
submit its report on the unified customs tariff of Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states within a month, said the Gulf
News daily on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank is preparing the report at the request of Gulf
states and it will submit the report to us by mid-June," GCC
sources were quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a World Bank delegation was in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, to gather information on GCC customs taxes, the sources
explained.
</P>
<P>
They also explained that the report will not be mandatory for
the six GCC states and it will be reviewed by GCC finance and
industry ministers following its submission.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
"Gulf ministers will review the report and amend it in
accordance with regional requirements," said the sources, adding
that Gulf states do not have to adopt it if it does not suit them.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Gulf states are examining three proposals for the
unified tax: 4 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent and 9 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GCC has been trying since 1983 to unify customs duties of
its members, which vary between 4 and 20 percent. It has set March
2001 as the target date for a customs union, aimed at establishing
a Gulf common market.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Condemns NATO Attack of Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
Tuesday expressed his condolences over those killed in a missile
attack by the U.S.-led NATO on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Chinese counterpart, Zhu Rongji, Hun Sen
said, "In the name of the royal government of Cambodia and the
entire people of the country, I express deep condolences to those
killed in such inhuman incident and wish the injured people
recover as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodia government maintains that it not only brutally
trampled on the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China to
attack the embassy of a sovereignty country, but also a brutal
violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and
international law," the message said.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and more than 20 people wounded in the
NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen stressed that "the Cambodian government always
denounces acts which are against the U.N. charter or the use of
force in the international relations."
</P>
<P>
"So, I urge all parties concerned to resolve the crisis through
negotiation and a political way on the basis of respect for
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the
legitimate rights of the Kosovo people," Hun Sen added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged an immediate stop to the NATO attacks
and use of violence. He pointed out that "continuing to do so will
be sure to cause more innocent people to be killed or injured."
</P>
<P>
The message has already been broadcast by local radio and TV
stations.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-led NATO Urged to Meet Chinese Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the United
States Li Zhaoxing on Monday urged the United States and its NATO
allies to make efforts to meet the four demands raised by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"The four demands have to be met," Li Zhaoxing said in an
interview with the PBS.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Monday put forward the
four demands to the U.S.-led NATO -- an open and official apology,
a complete and thorough investigation, prompt publication of the
detailed results of the investigation and severe punishment of
those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody who is serious" can believe that such a brutal attack
on the Chinese embassy is "a mistake" as claimed by NATO, said the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO raided the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade with
missiles last Friday, killing three journalists and injuring more
than 20 others, with the embassy building severely devastated.
</P>
<P>
The atrocity has generated the strongest protest and
indignation in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador pointed out that the atrocious attack is
a violation of the U.N. Charter and norms governing international
relations and a gross encroachment on Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We want thorough investigation. We want all details." he said,
adding China believes more in facts than words.
</P>
<P>
This was a serious event which resulted in heavy casualties,
and a violation of national sovereignty, he added.
</P>
<P>
"How can you just say sorry and then walk away without doing
anything. This will further anger the Chinese people," said the
Ambassador.

JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's police Monday delivered closure orders against three
offices in the Orient House in East Jerusalem after the Israeli
and Palestinian officials failed to reach a compromise over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the orders, the Palestinians had 24 hours to
appeal to the High Court before the office closures are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed on Monday
night his comments a year ago that "the left doesn't remember
what it means to be Jewish" were taken out of context and he has
"full respect for all Jews and non-Jews" in the country, even if
they don't vote for him in the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Appearing on a political talk show on Israel Television,
Netanyahu said the real issue in the election campaign is "who
will stand up to the pressure to allow an Arab state in the heart
of the country."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Stance on Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China has held that the Kosovo
issue should be solved in a just and reasonable way through
negotiations and under the prerequisite of respect for
Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity while ensuring
the rights and interests of all the ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao reiterated China's
stance on the Kosovo issue at a regular news conference here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for a peaceful solution to the conflict through
negotiations, and oppose the use of force and the threat of the
use of forece in the international affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
China also holds that sovereignty and territorial integrity of
each country should be respected, Zhu said, adding that China
opposes any interference in other countries' internal affairs by
any excuses and means, and opposes that any country does what it
wants to do by bypassing the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO, by bypassing the United Nations, launched
military attacks against Yugoslavia, a sovereign state. This is
the demonstration of an absolute gunboat policy," Zhu stated. "
This policy has caused extremely serious consequences."
</P>
<P>
He said until now, NATO has continued its wanton and
indiscriminate bombing of Yugoslavia and the prerequisite for
solving the Kosovo crisis is that NATO should stop its military
action against Yugoslavia immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, everything cannot be done," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also pointed out that any plan to solve the
crisis should be accepted by Yugoslavia, and should be made in
line with relevant principles of the international law.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Power Company Privatized in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Contact Energy, a big
state-owned power company in New Zealand, was totally privatized
as its shares started trading here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Contact shares, which were issued at 3.1 NZ dollars a share by
the New Zealand government Monday, surged to 3.75 NZ dollars in
the opening minutes of trading in the morning before settling at
3.34 NZ dollars at the close of trading in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Contact controls 27 percent of New Zealand's power generation
and its shares will be one of the top five listed sharemarket
stocks in the country.
</P>
<P>
In March, the New Zealand government decided to sell 40 percent
of the shares in Contact Energy to Edison Mission, a U.S. power
giant, which will pay 1.21 billion NZ dollars (678 million U.S.
dollars) for the cornerstone stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
Shares sold to the public and institutions this week will raise
 another 1.1 billion NZ dollars (616 million U.S. dollars) for the
 government.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the 2.3 billion NZ dollars (1.3 billion
U.S. dollars) the New Zealand government will earn from the sale
of the energy retailer and generator will be used to repay
government debt. Paying off that debt will save the government 140
million NZ dollars (78.4 million U.S. dollars) a year in interest
payments.

<P>
Kiribati is rich in fishing resources, and Chinese products are

economies are complementary, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has assisted Kiribati with several
projects which have produced good economic benefits, and China is
satisfied with the development of bilateral relations, Jiang said.

<P>
He noted that China and Kiribati are both developing countries
of the Asia-Pacific region, and they now face the same task of

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Four out of ten wireless
telephones in China are produced in Shenzhen, the country's
largest wireless telephone production base. Its output reached 12.
39 million units in 1998, making up 41.3 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, a Sino-Japanese joint venture
alone turned out 5 million wireless telephones last year, ranking
first in the world, compared with several hundred thousand units
in 1993 when it first began operations.
</P>
<P>
The firm's products have been sold well in Japan, the United
States and Europe. Officials of the joint venture attribute the
rapid development of the industry to high quality personnel in
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
To date, Shenzhen has dozens of enterprises engaged in
producing wireless telephones, and five of them having an annual
output of over one million units.
</P>
<P>
Inside sources predict that the industry still has great
potential for development, and that from next year the annual

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Develop 22,150 Resort Units by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has the potential to
develop up to 22,150 resort units by the year 2,000, catering to
an estimated 20.4 million guests, including about 20 percent from
the domestic markets, a former tourism official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement of this level of resort development would make
the Philippines one of the leading resort destinations in
Southeast Asia," the Philippines' former Tourism Secretary
Narzalina Z. Lim stressed.
</P>
<P>
She said that to achieve this competitive position requires
development of a large number of large resort estates located
close to major international gateways and transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
"We should develop large resort estates in the country to take
advantage of the Philippine's comparative advantage and capture a
significant share of the big tourism market in Southeast Asia,"
Lim said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lim rejected any cash register-based development,
stressing that the need for economic benefits should be balanced
with the need to preserve the environment and Filipino culture and
values.
</P>
<P>
She said that at present, main resort destinations in the
region are located in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Lim said that these countries provide combined 50,000 resort
units, catering mainly to international guests from Japan,
Australia, Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, demand is expected to reach 90,000 resort
units in the region, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the Philippines has a comparative edge as a
major destination in the Asia Pacific region because of its
proximity to major markets, its outstanding set of attractions,
manpower and favorable cost structure.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Considers Stock Dual Listings With Egypt, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is trying to reach agreements
with Egypt and Kuwait for dual listings of firms on the stock
exchanges of the two countries, Jordan Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal for dual listings with Egypt is expected to be reached
within two months as officials from both sides hope their
consultations on the issue will soon yield results, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding for dual listings with the
Kuwait Stock Exchange is scheduled to be signed in Amman this
week, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The dual listing programs with Egypt and Kuwait are
apparently part of cash-strapped Jordan's efforts to attract
investment to bolster its stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
The desert kingdom registered a negative economic growth in
1998 with its foreign debts standing at record 6.8 billion
U.S. dollars, unemployment rate at over 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein currently is on an
European and North American tour to rally financial support to
lift his country's economy out of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
The 18-day tour will take Abdullah to Britain, Germany,
Canada and the United States as part of his efforts to
call for reducing or rescheduling the payment of Jordan's
foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Raid of Chinese Embassy Deliberate: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' Journal newspaper said
Tuesday that NATO's missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was not an accident but more
likely a "deliberate accident."
</P>
<P>
The paper said "how can it be an accident when the Chinese
Embassy in the FRY is located in a strictly residential area?"
</P>
<P>
"For NATO that boasts the surgical precision of its bombings
coordinated by satellites and guided by missile cameras and laser
that can seek out a needle in a haystack, it is improbable that
this 'mistake' is simply an accident," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the Chinese Embassy's address in Belgrade is
surely in the Yugoslav and NATO phone books, an address of common
knowledge that should be quite easy to verify and locate.
</P>
<P>
So, "mistakenly" bombing a neutral country's embassy in a sea
of residential communities would "strain anyone's imagination",
the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged NATO and the United States to pinpoint the
cause of that attack and mete out punishment.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls to Withhold Coop with Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued here Tuesday, the call
was contained in a communique of the 57th ordinary session of the
Central Organ of OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution at Ambassadorial Level held here Monday on the
situation in the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
The seven-point communique said, "the Central Organ reiterated
its strong and unequivocal condemnation of the coup d'etat of
April 30, 1999 which seriously compromises the implementation of
the Antananarivo Agreement and its demand for immediate
restoration of the constitutional order."
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ reaffirmed its support for the Antananarivo
Agreement and "renewed its request to the Anjouanese Party to
sign, without further delay, the Antananarivo Agreement in
conformity with the commitment it made at the Comorian
Inter-Island Conference."
</P>
<P>
It "decided pursuant to the recommendations of the Maputo
meeting of the countries of the region to withdraw the military
component of the OAU observer mission in the Comoros given the
absence of conducive climate for the military observers to achieve
their mandate".
</P>
<P>
"The Central Organ further decided to review the presence of
the OAU mission in the Comoros if there is no positive evolution
of the problem and to take measures as appropriate," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ also requested the countries of the region,
in conformity with the mandate entrusted to them, in cooperation
with the OAU Central Organ and the OAU Secretary General, to
consider any other measures that can be taken in response to the
unacceptable situation in the Comoros.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Paper Stresses UN's Role in Resolving Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations should and
must be the medium to sort out differences over any conflicts
based on the charter of the world organization, The Rising Nepal
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government-owned newspaper noted in a commentary that war
like that in Yugoslavia never did anyone any good. "The first and
foremost step in this regard is for the parties concerned to be
less aggressive and sit down to find a peaceful solution," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It held that "not only in this case but over any such conflicts
the U.N. should and must be the medium to sort out differences
based on the charter of the world organization."
</P>
<P>
It said that during the NATO air strikes over Belgrade, the
Chinese embassy was attacked by missiles leading to the loss of
precious lives and valuable property.
</P>
<P>
As per international conventions and laws, a diplomatic enclave
should be strictly off-limits to any act of belligerency. "And
when missiles and bombs start hitting protected sites like
diplomatic enclaves, then there is every reason for the whole
international community to be shocked and dumbfounded, no matter
how legitimate the aim of such aerial campaigns is made out to
be," the paper commented.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Protest Outside US Consulate Over NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Chinese demonstrators
gathered outside the U.S. Consulate in West Australia's coastal
city of Perth on Tuesday to protest against NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tony Potts, a police spokesman in West Australian state, told
Xinhua that the protest was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were mainly young people, many carrying banners
reading "Shame Clinton Shame," the Australian Associated Press
said in a report.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 police men, including plainclothes detectives and
members of the Tactical Response Group, were on hand to ensure the
protest was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
"Clinton is wrong and the bombing of our embassy is the proof,"
said one protester, who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese community was upset and angry about the
attack on the Chinese embassy and called on the Chinese government
to sever all ties with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Three protesters were admitted to the consulate to present a
letter to consular officials condemning the "criminal" attack on
the Chinese embassy and demanding that NATO stop bombing
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"For the past 48 days the U.S.-led NATO strikes have rampantly
bombarded Yugoslavia, damaging thousands of homes and killing many
innocent people," the letter read.
</P>
<P>
"And now to our horror they've extended this irrational attack
to the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, claiming the lives of three
journalists and creating a bloody tragedy in the history of
international diplomacy."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Turns to Wind Power for Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 11 ( Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will soon conduct a
feasibility study across the island, exploring the possibilities
of harnessing wind power to meet its growing demand for power,
Irrigation and Power Ministry sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This follows the success of a wind power project constructed
recently at a cost of 270 million rupees (3.87 million U.S.
dollars) at Hambantota in the south capable of generating three
megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
However, a huge land area is needed for a large number of wind
mills and electricity generated through them fluctuates
considerably with the wind speed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Only around 10 percent of the country's requirement could be
met through wind power because of this factor, they said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the projected demand, electricity generating capacity
in Sri Lanka must be doubled in the next seven years. The
Electricity Board is seeking alternatives to generate 8 to 10
percent more electricity each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Boere Weerstand
Beweging (BWB, Boer Resistance Movement) Monday offered to send a
force of volunteer soldiers to Yugoslavia to help defend Serbia
against NATO aggression, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the right-wing group, Andrew Ford, sent a letter
to the Yugoslav embassy in Pretoria Monday, saying it was prepared
to send 100 men, including combatants, medics and technical
personnel to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The force would also include five helicopter technicians and
five pilots.
</P>
<P>
Although its mission was mainly humanitarian, the BWB would
also send 34 combatants to protect the other members of the group.
</P>
<P>
The BWB said in its letter it wanted to send the group to
Yugoslavia to "support its people in the crisis in the country
caused by the inhumane actions and aggression of NATO."
</P>
<P>
"We want to help the Serbians because they are nationalists and
Christians like us," Ford told SAPA.
</P>
<P>
NATO was wrong to attack a sovereign country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization decided to send the force at a meeting of its
general staff Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ford said all the members of the force were former South
African Defense Force and South Africa police members and fully
trained in combat situations.
</P>
<P>
Ford told SAPA that the BWB had contacts in Yugoslavia and was
confident of raising money for the mission.
</P>
<P>
The BWB also wrote to South African Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, asking for his approval for the force.
</P>
<P>
"We want to emphasize that this is not a mercenary expedition
but a sincere attempt to support a country and its people in a
time of need," Ford said in the letter to Buthelezi.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Europeans Speak Loud in Condemnation of NATO Embassy Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- "I have experienced two world wars
but never heard of attacking embassies. This is so rare," an 88-
year-old Polish woman said in a letter to the Chinese diplomatic
mission here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing shock and outrage at NATO's missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, the elderly lady said, "It's an
open provocation and aggression against a sovereign country."
</P>
<P>
Similar voices of condemnation of NATO savage have been heard
from all walks of life across Eastern Europe since the U.S.-led
military block raided the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday
night, which left three killed and more than 20 injured.
</P>
<P>
Many Polish citizens telephoned or wrote letters to the Chinese
Embassy in Warsaw, expressing indignation and condemnation over
the U.S.-led war-maniacs, and deep condolences over the Chinese
victims and sympathy with their families.
</P>
<P>
A Warsaw resident named Kucharski expressed concerns over an
expansion of the Balkans war, saying: "Today the Chinese Embassy
is bombed, tomorrow the Russian Embassy may be 'accidentally'
bombed. What will happen next?"
</P>
<P>
A businessman named Bohdaanowicz said in his letter that the
world is coming to realize that NATO is rapidly turning to an anti-
human, killer group, which will lead to its eventual destruction.
</P>
<P>
A Polish Ph.D. named Zochowski wrote that the NATO attack on
the Chinese Embassy was by no means an accident or an intelligence
error but an aggression scheme carefully worked out by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In Romania, the Romanian-Chinese Friendship Association and the
Romanian-Chinese Industrial and Commercial Chamber sent letters to
Chinese Ambassador in Romania, Liu Guchang, denouncing NATO's act
as "absolutely a war crime."
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Democracy Forum sent a telegraph to Liu, calling
for global unity to foil the U.S. attempts to be the overlord of
the world, while the Greater Romania Party issued a statement in
strong protest of NATO's attack, calling it an unprecedented crime.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Romania's leading national newspaper
Cotidianul carried a front-page commentary lashing out at the U.S.-
led NATO's barbaric act, denouncing it as a shameless trample upon
international law and basic diplomatic guidelines, a dangerous
provocation against a peace-loving nation and the first air raid
on a diplomatic mission in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, signed by the paper's director Ion Cristoiu,
said NATO's claim of "mistaken bombing" could not convince anyone
as all signs point to a premeditated targeting of the Chinese
Embassy in order to set up the United States as the only super
power in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, Chairman of the Hungarian-Chinese Friendship
Association Talas Barna on Monday sternly condemned NATO's
barbaric attack, refuting NATO's claim of unintentional bombing as
totally groundless and U.S. President Bill Clinton's apology as
far from enough.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Barna noted that some people in
the United States have always wanted to undermine the Sino-U.S.
relations and are always looking for enemies.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Workers' Party issued a statement on Monday,
expressing its most resolute condemnation of NATO's war crime
against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, the Bulgarian-Chinese Friendship Association held
an emergency meeting in Sofia on Monday, denouncing NATO's
barbaric act and shameless justification of its crime.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Official Condemns NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The missile attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade is a "savage" act by the U.S. and NATO forces,
said Reynaldo Calviac, director of the International Press Center
of the Cuban Foreign Ministry, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Calviac said that the attack proves that the bombings of
Yugoslavia are not only against military targets, but also civil
ones, adding that the Chinese Embassy did not constitute any
threat to the aggressors.
</P>
<P>
"No explanation of the aggressors could justify or explain away
such an act in a civil zone of the Yugoslav capital," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The attack established a negative precedent in international
relations and posed a threat to the respect for the immunity of
diplomatic missions, established in the Geneva Conventions," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"This precedent," he added, "can mean that in the future, in
any critical situation, any contender may attack a diplomatic
installation with impunity."
</P>
<P>
Expressing his solidarity with the Chinese journalists and the
Chinese people in general, Calviac said, "We share the sadness
over the death of three innocent persons."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was
devastated by three missiles of the U.S.-led NATO. Three Chinese
journalists were killed and more than 20 other embassy staff
members were injured, six seriously.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students in Japan Condemn U.S. Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Chinese students studying
in Japan demonstrated Monday outside the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo,
condemning NATO's missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade at midnight Friday that killed three Chinese journalists
and wounded more than 20 others.
</P>
<P>
Holding high the Chinese national flag and singing the national
anthem, the students demanded a severe punishment of the
perpetrators. They shouted slogans expressing their indignation at
the U.S.-led NATO atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The students delivered a protest letter to the U.S. Embassy,
which said NATO's barbaric act of bombing the Chinese Embassy not
only trampled upon the U.N. Charter and international law and
norms governing international relations but also seriously
infringed upon China's sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the U.S.-led NATO, flaunting the banner of
"humanitarianism," "preserving peace" and "protecting human rights,
" has continued its air strikes against a sovereign state of
Yugoslavia for almost seven weeks. That was a practice of
hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the attack on the Chinese Embassy is a vicious
provocation against the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The students also gave their full support to the Chinese
government's stand on the tragedy and said they would try their
best to help the motherland become a prosperous and powerful
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of overseas Chinese and Chinese students in
Moscow continued their demonstrations outside the U.S. Embassy,
shouting, "We oppose aggression, oppose hegemonism," "The Chinese
people are not to be bullied," "The NATO is doomed to failure!"
The demonstrators delivered a protest letter to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
A larger demonstration against the U.S.-led NATO is planned in
Moscow for the following two days.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) and Uzbekistan held similar protest demonstrations against
the U.S.-led NATO brutality.
</P>
<P>
A protest letter issued by overseas Chinese in the DPRK
condemned NATO's barbaric attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade and held the military bloc fully responsible for the
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese embassy staff and Chinese compatriots working and
studying in Uzbekistan gathered on Monday to denounce NATO's
attack and mourn the victims killed in the NATO attack.

Addressing a joint press conference in Skoplie after meeting

for Europe," he added.

situation.

<P>
KIEV, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Some Ukrainian parliament (The Supreme
Council of Ukraine) officials condemned Monday NATO's attack on
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and voiced support for the
Chinese government's protest to the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the parliament's foreign relations committee
expressed to Xinhua his outrage at the embassy attack. "I don't
believe at all the U.S. and NATO explanation to term their
barbaric act as a 'tragic accident'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the U.S.-led NATO's attack as "super barbaric," he
expressed understanding of the Chinese government's protest and
profound condolence to the three Chinese journalists killed in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Pavlovsky, chairman of the Group for Friendship between
Ukrainian and Chinese Parliament Members, told Xinhua that NATO's
"accidental bombing" came one after another, and even the Chinese
Embassy became its bombing target. The explanation of "an accident
" can hardly sell any more.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support to the Chinese government protest, and
pointed out that the Ukrainian parliament has always condemned
NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia, adding NATO must stop the
bombing and return to the track of a political solution of the
Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S.-led NATO's barbaric bombing on
Yugoslavia proved once again that the U.S. is practicing a dual
standard on human rights and democracy. It preaches democracy in
its own country while imposing sanctions and aggression against
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian News Agency and the Interfax-Ukraine News Agency
also called Xinhua on telephone to condemn NATO's attack on the
Chinese Embassy.
</P>

condolence to the killed Chinese journalists, saying NATO must
bear the responsibility and be punished.

The rise followed a 8 percent or 8.7 percent gain in February.
March's increase was the smallest monthly gain by dollar amount

GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's permanent representative to

missile attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade that killed
three people and injured some 20 others.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Deploy Security Force to Safeguard Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A 62,000-strong security force is
being prepared to safeguard Jakarta during the May 19 to June 5
campaign period, said deputy chief of the Indonesian Police Lieut.
Gen. Nana Permana.
</P>
<P>
"Jakarta will be guarded by a 62,000-strong force which
comprising 12,000 soldiers from the Army, Navy and Air Force;
8,000 policemen; 12,000 militia and 30,000 civilian guards,"
Permana was quoted by The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Their duty includes protecting ballot places and safeguarding
the entire city," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been rocked by a spate of violence since the
downfall of former president Soeharto in May last year. As the
June 7 general elections near, many fear that clashes among party
supporters will mar the campaign period.
</P>
<P>
Under Soeharto's 32 years in power, only three parties were
allowed to contest the elections. This year, 48 parties will take
part in the polls.
</P>
<P>
"We are very serious in safeguarding the city. Our single aim
is to guarantee a successful and safe election. The people have
nothing to worry about -- they don't have to go overseas for
security reasons," Permana said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the use of live bullets will become the final
option in the security drive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jakarta Police Chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman
said his office will involve members of each party's task force in
the citywide security effort in an attempt to prevent clashes
among party supporters.
</P>
<P>
Such clashes have already claimed several lives before
campaigning officially gets under way.
</P>
<P>
He said police will soon sit together with party executives to
arrange campaign routes.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to avoid violence prone areas such as shopping and
housing complexes. We will take stern measures against those
trying to incite unrest," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Washington will send a team of United
States police officers in the next few days to train their
Indonesian counterparts in handling protests.
</P>
<P>
The dispatch was arranged in anticipation of the June 7 general
election, the report said, adding that the U.S. police will also
train Indonesian police on how to improve relations with the
media, political parties and opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Third Most Polluted City in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The level of air pollution in
Jakarta is the third worst in the world after Mexico City and
Bangkok, and experts say it won't be easy to clean up the city's
choking atmosphere, The Indonesian Observer reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jakarta was ranked as the fifth most polluted city in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"The main cause of air pollution in Jakarta is vehicle exhaust
emissions," Jakarta Land Transport Organization Chairman Aip
Syarifuddin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that of more than 3 million vehicles in Jakarta, buses
produce the most pollution.
</P>
<P>
"There are only 100,000 units of public transport in Jakarta,
about three percent of the total vehicles in the city, but the
level of their pollution emissions is very high," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toxic emissions, including carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide,
are extremely dangerous and responsible for most of the air
pollution in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"About 70 percent of the air in the city has been polluted by
the chemical compounds contained in the vehicle emissions. At a
certain level the chemical compounds become poisonous, causing
asthma, cancer, eye irritation, headaches and many other
ailments," he added.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Visit Chinese Embassy to Condemn NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- "We condemn the bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade by NATO," British Parliament Members (
MP) said in a letter delivered to the Chinese Embassy here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A delegation, led by Alice Mahon and Tony Benn, both members in
the House of Commons from the Labour Party, visited the Embassy in
London and delivered the letter.
</P>
<P>
"We ... extend our deepest condolences to the government and
people of the People's Republic of China and to the families of
those killed and injured by NATO's bombs," the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
The attack on last Friday, which NATO said was "a terrible
mistake" and China regards as a deliberate attack, killed three
Chinese journalists in the Chinese Embassy and injured at least 20.
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled that this outrage against China has not led
NATO to reconsider its military intervention and that NATO has
said it will now intensify its bombing campaign which will
inevitably result in more deaths and injuries to innocent people,"
said the letter, which was also signed by another two Labour Party
MPs and one from the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
The MPs said NATO should stop its military actions in
Yugoslavia and let the United Nations in to achieve a political
settlement in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the only way for NATO to show the sincerity of
its apologies would be calling an immediate halt to its bombing
campaign in order to allow negotiations to proceed under the
auspices of the United Nations to seek a peaceful settlement to
the conflict," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Alice Mahon is the Chairwoman of the Committee for Peace in the
Balkans, which staged a number of protests in London after NATO
began to airstrike Yugoslavia six weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet Again Over Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council has agreed to continue consultations on a proposed
presidential statement regarding the NATO missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Security Council President Gabonese Ambassador Denis Dangue
Rewaka said after a two-hour meeting on the matter here Monday
afternoon that the council will meet again sometime later.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not give a date for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council meeting was held at China's request to
debate over a draft presidential statement to condemn the NATO
missile strikes on the Chinese Embassy which left three persons
killed and more than 20 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mission to the U.N. presented the draft statement
early Saturday at the council's formal session called by China to
discuss the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
The proposed statement asks the Security Council to strongly
condemn the attack on the Chinese Embassy, requests NATO and
parties directly involved to bear all responsibilities for the
casualties and property damage it has caused and to bring those
responsible to justice, urges the U.N. Secretary General to
conduct an immediate investigation into this matter and submit a
report before May 14.
</P>
<P>
Before the council met, China's Permanent Representative to the
U.N. Qin Huasun met with Secretary General Kofi Annan to brief him
about the tragedy and China's official stands.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the council session, Ambassador Qin said that the
Security Council has agreed to conduct further consultations on
the China-proposed presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has been
condemned worldwide. The Security Council should make a prompt and
formal reaction to this tragedy," the ambassador urged.
</P>
<P>
He added that most council members are in favor of such a
formal reaction.
</P>
<P>
The council president promised to inform the press as soon as
he works out a timetable.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Ranfeng, spokesman of the Chinese mission,
Ambassador Qin has told Annan that with NATO's bombing continuing,
there could be slim hope for a political solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The missile strike on the Chinese Embassy will inevitably and
adversely affect the efforts seeking a political settlement, Qin
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apology Not Enough: Chinese Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat said
here Monday that U.S. apology was not sufficient for the barbaric
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"So far I have not seen a formal and serious apology, an
official and open apology yet," said Liu Xiaoming, Minister of the
Chinese Embassy in the United States, in an interview with the CNN.
</P>
<P>
Liu said apology included many things, "not just say we are
sorry. It happened, then shirk responsibility and blame others."
</P>
<P>
He said apology should include why it happened and what U.S.-
led NATO is going to do with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do with those people who are responsible
for firing the missiles?" he said, "what are you going to do next?
"
</P>
<P>
"It's not simply to say I'm sorry. That's not enough. And
Chinese people could not accept that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton made an apology
gesture to China, saying that "I apologize, I regret that."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the gesture at the opening of a meeting on school
violence at the White House, without touching on the investigation
of the incident and punishment of those responsible for the
barbaric attack.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO wantonly used missiles to attack the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade at midnight Friday, killing three people and
injuring more than 20 others. The embassy building was devastated.
</P>
<P>
The atrocity has generated the strongest protest and
indignation in China. But the NATO officials claimed that it was "
a mistake" caused by an outdated map and put the blame on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tan Jiaxuan on Monday put forward four
requirements to the U.S.-led NATO -- an open and official apology,
a complete and thorough investigation, prompt publication of the
detailed results of the investigation and severe punishment of
those responsible for the attack.

<HEADLINE> European Chinese Denounce NATO Attacks on Chinese Embassy in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Federation of Chinese
Organizations sent letters on Monday to Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the U.N. Security
Council, expressing strong indignation at NATO's raids on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the letter to Jiang, the federation, representing two
million Chinese living in Europe, denounced NATO's attack as a
gross violation of the Chinese sovereignty and serious provocation
of all the Chinese people, including those overseas.
</P>
<P>
It expressed firm support for the solemn statement by the
Chinese government on the issue and opposition to all aggressive
acts, lodging stern condemnation and the strongest protests to
NATO's barbaric violence.
</P>
<P>
The European Chinese, although far away from their motherland,
have inseparable bounds with China and are closely following every
development of the issue, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In the open letters to Annan and the Security Council, the
federation called for early U.N. action to stop NATO bombing and
its evil war and to take forceful measures to make NATO take up
all responsibilities of its attack on the Chinese Embassy,
including formal apology to the Chinese government and people,
punishing murderers and compensation for the losses.
</P>
<P>
The federation also sent protest letters to U.S. embassies in
several European countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Federation of Chinese Organization was established
in the Netherlands in 1992 and elected a Hungarian Chinese, Zhang
Manxin, its chairman at its sixth annual meeting here in August
1998.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Clash in Dili, East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- At least four people died and eight
sustained bullet wounds and slashes from sharp weapons in clashes
on Sunday and Monday in Dili, capital of East Timor, according to
reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It was not true that more than 10 were killed during the
clashes between pro-independence and pro-integration youth groups
as reported by foreign media, they merely exaggerated the
fatalities," East Timor Police Chief Timbul Silaen was quoted by
Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incident, apparently sparked by a dispute over gambling,
occurred in Dili's Mercado Lama market and was the first of its
kind between the two sides since a deal on direct vote was signed
in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between pro-independence forces and pro-integration
groups have been on the rise for several months ever since
Indonesia abruptly announced in January that it would grant the
territory independence if the population rejects its offer on
wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement between Indonesia and Portugal
signed on May 5, the approximately 800,000 East Timorese people
are facing a direct vote scheduled for August 8 to decide their
own future.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulated that if the East Timorese accept the
wide-ranging autonomy package, the Indonesian youngest province
would remain as such but with a wide-ranging autonomy, but if they
reject the package, the Indonesian government will release East
Timor as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas
Monday warned that failure to prevent continued violence in East
Timor might result in mounting pressure from Portugal and other
Western countries for the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces,
and even the delay of a direct vote.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that we show to the world, especially to
the U.N., that we can uphold security and order," he said after
meeting with President B.J. Habibie.

<P>
HAVANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the Cuba-China
Friendship Association Moses Sio Wong on Monday strongly condemned
NATO's missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Sio Wong said the U.S.
explanation of an intelligence error causing the attack, which
left three killed and over 20 injured, is absolutely unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"It was an attack and there was ferocity in this barbarous
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cuban government's position before the U.N.
Security Council regarding the issue was a complete rejection to
the attack by the U.S.-led NATO, calling it a "genocide and
aggression, not an accident."
</P>
<P>
"In addition to stepping up their bombings against Yugoslav
territory, they have now committed this crime against an embassy
in clear violation of all the norms of international rights and
the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"The Cuba-China Friendship Association joins the wave of
indignation and condemnation of this vandalic attack and supports
the Chinese nation in its demonstrations denouncing the crime,"

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippines' 91-day treasury bill
rate, the benchmark interest rate, dropped to a single-digit level
Monday following a three-month consecutive decline of inflation
rate, Malaya reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the rate hit its 25-month low at
9.974 percent, representing a minimal 7.7 basis point drop from
the previous week's 10.051 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The 182-day t-bill rate also noted a 13.7 basis point decline
to 10.450 percent from 10.587 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the Bureau of Treasury had rejected all of the applications
for the 364-day term bills to prevent an upward movement in the
rate, however slight.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the rate decline to the improving market
conditions. Just last week, the inflation figure for April dropped
to 8 percent from 8.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank reduced its overnight borrowing and
lending rates by 12.5 basis points to 10.125 percent and 12.125
percent, respectively.

GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The world volleyball federation (
FIVB) said in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday that an Italian
player will be banned for doping if his federation fails to prove
his high level of epitestosterone in the World Championships was
natural.
</P>
<P>
FIVB President Ruben Acosta said it would not forfeit one of
the Italy's victories that led to its third straight world
championships even if Simone Rosalba is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Acosta said FIVB's medical commission would meet in Lausanne on
May 25 with the Italian federation, FIPAV, to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
Both samples of Rosalba, a substitute in the World

epitestosterone which is a chemical related to the performance-
enhancing male hormone testosterone after the team's quarterfinal
victory over the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
FIVB had confirmed at its annual meeting last week that in the
future a team would lose any match if one of its players was found

<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not bid for the 2006
World Cup and will instead support South Africa to win the hosting
right, sports minister Emeka Omeruah said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after "representations were made to
Nigeria by the government and people of South Africa on the need
for Africa to present a formidable and common candidate for the
2006 World Cup," said Omeruah.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Nigeria was one of five African countries bidding
to host the world's soccer gala, along with Egypt, Ghana, Morocco
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ghana pulled out and announced support for the
South African bid.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has the stadia and hotels needed for a
major sports tournament, is the favourite among African countries
to host the event.
</P>
<P>
But it is expected to face stiff competition from Germany,
England and Brazil which are also bidding to host the event.

<HEADLINE> China Begins to Defend Sudirman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China set off its way to defend
the title of the Sudirman Cup mixed team championship on Monday
with a 4-1 victory over Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In a group one match of the first category, the Chinese
shuttlers, led by Sun Jun, world champion in men's singles event
two years ago, had easy victories in the men's and women's singles,
mixed doubles and women's doubles before conceding the men's
doubles to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
In the mixed doubles, Ge Fei and Zhang Jun, a trial pair for
the first time, gave China the first point when they whitewashed
Chan Chong Ming and Ang Li Peng 15-2 and 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team heach coach Li Yongbo was satisfied with the duo,
saying that they had played to his satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Ge Fei's regular partner has been Liu Yong, with whom Ge won
the event at the last world championships in Glasgow, Scotland in
1997.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's singles, Gong Zhichao met no challenge
from little-known Woon Sze Mei, winning the match at an identical
score of 11-1.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun established China's victory in the men's singles,
beating Chew Choon Eng 15-7, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
In the consolation match of the women's doubles, Huang Nanyan
and Yang Wei, who are at the top position in the world rankings,
edged Lim Pek Siah and Joanne Quay at 15-8, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
However, the Malaysians filed a warning in the men's doubles,
defeating China's Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei 15-9 and 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, who once dominated the men's doubles in the eighties
with his current assistant Tian Bingyi, contributed the victory to
Malaysians' reservation of the lines-up Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"They did not send their best players in the first match," Li
said. "The Malaysians are still contenders for the championship."
</P>
<P>
"But no matter what other do, we will do our best in the match,
and try hard to win the trophy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudirman Cup mixed team championship is divided into seven
categories, with six teams in the first category vying for the
title.
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the first category are Denmark, South Korea,
Indonesia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
A total of 51 teams are partaking in the Sudirman Cup, which
will end on May 16.

<P>
OSLO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic snapped Sweden's 15-
game unbeaten streak in the World Hockey Championships, beating
the defending champions 2-0 Monday to secure the last semifinal
berth.
</P>
<P>
Martin Prochazka and Viktor Ujcik scored second-period goals
for the Czechs, who needed a victory to overtake Russia in the
quarterfinal-round standings.
</P>
<P>
Since losing to Canada in 1997 in Finland, the Swedes had 14
victories and a tie in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic topped its quarterfinal group standings
ahead of Sweden, which had already qualified for the final four.
The Czechs will play Canada in the semifinals starting Wednesday
in Lillehammer, while Sweden will face Finland.
</P>
<P>
Finland handed Canada its first defeat in the tournament,
winning 4-2 in Hamar to clinch first place in the other
quarterfinal group.
</P>
<P>
In Hamar, Matt Cullen and Mike Mottau each had a goal and an
assist to lift the United States to a 3-0 victory over Switzerland,
and to sixth place in the tournament rankings.
</P>
<P>
The victory landed the Americans behind fifth-place Russia, and
ahead of Slovakia in the tournament standings.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Petrenko scored a goal in the third period and Ravil
Gusmanov added a power-play tally as Russia rallied to tie
Slovakia 2-2 in the early game in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Zdeno Chara and Marian Hossa scored for Slovakia in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
In a rematch of the Olympic bronze-medal game, the Finns came
out on top again, defeating the Canadians 4-2 in Hamar to remain
undefeated in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Jere Karalahti scored twice to hand the Finns the victory which
marked Canada's first loss at the tournament, though the outcome
served only to determine the semifinal pairings.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Meets on NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- At the request of the
Chinese Mission to the United Nations, the United Nations Security
Council is meeting late Monday afternoon on NATO's attack against
Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press before attending the Council meeting,
Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations, Qin Huasun, said "Now it
is clear that U.S.-led NATO did launch missile attack on Chinese
embassy in Belgrade. This is a blatant encroachment on the
sovereignty of a UN Member State and trampling on the UN Charter
and basic norms of international law."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador reiterated Chinese Government's requests to the
U.S.-led NATO:
</P>
<P>
-- To make an open and official apology to the Chinese
Government, the Chinese people, and relatives of the Chinese
victims;
</P>
<P>
-- To carry out a complete and through investigation of NATO's
missile attack on China's embassy in Belgrade;
</P>
<P>
-- To make public promptly the detailed results of the
investigation;
</P>
<P>
-- to severely punish those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Qin once again called upon NATO to stop immediately its
military strikes against the sovereign state of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, so as to create a conducive atmosphere for
a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"Anything short of that, it is impossible for the United
Nations Security Council to discuss any plan to solve the
problem," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Council is now discuss a draft presidential statement
proposed by China, which condemns NATO's barbaric attack of the
Chinese embassy.

BRUSSELS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in Belgium
gathered here on Monday to condemn NATO's barbaric attack of the
Chinese embassy to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The overseas Chinese said in a protest letter that they were
shocked by the NATO atrocity when they heard that the US-led
military organization attacked the Chinese embassy during air war
against Yugoslavia at the midnight on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Such a criminal act hurted seriously the dignity of all Chinese
in the world, they said. "We strongly condemn the atrocity of the
US-led NATO and urge the alliance take full responsibility of the
tragedy," the Chinese in Belgium said.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the NATO and the Yugoslav government to
seek a diplomatic way to reach political settlement in order to
peacefully and completely solve the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We express our heartfelt condolences to those victims in
NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia, and also express our sincere
sympathies for the families of the deceased," the overseas Chinese

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Urges Probe into NATO's Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
on Monday said that he saw the need for an investigation into the
circumstances which led to the missile attack of the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade by NATO.
</P>
<P>
In a phone conversation with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, the EU duty president, D'Alema said that, aside from
the formal expressions of regret for the incident at the night of
May 7 and the apologies made to Chinese authorities, the Atlantic
Alliance was obliged to carried out an in-depth investigation into
the circumstances which lead to the attack.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the premier's office added that it was the
D'Alema's view that it would be extremely serious, for the
Alliance itself, if NATO's reaction was limited to its initial
justification and world public opinion was not offered by the
utmost transparency on the causes of the attack.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema went on to add that this was necessary also to avoid
any repetition of these conditions and to not compromise the
efforts underway for a political-diplomatic solution to the crisis
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said he will remain in close contact with Schroeder, in
view of his planned mission to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Killing of Chinese Journalists Concerned by IFJ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS May 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Journalists (IFJ) expressed on Monday their concern that three
Chinese journalists were killed when NATO attacked the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Shao Yunhuan of Xinhua News Agency, Xu Xinghu and Zhuying of
Guangming Daily were all in the Chinese embassy at the time it was
hit, the IFJ said in a statement. "We certainly extend our
sympathies very much to our colleagues in China and to the
families of the victims at the Chinese embassy," Aidan White,
General Secretary of the IFJ, told Xinhua at an interview.
</P>
<P>
"When the attack of the Chinese embassy took place, like other
organizations we are very surprised at what had happened," he said.
"But really it was for us a blow to discover that once again it
was journalists who in the wrong place and in the wrong time in
this particular case," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It really is for us quite horrifying that journalists and
media workers themselves are already figuring extensively in the
list of casualties of specific groups hit by the bombing so far,"
the IFJ chief added.
</P>
<P>
"It was a terrible tragedy incident and we hope that it won't
be repeated, anything that can be done to avoid civilian casualties
and particularly to avoid casualties to media workers and
journalists as far as we are concerned, it is extremely important,"
Mr. White said.
</P>
<P>
"The three journalists were in the embassy because they
considered it to be the safest place for them in Belgrade. It is a
tragedy that once again it is journalists and media staff who are
among the victims of this conflict," the IFJ General Secretary
said.
</P>
<P>
"These deaths illustrate the risks that all journalists
covering this conflict are running. No matter where they think
they may be safe, there is no telling which building may be hit
next," White said here in Brussels, where the IFJ is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Journalists is the largest
journalists' organization in the world, representing more than
450,000 journalists in 100 countries.

<HEADLINE> Italy Views Yugoslavia's Forces Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's announced intention to
withdraw Serb and Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo is a positive
development but remains insufficient, the office of Italian
Premier Massimo D'Alema said here Monday evening in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade announced Monday afternoon that the withdrawal had
already begun and operations against the Kosovo Liberation Army
had been concluded.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was welcomed by the West countries, but there
was some skepticism and the general approach of the international
community remains that of wait-and-see.
</P>
<P>
The statement from D'Alema's office said that "The news given
by the Yugoslav military concerning the start of the withdrawal of
Serb forces in Kosovo needs to be confirmed by facts, and clearer
elements are thus necessary in order to judge the true intentions
of the Belgrade government."
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope," the statement concluded, "that this
announcement will be followed and verified by other acts which
will allow for the suspension of military action, which is in line
with the political and diplomatic action in progress which has
Italy's full support."
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time, however, that Belgrade has made
such an announcement since the NATO campaign began 47 days ago.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, in fact, the Yugoslav government announced that all
military actions against the KLA had stopped, in time for the
orthodox Easter holidays, and that negotiations had begun with
moderate Kosovar leader Ibrahim Rugova for a political solution.
