<HEADLINE> British PM Blair Welcomes New IRA Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
welcomed here today the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) new
ceasefire, saying it would build a "new mood of hope for peace and
a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
The IRA guerillas, fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, announced this morning that it would implement an
"unequivocal" ceasefire from noon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blair said in a statement issued this afternoon: "I welcome
today's announcement which is good for the people of Northern
Ireland and for the people of Britain."
</P>
<P>
"Following the continuing loyalist ceasefire and the courageous
Orange Order decisions (cancelling planned marches) last week,
this can build on a new mood of hope for peace and a lasting
political settlement in Northern Ireland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also made it clear that the British government wanted to
see whether the new IRA truce was genuine before Sinn Fein, the
political wing of IRA, could be allowed to attend the all-party
peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we will want to assess the ceasefire with great
care. What we and others want to see is an end to violence for
good and an irrevocable commitment to peaceful means," he said.

<HEADLINE> Flour Smuggling Reduces Zambians' Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of jobs in the milling
industry of Zambia are being wiped out yearly through flour
smuggling, the government has been told.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Daily Mail today quoted National Milling Company
managing director Dawie Fourie as complaining that businessmen
from South Africa and Zimbabwe are trafficking huge quantities of
flour into Zambia without paying tax as they claim that the goods
are destined for the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot smuggling going on through the Chirundu
border. Traders from the south bring in a lot of subsidized flour
and evade tax by cheating that they were taking it to Congo,+ he
told Labor Minister Peter Machungwa recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the newly privatized National Milling Company has the
capacity to buy over 90 percent of the wheat grown in Zambia but
its ability is hampered by competition from the cheaper products
from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
His company has put its own workers at Chirundu in southeast
Zambia to see how many truck loads of flour get through and they
have found that huge quantities come in without duty and in the
process get off loaded in Zambia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The director suggested that all traders should be made to pay
deposit customs duty at Chirundu and when they reach another
border post to enter Zaire, they should be refunded to ensure
that there is no cheating.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa assured him that his ministry will move to secure
jobs for Zambians.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Ends Peace Talks with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the Bangladeshi
government and tribal rebels, which began on Monday, ended today
without formulating a draft peace agreement to end the
long-standing insurgency in the southern Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT).
</P>
<P>
However, Chief Whip Hasnat Abdullah, who led the government
delegation, told reporters that "the on-going process to prepare a
draft treaty is satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Tribal leader Shantu Larma, chairman of the Parbatya Chattagram
Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), said he does not want to say
anything at this stage.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth round of talks under the present government.
Both sides announced during the last round of talks in May that
they would sign a peace treaty soon.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process received a severe jolt when differences
of opinion surfaced among the top leadership of the PCJSS, which
has struggled for about two decades for self-rule in the
resources-rich CHT.
</P>
<P>
During the just-ended talks, according to informed sources, the
PCJSS were pressing hard for total authority, instead of partial
authority as had been proposed earlier.
</P>
<P>
The sources said both sides were also yet to resolve their
differences on some other key issues, including the involvement of
the United Nations in the repatriation of the tribal refugees in
Tripura of India.
</P>
<P>
The schedule of the next rounds of talks would be fixed with
the consent of the two sides through a liaison committee, the
sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 19 (Xinhua) -- King of Jordan Hussein and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak are keen to put the stalled Middle East
peace process back on track, a senior Jordanian official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe made the remarks during a regular press conference, in
response to questions about the summit between the two leaders
in the near future, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were always exchanging visits and consulting
each other on the peace process, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
He did not give further details about the upcoming summit
between Hussein and Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt have been trying to overcome the obstacles
facing the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and this was part of
the Arab efforts to help the Palestinians regain their
legitimate rights on their national soil, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mutawe disclosed that Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali will meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
Sunday in the West Bank to boost coordination in the peace
efforts and review ways to break the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are also expected to sign a health agreement, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan mediated the Hebron accord between Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority in January this year, which
was considered a major breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, later in March, Israel declared to build the Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem, thus stalling the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
From March till now, efforts by the United States and Egypt to
reactivate the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks failed due to
Israeli government's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are the only two countries in the Arab world
that have signed peace treaties with Israel.

<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Assistant Secretary
General Ahmed Bin Hali said that an imminent meeting is expected
to be held in Mogadishu between Somali faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
The projected meeting is to discuss means of pushing forward
efforts that aim at holding an overall and expanded national
reconciliation conference including all Somali conflicting
factions, said Hali who is in charge of Somalia issue in the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by leader of the Somali Salvation
Alliance Ali Mahdi Mohamed and leader of the Somali Congress Party
Hussein Farah Aideed, together with a number of Somali National
Salvation Council leaders.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders signed a reconciliation agreement in Cairo on
May 29 on holding peaceful talks to end the civil war that has
ravaged the country since 1991. Egypt has been involved in
mediating an end to the crisis in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League will pursue efforts that aim at making
mediation between various Somali factions a success, he was quoted
by the Egyptian MENA news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Somali National Salvation Council will shortly
make a tour of a number of Arab countries and states concerned
with the Somali crisis to gain support for their plan that aims at
achieving Somali reconciliation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is currently coordinating efforts with the UN
and the Organization of African Unity as well as major countries
in the area such as Egypt and Ethiopia to activate the Somali
reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late president Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several unsuccessful peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

ravaged the country since 1991. Egypt has been involved in
mediating an end to the crisis in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League will pursue efforts that aim at making
mediation between various Somali factions a success, he was quoted
by the Egyptian MENA news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Somali National Salvation Council will shortly
make a tour of a number of Arab countries and states concerned
with the Somali crisis to gain support for their plan that aims at
achieving Somali reconciliation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League is currently coordinating efforts with the UN
and the Organization of African Unity as well as major countries
in the area such as Egypt and Ethiopia to activate the Somali
reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late president Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several unsuccessful peace conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Pledges to Work for Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides has reiterated his government's desire for a solution
to the Cyprus problem the soonest possible.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the people of Cyprus, broadcasted this
evening, on the occasion of the coup staged by the Greek
military junta on July 15, 1974 and the Turkish invasion that
followed five days later, Clerides described these "tragic
events" as "the darkest periods of Cyprus' history."
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the conclusions of these tragic events
concerns the relations between the Greek and Turkish
communities in the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that the two communities must envisage and
plan a common future, noting that "as we enter the 21st century,
we must abandon the mentality and practices which have brought
about so many ills to Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He said a fair solution must be found, which will heal the
wound of the past and establish a climate of confidence, mutual
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the Greek Cypriot side has shown
"goodwill and made painful concessions" during the past 23
years.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also showed a positive attitude during
the U.N.-led direct negotiations between himself and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, held in the U.S. on July 9-12, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clerides stressed that his government will show the same
attitude in the second round of negotiations, scheduled to be
held in Switzerland on August 11-16, saying that "our ferment
desire is to achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem the
soonest possible."
</P>
<P>
"We all hope that the process that has already started may be
the starting point of an unprecedented effort to find a
solution," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the government policy that has attracted
international involvement in the Cyprus issue has increased hopes
for finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
Clerides assured that he will devote all his energy "to
ensure that this course may have the desirable conclusion to the
benefit of the two communities."
</P>
<P>
However, He stressed that he will not accept a solution "that
will not safeguard the future of Greek Cypriots, whatever the
price we may have to pay for our stand."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since the island was
divided following the Turkish invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite this
Mediterranean island nation as a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation
through peace talks, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Carter Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- As Liberians turned out in droves
to vote in the war-ravaged country's landmark election today,
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has called on the west
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) to leave the country shortly after
election.
</P>
<P>
According to Carter, the planned stay of ECOMOG in Liberia for
another six months after the installation of a new democratic
government in August may no longer be feasible, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu
in the capital Monrovia on Friday, Carter said, "prevailing
circumstances" had necessitated a review of the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He planned to discuss it with General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's
head of state and current chairman of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), which sent the peace-keepers to
Liberia in the heat of the country's factional fighting in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Malu, however, said that ECOMOG's stay might have to be
extended as it had not started training Liberian armed forces and
national police to which the task of consolidating ECOMOG'S gains
on security would be bequeathed.
</P>
<P>
This mission of ECOMOG is included in the revised Abuja peace
accord signed last August to put an end to Liberia's civil war
and bring in place an elected government at last.
</P>
<P>
"Even from that point alone, I don't think the issue of
leaving Liberia six months after a new government is put in place
would be there," Malu explained.
</P>
<P>
The force commander, who noted that the mission was a strain
on the finances of ECOWAS member countries, did not give reasons
why the training had not begun but assured it was a prerequisite
for ECOMOG leaving Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Malu disclosed that the officer corps would be trained in west
African countries with appropriate training institutions, citing
Nigeria and Ghana, while those trained in 1989 would be trained
as trainers together with ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that we are going to restructure the armed
forces and police to the level determined to be detribalized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that ECOMOG intends to train an army of about
4,000 and a police force of about 5,000 to cope with challenges
of post-ECOMOG Liberia.
</P>
<P>
After about seven years of operations, ECOMOG has succeeded in
disarming and demobilizing Liberia's warring factions, ensuring
security and an environment favorable for today's presidential
and legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
The first results of the elections, which began early this
morning, are expected to come out tomorrow while final results
are expected by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
Liberians, some of whom went to polling centers for voting in
the midnight, are reported queuing quietly in today's election
watched by ECOMOG and international monitors, including Carter.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 presidential candidates, former warlord Charles
Taylor of the National Patriotic Party and Mrs. Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf are seen as the most hopeful.
Liberians will also elect for a 90-member parliament.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes IRA Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today welcomed the decision of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to
restore a cease-fire in the British province of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said that on the basis of the
announcement his government will work with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, to reach a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. will "strongly support those who
take risks" for peace, praising the leadership of both Sinn Fein
and the pro- British loyalists who have sought to quell attacks on
the part of their respective armed militias.
</P>
<P>
"This declaration, which we expect to be implemented
unequivocally and permanently, can open the door to inclusive
negotiations to achieve a just and lasting settlement," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the IRA announced a new truce in its 28-year war
against British rule in Northern Ireland. It was to take effect at
midday on Sunday and allow its Sinn Fein spokesmen a seat at peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"This is a moment of great possibility," Clinton said. "The
United States will work closely with the two governments and the
political parties to build on this historic opportunity," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has put Northern Ireland high on his
diplomatic agenda and in December 1995 became the first American
president to visit the troubled province.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been excluded from the peace talks on Northern
Ireland since the IRA suspended a ceasefire more than one year
ago. and the newly-offered truce will pave the way for the party
to participate the all-party talks.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Meets With Senior Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
this evening met with Nabil Shaath, minister of planning and
international cooperation at the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA), to review the latest efforts to break the peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The two sides took up the Egyptian-American-Palestinian efforts
for salvaging the Mideast peace process, Shaath said after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is in a difficult time and moving very
slowly while the Israeli government sticks to its obstinate
stance," said the Palestinian chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official who arrived here this morning reviewed
the fresh Egyptian bid to reactive the stalled peace process
during the past week, which brought together the Palestinian and
Israeli sides under Egyptian auspices.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Ambassador to Tel Aviv Mohammed Bassiouni met Thursday
with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, in a fresh effort to
break the four-month-old Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He also hosted a meeting between Shaath and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to narrow their difference concerning
the building of an airport in Gaza to serve the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shaath urged Israel to abide by the signed accords with the
Palestinians and speed up the implementation of their agreement on
the Gaza international airport.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace march slid into a crisis with
violence renewing in West Bank and Gaza, after Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave orders in March to build
thousands of Jewish homes at a East Jerusalem hillside.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hold that the peace crisis was a result of
Israel's settlement building while Israel repeatedly charged that
Palestinian violence was the main obstacle to progress in
peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Egypt stepped in as a main mediator for peace between Israel
and Palestinians after the U.S., a key sponsor of the Mideast peace
talks, has lowered its mediation profile.

<HEADLINE> Serb President Plavsic Expelled from Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Biljana
Plavsic was expelled from the ruling Serb Democratic Party (SDS)
at the party's executive committee session at Saturday night, a
SDS communique, released today in Serb capital Pale, said.
</P>
<P>
The party also demanded Plavsic to step down from office and
transfer her authorities to Vice-President Dragoljub Mirjanic.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five of the 84 committee members attended the overnight
session and voted unanimously to expel Plavsic from the party and
release her from all her duties as a committee member.
</P>
<P>
The communique gave the reasons of Plavsic's expulsion, saying
that was because she "betrayed" the ruling party and the state
authorities, adopted some measures that "violated the Dayton Peace
Accord and the Serb constitution" and "defamed" leaders of the
party and the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic's expulsion is the latest outcome of the waging power
struggle within the SDS and the Republika Srpska (RS), which went
open on June 28 when President Plavsic dismissed the Interior
Minister Dragan Kijac in the name of inefficiency on crime
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Her daring move triggered angers from the government, which
announced her decision "against the constitution".
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the ruling SDS held an executive committee meeting,
calling on the parliament to remove Plavsic from office. But two
days later, Plavsic dissolved the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament responded on July 4 by announcing Plavsic's
decision "against the constitution" and threatened to dismiss her
from her post if she does not withdraw her decision.
</P>
<P>
As the struggle went fiercer, Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb
member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic held talks with Plavsic and wanted to mediate
between the rival sides.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts to persuade Plavsic to take back her decision of
dissolving the parliament ended in vain as the tough lady
resolutely turned down their suggestions.
</P>
<P>
As Plavsic was elected president in September 1996 as the
candidate of the SDS, she is now very likely be removed from the
highest place of the RS if she ignores SDS's decision of expulsion
and insists not to resign.

<HEADLINE> Significant Sea Transportation Solution Between HK, Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A signed article titled, "The
Significance and Enlightenment of the Solution to the Issue on Sea
Transportation between Hong Kong and Taiwan after 1997", carried
by the latest issue of the journal "Relations across the Straits",
says that the pragmatic settlement to the problem conforms both to
the one-China principle and the interests of compatriots in Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The smooth settlement of the issue of sea transportation is
beneficial to economic development and exchanges between Hong Kong
and Taiwan, the article says, and will play a role in showing the
way to developing direct shipping services across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that on May 2 and 24, 1997 the Federation of
Hong Kong Shipowners and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchanges
Foundation exchanged views in Hong Kong and Taibei and reached an
understanding over the issue concerning flying of flags when ships
from both sides navigate between or enter each other's ports, and
the Summary Of Negotiations On Sea Transportation Between Hong
Kong and Taiwan was inked as a result.
</P>
<P>
The summary rules that after July 1, 1997 "Hong Kong-registered
commercial ships will fly only the regional flag of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) on the stern flagpole during
the period when they enter and exit Taiwan ports, and the flying
of flags from the main mast will be suspended pending further
consultation". Also, "Taiwan-registered commercial ships will fly
no flags temporarily on either the stern flagpole or the main mast

The Summary of Negotiations has been examined and affirmed by
the mainland's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits
and the Straits Exchanges Foundation, and officially went into
effect on July 1.

<HEADLINE> Significant Solution to Sea Transportation Between HK, Taiwan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The settlement of the sea transportation issue between Hong
Kong and Taiwan after 1997 has drawn strong repercussions in the
two places, the article says. The majority opinion of shipping
circles in the two places holds that the sea transportation
between Hong Kong and Taiwan remains unblocked after 1997 and this
is of great significance for the economic development of both Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The consultation on technical problems and the signing of the
summary reflected the principle of pragmatic practice and mutual
benefit, which complies with the interests of all parties
concerned. The Taiwan-based newspapers have spoken highly of the
negotiations, considering them successful and noting that smooth
navigation between Hong Kong and Taiwan ensures some 30 billion US
dollars-worth of annual trade between them.
</P>
<P>
The smooth solution to the sea transportation issue between
Hong Kong and Taiwan will play an exemplary and demonstrative role
in promoting direct shipping services between the motherland and
Taiwan in the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
First, the continuation of direct shipping between Hong Kong
and Taiwan has paved the way for realization of direct shipping
services across the Taiwan Straits. Since the return of Hong Kong
to the motherland this year, relations between Hong Kong and
Taiwan have become a special part of the relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits. The people-to-people exchanges
between Hong Kong and Taiwan will be maintained and developed on
the basis of observing the Basic Law and the principle of One
China.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on Economic Development of Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua,
addressing an economic symposium marking the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region today,
stressed the need for the country's ethnic-minority regions to
focus on economic development.
</P>
<P>
Zou, who is heading a central government delegation to attend
the region's anniversary celebrations here, said at the symposium
that Inner Mongolia should stick to the basic line of seizing
opportunities, deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside
world, promoting development and maintaining stability, so as to
push for overall economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years fundamental changes have occured in
Inner Mongolia's economy, society and people's life. Since the
implementation of the reform and open policy in 1979 particularly,
the region has witnessed its most rapid and best development
period, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
The annual economic growth rate has averaged 9.7 percent in the
past 18 years in the region, making it reach the target of
re-doubling its gross domestic product (GDP) of 1980 five years
ahead of schedule, the vice-premier said, calling this "marvelous
progress."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the success to the efforts of the region's people
of all ethnic groups, different levels of party committees and
governments, which have given top priority to developing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Experience has shown that the modernization of ethnic-minority
regions cannot be separated from that of the country and the
nation as a whole, Zou noted.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-minority regions should unswervingly adhere to economic
construction as the central task, and all efforts should serve
this center, he stressed. Quoting a theory of Deng Xiaoping, Zou
said that anything that benefits the development of productive
forces should be adhered to; otherwise, it ought to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Also, the vice-premier urged Inner Mongolia to pay more
attention to the market in developing the local economy, and to
expand local advantages, intensify regional cooperation, promote
economic development with science and technology, and walk on a
road of sustainable development.

<P>
Direct shipping between Hong Kong and Taiwan will become a
component part of direct shipping between the motherland and
Taiwan. With further growth of economic, trade and cultural
exchanges between the motherland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the
partial direct shipping will be extended from Hong Kong to other
parts of Taiwan and the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the consultation over the technical issues of sea
transportation between Hong Kong and Taiwan after 1997 has
provided a model for the settlement of the relevant problems
existing in the upcoming direct shipping services between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that the One China principle is the basis
for maintaining and developing relations between Hong Kong and
Taiwan after 1997. As far as sea transportation is concerned, that
between the Hong Kong and Taiwan will remain unblocked providing
that the problem of Two Chinas or One China, One Taiwan does not
complicate the flag issue.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the signing of the Summary of
Negotiations On Sea Transportation Between Hong Kong And Taiwan
fully reflected the sincerity, mutual respect, consultation on an
equal footing and pragmatism of the two sides. It has provided a
good example for resolving the issue of flags for direct shipping
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will provide reference for the settlement of
the relevant technical problems in comprehensive direct shipping
services between the mainland and Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government, Rebels Exchange POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Tajik government and the rebels
today exchanged another group of 97 prisoners of war and ended the
first round of exchange which started on Friday, said a report
from the Tajik capital of Dushambe.
</P>
<P>
The government released 48 POWs, and the rebels, in return,
sent back 49, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exchange was carried out under the landmark peace accord
the Tajik government and the rebels signed in Moscow last month,
which ended the tiny central Asian country's four-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, a total of 100 POWs, 50 from each
side, should be released during the exchange on July 18-20.
</P>
<P>
Tajik government explained that three more POWs, two from the
government side and one from the rebels, would be released in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
A group of international observers supervised the
exchange. They praised the smooth exchange and said it not only
showed the two sides' determination to fully carry out their peace
agreement but also enhanced mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that the government and the rebels reached
agreement on the next round of POWs exchange.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts among different political, religious and ethnic
groups intensified in Tajikistan since the country gained
independence in September 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
Islamic opposition forces, the main rival of the Tajik
government, set up bases in mountainous border areas between
Tajikistan and Afghanistan and launched a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale fighting ended after the Tajik government and the
opposition forces signed a truce in December 1996, but sporadic
clashes continued until the two sides signed peace accord in
June. By then, the rebels held a total of 256 government
soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 20 (Xinhua)- Sierra Leone junta delegation
attending mediation talks with four foreign ministers of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) returned here
Saturday with agreement to solve the country's political impasse
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The 13 member delegation led by the junta's Foreign Secretary
Paolo Bangura had a two-day initial talks in Abidjan in which a
four-point agreement was reached, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resolved that "all crises should be solved
peacefully, all hostilities cease with immediate effect that all
sides should work for an early restoration of constitutional
order and to give time to the junta delegation to report back to
military leader, Major Johnny Paul Koroma and reconvene the talks
in Abidjan on July 25."
</P>
<P>
In the Sierra Leone capital Saturday, hundred of people
welcome the decisions reached so far at the talks, assessing it
as a high degree looming on the horizon."
</P>
<P>
Military officers called the accord "a good beginning for
peace between Sierra Leone soldiers and a contingent of Nigerian
troops which have repeatedly clashed over the past two weeks at
the international airport and a major highway east of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
"We can not look forward to the Nigerians lifting their
blockade of the main highway, 20 miles from the capital which
leads to the interior", one soldier said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians blocked the highway after a conflict last
weekend which left some 60 people, mainly civilians dead.
</P>
<P>
The news of the talks, which is the first with any foreign
group since the junta came into power seven weeks ago, was
welcomed with relief in Bo in the south where an independent FM
station interrupted its regular programs to play victory songs.
</P>
<P>
In both Kenema and Kono in the east, marchers snake-danced at
the court halls in celebrations. The State radio also welcomed
the decisions as "a positive development".

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Roberto Rios of Real Betis set the
highest transfer-record of two billion pesetas (13.5 million
U.S. dollars) in Spain to Athletic Bilbao, Spanish newspapers
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rios, 26, had played for Real Betis since 1992, capturing seven
caps to his name.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United earlier in the year offered a bid of 10.5
million U.S. dollars for the Spanish international defender, but
this offer was turned down.
</P>
<P>
Rios, however, was not the most expensive player signings made
by Spainsh clubs. Juninho tops the list as he moved from
Middlesbrough to Atletico Madrid with a record of 19.5 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Christian Vieri was the second most expensive player after his
transfering from Juventus to Atletico Madrid with 17.5 million
U.S. dollars. Rios is the third.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid's two Spanish international goalkeepers Francisco
Buyo and Jose Canizares are also transfer listed. Buyo is the
target of Rayo Vallecano and Mexican club Atletico Celya. He has
won seven Spanish caps during the 11 seasons in Real Madrid and 6
seasons with Sevilla.
</P>
<P>
Canizares leaves the Real for the coming of Pedro Contreras
from Rayo Vallecano. He manages to acquire nine caps.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cracks Down on Government Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it is
setting up a special court to deal further with rampant
governmental corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language evening paper Kayhan reported that both
the parliament and judiciary have taken up measures to fight
against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Judicial chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said "Signing of
unfair contracts, issuance of fake permits and some illegal
privatization cases in factories and firms will be given high
priority in this court."
</P>
<P>
Yazdi's announcement came on the heels of the latest attacks
by the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on government
officials who have become rich through illegal means.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow the formation of a class whose wealth is
accumulated through illegal ways," Khamenei stressed last week.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Iranian authorities concerned have launched a
new campaign against corruption, calling it a "dangerous
phenomenon" that must be confronted.
</P>
<P>
Iranian speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said at the parliament
that what he termed an "opportunist class of the rich" causes
economic insecurity in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri suggested that an appropriate parliamentary
committee should work together to identify the corrupted rich
people whom he called "traitors."
</P>
<P>
On July 1, some 156 members of the 270-seat parliament called
for investigations into the assets of top officials of the
Rafsanjani administration and their families.
</P>
<P>
The latest anti-corruption campaign comes at the end of the
Rafsanjani's term of office. Outgoing Rafsanjani, who has been
president of the Islamic republic for two consecutive terms, will
officially step down on August 3.
</P>
<P>
Corruption became rampant towards the end of Iran's 1980-88
war with Iraq, becoming a significant economic factor in the
free-wheeling days of post-war reconstruction during Rafsanjani's
first term of office.
</P>
<P>
Public concern increased with the exposures two years ago of
scandals at banks and state agencies involving misuse of hundreds
of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In June, a court sentenced to death a man arrested seven
years ago for cheating investors.
</P>
<P>
A state official and 12 accomplices were also sentenced to up
to 30 years of imprisonment for appropriating large sums of
state money allocated for rebuilding earthquake-hit areas, and a
former Revolutionary Guards commander was put on trial for
treason and embezzlement.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Israeli Spy in Egypt Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Higher State Security
Court has decided to put off until next Saturday the trial of four
defendants charged of spying for Israel to undermine Egypt's
national and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time that the hearings of the case have been
adjourned since they opened on April 24, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Azam Azam, a 35-year-old Israeli textile engineer, and his
Egyptian colleague, 34-year-old Emad Abdul Hamid Ismail, arrested
last November, had pleaded their innocence to charges of spying for
the Jewish state that can carry sentences of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's hearing, the Egyptian defense attorney
alleged that the real motive in the case was to stop the
normalization of Egyptian-Israeli relations, according to today's
Egyptian Gazette.
</P>
<P>
"Is there really an espionage case? The case is meant to stop
normalization," said Faird al-Dib, a distinguished lawyer, who was
punched by his Egyptian colleage after the court adjourned its
second hearing of the case on May 18.
</P>
<P>
The court will continue to listen to his pleading next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dib has been harshly criticized for agreeing to defend the
alleged Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
Zohra Yousef Giris and Mona Ahmed Shuwahna, two Israeli women,
also stood trial in absentia in previous hearings. They are
accused of recruiting the Egyptian for spying for Mossad, the
Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to have a peace treaty with
Israel but ties have been cool. The spy case, however, added to
the tensions because of the Mideast peace deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Early Results for Liberia's Election Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Due to bad weather and water
logged roads in the interior parts of Liberia, early results for
the country's presidential election are not expected until late
today.
</P>
<P>
After seven years of one of the bloodiest civil wars in the
African continent, over 700,000 Liberian voters trooped up 1,900
polling stations Saturday in the country's first democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
Journalists in Monrovia said hundreds of voters had lined up
to cast their ballot long before 7:00 am GMT when the polls
opened in the capital and other towns.
</P>
<P>
"Polling stations in outlying areas were opened an hour or two
later but the delay did not deter the excitement on the faces of
many voters who see the election as the way forward for Liberia",
one radio journalist said.
</P>
<P>
Liberia Radio reported that dozens of voters brough sandwiches
and other foodstuff as they lined up for the vote and at least
six stations in Monrovia ran out of ballot papers within three
hours of the opening of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Security remains tight with heavily-armed west African
peacekeeping (ECOMOG) troops patrolling the streets and watching
polling stations with binoculars from discreet distances.
</P>
<P>
Charles Taylor, one of the 13 presidential candidates, made a
sweeping tour of polling stations in Monrovia before flying to
Gbarngba, his one time factional stronghold to cast his vote.
</P>
<P>
"By the destiny of God, I shall be President Charles Taylor by
early next week," he boasted to reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Taylor's major rival Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf visited dozens of
polling booths and waved victory signs to mainly women
supporters."
</P>
<P>
"We shall see who would have the last laugh", she said in
response to Taylor's taunting during the campaign that the
election was not a woman's affair.
</P>
<P>
Election officials said some of the ballot boxes would have to
be brought to counting stations by dugout canoes and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
There are 13 presidential candidates contending in the
election which will also result in parliament members.
</P>
<P>

<P>
KIEV, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A group overseeing a renovation
project at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is to announce
several tenders soon, First Deputy Energy Minister Mykola Friedman

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Accord Transit Facilities to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's second largest port
Mongla is expected to become a regional port with Nepal having
transit facilities for shipment of its export and import cargoes
through Bangladesh in the near future, sources said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the Bangladeshi government has agreed
in principle to accord transit facilities to Nepal, upholding the
spirit of regional cooperation in expanding trade and improving
the livelihood of the people in the region.
</P>
<P>
An agreement allowing transit facilities to Nepal could be
finalized in the next few months, presumably before the year was
out, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, an inland mountain country, has been showing interest in
obtaining the right for shipment of cargoes to pass through
Bangladesh. The main hurdle was the absence of any agreement for
passing through Indian territory between Bangladesh and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The hurdle, however, was cleared recently with India agreeing
to allow the movement of Nepal's traffic through its territory to
and from Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Central Authorities Hail Inner Mongolia on Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, the State Council, the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and the Central Military Commission today sent a joint
message of congratulations to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, the first autonomous ethnic-minority region in
China, was a creation of the CPC, combining the fundamental tenets
of Marxism with China's multi-ethnic situation, and provided a
model for the implementation of autonomy in other areas of the
country, the message noted.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made in socialist revolution and
construction over the past half a century in the region. Today's
Inner Mongolia enjoys political stability, economic expansion,
ethnic unity and social progress, it said.
</P>
<P>
The glorious experience of the autonomous region has shown that
in order to maintain the stability and development of the region,
efforts must be made to uphold Marxism and Leninism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics, and to unswervingly march along the road
socialism under the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Also, the message stressed the need to focus on economic
construction along with efforts to deepen reforms, open wider to
the outside world, promote overall social progress, and to improve
people's material and cultural living standards.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the message said the Party's policies on ethnic
and religious affairs must be fully implemented, along with
efforts to safeguard ethnic and national unity, and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
The message called on regional efforts to come up with creative
work in combining the policy of the central government with the
realities of the region.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council will continue
to give full support to the development of Inner Mongolia in the
future, the message asserted.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Secretary Announces Bid for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa today formally announced his bid for the presidency in
the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
De villa, who joined President Fidel Ramos' Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) recently, is one of the
seven presidential contenders within the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Other presidential hopefuls in the ruling party include Speaker
Jose de Venecia, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and President
Ramos' sister Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani.
</P>
<P>
"I'll go straight to the point. I accept the challenge," de
Villa told a crowd of about 20,000 at the Lyceum University of
Batangas, Batangas Province, where he celebrated his 62nd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said he had gone through six months of consultations
and capability assessment and found out a strong clamor for him to
run.
</P>
<P>
"Who can refuse? Who can turn his back to this public clamor?"
de Villa said.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, who became defense chief in July 1991, said his
vision is to push further the country's unity and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a presidential contender, he will present
himself as an alternative to the traditional politician.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to present the country with someone whose record of
service is not disturbed by dirt," he said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came two days after de Villa and other
presidential contenders from the ruling Lakas-NUCD had a meeting
with President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the presidential palace said the official
presidential candidate of Lakas-NUCD will be selected through a
series of consultative assemblies and will be announced by
President Ramos, chairman of the party, on or before the party's
national convention on November 27.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Election Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The long-awaited Liberian election
ended Saturday peacefully, with an exceptionally large turnout of
voters, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, the capital city, voters filed out to the polling
stations as early as 7:00 a.m., defying the early morning rain.
</P>
<P>
The voting went on peacefully and orderly in the polling
stations, all of which were manned by soldiers of west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
It ended peacefully at 4:00 p.m.. No violence was reported
during the election.
</P>
<P>
Altogether there were some 11,000 ECOMOG soldiers deployed
nationwide to provide security for the election.
</P>
<P>
The election was supervised by over 500 observers from the
United Nations, the European Union and other international
organizations. Noteworthy among them is former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
Former warlord and presidential candidate of the National
Patriotic Party Charles Taylor reportedly cast his vote in his
home in Monrovia suburb. He is widely regarded as most likely
winner of the election.
</P>
<P>
Two other former warlords, George Boley of the National
Democratic Party of Liberia and Alhaji Kromah of the All Liberian
Coalition Party, also took part in the election.
</P>
<P>
Among the 13 presidential candidates from 13 political
parties, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former senior official of the
United Nations and the only female aspirant, is regarded as the
most likely rival of Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Of the over 2.6 million population in Liberia, 710,000 were
registered as voters.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election is expected to lead Liberia to final peace
after seven years of civil war that has killed more than 150,000
people and made many more others homeless.
</P>
<P>
However, no matter who will be announced the winner next week,
he or she will face the challenge of persuading the losers to
accept the results, and this is what the international community
is concerned at the moment.

<HEADLINE> More Central Government Support for Inner Mongolia, Zou Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
said today that the central government will give more support for
the development of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Zou, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), told a
gala ceremony in this capital of Inner Mongolia, marking the 50th
anniversary of the foundation of the region, that there will be no
change in the central government's support for Inner Mongolia, as
the comprehensive national strength and revenue are increasing.
</P>
<P>
He said that the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region was an example of the successful policy of the CPC for
solving ethnic problems, and a model of New China in implementing
autonomy for ethnic regions.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the region over the past 50 years have been
superior to those of any other historical period, said Zou, who is
heading a central government delegation. This demonstrates that,
in order to maintain the region's stability and speed up its
development, efforts must be made to uphold Marxism, Mao Zedong
Thought and Deng Xiaoping's Theory of Building Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics, to adhere to the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party and the road of socialism, stick to the
system of autonomy for ethnic regions, and focus on economic
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The region has sound development opportunities and will have a
bright future, as it is rich in natural resources. It also has a
good basis after half a century's development, as the state has
been attaching great importance to the development of ethnic
regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zou pointed out that the top priority is to develop the local
economy and raise the living standards of the local people.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that different levels of government of the region
strengthen the basic role of agriculture, and expand the
processing of agricultural, animal, and forestry products, as well
as the pillar industries of energy and metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia should open wider to the outside world as a way
of promoting development, and push ahead with reforms in different
spheres with flexible policies and measures, though in a positive
and steady manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also emphasized the need to strengthen unity
of all ethnic groups, maintain social stability and safeguard
national unity, calling these "the fundamental prerequisites" for
Inner Mongolia's progress.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee and the State Council fully affirms
the region's successful efforts in the past five decades to ensure
unity of all ethnic groups, social stability and sound border
defense, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he asked people and officials in the region to watch
against infiltration attempts made by Western hostile forces at
the country's ethnic regions by using ethnic and religious issues.
</P>
<P>
While all officials and people in general need to fight firmly
against hostile attempts at sabotaging ethnic and national unity,
and social stability, efforts must be made to properly handle
different kinds of social contraditions that run counter to unity
and stability, thus ensuring a sound social environment for reform,
opening, and economic construction, and safeguarding the unity and
lasting stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, work on law building should be accelerated,
he said, adding that ethnic regional autonomy should be improved
with efforts to make it more suited to the system of the socialist
market economy.

<HEADLINE> Tortuous but Bright Road Before Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- As the first female pilot in
Lebanon's Middle East Airlines and probably also in the Arab
world, Rola Hoteit has become acceptable among her colleges,
but not by all people in a society where women are still
struggling to prove their values.
</P>
<P>
As a woman entering such a profession, the 23-year-old Hoteit
has come across a few cases of gender discrimination from
passengers.
</P>
<P>
"One day, as an airplane is about to take off from the Beirut
Airport, a passenger heard that there was a woman pilot on board
and went completely insane. He got up and started shouting,
demanding that the plane be stopped because he didn't want to
die," Hoteit told the story in a weekend party of university
mates.
</P>
<P>
"He said that a woman cannot possibly be capable of flying a
plane and that if I was trying to learn flying at that
particular time, he would rather I learn during flights when
he's not on board," she said.
</P>
<P>
"After pushing and shoving with the crew to open the door and
failed, he sat down, practically shivering during the entire
flight," the vivacious Hoteit chuckled.
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that she has never felt regret for the
decision to be a pilot. "Women are able to take on the
same jobs as men and they must not think that their only job is
to bear children and tidy the house," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Becoming a pilot was not a childhood dream, but rather
something I decided during my third year at the American
University of Beirut where I was majoring in Mathematics,"
Hoteit explained.
</P>
<P>
The decision came about almost by accident. "A friend of mine
came up to me one day holding a newspaper in his hand, laughing
quite loudly and arrogantly. When I asked him what it was so
funny, he said that the MEA was asking for pilots in an
advertisement, and what was making him laugh so much was that
they were also asking for female pilots."
</P>
<P>
"I was so furious at his insulting attitude that I decided to
challenge him. Why don't we both apply, I said, and we'll see
who succeeds. He never made it."
</P>
<P>
Hoteit quickly developed a fascination with becoming a
pilot. But she still had two main obstacles: her father and the
exams she needed to pass.
</P>
<P>
"My father said I could go through the exams just to prove I
could do it, but I could not dream of ever pursuing a career
as a pilot," she recalled. "Without his permission, the road
ahead looked arduous."
</P>
<P>
With her perseverance and mathematical mind, Hoteit breezed
through her exams, ranking third out of the ten people accepted.
</P>
<P>
"After passing my exams, I had one week to prepare to go to
Scotland for 13 months of intensive flight training and studies
at the Air Service Training School," Hoteit said.
</P>
<P>
"I still had to convince my father so I decided to withdraw
from my university courses at the beginning of the
semester. Finally, he gave me his blessing."
</P>
<P>
With only one other woman from Africa and 500 men at the
school, Hoteit began her career as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Homesick at the beginning, she nevertheless found her first
flying experience on a one-engine plane the most exciting moment
of her life.
</P>
<P>
"I started out my training in a one-engine propeller
aircraft, fitting two people, where I had to fulfill 50 hours -
15 hours with my instructor and 35 hours solo," Hoteit said. She
later moved onto a two-engine jet plane.
</P>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years later, Hoteit today flies airplanes like
Boeing 707 and Airbus 320.
</P>
<P>
As a first officer, she has completed 800 flights hours and
still needs to fly 3,200 hours more to gain the four stripes of
a captain.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu's Exports on Rise in First Half of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics show that
the total export value of east China's Jiangsu Province reached
6.78 billion US dollars in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure is up 26.2 percent from the same period of last
year, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the province has made a success of revamping
the mix of its export products, and most local export-oriented
enterprises have started making profits, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu provincial government has taken measures to support
the development of the machine-building, electronics, chemical and
automobile industries since early this year to improve the
economic performance of local foreign trade enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the province's exports of finished industrial
products rose 0.3 percent in the first half of this year, and the
export value of these products accounted for 91.9 percent of the
province's total in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiangsu saw a marginal growth in exports of
machinery and electronic products in the first half, accounting
for one third of the total export of finished industrial products.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Remains Determined to Host Economic Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Qatar remains determined to
convene the fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference that may include Israeli delegates despite boycott
threats, the Qatari news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to live up to our international obligations
with regard to convening the economic conference in Doha," Qatari
Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani told the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Qatar is due to host the conference in November, but
Syria has been leading calls to boycott the meeting in
response to Israel's hardline settlement policies that have
brought the Middle East peace process to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Israel attended the three previous gatherings in Morocco,
Jordan and Egypt that were aimed at boosting economic
integration in the region while Syria boycotted the previous
three because of Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has repeatedly said it plans to go ahead with the
meeting and it expected Israel's participation because the meeting
is a " purely economic forum."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Emir denied reports that other Arab states will
boycott the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I have not received officially any reply not to attend.
Each state has the right to practice the policy it wants,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On Qatar's determination to hold the conference, Syrian
official daily Al Thawara said Saturday, "We are astonished by
Qatar's attitude which is insisting on holding the conference for
what it claims the good of the Arabs. Holding such a conference
will allow Israel to divide the Arabs and to better dominate
them."

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian teenage Valentino Rossi held
off the challenge from Japanese Yoshiaki Katoh to win the 125cc
race, his seventh in nine this season, at the German Grand Prix
Sunday at Nurburgring.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Rossi steered his Aprilia through 23 laps -- a
total of 104.46km -- in 48:05.749 to increase his world
championship lead.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Katoh was second on his Yamaha, just over half-a-second
behind Rossi. German Manfred Geissler was third on his
Aprilia. Both men recorded career-best results.
</P>
<P>
World championship third-placed Tomomi Manako of Japan took the
early lead until he crashed his Honda on lap three. His
second-placed compatriot Noboru Ueda slid out on his Honda at the
same corner a couple of laps later.
</P>
<P>
Kazuto Sakata of Japan led the race on his Aprilia until he was
forced to pull out with mechanical problems after 15 laps --
leaving the way clear for Rossi.
</P>
<P>
Rossi now has 195 points after his fourth straight win. Ueda is
second on 123, Manako third on 111 and Sakata fourth on 101.
</P>
<P>
Later on Sunday, Tetsuya Harada of Japan, riding an Aprilia,
claimed the 250cc race by clocking 42min 36.307sec for the
113.75km.
</P>
<P>
Harada finished the line just ahead of Olivier Jacque of
France, Ralf Waldmann of Germany and three-time world champion Max
Biaggi of Italy, all on Hondas.
</P>
<P>
The four riders swapped the lead throughout the race, setting
up a finish in which all crossed the line within the space of
13-100ths of a second.
</P>
<P>
Biaggi now holds a lead of only two points in the
championship. He has 149 points to 147 for Waldmann and 142 for
the improving Harada. Jacque is fourth on 101.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's annual
exports to Africa doubled from 1.9 billion U.S. Dollars in 1994
to 3.8 billion Dollars in 1996, according to a survey by the
South African Institute of Race Relations.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance is heavily weighted in South Africa's favor,
although its imports from Africa recorded at 733 million Dollars
in 1996, up 41 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's trade with the Southern African Customs Union
(Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana) took the lead,
followed by Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's trade with other African countries is expected
to continue to grow and could account for up to 25 percent of
exports within about 10 years, local economist Erika Prinsloo
said.
</P>
<P>
She cited Mozambique and Angola as immediate targets for South
African exports and investment because both had to recover from
severe devastation caused by civil war.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Official Attends Inner Mongolia's 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Leung Qi-sie, secretary of justice
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here
today that it is exciting to get to know the remarkable progress
that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made over the past
five decades.
</P>
<P>
Leung is here to attend the celebrations for the 50th
anniversary of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, with the
central government delegation headed by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua that in the past three days she had learned a
lot about the region's economic and social development, the
people's living standard and other aspects of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honor for me to visit the region soon after Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, and to congratulate all ethnic
groups in the region on behalf of all Hong Kong residents and
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that it is quite moving to learn about the efforts
that all the people in the region have made to promote its
economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Leung expressed the hope and conviction that the region will be
more prosperous, and the local people's living standard will be
further improved in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Also, she said she expected the region to increase exchanges of
personnel and economic cooperation with the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region was China's first ethnic
autonomous region, and is considered an example of the Chinese
Communist Party's successful efforts to handle ethnic issues.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that the region has enjoyed economic
development, ethic unity, social stability and sound border
defense since its founding.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Prince Norodom Ranariddh will meet Singaporean Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong on Monday, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Ranariddh was here on a swing through
Southeast Asia to seek support from regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry Spokesman confirmed today that Ranariddh had
arrived in Singapore, but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh condemned Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen on Saturday for rejecting the mediation efforts of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), warning that this
"would bring about isolation, an end to democracy and a return to
civil war."
</P>
<P>
"In rejecting ASEAN mediation, I think Hun Sen is now isolating
Cambodia by himself," the prince said.
</P>
<P>
In early July, forces loyal to Hun Sen demanded to search
barracks under Ranariddh's control for illegal weapons, sparking
eruption of armed conflicts between forces supporting the two
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen's forces controlled Phnom Penh and then Ranariddh's
military bases.

<HEADLINE> Iran Passes Law on Women's Alimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Parliament today
approved a special bill to allow women to receive their alimony
based on inflation growth over the years.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the new bill would
make it mandatory for marriage license bureaus to register the
price indicators in the marriage certificate at the time of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
The price indicator is provided by the Central Bank of
Iran, according to the report. Most of married women are
housewives in the country and their living largely depends on
their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Under Islamic law implemented in Iran, a wife can claim her
alimony both during her marriage or at the time of divorce. The
husband pledges the amount at the time marriage contract is
signed. He will have to pay the alimony any time his wife demands
it.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, men have preferred to designate their alimony
in money terms because they realized the monetary unit rial is
devaluating. Whereas women prefer to dozens or hundreds of gold
coins rather than rials.
</P>
<P>
The law applies to alimony that has been allocated in the
country's depreciating currency rial. Rial has been rapidly
devalued over the past 18 years since the Islamic revolution as a
result of drastic drop of the oil export revenue and runaway
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani told the Persian
daily Jomhuri Islami Saturday that the total inflation since 1989
stood at 595 percent. Non-official estimates have put annual
inflation in Iran as high as 30-60 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Vahideh Dastjerdi, a woman MP who supported the passage of
the bill, said that over the years, the alimony has been
depreciated to the point that it is not worth claiming by
women who are getting divorced.
</P>
<P>
The alimony of many women who were married decades ago is
not even enough to pay for her cab fare to the court to
get her divorce, she added.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Bangladesh Water Talks End with Positive Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indo-Bangladesh Joint Rivers
Commission (JRC) ended its two-day meeting here today and both
sides expressed optimism about the solution of problems regarding
the water sharing issue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of Water Resources Sis Ram Ola told a press
conference today that his government would do everything for the
implementation of the Ganges water sharing treaty, signed last
December.
</P>
<P>
"We will implement every word of the treaty and it is being
implemented," said the visiting Indian minister.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak expressed his
satisfaction at the outcome of the talks, saying: "We have agreed
to resolve the water sharing problems in the interests of the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Besides India's renewed assurances to implement the Ganges
Water Treaty, Razzak said, the meeting also came out with the
initiation of discussion on the water sharing of other common
rivers including Teesta.
</P>
<P>
Another important outcome was India's support for Bangladesh's
proposal to build a Ganges barrage, Razzak added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the two ministers signed the agreed minutes
of the just-concluded JRC meeting, which took place after a gap of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides in a joint communique agreed to revive the
Standing Committee and Local Level committees to resolve the
issues of tying of embankments, and sharing water of Teesta and
other common rivers.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to remove the bottlenecks in
implementation of the Ganges Treaty with further negotiations and
maintain transparency in the treaty's implementation both at
Farakka and at Hardinge Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The JRC meeting was the outcome of a summit meeting in January
between former Indian Premier Deve Gowda and his Bangladeshi
counterpart Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers signed the 30-year Ganges water treaty
in New Delhi on December 11 last year, agreeing to share the
Ganges water flow in dry season.
</P>
<P>
Today's JRC meeting was the 32nd since the formation of the
commission in 1972. Its next meeting will be held in New Delhi in
November.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam
Majali left here today for the West Bank town of Ramallah to meet
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on bilateral relations and the
lastest development of the Mideast peace process, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit to the Palestinian self-rule area, he
will hold talks with Arafat and senior officials of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in an effort to strengthen
Jordanian-Palestinian relations and consultations on the latest
developments in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, semi-official
Jordan Times here today quoted the prime minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Majali said Saturday that he would not propose any particular
Jordanian initiative to "unblock" the talks, which have been
stalled since mid-March when Israel began the construction of a
Jewish neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During Majali's visit, Jordan and the PNA are expected to sign
an agreement on health cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister on his visit was accompanied by
Minister of Health and Medical Care Ahshraf Kurdi and Minister of
Trade, Industry and Supply Hani Moulki.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Jordan mediated the Hebron accord between
Israel and the Palestinians on Israel's redeployment in the West
Bank city of Hebron, which was thought as a major breakthrough in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, later in February, Israel declared to build Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem and started the construction
in March. The peace process has been deadlocked since then.
</P>
<P>
During the period from March to June, efforts by the United
States and Egypt to reactivate the peace talks between Israel and
the Palestinians failed to achieve any results.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Launches First Self-made Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has fired its
first domestically made surface-to-surface missile in a test,
official Saudi Press Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister and Defense and Aviation
Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz was quoted as saying that
the missile which has a range of 35 to 60 kilometers was launched
at a new military firing range in the south of the Kingdom on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement during the inauguration of an
ammunition maintenance center in Al-Kharj, 100 kilometers
southeast of Saudi capital of Riyadh which was opened with the aim
of giving Saudi Arabia the ability to check and maintain its own
ammunition instead of sending it to foreign countries. It also
includes a firing range, from which the missile was fired.
</P>
<P>
He said "it is no secret that the kingdom possesses long-range
surface-to-surface missiles," without giving more details about
the test.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia intends to turn the naval base in Al-Kharj into a
military town with an advanced military school within four to five
years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has an ambitious armament program and major arms
contract with Britain, the United States and France.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Press Agency quoted Mohammed Al-Hudaithy, the
general administrative manager of armament as saying Friday that
the launch comes within the framework of a program to check and
maintain ammunition and field experiments.
</P>
<P>
He said with the launch of the surface-to-surface missile,
work will start in the test track in Al-Kharj.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the project of the maintenance and field
experiment took four years to establish. It is considered one of
the most advanced technical projects to serve different sectors of
Saudi military forces.

<HEADLINE> China to Become Intel's 3rd Largest Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The vice-president of the Intel
Corporation of the US said here today that China will be Intel's
third-largest market in the world after the US and Japan within a few
years.
</P>
<P>
James W. Jarrett, also president of Intel's China region, said
that with a growing demand for computers across the country, China
has become the company's fastest-growing marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's demand for personal computers
(PCs) has been increasing at an average annual rate of 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Intel's sales in the second quarter of this year came to six
billion US dollars-worth, of which 1.2 billion dollars-worth was
in the Asia-Pacific region, where China is the major marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Jarrett said that he believed that although China ranks the
sixth in the company's world market currently, it is sure to rise
to third in a few years' time and eventually replace Japan as the
world's second-largest PC market. "Intel will do its best to
develop this market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Intel is building a large-scale factory in Shanghai's Pudong
New Area to produce computer components and parts. The investment
in the project's first phase is set at nearly 100 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company is working in cooperation with a number
of Chinese computer manufacturers in designing computers and
developing software suitable for use in China.
</P>
<P>
Intel plans to increase the number of its sales centers in
China to 11 from four at present, in a bid to spread its products
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company will set up a purchasing center in China
soon, sources said. The center is expected to buy 160 million US
dollars-worth of computer and printer parts from Chinese factories
this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police to Charge Six in Bridge Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Six officials would be charged
of responsibility for the deaths of two Australians in a bridge
collapse at the Jewish Olympics, the daily Yediot Aharonot
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the officials to be charged include the
engineer in charge of building the temporary structure and the two
contractors.
</P>
<P>
The report also said organizers of the Games who hired the
company would also be implicated.
</P>
<P>
The bridge collapse took place last Monday and killed two
Australian athletes and injured 43 others when members of the
Australian delegation were making their way across to the Games's
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet was slated to hear police reports Sunday on
the collapse. Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled told Israel
radio Sunday that his ministry's committee investigating the chain

<HEADLINE> IACVB Conference a Vote of Confidence in Hong Kong, Says FS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The choosing of Hong Kong by the
International Association of Convention and Visitor Bureaus
(IACVB) as the venue for its Annual Convention "is a vote of
confidence in Hong Kong as an international tourism, convention
and exhibition destination," Financial Secretary Donald Tsang of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony of the IACVB's 38th Annual
Convention and Asia-Pacific Sales Mission here today, Tsang said
that much of what Chinese President Jiang Zemin said of the "one
country, two systems" concept during ceremonies for Hong Kong's
return to China three weeks ago is already a reality.
</P>
<P>
"There may still be prophets of doom and gloom who predict Hong
Kong's star will fade. But I earnestly believe such predictions
are ill-founded, over simplistic and fail to give due
consideration of the determination of the Hong Kong people to
succeed and to seize the opportunities thrown up by new challenges
and circumstances, to the determination of China to make the Hong
Kong enterprise work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that the elements of Hong Kong's success would not
change. "Come back next year, in five years or 10 years. You will
find Hong Kong's star shining even bigger, brighter and better
than before," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA)'s Executive Director Amy Chan said the IACVB's confidence
in Hong Kong set a good example for many international
organizations to follow. And now Hong Kong has many events
confirmed all the way to the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged more interaction among HKTA's friends and
counterparts around the world because this would benefit everyone
involved in the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference has a program including presentation
and keynote address, education sessions, and a business trip to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The IACVB was founded in 1914 to promote professionalism in the
areas of destination marketing for both conventions and tourism.
Based in Washington DC, the organization, which now has 420 member
bureaus, brings together Convention and Visitor Bureau leaders
from 30 countries and regions for the Hong Kong conference.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artist Holds Exhibition in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of visitors were
deeply touched here today by a fine art exhibition of a young
Chinese oil painter, Li Zijian, in a university art gallery.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, in Harriet and Charles Luckman Fine Arts and
Complex, California State University, presents Li's series of
paintings of mother and daughter, red quilt, the homeland, the
homeless and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Li's works, Dr. Patricia Woodlin, curator of the
exhibition and director of the gallery, said that the artist
"portrays people, Chinese or Americans, in such a way that they
are real people with love, dignity and dreams."
</P>
<P>
It is the 18th exhibition in an international tour since 1993,
when Li Zijian began to show his 100 oil paintings around the world.
</P>
<P>
U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan, after visiting a similar
exhibition in the U.N. headquarters last June, praised the
painter's commitment to world peace.
</P>
<P>
"You are a very fine artist, and your commitment to world peace
evidenced in your World Tour with the theme of "Humanity and Love"
is a tribute to your art and to your country." Annan wrote to him
recently.
</P>
<P>
Li said he will bring the exhibition to his motherland in 2000,
following the world tour to Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea,
Russia and East European countries during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Li was born in Hunan, China in 1954. In his childhood, he was
suffering from hardship because of his declining family. Yet the
warmth of his loving mother, the deep affection of his elder
sisters and neighbors are always in his memory. All these had
naturally contributed to his works.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in India Down to 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua)-- India's annual inflation rate
plunged to a 52-week low of 4.70 percent for the week that ended
July 5 from 5.9 percent in the previous week, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline was attributed to the "wearing off" of the
direct effect of last July's petroleum price hike on inflation.
During the corresponding week last year, the inflation rate had
jumped 1.6 percentage points to 5.8 percent on account of the
petro-product price hike.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 4.70 percent inflation in all commodities, the
rate of increase in prices of "primary articles" was 4.03 percent,
while in "manufactured products" and fuel, power, light and
lubricants it was 4.35 percent and 8.45 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Australia Starts Campaign To Sell Greenhouse Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior Australian officials will
travel around the world in a final bid to sell Australia's stance
on greenhouse gas emission reduction targets ahead of December's
Climate Change Convention Conference in Kyoto, Prime Minister John
Howard said today.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the hand-picked task force would try to persuade
American, Japanese and British government advisers to set
different targets for different countries.
</P>
<P>
Howard has failed to win support from the United States and
Japan during his talks with leaders of the two countries earlier
this year over greenhouse gas emission reduction targets proposed
by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU wants all developed countries to reduce their emissions
by 15 percent of their 1990 output by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Australia argues that as the world's leading coal exporters,
dependent on greenhouse gas-producing fossil fuels, it stands to
lose more than other countries.
</P>
<P>
"In the government's view, there is still time before the Kyoto
meeting to develop a realistic and fair outcome based on
differentiation that would have a better chance of being
implemented than the options being proposed, in particular by the
European Union," Howard said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The task force, led by Environment Department Secretary Roger
Beale and Australia's Ambassador for the Environment, Howard
Bamsey, will meet senior officials in Washington, Tokyo and
London.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the task force will set out the steps
Australia is already taking to help limit its greenhouse gas
emissions and underline Australia's commitment to pulling its
weight in responding to climate change.
</P>
<P>
Howard warned last month that Australia will refuse to sign the
international agreement on greenhouse gas emission reduction
targets if it fails to obtain accommodation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be part of an agreement that damages
Australia," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Fix quantity for India's Oil Import from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua)-- India's Petroleum Secretary Vijay
Kelkar said today that the United Nations would determine the
quantity of oil to be imported by India from Iraq under a barter
deal between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
India has got the U.N. Security Council's clearance for
importing oil from Iraq in return for exports of 1,000 tons of
black tea to Baghdad under an "oil-for-food" program.
</P>
<P>
"So far no contract has been signed as it is yet to be
finalized," Kelkar said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Oil Corporation Director Suresh Mathur has said official
contact on the barter is expected in about a week, but he is not
aware of the quantum.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, India would import one million
tons of crude oil from Iraq for its export to that country of
1,000 tons of tea.

<HEADLINE> Central Government Pledges Support for Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said here
today that the Central government will increase its aid to the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with increased revenues and
national strength.
</P>
<P>
"The central government's policy of helping the region speed up
development will remain unchanged," Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua told a
rally attended by more than 50,000 people to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of this autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Zou, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, is the head of the central
government delegation to Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, based on fifty years of development, with
abundant natural resources and with support of the central
government, is now facing a rare development opportunity and
enjoys bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the primary task for the region is to focus on
economic development and to do its utmost to improve the living
standards of people of various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Party and government organizations in the region
to continue to strengthen the status of agriculture and animal
husbandry as the foundation of the region's economy, improve
production conditions, promote industrialized and intensive
production in rural and livestock-breeding areas by relying on
scientific and technological progress, so as to effectively
increase supplies of farm products and animal by-products, as well
as the incomes of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and animal product processing industry, the
energy industry and the metallurgical industry must be given
priority in order to spur the overall economic growth of Inner
Mongolia, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Inner Mongolia must stick to and improve the
system of regional autonomy. Its socialist legal system with the
characteristics of regional autonomy should be improved, so as to
be adapted to the market economic structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the achievements made by Inner Mongolia in the
past 50 years are unprecedented in history.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening unity among people of various ethnic groups,
maintaining social stability and safeguarding the unification of
the motherland are preconditions for invigorating Inner Mongolia,"
Zou said.
</P>
<P>
He asked officials and people of various ethnic groups in Inner
Mongolia to bear the general situation in mind, correctly handle
new circumstances and problems cropping up in the process of
development, properly deal with social contradictions detrimental
to unity and stability, in order to create a stable social
environment for the reform, opening up and economic construction,
and to safeguard the unification of the motherland and China's
long-term stability and prosperity.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Forces opposing to the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia have claimed the capture of a key air base
north of the beleaguered capital Kabul, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to the former military chief Ahmad Masood took
control early today Baghram air base and Charikar, about 40 km and
65 km respectively north of Kabul, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban, who control the Afghan capital and the
southern two thirds of the country, declined to confirm the
opposition claims, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban has lost both Baghram and Charikar it would put
the opposition within easy rocket range of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who vow to impose strict Islamic law on
Afghanistan, have locked in a bloody war with northern opponents
since taking control of Kabul in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, led by Masood and Uzbek warlord Abdul
Malik is demanding the demilitarization of Kabul before agreeing
to a ceasefire while the Taliban asked the northern alliance
release all Taliban prisoners it is holding including several
senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Urges U.S. to Take on Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Salam
el-Majali today called upon the U.S. to heighten its mediation
profile in the Mideast peace process which has suffered serious
setbacks in the past four months.
</P>
<P>
In an interview over telephone from Amman to the Cairo-based
Voice of Arab radio this morning, Majali termed the present peace
process impasse as very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should restore its role as an effective partner in
the peace march. Tackling this impasse logically would be a proper
way to surmount it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Majali expressed hope that the U.S. initiative to get the peace
march back on track would be a "logical and just one" and would help
bring the Palestinian and Israeli sides back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Jordan's support to the Egyptian initiative
aiming at salvaging the peace process, which came to a halt as
Israel began building thousands of homes for Jews in East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Majali will convey a message from Jordan's King Hussein to
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in a
meeting in the West Bank city of Ramallah today.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian premier told the Arabic-language radio that the
meeting with Arafat will cover their bilateral relations and the
latest developments of the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch is expected in Cairo soon for talks with
President Hosni Mubarak on the current efforts to push ahead the
stalled peace march.
</P>
<P>
Egypt stepped in as a major mediator between the Palestinians
and Israelis as the U.S. efforts have visibly slacked off, failing
to bear pressure on Israel to halt its settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has brokered a Palestinian-Israeli ministerial meeting in
Tel Aviv recently to discuss implementation of the agreement on
operating Gaza airport. An enlarged Egyptian-Palestinian meeting
will be held here on Sunday to evaluate the present situation.

<HEADLINE> S. African Arms Giant Makes Secret Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
state-owned arms manufacturer Denel is trying to make a
1.6-billion U.S. Dollars arms deal with a Middle East country,
local daily "The Sunday Independence" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed weapons export deal, including mobile artillery
and anti-aircraft missiles, would be the biggest of its kind in
South African history, informed sources were quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the deal would be finalized in
September, but declined to reveal the name of the client, saying
the deal would be torpedoed if the name was published.
</P>
<P>
Denel claimed that up to 30,000 jobs could be lost and the
companies itself could even be destroyed if the deal fell
through.
</P>
<P>
The industrial analysts said an export order of this magnitude
will revive the flagging fortunes of the South African arms
industry, which has been under pressure following military budget
cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been aggressively marketing its wares in the
Middle East and surrounding areas, with the exception of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Denel has signed a few deals with countries like Jordan, but a
signed deal with Turkey was reversed by South Africa's Arms
Control Committee because of disputes over Turkey's human rights
problems.
</P>
<P>
Last year a 667-million U.S. Dollar deal to sell tank-firing
systems to Syria was also reversed after unprecedented
international pressure led by the United States, which claimed
the arms deal would upset the military balance in the region.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Anti-Taliban Forces Bomb Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Forces opposing the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia launched three air raids today on the
beleaguered capital Kabul after capturing a strategic airbase in
the north, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
At least two bombs exploded close to the center of the city,
but the intensity of ground fire made the thumping booms difficult
to distinguish from the outgoing fire, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The raids came after opposition forces took the Parwan
provincial capital of Charikar and a neighboring airbase,
strategically placed just north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to the former military chief Ahmad Masood claimed
earlier in the day to have captured the Baghram air base and
Charikar, about 40 km and 65 km respectively north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban, who control Kabul and more than two
thirds of the Afghan territory, declined to confirm the opposition
claims, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
If the Taliban have lost both Baghram and Charikar, provincial
capital of Parwan province, it would put the opposition within
easy rocket range of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have vowed to impose strict Islamic laws on
Afghanistan, have been locked in a bloody war with northern
opponents since taking control of Kabul in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The northern alliance, led by Masood and Uzbek warlord Abdul
Malik is demanding the demilitarization of Kabul before agreeing
to a ceasefire while the Taliban is asking the northern alliance
to release all Taliban prisoners it is holding including several
senior officials.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua)-- Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral said here today that the future of the people of India and
Pakistan would be in their togetherness and both countries have
been trying to cover the ground which remained uncovered so far.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to 'Home TV' telecast this morning, the prime
minister said that the talks between New Delhi and Islamabad "are
not for the fun of it, nor for avoiding issues, but to lead to
something, to understand each other".
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan resumed their bilateral talks on the foreign
secretary level in March this year and their foreign ministers and
prime ministers also held useful dialogues in April and May.
</P>
<P>
Gujral said in the interview that "let the conversation not
stop. Let talks follow more talks".
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indian government's decision to ease visa
restrictions for Pakistanis visiting India, Gujral said, "When we
relaxed visas we were not doing a favor to anybody. It is a
product of two things: one humanitarian... the other is that the
more people to people contacts there are, the more understanding
there will be."
</P>
<P>
"I am one of those who suffered partition and I came from that
side. The parents of (Pakistan prime minister) Mr. Nawaz Sharif
went from this side," he further said.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan partitioned in 1947 when they became
independent of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Language and ethos would help in the process of improving
bilateral relations, the Indian prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> Constitutional Amendment Bill to Be Presented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- A constitutional amendment bill
is to be presented to parliament in less than two weeks, Kenyan
Attorney-General Amos Wako has claimed.
</P>
<P>
The bill, being drafted by Wako's team, will have to be
approved by the cabinet before being tabled in the current
session of parliament for debate, Wako was quoted by today's
local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I am moving with great speed as the government's
principal legal adviser and what I can assure my fellow Kenyans
is that my office is already working on the proposed bill," he
said in Machakos, southern Kenya on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) on Thursday
recommended the publishing of the bill and the repeal of 11 laws
which have been widely described as "oppressive and colonial."
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a surprise departure from the
uncompromising stand, previously adopted by KANU which has an
absolute majority in parliament, against legal and constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
The laws charged as "oppressive" include the Public Order Act
on public rallies, the Preservation of Public Security Act, the
Penal Code and so on.

<HEADLINE> Islam Basic Principle in State Affairs: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President-elect Mohammad
Khatami stressed Saturday night that Islam is the basic principle
for building the country, the official news agency IRNA reported
here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
In his first message to the nation after elected in May,
Khatami said, "religious identity of the Muslim people of Iran and
the Islamic revolution should be the basis of an identical
national feeling in building the nation."
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who is expected to be sworn in on August 3, made it
clear that "the creation of a well-developed, independent and free
nation would need the effort of every citizen together with
solidarity and national determination".
</P>
<P>
On May 23, Mohammad Khatami won a landslide victory in the 7th
presidential election. But it is believed that there would be
little room for him to play in running the state affairs because
the country's supreme leader is Seyyed Ali Khamenei who succeeded
the late spiritual leader Seyyed Ruhollah Khomeini in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, former cultural and Islamic guidance minister, was
sacked by Khamenei in 1992 because he was labeled as "a
liberal-minded minister" and not close enough to the supreme
leader.
</P>
<P>
In his first message, Khatami said that since his election to
presidency on May 23, he has been concentrating on the present
state of affairs of Iran and on how to form his cabinet. He has
been consulting with experts and professionals for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to local observers, more than 2,000 names have been
introduced to him but there are only 22 ministerial posts in the
cabinet.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Navy Saturday foiled a
Tamil rebel plan to destroy Trincomalee Navy Base using limpet
mines, according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted a navy spokesman in Trincomalee Town as
saying the rebel plan, uncovered in the nick of time, was to blow
up at least six navy vessels inside the Trincomalee Harbor, 250
kilometers from Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The rebel plan came to light when a group of navy divers
carrying out a special under-water search operation detected six
powerful sea mines.
</P>
<P>
Each mine weighed approximately 50 kgs. The devises were later
defused, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
All six mines were rigged with necessary equipment to fix them
on to the hull of vessels, said the sources adding that The mines
were discovered at a point close to Clappenburg within the
Trincomalee Navy base.
</P>
<P>
The sources believed that the mines were left behind by a sea
Tiger cadre who was killed last December when the Navy discharged
'depth charger', usually used to prevent sea Tigers approaching
the harbor area.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war for a separate Tamil
state in the north-east of the country since 1983.

BELGRADE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior international
representative has accused Bosnia's all three parties of failing
to cooperate in the implementation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
High Representative of Peace Implementation Council (PIC)
Karlos Westendorp pressed the charges in his remarks made to the
Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz published today.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp blasted Serb leaders for noncooperation in launching
a single currency, and the Muslim-Croat Federation for similar
attitude toward the Dayton accord signed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Croatian Union of Herceg-Bosnia is still
functioning, he noted, adding that its existence will impede
possible agreements among all three parties in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The PIC official attributed the noncooperation to the pursuit
of their own interests by the different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims are trying to control the entire Bosnian territory
while the Serbs are attempting to break away from Bosnia and the
Croats are seeking absolute autonomy, Westendorp said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- On October 1, a special natural
gas torch will be ignited at Tian'anmen Square, said today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The torch marks the change which will take place in many
Beijing residents' lives. After October 1, they will cook with
natural gas from Changqing Oil and Natural Gas Field about 900
kilometers northwest of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The change is expected to alleviate Beijing's pollution
significantly since natural gas is much cleaner than coal.
</P>
<P>
Changqing Field is in the Ordos Basin, which includes north
Shaanxi and parts of Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. It
covers 370,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of crucial discoveries in recent years,
Changqing boasts the largest natural gas field in the country. By
1996, the field had 241 billion cubic meters of controlled
reserves, said Hu Wenrui, deputy general manager of Changqing
Petroleum Exploration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Only six percent of total estimated gas reserves have been
proven," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the bureau was building a large natural gas development
project with a 3-billion-cubic-meter annual production capacity.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to provide 1.5
billion cubic meters of gas annually.
</P>
<P>
A large gas collecting, purifying and distributing center in
Jingbian County can handle 10 million cubic meters of gas a day.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Suffer Severe Setback on BSE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 20 (Xinhua)-- Pivotals suffered a severe
setback on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market as well as on
the National Stock market last week due to political uncertainty
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index crashed 197 points during the week. The
trading sentiment was steady when it resumed on Monday but
suddenly turned weak on all round liquidation. Since then the
market has never recovered and selling pressure continued.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index slumped from the previous week level of
4321.98 to 4124.81 with the sizable loss of 197.17 points. The
national index also lost 83.31 points to 1791.93 from the previous
week level of 1875.24.
</P>
<P>
The trading sentiment was considerably affected following a
decision by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), one of the
constituents of the ruling United Front, to withdraw its ministers
from the Inder Kumar Gujral government. The uncertain political
situation continued throughout the week. As a result, the
speculative activities reduced considerably and foreign
institutions have also slowed down their buying. The selling
pressure was also due to a likely hike in petroleum prices in the
coming days.

ROME, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The international community should help
rebuild Albania's economy while rearming its troops, police and
judicial authorities, a senior Italian official said today.
</P>
<P>
A new phase of assistance to Albania should begin as the first
phase has accomplished, Deputy Foreign Minister Piero Fassino told
a press conference after a seminar on the Albanian issue.
</P>
<P>
As the earlier phase was to deploy multi-national forces in the
troubled tiny Balkan nation to safeguard food relief operations,
the next should be devoted to help rebuild the country, he said.

<P>
In a related development, about 400 soldiers of the first

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Inflames Seasonal Goods Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's hottest summer in 50
years is frustrating residents, straining utilities but igniting
seasonal businesses, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Air conditioner producers and sellers possibly profited most as
air conditioner sales swept the city.
</P>
<P>
In many Beijing shops, air conditioners, even samples, are sold.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi and Meidi After-Sales Center said it had to stop
providing air conditioners to small and medium-sized shops to
guarantee supplies for department stores and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
With so many people jostling to buy air conditioners, most
after-sales centers were surprised because they had far from
enough professionals to install them, an industry insider said.
</P>
<P>
Most air conditioner producers have revoked their guarantees to
deliver and install air conditioners within 24 hours and offered a
five- or seven-day guarantee instead, the industry insider said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of electric fans also jumped. They are the best choice
for people who cannot afford air conditioners or who use electric
fans instead of air conditioners when the weather is not
unbearably hot.
</P>
<P>
Electric fans at Beijing's Shuang'an Market are sold out, and
Guiyou Shopping Center reported daily sales volume of 200 electric
fans.
</P>
<P>
Straw and bamboo sleeping mats are selling better than last
year when it rained more frequently and the temperature was lower,
street vendors said.
</P>
<P>
While the heat fuels sales in the city, it is withering profits
for farmers. In the mountainous areas outside Beijing, farmers are
hurriedly trying to save 20,000 hectares of corn.
</P>
<P>
The sweltering heat has put power and water companies under
great stress.
</P>
<P>
Daily electricity use was 4.71 million kilowatt-hours, a July
record, said Ji Hong of the Beijing Power Corp. The company is in
charge of the city's electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 800,000 kilowatt-hours more than last year's July
record, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Tap Water Co. said it might have to cut the water
pressure if demand continues to rise. The company is providing
water at full capacity: 2.4 million cubic meters, company
spokesperson Yao Lei said.

<HEADLINE> China's Commercial Banks Upgrade Auditing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's four State banks severed
from the central government adminstration have been tightening
bank audition and surveillance in the process of transforming to
commercial banks, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"(The four Banks) have never been so concerned about the
quality of their capital," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The banks are the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), the
Bank of China (BOC), the Commercial and Industrial Bank of China
(CIBC) and the China Construction Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is something the sound operation of the bank and our
reputation depends on," ABC president Shi Jiliang said.
</P>
<P>
The ABC, the most burdened of the country's top four banks, is
taking a lead in finding an effective way to secure the bank's
healthy performance. Early in June, it set a committee responsible
for auditing and supervision.
</P>
<P>
A BOC official said his bank set up an auditing group headed by
the bank chief in 1995. And the group's main task this year is to
check the unaccounted funds and curb illegal use of capital, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Kaisheng, vice-president of the CIBC, said the bank had
unified control over the credit capital. The bank keeps detailed
records of each client to make sure that credit is used
effectively.
</P>
<P>
And the Construction Bank has established a risk-monitoring
system that warns of risks in advance, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994, all the four State banks acted as arms specialized
in performing the central government policies, when all the credit
was granted under the mandate of the central government, and
whether the credit could be repaid was not important to the banks'
operation.
</P>
<P>
As a result of too many branches and employees, the head
offices were simply unable to exercise their authority in managing
their entire network.
</P>
<P>
The newly established supervisory mechanism is expected to
ensure the sound and healthy growth of the four commercial banks,
the Daily said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Decline Normal: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The latest drop in foreign
investment in China is nothing to fuss about, but a normal outcome
of China's economic progress and will not affect their long-term
interest in the country, the China daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although statistics are alleged to suggest foreign investors'
interest in China is waning, Zhang Shangtang, vice-chairman of the
China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment,
downplayed those rumors.
</P>
<P>
"It really should be seen as a normal thing, regarding the
decline in the growth rate of contractual foreign funds in recent
months," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation show contractual foreign investment was 23.3 billion
US dollars in the first half of the year, down 48.76 percent from
the same period last year. But direct investment surged 5.49
percent to 20.7 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A researcher from the State Planning Commission said the
abnormal growth of foreign investment in the first half of last
year led to this year's decrease.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors jostled to clinch deals before April 1, 1996,
when the import tariff exemption on capital goods expired, thus
causing contracted investment to skyrocket in the first several
months of last year.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, chairman of US-based Westinghouse, told the
China Daily that although China's policy adjustment affect foreign
investment, thoughtful foreign investors would keep a long-term
perspective toward their business in China.
</P>
<P>
It is not justifiable for China to always run on the fast
track after being the world's second largest investment target for
four consecutive years, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, a good sign surfaced that investment quality is
improving, according to Zhang Shangtang.
</P>
<P>
China approved 9,763 foreign-funded enterprises in the past six
months, down 30.5 percent from last year. But per-project
investment hit 2.12 million US dollars, higher than 1.7 million US
dollars in 1996 and one million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Small foreign-funded plants seeking short-term returns are
moving to neighboring countries because of rising costs,
industrial adjustment and surging dumping allegations, Zhang
said.

<HEADLINE> HK Return to Help Chinese Oil Producer: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong is an
opportunity for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to
develop, CNOOC President Wang Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC is the monopoly authorized by the State Council to be
engaged in the exploration for, development, production,
utilization and marketing of offshore oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
It is considering many measure to raise funds to develop
downstream products and expand overseas, the China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, an international financial center, will be crucial
in helping CNOOC attain its goal, Wang was quoted by the Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC created an investment company in Hong Kong to raise
funds, which is expected to be listed in local securities markets.
</P>
<P>
The company has benefited from Hong Kong since its founding in
1982, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The China Ocean Oil Fields Services (Hong Kong) Ltd, a
subsidiary of the CNOOC set up in 1982, has recruited a lot of
overseas technical experts.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC has accommodated 8,600 overseas experts in the past
14 years, mostly through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Wang also disclosed that his company is prepared to cooperate
with Hong Kong's Merchant Bureau Group Ltd. and other partners to
build the Nanhai Petrochemical project in Guangdong Province. The
first phase of the project is capable of producing 800,000 tons of
ethylene annually.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC is expected to pump 16 million tons of oil and 8.5
million to 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually by
2000.

<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kelon Group, one of China's
largest household appliance manufacturers, intends to become the
world's leading refrigerator maker, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong-baded group plans to expand its international
business while increasing production to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
It has maintained the title of the country's largest
refrigerator maker for six years. Last year, it sold 1.8 million
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
Group president Pan Ning said last week his group planned to
move its headquarters to Hong Kong from Shunde, Guangdong, to
capitalize on Hong Kong's advantages as a global information,
trade and financial center.
</P>
<P>
The group spent more than 100 million yuan ($12 million) on an
office building in Hong Kong. It spent more than 100 million yuan
establishing the Kelon (Japan) Ltd. in Kobe last year.
</P>
<P>
In the domestic market, it spent 510 million yuan ($61.44
million) establishing two refrigerator plants in Chengdu, Sichuan
Province and Yingkou, Liaoning Province, in December 1996 to
increase its annual output of freon-free refrigerators by one
million sets.

<HEADLINE> Trade Gap To Continue Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) -- China's trade surplus continued to
swell this year, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
But experts say the gap will have some negative effects on
long-term development.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade surplus, buoyed by rocketing exports and
declining imports since the start of the year, hit 17.8 billion US
dollars in June. The 1996 surplus was 12.2 billion dollars; the
1995 surplus was 16.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Li Jian, a researcher with the International Trade Research
Institute, said the surplus was a result of the country's
macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
A direct consequence of the tight credit policy is the
slackened domestic purchasing power. Although Chinese savings are
increasing, commercial and industrial sectors complained domestic
spending was sluggish. As a result, the demand for imported
products is waning.
</P>
<P>
Another outcome is the ebbing investment demand reflected by
contractual foreign investment, which plunged 48.7 percent in the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The declining investment is a more direct result of China's
elimination of the tax exemption on capital goods imports since
last April. It caused plant equipment imports to fall. They
usually account for about 20 percent of China's imports.
</P>
<P>
Li said the continuous surplus could buoy China's foreign
exchange reserve and lead to an inequilibrium of China's
international payment balance.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Baoliang, a researcher for the State Information Center,
said that the trade surplus would ultimately lead to a rise in the
value of renminbi, which in turn, will raise costs and hurt
exports.
</P>
<P>
China's exports will continue to rise although slowly,
throughout the year. Therefore, the surplus will become even
larger this year as the import situation will not change
considerably, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, World Bank Plan Loan to Boost Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and the World Bank (WB) are
preparing a new crediting program to develop the country's
business, said a World Bank official.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Drume, head of the WB mission here, said the program
would focus on four areas: privatization, the stock market,
accountancy and bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
The program will come before the WB Board of Executive
Directors for approval in November, at which time the actual size
of the loan and the conditions of its disbursement will be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
However, present requirement for the disbursement of the WB
credit will include the privatization of 9,500 enterprises, with
at least 70 percent of their stock being sold by June 30, 1998, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The bank also wants the number of companies excluded from
privatization to be cut. At present, this number stands at
4,000. In addition, the State Property Fund is to prepare
individual privatization plans for 10 major companies before
September 30.
</P>
<P>
The WB has disbursed two batches of an earlier business
development loan, the 310 million dollars of Enterprise
Development Adjustment Loan (EDAL). The three-batch EDAL loan is
to be repaid over a 17 year period.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Five thousand residents in and
around Flora, Mississippi, have been evacuated as a 25-car train
with hazardous chemical stored derailed, the United Press
International reported today.
</P>
<P>
Authorities plan a controlled explosion of more than 300,000
pounds of the potentially hazardous chemical stored in two
refrigerated cars.
</P>
<P>
The Illinois Central Railroad train derailed Friday afternoon.
Although much of the derailment has been cleaned up, those two
cars pose a significant threat as chloroprene is a very sensitive
chemical with a flashpoint of minus four Celsius and given the
wave of 90 degree temperatures, could explode all by itself.
</P>
<P>
With explosive charges, authorities plan to rupture the cars,
then ignite it.
