METROPOLITAN LIFE SAYS IT AIMS TO START A FULL-SERVICE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first time since Congress eliminated
Depression-era barriers last fall that prevented banks and
insurance companies from intermingling their businesses, a major
insurance company, Metropolitan Life, said Thursday that it was
taking steps to go into full-service banking.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life, a unit of MetLife Inc. and one of the
nation's largest insurers, said it had not decided whether to buy a
bank or to get a charter and develop one from the ground up. It did
say, however, that it expected to make ``the best use of both
traditional banking services and online capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   To work out the new banking strategy, Met Life has selected Judy
Weiss, a 27-year veteran of Met Life who is the company's chief
actuary and one of a handful of executive vice presidents. She is
to report to Robert H. Benmosche, Met Life's chief executive and a
former investment banker at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Met Life's decision was likely to set off a chain
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Met Life is such a powerful force in the industry,'' said Tom
Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a Manhattan financial
research company. ``They are telegraphing that a large insurance
company cannot afford to remain solely in their own industry and
that you have to diversify to take advantage of the changed
regulatory environment.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, under the new financial services laws, no banks have
bought major insurance companies, said Ken Reynolds, executive
director of the Association of Banks in Insurance, an organization
in Washington. But Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A.M.
Best Co., the insurance rating agency, said a handful of banks had
begun ``looking for insurance properties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot going on behind the scenes,'' Mayewski said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 insurance companies have obtained thrift charters and
are offering checking and other banking services through agents and
on the Internet. But analysts said they expected the Met Life
operation to be far larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be a more broad-based, aggressive push into the
banking area,'' Mayewski said.
</P>
<P>
   With a thrift charter, banks are expected to offer at least some
mortgage loans and most of their commercial lending is to small
businesses, which limits their prospects for growth. In 1998,
Travelers, another big insurer, merged with Citicorp to form
Citigroup. That merger anticipated the regulatory change and
increased pressure on Congress to bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that Met Life's move into banking was
inevitable. ``A couple of years ago,'' said Colin Devine, a Salomon
Smith Barney analyst, ``you would have said their competitors were
the other major insurers. Now their competitors are the big
financial services companies like Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill
Lynch. They had to do something to keep pace.''

FOR TURKS, TIME TO SHOUT `HELLO, EUROPE!' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Early Thursday morning, after the Istanbul
soccer team Galatasaray won the first major European championship
ever by a Turkish team, the coach, Fatih Terim, said he had one
more wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope our country follows up on this,'' Terim said during the
jubilation, ``not just in soccer but in every field.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in this soccer-crazed country spent Thursday both
proud and ecstatic. In a century of competition, no Turkish team
has even come close to such a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   But Galatasaray's 4-1 victory in a penalty shootout over the
British team, Arsenal, has an importance far beyond sports. It
spoke of this country's growing self-confidence and encouraged the
increasing number of Turks who say that Turkey can succeed at any
level if it disciplines itself and embraces European rules.
</P>
<P>
   Terim is an ideal symbol of the transition Turkey hopes to make.
Once a young tough who got into fights in bars, he has blossomed
into an articulate leader who plays by Europe's rules and comes out
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much bigger than football,'' said Serif Erol, a radio
commentator who spent much of his Thursday morning show discussing
the big victory in the Ufea Cup, given by the Union of European
Football Associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has been missing success for much too long,'' Erol
said. ``We started to wonder if we could ever compete with Europe.
Now we're losing some of that inferiority complex. It's a sign of
the reversal in our psychology. If we can beat so many great
European teams on the soccer field, that makes us think we can be
as good as the rest of Europe in democracy, in human rights, in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's game, which was played in Copenhagen, gave
Galatasaray the right to call itself the best soccer club in
Europe. On its way to the championship, it defeated top teams not
just from Britain but also from Germany, Italy and other longtime
soccer powers.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came at a remarkable moment in Turkish history.
During the last year this country has seen the apparent end of a
long civil war, has been invited to apply for membership in the
European Union, and has begun making peace with Greece, its
longtime rival.

CEO OF FIBER OPTIC LEADER JDS UNIPHASE RETIRES, CITING EXHAUSTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ontario)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ JDS Uniphase, the largest component manufacturer
for fiber optic equipment, said Thursday that Kevin Kalkhoven had
retired as co-chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Kalkhoven, 55, is succeeded by Jozef Straus, 53, who has been
co-chairman, president and chief operating officer since the
company was formed 18 months ago through the merger of JDS Fitel,
of Nepean, Ontario, and Uniphase, of San Jose, Calif. Kalkhoven
said he was leaving because of exhaustion after several years of
100-hour weeks and that he would start a venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been nine years of extreme high-intensity activity,''
Kalkhoven said in a conference call with securities analysts.
``It's been a wonderful time; it's been the pinnacle of my career.
But it's also been a very stressful environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have today,'' he added, ``is only a transition. It's a
relatively seamless transition in a company that is going to be a
major player for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that confidence in the company remained high
despite Kalkhoven's departure because of the steps he and Straus
had taken to deepen the management team. JDS has been an aggressive
acquirer of smaller components companies, and in addition to
broadening its product line through these deals it has typically
retained senior management.
</P>
<P>
   ``When JDS and Uniphase got together, they really did create an
industry,'' said Chris Crespi, a BancAmerica Securities analyst.
``People realized you had to put together a lot of product lines''
to compete across the breadth of the fiber optic market, he said.
At JDS Uniphase, he added, ``even without the acquisitions, the
internal growth sequentially is very good.''
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase also reported earnings for its third fiscal quarter
Thursday. Excluding acquisition-related charges, it had earnings of
$85.8 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, up 158 percent from
$33.2 million, or 5 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 155 percent, to $394.6 million from $154.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase shares fell $5.75, to $86.75, in heavy Nasdaq
trading. The shares have surged 345-fold since Uniphase went public
in 1993 and have more than quadrupled since the merger with JDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we were a $200 million company,'' Straus said in
a telephone interview. ``Now we are a $1 billion company, and we
want to be a $4 billion company very soon. So we have a
considerable task in front of us, but I think our agility and
flexibility will continue to be the driving force.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Straus, a refugee from Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, co-founded JDS
Fitel in 1981 and served as its president and chief executive from
1993 until its merger with Uniphase. Bringing the two companies
together joined JDS Fitel's leadership in passive optical
components, like attenuators and distribution devices, with
Uniphase's expertise in active components, like semiconductor
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   With customers like Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies, JDS
Uniphase has been well positioned to ride the commercial explosion
of fiber optics. ``We have a natural transition from electrical to
optical in the core parts of the network,'' Crespi of BancAmerica
said. ``The volumes are humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   Straus has been in charge of production since the merger, while
Kalkhoven focused on strategic acquisitions. Straus will be
succeeded as president and chief operating officer by Charles J.
Abbe. Abbe joined JDS Uniphase as part of the February acquisition
of Optical Coating Laboratory of Santa Rosa, Calif.

USA NETWORKS BUYS 2 DIGITAL CABLE TV CHANNELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Networks Inc. has acquired two digital cable television
channels for approximately $100 million, company executives said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Diller, the USA Networks chairman, said his company had
purchased North American Television Inc., a Canadian concern that
owns the Trio network, and News World International.
</P>
<P>
   Those networks are only available through digital television
services offered by providers like DirecTV and Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Trio, an arts and entertainment network, can be viewed in 7
million homes. News World International, which shows newscasts from
around the world, is available in 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the continued growth of digital TV, Diller said he expected
the networks' distribution to grow significantly during the next
couple of years and predicted that they would eventually become a
significant part of his cable TV empire.
</P>
<P>
   Diller said he would spend ``hundreds of millions of dollars''
over the course of the next few years to produce new programming
for the two networks, which do not currently have very high
production values.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Diller said, he would like News World
International to run first-rate documentaries and to feature
in-depth discussions of issues. Trio, he said, will delve even
deeper into the popular arts, including jazz and the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got big, big aspirations and we're willing to invest
what I think anybody would call serious money to get there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks does not own other TV networks that strictly
feature nonfiction programming. Its USA network runs entertainment
shows like ``La Femme Nikita'' and ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' Its
Sci-Fi Channel is geared to science-fiction enthusiasts with shows
like ``Sliders'' and ``Farscape.'' USA Networks also owns two
shopping networks.
</P>
<P>
   Since America Online announced that it was buying Time Warner
Inc., industry observers have said that they expected Diller to
announce a major deal of his own.
</P>
<P>
   This latest acquisition marks but another small, calculated step
on his part to expand his businesses.
</P>
<P>
   However, he recently said that he was interested in buying more
traditional media properties.

SCHOOL STAR ON TARGET TO JOIN SUB-4-MINUTE MILERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va., Kan.)  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Marty Liquori became the third high school miler to break
four minutes in the 1960s, he remembers calling his coach and
saying, ``This is great and all that, but I wonder who will do it
next year?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Fred Dwyer, who coached him at Essex Catholic in
Newark, replied, ``No, this is going to be very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   How unusual, Dwyer could not have known. Liquori ran 3 minutes
59.8 seconds on June 23, 1967, in Bakersfield, Calif., carried
along by the world-record pace of Jim Ryun. In the 33 years since
then, not a single schoolboy miler has breached four minutes, a
particular lapse that symbolizes the general decline of U.S.
distance running.
</P>
<P>
   The next serious mile challenge will come Saturday night in
Charlotte, N.C., when Alan Webb, a junior from South Lakes High in
Reston, Va., attempts to accomplish what only Ryun, Liquori and Tim
Danielson have done in their pre-college careers _ run four times
around a track with a pace below one minute a lap.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six years after Roger Bannister became the first runner to
go under four minutes, the mile retains a certain magic. It is
seldom run anymore, but it remains the last holdout against the
metric onslaught, with its familiar measurement of yards and feet
and its requirement of enervating resourcefulness. The 1,500 meters
at least retains Olympic familiarity as the metric mile, but the
distance run frequently in high school is the 1,600. While the
1,600 is closer in length to the mile _ just slightly less _ it is
a distance with no emotional resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mile is that combination of speed and endurance for a long
enough period of time that, if you happen to blink, you won't miss
the race, as you would in a short sprint,'' said Ryun, now a
Republican member of the House of Representatives from Kansas.
``It's a distance people can identify with. One of the things that
has hurt us is, we felt we had to go to the metric system. It
confuses people about distance. The 1,600 meters is not a mile.
Just what is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Living in suburban Washington, the 5-foot-8-inch, 140-pound Webb
has twice met Ryun, who ran the mile under four minutes five times
while in high school in Wichita, Kan. His national schoolboy record
of 3:55.3 still stands after 35 years. Last year, Webb broke Ryun's
sophomore record with a time of 4:06.94. Last month at the Penn
Relays, the 17-year-old Webb ran a 1,600-meter leg of the sprint
medley relay in 3:59.9, which converts to a 4:01.03 mile.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun advised Webb to stick to his own training program and told
him to surround himself with people who will help him facilitate
his dream instead of telling him it will be impossible to achieve.
He also cautioned that the ability to handle mental pressures will
be as challenging as the physical requirements to run under four
minutes. Webb's workouts indicate that he is on target. He has
recently run 800 meters eight times in descending order from 2:14
to 1:55 on 2-3 minutes' rest, and 400 meters 12 times in 58-59
seconds, with 30-45 seconds' rest between each lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you think you can do it, don't hesitate,''' Webb
said of Ryun. ``He said when he was younger, some people said, `You
should wait until you're older to really push.' He told me not to
hold back. I think I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't a high schooler broken four minutes in three decades?
There are many theories: training has evolved from high mileage to
long, slow distance. (``Some coaches feel it is child abuse to make
guys run 80 miles a week,'' Liquori said.) Compulsory physical
education has lapsed, while increased opportunities to compete in
other sports such as soccer and lacrosse have siphoned potential
distance stars. The awarding of college scholarships to foreign
runners has diminished the motivation of U.S. high schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the '60s, there was a different work ethic in which
young athletes recognized that you had to invest a certain amount
of time to arrive at a destination,'' Ryun said. ``Today, it's more
like, `I want it now.' Instant gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb appears to have two things in his favor, aside from immense
talent. First, his coach, Scott Raczko, is a former runner at
American University, and not a football coach who works with track
in the spring. He has Webb training between 40 and 55 miles a week
and is careful not to overrace him and to allow for sufficient rest
and recovery. Second, Webb appears not to be obsessed with four
minutes as a barrier. His ambition this season is to run even
faster, breaking Ryun's junior national record of 3:59, and
achieving the 3:58.14 he would need to qualify for the Olympic
trials at 1,500 meters in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what has hurt some of the kids who tried in the '90s
was just that, the four-minute mile,'' Raczko said. ``It's a mental
thing. If you're driven just to get to four minutes, you're in
trouble. Four minutes is not a barrier for Alan. He is shooting for
3:58, so he's confident about 4:00.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident and determined that he is skipping his high school
prom Friday night to rest for Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 46 years ago, they were saying it was physically
impossible for humans to run under four minutes,'' Webb said.
``That's the coolest thing about all this. It's why I get excited.
It's the only thing that makes 3:59 anything more than taking five
seconds off my best time. It wasn't that long ago that they thought
no one could do it.'' &QL;

NO JOB OFFERED, JARVIS SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis, the St. John's basketball coach,
acknowledged Thursday that his agent had spoken with the Washington
Wizards. But Jarvis said there was no offer on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said his lawyer, Robert Ades, met with the Wizards'
Michael Jordan, the head of basketball operations, Thursday but
characterized the discussions as informational. He was careful not
to say he was Jordan's top candidate; that was a mantle that former
Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens assumed prematurely last week. He
also cautioned that if he received an offer, it was not a foregone
conclusion that he would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking and listening,'' said Jarvis of the discussions
between Ades and Jordan. ``He's gathering information. Negotiations
would not be the right word. People are talking. I have to be
prepared before an offer is or is not made. Once I make a decision,
I've got to be comfortable with it. You can't go into anything
blindly. I have the world's greatest respect for Michael Jordan,
but he will be just one factor in the decision. You make a list.
You list pros and cons. Reasons why you would and wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Jordan was in no hurry to make a decision even
though the former Bulls star has indicated that he would like a
head coach in place before Sunday's league lottery draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody knows Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan is not
stupid,'' Jarvis said. ``Michael Jordan is not going to offer a job
unless he is absolutely sure I'm going to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the process, Jarvis said: ``This is a great
educational opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis also said he would not be intimidated working for Jordan
and handling pro players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when the time comes that I'm offered the job, I would
not be any more worried about that than when people said I couldn't
go from high school to college,'' he said. ``In any business, you
make sure you surround yourself with a great staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said he planned to attend the Big East meetings in
Florida, which begin Monday. &QL;

DONALD COGGAN, 90, EX-ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Donald Coggan, a former archbishop of Canterbury and
the first spiritual head of the Church of England to support the
ordination of women, died May 17 in a nursing home in southern
England. He died after a long illness, according to a statement
from Lambeth Palace, the official home of the archbishops of
Canterbury. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to 1980, Coggan brought progressive ideas, scholarly
training and passionate evangelism to his leadership of the 30
million Anglicans in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed the ordination of women at the Lambeth Conference of
the world's Anglican churches in the 1970s, despite fierce
opposition from other denominations. He had broached the topic with
Pope Paul VI in 1975, in a letter asking for the pope's views.
</P>
<P>
   Paul wrote back that it was impossible ``for truly fundamental
reasons,'' citing the example of Christ in choosing male apostles.
The Church of England did not ordain women until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop used his training in Semitic languages to improve
relations between Christians and Jews. ``He will be remembered
particularly for his remarkable contribution to the New English
Bible and Revised English Bible, and for his unfailing support for
the Council for Christians and Jews,'' said the Most Rev. George
Carey, the current archbishop of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Coggan, a slim, bespectacled man, cleaved to broad themes in the
pulpit. He denounced racial intolerance and nuclear weapons and
promoted a renewal of faith _ calling on churches to train
``Christian commandos'' _ but did not immerse himself in the myriad
smaller conflicts of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In sermons, he urged bishops not to be merely
``super-executives,'' despite the many administrative demands upon
them, but to be ``on the lookout for the surprises of the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in London on Oct. 9, 1909, he became an accomplished
student at Cambridge University, receiving honors in Oriental
languages. He went on to become a lecturer in Semitic languages at
Manchester University from 1931 to 1934. A prominent biblical
scholar who wrote nine books, he became a professor of the New
Testament at Wycliffe College in Toronto from 1937 to 1944, then
was principal of the London College of Divinity until 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He undertook religious duties even as he pursued his scholarly
career, having been ordained in 1935. For three years, he served as
curate at St. Mary's Church in Islington, North London, where he
allied himself with the evangelical wing of the church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, he was appointed bishop of Bradford. During his tenure,
he presided over a new translation of the Psalms. A commission that
included T.S. Eliot worked with him to revise the Miles Coverdale
translations of 1539. ``Our aim was invisible mending,'' he said,
when the new Psalter for the Church of England came out in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed the 101st archbishop of Canterbury, in
1974, his reputation as a personable man, not just a scholar,
preceded him.
</P>

   ``He was known as the friendly archbishop,'' said the Rev.
Stuart Burgess, president of the Methodist Conference and chairman
of the York District of the Methodist Church. ``People in York
still talk of how he would walk through their streets and stop to
talk to people.''
</P>
<P>
   When selected for the post by Prime Minister Harold Wilson,
Coggan took four days to accept the offer. As he said, ``The prime
minister wanted the answer earlier, but I wanted time to say my
prayers and talk to my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired as archbishop in 1980, and was named to the House of
Lords, becoming Lord Coggan of Canterbury and Sissinghurst.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Jean, and two daughters, Ann and
Ruth.

AN AMERICAN IN JALISCO: LIVING OUT A TEQUILA DREAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.J.)  (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By ALICE FEIRING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entrepreneurial challenge is not a new concept to W. Park Kerr.
After all, he and his mother had started the El Paso Chile Co. by
selling chile ristras, or garlands of red-hot chiles, on a roadside
in El Paso, their hometown. Now, 20 years later, the close-knit
family business _ which includes his mother, Norma; sister, Monica;
and brother-in-law, Sean _ makes a line of salsas, hot sauces, dips
and chips that brings in more than $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though business was great, Kerr hit a self-proclaimed midlife
crisis a few years ago and was itching for a new cross-border
thrill. ``In our company, any family member with a really good idea
can pitch it,'' he said. ``So, I said: `I want to make tequila. Are
you guys in?' They gave me $30,000 and a credit card to explore the
venture with their blessing.'' (So far, he has spent about a
half-million dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   His decision to enter an already crowded market and take on
another country's national obsession raised eyebrows in the spirits
industry. Those who know the Mexican tequila world had their doubts
that Kerr could accomplish his goal of making a custom-distilled
premium product. After all, the non-Mexican companies in the
business were just distributors, buying ready-made tequila and
slapping private labels on it, like Don Eduardo, from Brown Forman,
or Porfidio from Martin Gassl.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Emmons, an industry consultant who wrote ``The Book of
Tequila,'' said: ``The Mexicans jealously guard their tequila. It's
highly unlikely that any outsider could pull this off.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Denton, who imports two premium tequilas, El Tesoro and
Chinaco, was also skeptical. ``No one rents out their distilleries
for an American to come and make their tequila, believe me,'' he
said.''
</P>
<P>
   But the charismatic Kerr was able to convince a distiller to
make a tequila the way he wanted it. After almost three years in
development, the El Paso Chile Co.'s new offering, Tequila Nacional
Silver, has hit the United States market 6,000 bottles strong. The
tequila, already available in Texas, will reach stores in New
Jersey this week, with New York and several other states to follow
in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy, Kerr said recently over a perfectly chilled
margarita (with salt). But perseverance and connections helped.
</P>
<P>
   Learning all he could about the tequila process went smoothly
enough. He hired a Mexican bottle manufacturer that, in turn,
introduced Kerr to its distillery clients. Such links were crucial.
``These people are very traditional,'' Kerr said. ``It's probably
only because of the personal nature of my introduction, and that I
speak Spanish, that I eventually won their trust.'' He learned
about growing, harvesting and distilling the spiky agave plant's
fruit, the pina, which looks something like a pineapple on steroids
and can weigh 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   By last winter, Park was ready to contract with a distillery,
though he had a laundry list of criteria. It had to be midsized _
small enough so an extra $500,000 in annual income would make a
difference, yet large enough to handle the planned volume. It could
not have competing brands in the United States. It should be in Los
Altos, in the state of Jalisco, where, Kerr said, ``the earth is
red and the agave grow sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not all: The tequila would have none of the ammonia
nitrate, flavoring or urea often used in commercial tequila. The
pinas were to be roasted before fermentation in the traditional
adobe ovens called hornos, and the distiller had to agree to roast
the fruit slowly and to let it cool for a full 24 hours before
distillation, to improve taste. Kerr wanted to supply his own yeast
and yeast food. He insisted on potstills made of stainless steel
instead of copper, for a purer flavor. To ensure purity, all
production had to be above ground, in an immaculately clean plant
free of chemical contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell you my favorite story?'' he asked. ``I visited one
distiller who was very proud of how clean his plant was, because
every day he scrubbed the machinery and floors down with Pine-Sol.
What do you think his tequila tasted like?''
</P>
<P>
   Distillers he visited told him to be a good boy, buy ready-made
tequila and put his own label on it. Who would know the difference?
Once the distillers understood that Kerr, an American businessman,
was seeking control over how his tequila was made, none would play;
they did not return his phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   As despair was setting in, Kerr met Thomas Fernandez, the owner
of Coca-Cola bottlers in five Mexican regions, at a cocktail party.
``I play in two worlds _ America and Mexico,'' he said he told
Fernandez in frustration. ``I live on the border. I speak Spanish.
I love everything about this culture and its food. Yet no one
understands me.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez thought that one of his sons might be able to help.
When Kerr got together with Miguel Fernandez, a man of American and
Mexican parentage who attended schools on both sides of the border,
he knew he had found an ideal ally.
</P>
<P>
   With the younger Fernandez at his side, Kerr found, distillers
were willing to talk about the project, and he could begin choosing
instead of begging. ``Out of 20, five were out because they were
too big, five others because they were too small,'' Kerr said.
``Seven didn't make the cut because of integrity and cleanliness
issues _ which, believe me, is a big deal down there. We finally
came down to a list of three distillers. One guy at the last minute
balked at our bringing our own yeast and distillation techniques
in, and then it came down to price. One guy wanted to charge us $10
a liter of tequila, which is a huge amount of money. In April we
finally went with Destileria San Isidreo, who agreed to all of the
terms.''
</P>
<P>
   As in-country coordinator for Tequila Nacional, Fernandez
interprets the intricate Mexican culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about strategic partnering with someone in Mexico with
fluency on both sides of the border, who can understand American
urgency and Mexican politics,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Destileria San Isidreo agreed to use Kerr's recipe,
Fernandez is on hand to oversee it personally. He springs surprise
distillery visits, makes sure no rotten or blighted agaves get into
the mix and reminds the distiller why the pinas have to be washed
before they are split and thrown into the hornos.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said the distiller, whose own approach to planning and
organization was very different from Kerr's, was ``finally open to
our advice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The project has gone relatively smoothly, though the Mexican
government paperwork has been a bureaucratic nightmare,'' Fernandez
said. ``If a word is misspelled or an `i' not dotted, the document
is returned for correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr said he admired some aspects of the Mexican system. ``Here,
we got our trademark in three months,'' he said, ``way shorter than
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the task is to make Tequila Nacional stand out on crowded
retail shelves. Kerr made a point of thinking about this early and
often, and he had an established company with related products in
his corner. Leveraging and capitalizing on El Paso Chile's current
market position _ it is the industry leader in the highest-priced
tier of the salsa market _ the company started guerrilla marketing
before there was anything to sell.
</P>
<P>
   It introduced a line of salsas called Borracho (``drunk,'' in
Spanish) with the words ``made with Tequila Nacional'' displayed on
the labels, as well as a margarita mix and margarita salt. ``The El
Paso Chile Co. Margarita Cookbook,'' published last May, included a
full-color reproduction of the Tequila Nacional label. Kerr is
banking on niche marketing and brand allegiance for the tequila,
which will have a retail price of about $35 to $40, midpriced for a
premium brand.
</P>
<P>
   Denton, the importer who thought it was impossible, conceded
that Park Kerr appears to have beaten the odds by bringing a
custom-distilled tequila to market. But like Kerr's Mexican
distiller, he does not see why Kerr insists on having the agaves
washed before roasting. ``Nothing can live through distillation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr's response: ``I'm a little obsessive.'' &QL;

PRICE OF AVERAGE MANHATTAN APARTMENT TOPS $700,000 IN SURVEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing a seemingly inexorable climb, the average
price for apartments in much of Manhattan jumped by nearly a third
over the last year, breaking the $700,000 mark for the first time,
according to one of the real estate industry's most comprehensive
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for an apartment south of West 116th Street
and East 96th Street rose to $733,860 during the first quarter of
2000, a 31 percent rise from the $559,204 average recorded in the
first quarter of 1999, according to the study, the Douglas Elliman
Manhattan Market Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time ever that the average has exceeded
$700,000,'' said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the
appraisal company that prepares the quarterly report. Miller said a
major contributor to the jump in the overall average price was an
increased proportion of larger apartments in the quarter's sales.
</P>
<P>
   The $733,860 figure represents a 77 percent increase over the
average price of $414,187 recorded in 1995 _ during the
bottoming-out of the last real estate recession _ and 62 percent
over the $453,909 average in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are crazy, but it's still not the 80s in terms of
percentage,'' Miller said, pointing out that between the fourth
quarters of 1985 and 1986, the overall average price rose 49.1
percent, to $580,282 from $389,170. Adjusted for inflation, that
1986 average of $580,282 would be $906,458 today.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, put the current
increases in perspective. ``We're in an era of setting economic
records,'' Hughes said. ``Each month, we break the record for the
longest economic expansion in history. Manhattan has become one of
the major locomotives of this record-setting, and it would be
shocking if this were not reflected in surging housing prices in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This now rivals the boom of the 1980s in terms of a single
year,'' Hughes said. ``The difference in the 80s was that the price
surge was sustained over a seven-year period. This current boom has
really only taken off the last two years. As long as the national
economy keeps expanding, the price momentum in Manhattan will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is not the only place in the country where price rises
have been breathtaking. In Santa Clara County, Calif., which
includes most of Silicon Valley, the local association of Realtors
reported in April that the average price for a single-family home
hit $702,165, a 37 percent increase from $513,085 in April 1999,
and that the average price of condominiums and town houses had
jumped 30 percent over the same period, to $341,167 from $262,139.
</P>
<P>
   The Elliman first-quarter report was based on 2,313 closed deals
for both co-op and condominium apartments, representing about 75
percent of the market's volume. It does not include sales of less
than $75,000, Miller said, because there are so few transactions
below that mark ``that they are insignificant to the overall
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board
of New York, expressing concern that the Elliman numbers might
scare off potential buyers, pointed out that the report did not
cover northern Manhattan and that prices for smaller apartments
throughout the borough, while increasing significantly, were more
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Placing the Manhattan numbers in geographical context, Kevin
Thorpe, an economist with the National Association of Realtors,
cited the median price for an existing single-family home in the
Greater New York Region, which the association defines as the city
and certain suburban areas. The median was $221,500 in the first
quarter of 2000 _ a rise of 14.3 percent from the $193,800 median
in the first quarter of 1999, and 6.5 percent above the median of
$207,900 at the end of last year. The median price is the point at
which half the sales were above that figure and half were below it.
</P>
<P>
   The Elliman Manhattan survey found that the average price for
condominiums had increased 40 percent in a year, from $682,094 in
the first quarter of 1999 to $952,761 this quarter. ``That's a
staggering increase, since we have never seen the quarterly average
for condos exceed $700,000,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking down the condominium category by apartment size, the
average price for a studio in the first quarter of 2000 was
$243,667, up 38 percent from $175,986 in the first quarter of 1999.
For one-bedrooms, the average was $387,961, a 7 percent increase
from $361,397 a year ago. The two-bedroom average this year was
$958,202, up 8 percent from $888,093.
</P>
<P>
   For three-bedrooms, the average price was $1,997,053, a 75
percent jump from $1,140,600 in the first quarter of '99. (Miller
attributed that increase to great demand for the few available
properties.) For condos with four or more bedrooms, the average
price in the first quarter of 2000 was $4,118,750, a 7 percent
increase from $3,836,414 in the first quarter of '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory for the change in the overall average is that there
has been a shift to larger units; a significant increase in the
number of two-bedroom sales relative to the rest of the market,''
Miller said. ``The two-bedroom apartment is becoming a
first-purchase preference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the co-op category, the Elliman survey reported the average
price increased 24 percent over the year, to $576,596 from
$464,692. ``That's the highest average ever recorded for co-ops in
our study,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   For co-ops, by apartment size, the average price for a studio
was $142,060 in the first quarter of this year, up 19 percent from
$119,444 in the first quarter of 1999. For one-bedrooms, the
average was $291,675, a 28 percent increase over $227,229 in 1999.
In the two-bedroom category, the average this year was $760,578, up
39 percent from $547,407. For three-bedrooms, it was $1,858,576, up
44 percent from $1,294,840. And for those with four or more
bedrooms, the average price in the first quarter of 2000 was
$3,565,625, a decrease of 24 percent from $4,690,833 last year.
There are relatively few sales of apartments with four or more
bedrooms, so prices in that category are particularly volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about wary buyers, Beck of the real estate board noted
that the board's report covered all of Manhattan, ``so that our
figures aren't quite as euphoric, although they are wonderful.''
The median price for co-ops in all of Manhattan during the first
quarter of this year was $397,500, the real estate board reported,
up 14 percent from $350,000 in the first quarter of 1999.
Condominium prices were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Beck pointed out that more than 80 percent of all apartments in
Manhattan were studios, one-bedrooms or two-bedrooms. The median
price for those apartments, taken together, was $342,500 in the
first quarter of this year, up 12 percent from $306,000 a year ago.

EXPECTING FRAUD, CHALLENGER DROPS OUT OF PERU RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd graf for clarifications; adds new 9th graf with updating
on decision of National Elections Commission to go ahead with
election)  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The outspoken challenger in Peru's presidential
race said on Thursday that he was pulling out of the runoff
election scheduled for later this month because he believed the
vote would be a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The challenger, Alejandro Toledo, asked President Alberto K.
Fujimori to delay the vote to mid-June so international election
monitors could test computer systems to ensure a clean vote. Even
then, Toledo did not promise to participate unless he received
equal time on the main television stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori rejected such an idea before Toledo made the
request. For several days, Toledo had threatened to back out of the
race, and earlier on Thursday, Fujimori told campaign audiences
that he would not change the election day.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's withdrawal leaves Fujimori open to win a third
five-year term when balloting begins May 28. But it could prove to
be a Pyrrhic victory, capping a campaign tainted by international
observers' complaints of dirty tricks and tampering in the first
round of voting, on April 9. In that vote, the president fell just
shy of an absolute majority, forcing a runoff with Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Should Toledo and Fujimori hold firm, the Clinton administration
and the Organization of American States would be put in the
difficult position of having to validate an uncontested re-election
victory or reject it because of irregularities. A decision to
reject the election could lead the U.S. Congress and the OAS to
apply economic and political sanctions to Peru that would be
damaging not only to the country's weak economy but to its alliance
with Washington in the fight against cocaine trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Fujimori will not push the country over the
cliff,'' Toledo said at a brief news conference on Thursday
evening. ``We are firm. We will not participate in a fraudulent
election process like the one of the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   If history is any guide, Fujimori is not one to be pressured in
public. Over the last several days he has publicly pledged in no
uncertain terms that he would not change the election date no
matter what Toledo or the OAS' election observation team said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who say we should postpone the elections,''
Fujimori told a rally in the city of Chiclay on Wednesday night,
``but we just won't do it.'' He ridiculed Toledo, saying he was
trying to destabilize the country by traveling to Washington and
Buenos Aires, Argentina, in recent weeks to complain that the
election process had been so corrupted that it was probably
impossible for him to win.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the National Elections Commission, the final
authority on elections, announced that it would not change the
election date. Upon hearing the news, at a rally in Lima, Toledo
said: ``The dictatorship has taken the cruel decision of staying in
power. We will not allow five more years.'' He then called on
students to take to the streets in peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   In the April round of voting, ballots were counted over three
days amid calls by the Clinton administration and the OAS that a
second round was necessary to assure a fair result.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old, American-educated business professor, has
been threatening to drop out of the race ever since he came in
second in that vote, a tactic that has sometimes made him look
indecisive and like a sore loser. But on Thursday he was able to
use a new report by the OAS observation team calling for a delay in
the election as a buffer, as he claimed only to be following the
recommendations of a nonpartisan body invited by the Fujimori
government to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on Thursday, the organization's team
sharply criticized the election authorities for choosing an
entirely new computer software program for the May vote without
consulting foreign or Peruvian opposition monitors. The report
called on the government to postpone the election, in order to
avert a series of irregularities that plagued the initial round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   OAS monitors said there had been tampering with ballots, but
most important, it said that the disappearance of ballots and tally
sheets for hours at a time when they were supposedly being counted
made it impossible to verify the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This second round of the presidential election has to choose a
winner with a clear and transparent result,'' the report concluded.
``But confidence continues to be lacking and the calendar conspires
against recuperating that confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the new computer software, the report continued:
``When did they initiate the development of this new application
and why did the National Office of Election Processes not share
this information?'' It added that ``the election calendar makes it
impossible to do a complete test'' of the new software to assure
that it would give the opposition access to the final count as the
votes are being counted.
</P>
<P>
   In another press conference on Thursday, officials at the
National Office of Election Process disputed the OAS report. They
said they needed to change the computer program because unlike the
first round of voting the May 28 ballot would not include
congressional races. It also said that all of the software was
being properly shared with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In endorsing the findings of the report, Toledo said that even
if the vote was postponed, he would only participate if the main
television channels also gave him equal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty war against my candidacy must end,'' Toledo said,
referring to a campaign by several tabloid newspapers and several
television stations of either not covering his campaign or filling
its coverage with stories about his marriage, allegations that he
has an illegitimate daughter and claims that he has a drinking
problem.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aides to Toledo said they concluded that they needed to take
dramatic action to prevent fraud after they completed their own
study that showed that in scores of voting sites in remote
provinces Fujimori had inexplicably high vote counts last month. In
some vote tables, Toledo received no votes.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's aides again demanded on Thursday that the April
poll-watchers, who were chosen by lottery and used in the first
round to guarantee the vote, be replaced by new monitors in the
second round. But Fujimori's allies in Congress have refused to
change a law that requires that the same poll-watchers who worked
in the first round be used in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday night, Fujimori denied that there
would be any fraud or problems in the vote May 28. ``At this moment
there are no more irregularities,'' he said. ``They have been
overcome since the first round and now we are in the runoff.''

PHILLIPS TRIES AGAIN AND, THIS TIME, SUCCEEDS
</HEADLINE>
  By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernard Arnault is not a man who makes the same
mistake twice. Ever since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought
Phillips Auctioneers in October, Arnault, its chairman, has been
determined to make the house _ a distant third to Sotheby's and
Christie's _ a major player in the art world. Last week, Phillips'
first evening sale of important Impressionist and modern art was
something of a disaster: about 40 percent of the works went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Phillips tried again, this time with 39 works of
contemporary art. But this time Phillips was smart: estimates were
low, or at least at market prices. As a result, the sale totaled
$11 million, just under its high estimate of $11.2 million. Of the
39 works up, two failed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for contemporary art was great, as it had been
earlier this week at Sotheby's and Christie's, and buyers were
willing to pay mightily. Records have been set all week, and
Thursday night several more could be added to the list, for Agnes
Martin and Damien Hirst, among other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' sale included modern masters like Andy Warhol and
Martin, as well as trendier artists like Hirst and Robert Gober,
who has just been named to represent the United States at next
year's Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Craft Museum on West 53rd Street _ a space LVMH
has rented and spent more than $1 million to renovate for these
sales _ major dealers bid avidly, some for stock, others for
clients.
</P>
<P>
   But drawing a crowd must have cost LVMH a considerable sum. Of
the lots offered Thursday night, 30 came with some form of
financing from Phillips: a guarantee (an undisclosed minimum price
promised to the seller regardless of a sale's outcome), an advance,
a loan or a combination of the three. Often, competitors said,
Arnault had paid more for the works than their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensible estimates encouraged bidding. Among the star
works was ``Apple Orchard,'' a 1987 landscape by Gerhard Richter
that had recently been on view at an art fair in Munich. Lucy
Mitchell-Innes, the Manhattan dealer, won her battle against
another bidder, paying $1.6 million, nicely above the painting's
high estimate of $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another sought-after painting was Martin's ``Drift of Summer''
(1965), a white abstract grid. Estimated at $800,000 to $1 million,
it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.4 million after
five people competed for it. The price more than doubled the
artist's previous record, $525,000 for ``The Tree,'' a 1964 grid
painting sold at Sotheby's in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A record was also set for Hirst. ``Out of Sight, Out of Mind,''
a 1991 work consisting of two cow heads preserved in formaldehyde,
sold to an unidentified buyer for $552,500, far above its $400,000
high estimate. It eclipsed Hirst's previous record, set last year
when ``My Way,'' one of his pharmaceutical cabinet assemblages,
sold for $354,500.
</P>
<P>
   A salesroom announcement made before bidding was opened on the
piece explained that it was in London and had been cleared by
British customs. If the purchaser was in either Britain or the
European Union, the work could be picked up immediately, the
announcement said, ``but if purchased by a client in the United
States, U.S. Customs will require the new owner to sign an
affidavit stating that they will not use the medium in any way
other than for the purpose of an art exhibition, as to prevent the
potential threat of mad cow disease or any other hazardous epidemic
that can be associated with the natural decay of dead animal
tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Another work by Hirst was up for sale: the photograph ``With
Dead Head,'' part of an edition of 15 made from 1981 to 1991.
Estimated at $30,000 to $40,000, it went to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $74,000, the same price another print brought
at Christie's last year.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Phillips' commission, 15 percent of the
first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect
commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Sherman's ``Untitled Film Still No. 13'' (1978), a
photograph of a blonde reaching for a book, was estimated at
$80,000 to $120,000. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder
for $167,500. Christie's sold another print last May for $156,500.
A self-portrait of Sherman posed as an Old Master sold Thursday
night to an unidentified bidder for $79,500, just under its low
estimate of $80,000. On Tuesday night, a similar Sherman work sold
at Sotheby's for $269,750.

EDITORIAL: BLUNDERS IN LOS ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt left no doubt Thursday about
the National Park Service's responsibility for the disastrous Los
Alamos fire. A preliminary internal report, he said, found that
officials at the Bandelier National Monument had made several
critical mistakes. Among other things, they failed to fully
evaluate the risks before giving the go-ahead for a ``controlled
burn'' that quickly roared out of control, destroying more than 200
houses and apartment buildings and driving 25,000 people from the
city. They should also have had more firefighters on hand in case
the fire jumped its prescribed boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Having accepted responsibility, Babbitt and other officials have
two tasks. One is to see what can be done to improve the policy of
controlled burns, a generally successful technique for clearing
forests of debris and thus preventing even more devastating fires.
One possibility, Babbitt suggested, is to ```thin out'' the forest
in advance by clearing very small trees. The second task is to
arrange compensation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has already declared Los Alamos a disaster
area, but disaster relief is slow and often meager. The victims
could sue, but a law called the federal Tort Claims Act shields the
government from liability for a wide range of actions.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has already said, however, that ``if we were negligent,
we pay.'' That is certainly the right attitude. The question is
where to get the money. One possibility is to make the Park Service
pay, but the service is already woefully underfinanced. A better
idea would be an emergency congressional appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a precedent. In 1976 the Teton Dam in eastern Idaho
broke apart, killing 11 people and destroying 4,000 homes and
businesses. Five weeks later, after a preliminary investigation
suggested that the Bureau of Reclamation had built the dam on a
geologically suspect site, Congress approved a $200 million
appropriation to satisfy claims.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear yet how much the damage will amount to in Los
Alamos. But Congress could set aside some money now, and more
later. In any case, a congressional law seems the fairest and
fastest way to make the Los Alamos victims whole.

SPORTS COLUMN: DANEYKO PLAYS AGAIN, BUT IN A GAME TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J _ He seldom scores. For that matter, he
seldom shoots. But he is the New Jersey Devils' constant. If the
Devils are playing, Ken Daneyko is playing.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when too many professional athletes jump at the drop
of a dollar sign, the burly and bearded Daneyko is a dinosaur. He
has not only spent his entire NHL career with the Devils, he has no
desire to play anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Devils drafted me in 1982,'' he said, ``I didn't know
where New Jersey was except that it was near New York, but now I
couldn't imagine playing anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else could imagine that either. As the Devils lost, 4-2,
Thursday night to drop behind the Philadelphia Flyers, 2-1, in the
best-of-7 Eastern Conference finals, their 36-year-old defenseman
was playing in their, and his, 121st Stanley Cup playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Most hockey players are about goals or assists or penalty
minutes or shutouts, but Daneyko is about games, about consistency
and dependability. He vividly remembers certain moments in certain
games, but he wants to forget about Thursday night's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lacked a little jump,'' he was saying now. ``We were
sluggish for some reason. They capitalized on their chances and we
didn't. But we've got to stay positive. This is no time to panic.
We know now that Game 4 Saturday night is imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   In losing the last two games to the Flyers, the Devils hardly
resembled the defensive wall that eliminated Florida and Toronto in
earlier rounds, especially the virtually perfect sixth game against
the Maple Leafs only 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko's 1,070 regular-season games rank second (to Detroit's
Steve Yzerman) among active players with the most career games, all
with one team.
</P>
<P>
   On the all-time list, Daneyko's 1,070 games are tied for 11th
place with, coincidentally, Craig Ramsay, the Flyers' coach who was
a forward for the Buffalo Sabres. The leader is Alex Delvecchio, a
center in 1,549 games for the Red Wings, a total that is probably
out of reach for Daneyko, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll keep playing,'' he said, ``until I lose that passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, that passion has always separated Daneyko
from most of his 186 teammates. Growing up in Edmonton, he was a
14-year-old youngster in a summer hockey school where Mark Messier,
then only 17 but already in the World Hockey Association, was an
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mess told me, `I see the fire in you, keep working,''' Daneyko
said. ``That's what I've always tried to do. Just keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   When most hockey players reflect on their careers, they remember
a big goal or a big save. But Daneyko remembered big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won the last game of the season in 1988 on Johnny
MacLean's goal to get into the playoffs for the first time, that
was the turning point of the franchise,'' he said, alluding to the
struggle of the Devils' early seasons. ``I was on the ice when
Johnny scored but instead of rushing to him, we all just skated
around like little kids for a few seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost in passing, he added, ``I scored in that game.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not scored that often. Only 34 career regular-season
goals, none in 74 shots in the recent season. Only four playoff
goals, none since his goal in 1995, when the Devils won the Stanley
Cup with a four-game sweep of the Red Wings in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Shawn Chambers scored with about six minutes to go to
just about clinch the cup,'' he said, ``I finished that game with
tears coming down my face.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Devils battled the Rangers into overtime at Madison
Square Garden in the seventh game of a classic conference final
series, only to lose on Stephane Matteau's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't too dejected that year,'' Daneyko remembered. ``I
knew and we knew we had left everything out there on the ice. I had
a lot worse feelings the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the first-round playoff losses to Ottawa in six games
in 1998 and to Pittsburgh in seven games a year ago. But under
Larry Robinson's firm hand as coach now, the Devils resembled a
Stanley Cup contender until Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Larry came here as an assistant coach in 1993,'' Daneyko
said, ``he really taught me about positioning, how to use your
stick, how to deflect pucks, how if you see a big hit, take it but
don't run around wasting your energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko grew up watching Robinson, a Hall of Fame defenseman for
Montreal and a feared fist-fighter when aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I remember seeing Larry beat up Dave Schultz on
television,'' he said, referring to the Broad Street Bullies'
prince of the penalty box in that era. ``Those things stick in your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night's loss won't stick in Ken Daneyko's mind.

EDITORIAL: PROSECUTING FODAY SANKOH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade Foday Sankoh has led one of the world's most
brutal guerrilla movements. His Revolutionary United Front has
terrorized Sierra Leone by murdering thousands of civilians,
gang-raping women and girls, and chopping off the limbs of
suspected opponents. Sankoh's arrest this week is therefore welcome
news. It is imperative that he now be charged and tried for war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was a party to the 1999 Lome peace accord that was to
have ended Sierra Leone's brutal civil war. That accord failed in
part because it granted Sankoh immunity from prosecution for
previous war crimes, thereby reinforcing the cycle of violent
lawlessness in which the rebel leader and his murderous associates
have thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's forces have clearly broken their end of the bargain by
refusing to disarm and restarting the war. Whether the previous
amnesty should now be rescinded can be argued either way. But there
is no disputing that Sankoh's forces have committed countless
crimes since the accord was signed that would not be covered by the
amnesty. On these they should unquestionably be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, it is best for people to be tried in
the countries where they committed their crimes. But Sierra Leone's
government does not have the means to guarantee an orderly trial or
due process in such a highly charged case. Witness protection would
be impossible, and there is the danger of mob justice. Neighboring
Liberia's former dictator, Samuel K. Doe, for example, was captured
by a rebel gang in 1990, stripped naked and tortured to death. That
crude vengeance ratcheted up the cycle of violence and criminality
that continues to haunt Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   A trial for Sankoh must be conducted according to international
standards before impartial judges, affording the accused access to
counsel and the means to wage an effective defense. This is the
kind of case for which the International Criminal Court was created
two years ago. Since that court is not yet functioning, the best
approach is to create an international tribunal like those the
United Nations has established for Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia. It would have a mandate to try not just Sankoh but his
confederates, as well as leaders of other fighting factions that
have committed heinous crimes. Extensive evidence has already been
assembled by rights groups, but the United Nations should be
prepared to send an investigative team to Sierra Leone to document
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's arrest may complicate efforts to secure the release of
the remaining 270 U.N. peacekeepers held hostage by the rebels. But
it should now be clear that any attempt to enlist Sankoh as a
partner in peace is doomed to fail. Bringing him to justice is the
best way to curb the anarchy that lies at the root of Sierra
Leone's agony.

GIULIANI KEEPS AGONIZING, AND SO DO REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a nationally televised
town hall meeting in Manhattan on Thursday night that he still had
not reached a decision about his treatment for prostate cancer or
whether he would remain in the race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers now say the decision could come this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor told Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC, who was moderating the
meeting at the 92nd Street Y, that the decision about his treatment
had turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   When he discovered he had prostate cancer, the mayor said, ``I
put a whole process into place'' for making a decision. ``I kind of
approached it as if this was a big case, or a budget decision.''
But he learned, he said, that ``this is a different kind of
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It involves thinking about your life, mortality, the quality
of your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hourlong program, Mitchell frequently asked the
mayor if he regretted some of his most controversial actions of the
last year, including his verbal attacks on Patrick Dorismond, the
unarmed black man who was shot dead by police in March.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Giuliani said he regretted not having been
more sympathetic to Dorismond's family. ``In doing that I made a
mistake,'' he said, adding, ``I should have also conveyed the human
feeling that I had, the compassion, the loss of the mother. I think
if I could do it over again, I would have tried to balance it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani did not say he regretted releasing Dorismond's
juvenile police record, a decision for which he was criticized.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As Giuliani spoke, the state Republican Party continued with
plans to nominate him as its Senate candidate 11 days from now in
Buffalo. The party, which is operating on the assumption that the
mayor will run, has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on
``Rudy'' posters to be festooned all over the convention site. The
state Democratic Party nominated Hillary Rodham Clinton as its
Senate candidate on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans moved Thursday to turn up the pressure on Giuliani
to make a decision. A senior state Republican official said that
party leaders had contacted one of Giuliani's senior advisers to
warn him that the mayor's political future with the state party
would be in ruins if he dropped out of the race now _ unless it
turned out, the official said, that the mayor had additional
medical complications.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani's cautious deliberations are driving
Republicans, his campaign staff and the media to high levels of
irritation and anxiety, several prostate cancer specialists said
Thursday that the mayor was taking no longer to determine his
treatment than many other men. Many patients, doctors said, can
take months to decide. The delay is not a problem, they added,
because most prostate cancers are slow to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going through a process that lots of people go through,''
said Dr. Michael J. Droller, the chairman of the urology section at
Mount Sinai Medical Center, who is not directly involved in
Giuliani's case.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's two main choices are radiation or surgical removal of
the prostate. He said Monday that he had wavered between the
options, and said Thursday that he was not leaning in either
direction. He also said that the possible side effects were
complicating his decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``You find that that does sort of overlap into the thinking,''
Giuliani said, speaking at a new Steuben glass store on Madison
Avenue after a ribbon cutting. He added that ``it makes it more
complicated than it would be if I were making this decision
privately.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most men of Giuliani's age, 56, choose surgery, which doctors
say can have a cure rate as high as 95 percent. But side effects
include both incontinence and impotence. Doctors say the rates of
incontinence and impotence vary widely, depending on the patient's
age, his functioning before surgery and the skill of his doctor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association
last year, a team of scientists led by Dr. Janet L. Stanford of the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that almost
60 percent of patients were impotent after prostate surgery. But
Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, a specialist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center
in Baltimore who developed the ``nerve-sparing'' prostate operation
designed to preserve sexual function, said that 75 to 90 per cent
of patients under the age of 60 _ provided they were in the hands
of experienced surgeons _ recovered sexual function a year and a
half after the operation.
</P>
<P>
   A mayoral adviser said that Giuliani had spoken to at least a
dozen experts around the country and had recently traveled to
Baltimore to meet with Walsh.

COOK'S 66 SETS EARLY PACE AT COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
EDS: FIXES SLUG, HEADLINE AND BYLINE 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Fortunately for Keith Clearwater, he earns a living
by playing golf, not predicting its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after posting a 67 in Thursday's opening round of the
MasterCard Colonial, Clearwater dismissed himself as an
afterthought in the proceedings. Swirling winds, which reached 25
mph, were dying, and Clearwater envisioned bushels of birdies for
those who followed him down ``Hogan's Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone's going to shoot 6 under, and everything I'm saying is
going to be shuffled into the recycle bin,'' said Clearwater, the
1987 Colonial champ.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   It took a chip-in eagle by John Cook, playing in one of the
final three groups of the day, to bump Clearwater from a share of
the top spot on the Colonial leader board.
</P>
<P>
   Cook emerged from a blustery day at refurbished Colonial with a
66, almost six strokes below the average score (71.7) posted by the
110 starters in Thursday's opening round. Cook stands at 4-under
par, a stroke ahead of an eight-player group that includes
Clearwater, Davis Love III, Phil Mickelson and David Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is two strokes ahead of a five-player knot at 68 that
includes Irving resident Joel Edwards, Frank Nobilo and Rocco
Mediate. Cook is one of 25 players _ 10 morning starters, 15
afternoon starters _ who broke even-par 70 on a course that has
received a $3.5 million face-lift since the final putt dropped at
the 1999 Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover included 18 rebuilt greens and several repositioned
fairway bunkers. The result? Cook's 66 matched the highest score
posted by a first-round leader at Colonial since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who collected 15 pars, two birdies and an eagle, said he
was pleased to play a bogey-free round amid the swirling gusts. The
new greens, he said, were firm and created a guessing game on
approach shots when combined with intermittent winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to pull the right club out there,'' said Cook, who
began his round at 1:20 p.m., roughly an hour after Clearwater
finished. ``The afternoon (starters) didn't get the wind that the
morning guys did, but the wind really baked out the greens. When
you put this golf course with firm greens, low scores aren't going
to happen very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course has stood the test of time without making it so no
one can play it. It defies all of today's architectural standards.
It doesn't have to be 8,000 yards long, with forced carries over
bunkers, to make it difficult. I'm not that surprised by the
scores. You're not going to make many birdies around here. You have
to eliminate the `others.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In golf parlance, ``other'' is a score above bogey on a given
hole. Cook had none of those. That is why he got so much mileage
out of his chip-in for eagle at the sixth hole. Cook's 9-iron from
127 yards landed 12 feet short of the pin, rolled up to the pin and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this year's been going, I expected it to hit the pin
and bounce off the green,'' said Cook, who ranks 169th on the money
list ($46,231) and has not finished higher than 22nd at a PGA Tour
event this season. ``When it went in, I thought, `There we go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The shot allowed Cook to climb all the way to the top of a
leader board on a day when several headliners stumbled. Masters
champ Vijay Singh failed to post a single birdie in a round of 73.
That matched the score of Justin Leonard and Mark O'Meara, a pair
of former British Open champs, as well as Fort Worth native Hunter
Haas, the nation's top-ranked amateur. Fort Worth resident Mark
Brooks struggled home with a 75. Ben Crenshaw, a two-time Colonial
champ, ballooned to a 77.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask Len Mattiace, a member of the 3-under group, to
explain the soaring scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought scores would be lower,'' said Mattiace, whose round
included a 30-foot putt to save par and a 45-footer for birdie.
``When you played downwind shots, the ball would bounce and run.
When you played into the wind, the green would be receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trick, said Toms, was reading the new greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a tip from a local caddie who told me not to play as
much break as you might see,'' said Toms, who needed just 28 putts
during a round of 67. ``I thought the greens were perfect. But I
don't think they're breaking as much as they look like.''
</P>
<P>
   They broke enough Thursday to provide Clearwater, a member of
the Buy.com Tour, an extended stay on the Colonial leader board.
Barring rain, Cook said he expects no major changes in the final
three rounds.
</P>

HEAT ALL TOO AWARE OF WHAT LURKS IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Tim Hardaway looked around the locker room in the
afterglow of the Miami Heat's victory in Game 5 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no smiling,'' he said. ``Everybody is dead serious.
Check it out. We're going to New York to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat, which leads the playoff series against the New York
Knicks three games to two, is passionately mindful that the Knicks
have ended the team's season with first-round knockouts the last
two seasons, particularly last season when Allan Houston's winning
shot bounced off the glass and tantalizingly off the rim before
falling through the net with 0.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory of that shot is still there, big-time,'' P.J. Brown
said Thursday at American Airlines Arena before the Heat flew to
New York for Game 6 on Friday night. ``A lot of heartache and pain
went with it. Now we have a chance to close them out at the Garden.
To say the least, it would be a real good feeling to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Riley put it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' he said. ``We've been through a lot. There's not
going to be any real words by me or videos. It's going to be
straight up and straight down. It's time for us to step up and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Mourning wants his teammates to go into the Garden with a
feeling of desperation, to play as if the Heat trailed in the
series. He tried that approach in Game 2 after the Heat won Game 1,
and it failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a cushion we tend to relax and kind of exhale,''
Mourning said. ``I think if we go in with an attitude that it's a
must-win situation, we'll be able to finish it out. It's a matter
of carrying that mentality over from Wednesday's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning is aware that the Heat has won six of the nine games
played between the teams this season, including three of four in
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found ways to beat this team throughout the course of
the year,'' he said. ``But we have to learn to play better on the
road. That is our challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat seems to also feel that the team must prove it can end
the Knicks' season at the Garden _ with all the hostility and
history it represents _ in order to be a serious contender for the
National Basketball Association championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our chance to show we can close a series with
championship quality,'' Brown said. ``And I think we're ready to go
out and play our best game of this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Knicks win Friday, the decisive game would be Sunday
at Miami. The Heat has had too many disappointing finishes against
the Knicks to want to risk a Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a security blanket to us because it hasn't proven
successful,'' Dan Majerle said. ``We have to go to New York with
the mindset that we want to end it there and not leave it to one
game.''
</P>
<P>
   A season ago, the Knicks had a 24-rebound advantage in
eliminating the Heat in five games. This time, the Heat has 40 more
rebounds than the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our No. 1 priority going into the series,'' Riley
said. ``I think that's what got us beat last year. The difference
is simply big muscle. It's concentration. It's blocking out.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Riley is particularly happy that the Knicks' offensive
rebounding has been minimized. They have been held to fewer than 20
second-chance points in each of the Heat's three victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' the coach said.

 76ers FACING VACATION OR FINAL SHOWDOWN  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Allen Iverson was late for Thursday's practice,
but once the game begins, he is often a step ahead of everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Iverson, their enigmatic and electrifying guard, the
Philadelphia 76ers are trying to write a playoff run to remember.
</P>
<P>
   No National Basketball Association team has ever recovered from
a 3-0 deficit to win a four-of-seven game series. But the Sixers,
who lost the first three games of their series against the Indiana
Pacers, have reduced that margin to 3-2 heading into Friday night's
Game 6 in Philadelphia. If the Sixers win Friday in the energized
First Union Center, the decisive Game 7 will be Sunday in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, facing elimination no longer alarms the Sixers.
They have somehow turned the pressure into a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is the third time we'll be playing a game we have
to win,'' said Toni Kukoc, a Sixers backup forward who has
championship experience from his days with the Chicago Bulls. ``You
don't think about that anymore. You just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Few play the game with more zest than Iverson, who has averaged
28.2 points a game in the series to lead all scorers. Despite being
only 6 feet 1 inch, Iverson can dominate a game, either by making
long-range jumpers or by driving to the basket with an array of
moves and alarming quickness. His talent and his toughness have
made Iverson one of the league's special players, an All-Star who
has become the cornerstone of a franchise on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   But Iverson's penchant for lateness to practice, and several
disagreements during the season with coach Larry Brown, have also
been part of the package. Iverson joined his teammates on the floor
Thursday as practice was about to begin, but he was nowhere in
sight during the half-hour media session that preceded the workout.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Croce, the Sixers' owner, said Iverson would be fined for
his tardiness, but around the Sixers, Iverson's being late was
almost business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fined and I'll talk to him,'' said Croce, wearing the
wry smile of someone who knew that neither a talk nor a fine would
probably change the situation. ``I've talked to him before about
leadership, about the importance of timeliness. But believe me, his
teammates won't show any angst about it. They know him. They know
when he gets out on the floor during a game, he gives everything he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers squeaked out a 2-point victory in Game 4, then
dominated Game 5. But Game 6 will mark the return of Reggie Miller,
Indiana's All-Star guard who served a one-game suspension in Game 5
for throwing a punch at Matt Geiger, Philadelphia's center.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger was suspended two games for his flagrant foul against
Miller, so he will miss Friday night's action as well.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been magnificent in the playoffs, averaging 25 points
over all and 26 points against Philadelphia. After sitting out a
game, expect Miller to be even more eager to end this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers were well aware of Miller's penchant for rising to
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie can be quiet for three quarters, then hit three
3-pointers in a row,'' said Aaron McKie, a Philadelphia guard and
one of the players who will guard Miller. ``He's going to come out
and try to kill us. He's a showboat. He'll play to the crowd,
whatever. It's all fun to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But the series was more fun for the Pacers when they were making
more outside shots. In the first three games, Indiana was 28 for 62
from 3-point range, but in the last two games, Indiana made just 10
of 41 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jalen Rose, Indiana's second-leading scorer, has
become ineffective at an inopportune time. After averaging 35
points in the first two games of the series, Rose scored just 12
points in Game 3, 16 points in Game 4 and 13 points in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   If the Pacers make their outside shots Friday night and spread
Philadelphia's defense, Indiana has an excellent chance to prevail
and go on to face the winner of the Knicks-Heat series. But the
Sixers are the better rebounding team, and they have momentum. So
if the Pacers don't shoot well, Philadelphia could move closer to a
historic comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown our maturity by fighting back,'' said Theo
Ratliff, Philadelphia's leading shot-blocker, who has also averaged
15 points a game in the series. ``We're looking forward to another
game. We know we have a chance to do something that no team has
ever done.''

KNICKS BECOMING AN UNRAVELED TEAM ON AND OFF THE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ In one 72-hour mood swing, the same good-time
New York Knicks who were dizzy in the afterglow of their Sunday
victory began bickering on the floor by the second quarter of
Wednesday night's Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   That discord set the tone for the team's mental unraveling on
defense minutes before the final buzzer of their miserable loss in
Miami, a dispiriting defeat that left last year's Eastern
Conference champions one game from elimination as Friday's Game 6
at Madison Square Garden approaches.
</P>
<P>
   All of this was unsettling enough before another calamity
unfolded around 3 a.m. Thursday morning when the Knicks' team plane
landed in Westchester County. In a freakish incident, a large
amount of thrust was emitted from one engine as the plane neared
the team's parking area. The blast lifted coach Jeff Van Gundy's
Honda Civic and tossed it like a tumbleweed rolling over several
staff and player cars, including the Mercedes of Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say?'' Latrell Sprewell said. ``Things were
already bad and then to have that happen, it was the cap for the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time this season such destructive forces _
whether on the court or off it _ have existed in the midst of a
team that has generally been a dysfunction-free zone. With almost
everyone healthy and well fed by their contracts, with nearly
everyone safe and snug in their job security, the Knicks are
missing the kind of desperate air the Miami Heat has fed off to
take a three games-to-two lead in this four-of-seven-game,
second-round series.
</P>
<P>
   The less-talented Heat understands that if it is eliminated,
coach Pat Riley might dismantle the team and start over. And the
Heat is dead set on slaying the Knick demons that have dogged them
for two early offseasons. The Knicks, the year-long favorite to
reach the finals again, have been missing that little something
extra this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hunger,'' Houston said. `'Just that feeling of us
against the world. We don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a sign of that glorious, motivational
dysfunction sprouting in the cracks of the Knicks. Now, the Knicks
either win or get humiliated by the Heat. Now, Marcus Camby either
finishes strong with an offensive rebound or he could return to the
same fragile label he fought so hard to peel off last year. Now,
the vanishing Houston either shakes the crusty, throw-back defense
of Dan Majerle or he could find his All-Star status second-guessed.
Now, Patrick Ewing either puts a body on Alonzo Mourning or he
could end up mocked for his ``I'm Still Great'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of tension to galvanize the adversity-starved
Knicks. And it all was laid out before them in the team's film
session Thursday. ``It was like watching a horror flick,'' said
Houston, who noted that he has to assert himself more than he did
in Game 5, when he was 1 of 2 in the second half. ``It was hard to
watch. You wanted to say, Jeff, that's enough. We don't want to
watch this, but we have to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the moment Mourning missed two free throws and the
Heat won the wrestling match for the rebound in the first quarter,
and the time when Ewing called for the ball and Chris Childs
angrily directed him to set a pick in the second quarter. Both
snarled at each other for several minutes as the Heat overtook the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be together when things aren't going our way,''
Camby said. ``We can't have guys wanting the ball and then rolling
their eyes and not getting back on defense. It should be a group
effort and the ego and stuff should be put aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Van Gundy address the infighting during a
second-quarter timeout, he added a few more words about the issue
in the locker room after Game 5. ``You're fighting an opponent you
shouldn't be fighting which is yourself,'' Van Gundy said. ``Any
time the pressure is up more you have time to fall prey to that. I
think that obviously the more time you spend fighting amongst
yourself, the less time you spend fighting the opponent you should
be fighting. I just wish we could move on past it quicker. Say what
you've got to say and then go to the next play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks talked about moving forward Thursday by learning from
all of the mistakes they've made so far in this series. There was
plenty of material. Through the five games, the most glaring
breakdowns have occurred in the fourth quarter. In Game 5, the
defense was confused in its rotations and gave up three 3-pointers
in the last 2 minutes 30 seconds of the game. In Game 3, it was 8
costly turnovers during a fourth quarter, plus overtime. In Game 1,
there were 5 pivotal turnovers down the stretch. But in each game,
one common thread that needs attention has been rebounding,
particularly on the offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Heat poke at the Knicks every time. And since
rebounding is borne out of effort, this is the area that gnaws at
Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the ball,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's very simple. Hit
someone and go get the ball. Anthony Carter has 26 rebounds, more
than most of our big guys. If he can get the ball, you can get the
ball.''

EDITORIAL: A MODEL CHILD CARE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable turnaround over the past 10 years, the Defense
Department has transformed an abysmal military child care system
into a model for the nation, judging from a report by the National
Women's Law Center, a research and advocacy group. A decade ago,
military child care services were plagued with poorly trained
staff, extremely high turnover in caregivers, long waiting lists
and costs too high for many military families to afford. But child
care became a key personnel issue, and in 1989 the Military Child
Care Act mandated that improvements be made.
</P>
<P>
   The military created a network of child care centers, child care
in family homes and before- and after-school programs. It nearly
tripled the number of child care slots, and established training
requirements, safety and health standards and child-to-staff ratios
that are rigorously enforced. It also raised wages to $10 an hour
for experienced caregivers, significantly higher than civilian
scales. And it provided substantial subsidies to ensure that child
care is affordable even to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   These improvements would not have been possible without more
resources. The budget for military child care has risen from $90
million in 1989 to $339 million in the last fiscal year. Federal
and state policy-makers should make a comparable commitment to
improve child care in the civilian realm.

FBI MEMO DETAILS FREEH WARNING TO RENO
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Director Louis Freeh of the FBI warned in 1996 that
Attorney General Janet Reno and one of her top deputies should
remove themselves from an investigation into Democratic fund
raising after the aide was quoted as saying that Reno could lose
her job if the inquiry proceeded, government officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's warning, they said, was in a memorandum that the FBI
provided this week to Senate investigators who are reviewing the
Justice Department's investigation of campaign fund-raising
improprieties by Democrats in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum could cast new light on Reno's early decision
making in the investigation and her later decision to turn aside
the advice of Freeh and her own chief campaign finance prosecutor
and close an investigation into Vice President Al Gore. That
decision greatly eased Gore's burden as he prepared to open his bid
for the White House, but it embroiled Reno in harsh criticism that
she was seeking to protect her superiors. She has insisted that her
decision not to seek an independent counsel in the case was
motivated by a lack of evidence, not by any sort of political
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum is additional evidence of the deep, longstanding
split between Freeh and Reno, and its existence became known as
Reno received an internal report this week that faulted both the
Justice Department and the FBI for failures to cooperate in the
investigation of the nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee. Officials said
the report was especially tough on the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dec. 9, 1996, memorandum on the campaign
fund-raising investigation, Freeh recounted remarks attributed to
Lee Radek, the Justice Department's chief of public integrity, in
which Radek was said to have claimed that he was under considerable
pressure to scrap the investigation because Reno's job ``might hang
in the balance,'' the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had been widely quoted at the time as
suggesting that Reno might be asked to step aside and allow the
appointment of a new attorney general in President Clinton's second
term. The existence of the memorandum was first reported by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's memorandum, which was addressed to the bureau's deputy
director, William Esposito, recounted remarks made to Esposito by
Radek, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Radek was traveling in Europe Thursday and was not immediately
available for comment. But in a prepared statement released to The
Associated Press, he said he did not recall making such statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no recollection of ever saying I was under pressure
because the attorney general's job hung in the balance,'' Radek
said. ``Nor is it something I would have said because it has no
basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, the Justice Department spokesman, said Reno's
actions were based on the law, not on personal or political
considerations. ``This attorney general has never let her own
self-interest color her decision making,'' he said. ``She proceeds
by the book, based on the facts and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Rallying to Reno's defense, Justice Department officials noted
that the attorney general sent nine separate matters to independent
counsels for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a year after Freeh's memorandum, the officials noted,
Reno expanded the jurisdiction of Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel whose inquiry into the Monica Lewinsky matter led to the
president's impeachment in 1998. In Freeh's memorandum, which is
being studied by the House and Senate judiciary committees, he told
Esposito that he had confronted the attorney general and Radek and
urged them both to step down from the investigation, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno apparently refused, and the rift between her and Freeh has
widened considerably during Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Democratic fund raising began in the midst
of Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996, when Justice Department
prosecutors reviewed several instances of questionable fund raising
by senior Democrats, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president came under intensive scrutiny by prosecutors
over his activities at what was later described as a fund-raising
event at a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., in April
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Nov. 1, 1996, to a top federal prosecutor in Los
Angeles, Radek said the local investigation of the incident had to
be brought to a halt and turned over to the Justice Department in
Washington because of the potential for appointment of an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your office should take no steps to investigate these matters
at this time,'' Radek wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The temple inquiry eventually exonerated Gore, although it led
to an conviction of a California fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, who
helped organize Gore's visit to the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said initially that he did not know that the temple event
was a fund-raiser, although he later acknowledged that he knew it
was ``finance-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Hsia's conviction earlier this year has kept alive the political
embarrassment that the event caused for the vice president, the
putative Democratic presidential nominee this year. His opponent,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has vowed to make Gore's role in
campaign fund raising in 1996 a major issue in the campaign this
fall.

COURT UPHOLDS REJECTION OF GUILTY PLEA IN KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state's highest court ruled Thursday that a man accused
of strangling eight women in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., cannot avoid the
death penalty by pleading guilty.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the suspect, Kendall L. Francois, tried to
plead guilty to murder before prosecutors had decided whether to
charge him with capital murder and seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dutchess County district attorney, William V. Grady,
refused to accept the plea, saying that Francois did not have the
right to do so during the 120 days prosecutors are allowed after an
arraignment to decide whether to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, the day after Francois tried to plead guilty,
Grady announced that he would seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Francois appealed, saying their client could plead
guilty at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument was rejected in July by the Appellate Division
of the state Supreme Court, and Thursday, the State Court of
Appeals upheld that ruling. The unanimous decision by the
seven-member appeals court, written by Judge Howard Levine, found
that the state's 1995 death penalty law did not give capital murder
defendants the right to sidestep a district attorney's period of
deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   Until completion of that deliberation, Levine wrote, ``a capital
defendant does not have an unqualified right to plead guilty to the
entire indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Francois, Mark Harris of the state's Capital
Defender Office, said there were still several issues to be
resolved in the case but the matter of the guilty plea ``is sort of
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices noted that if the decision had been otherwise, ``it
would inevitably result, in the most heinous or high profile cases,
in an unseemly race to the courthouse between the defense and
prosecution to see whether a guilty plea or notice of intent to
seek the death penalty will be filed first.'' The murder trial is
expected to start this fall in Dutchess County.
</P>
<P>
   Francois is accused of strangling eight women and stashing their
bodies in the Poughkeepsie house that he shared with his family in
a 22-month killing spree. He was arrested in September 1998.

MICHEL KAZAN, 92, HAIRSTYLIST KNOWN FOR BOUFFANT HAIRDOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ENID NEMY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michel Kazan, who gave society and entertainment
figures the bouffant hairdo and created the coiffures for the
models of several fashion designers, died May 13 at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by historical styles, Kazan brought several famous
hairstyles to the modern world, not just the bouffant but the
pageboy and the French twist. In the mid-1960s, he came up with the
immensely popular idea of attaching little curls to hairpins, which
allowed women to simulate widow's peaks, bangs and curl clusters at
the crown of the head.
</P>
<P>
   He remained active until well into his 80s, and the Manhattan
salon at 16 E. 55th St. that he opened in 1961 still bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, '60s and '70s, Kazan created original hairstyles
for well-known couturiers like Lanvin-Castillo, Chanel and Jean
Desses in Paris and James Galanos in the United States. He adapted
his designs to blend with their individual collections; one of his
trademarks was the crisp, slicked-back, almost boyish styles used
in several Galanos shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, he coiffed social figures and celebrities on
both coasts, including Greta Garbo, Lee Radziwill, Natalie Wood,
Raquel Welch and Doris Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan was born in Russia of French parentage and went to Paris
as a young boy.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his first salon in Paris in 1934; in 1940, during
World War II, while France was occupied by the Germans, he left for
New York, which he had visited briefly the year before. Several
decades later, he still called his permanent entry to the United
States ``the best Christmas present in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early years here, he joined Helena Rubinstein, the
cosmetics empress, where he became chief stylist of the
hairdressing salon. He quickly became a byword in both the fashion
and social worlds. By the time that he left Rubinstein in 1961 to
open his own luxurious salon, there were branches in a number of
cities around the country, and he had become an international
authority on hairstyling.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he was associated with Bonwit Teller, leading to salons
in both America and Europe and to several unusual assignments,
including designing for theatrical productions and creating a new
hairstyle for about 1,800 Eastern Airlines stewardesses.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Kazan's New York salon served as a training ground for
young stylists who later went on to their own international
recognition. The best known is Kenneth, who became Jacqueline
Kennedy's personal stylist and still has a salon in the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan is survived by his second wife, Maria; their two children,
Roman and Zofia Kazan, both of Manhattan; three other children,
Micheline Best of Delray Beach, Fla., Jacqueline Ganden of Boynton
Beach, Fla., and Michel Kazan of Laguna Beach, Calif.; 9
grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan had originally hoped to become a plastic surgeon, but when
lack of money made that impossible, he attended art school. Years
later, he noted his satisfaction at being able to make women
beautiful without cutting their faces.

FOR ENTERTAINMENT, RICKEY'S A STEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's not often a newly acquired player helps two
sports teams in town.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it: Now that the Mariners have acquired Rickey
Henderson, the Sonics' Gary Payton is no longer Seattle sports'
only wild hair.
</P>
<P>
   Payton now can hurl all the TV remote controls at all the
teammates he wants. Few sports fans will notice.
</P>
<P>
   With Henderson, baseball's designated distraction, so much will
be happening that even the Experience Music Project building falls
to second in the public peeves.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get me wrong. Having Henderson around is wonderful.
Hey, I'm a sports columnist.
</P>
<P>
   He is to my job what hooker roles are to actresses: Disturbing,
yet exotic, and necessary to experience just to display range.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Mariners get out of this decision is secondary, and
can be explained in two numbers: $150,000 and .184.
</P>
<P>
   If Henderson is a complete bust as a player and more toxic in
the clubhouse than a paternity-suit rumor, the Mariners can cut him
for a cost of about $150,000 in salary _ almost exactly the wages
of the pool boy for Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   And .184 is the average of Mariners hitters in the leadoff
position this season. To give an idea how bad that is, well, it's
worse than Ken Griffey Jr.'s average in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the horror. Oh, the humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Though Henderson is old, he's not THAT old _ contrary to reports
elsewhere, he was a mere child, not an adult, when the Crusades
began _ and even on baseball fumes he can hit better than .184.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was hitting .219 this season with two stolen bases with
the New York Mets. But if the Mariners had that nearly 40-point
improvement all season leading off in front of Alex Rodriguez, John
Olerud and Edgar Martinez, we'd be talking magic numbers already.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, at 40, Henderson led the National League in on-base
percentage at .429. Even if age has caught up with him, he's not
too old to crouch his strike zone down to a pinhole. Camels have
better relationships with eyes of needles than pitchers do with
Henderson's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Once he's walked, just the threat of a theft by the greatest
base stealer in history has to shake up pitchers. In that way, he's
like Payton: Just standing there, he's annoying to opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Henderson is a liability in the outfield. He's
always had a mediocre arm, and watching him break on a fly ball the
past few years has been a little like watching a teenage driver's
first attempt to parallel park.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, for $155,000, what can be expected? If Henderson just
throws back whatever hits off the left-field wall, the problem is
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   The issue with Henderson has always been his attitude and its
impact on the several dozen clubhouses he's been in.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, chemistry as a baseball virtue is vastly
overrrated. Compared to most other team sports, there is very
little teamwork involved, unless it involves passing notes to the
dugouts from the halter tops circling the bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Little in baseball has changed. Casey Stengel once observed that
his major task as a manager was to keep ``the half of the team that
hates me from the half that hasn't made up their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the little picture, Henderson's litany of troubles rarely
involve teammates. Many of his former teammates say he's usually
been helpful, and almost never confrontational. And he's a media
magnet, saving many a postgame clubhouse when there wasn't much to
be said about a particular contest.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in sports is better at saying nothing in an amusing
fashion than Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   His conflicts lie almost exclusively with managers and
management. It's possible that in his 21 years as a major league
player, Henderson has never been played enough or paid enough, in
his own humble estimation.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of perpetual yap was probably at the heart of the
debate among Mariners bosses. There's no way that either general
manager Pat Gillick or club president Chuck Armstrong can look
forward to Henderson's complaints, laments, suspicions and
paranoias. They just finished with Griffey, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Merely getting ahold of the guy is a major franchise task. After
Henderson failed to show on the day expected at spring training,
Mets officials had 11 different phone numbers for Henderson. None
worked. Nor did his family or agents have a location.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lou Piniella, who handled Henderson somewhat
successfully when the Mariners manager skippered the Yankees in the
late 1980s, is persuaded that he can deal with any player, as long
as he is not a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to understand about Henderson is that he is
almost exclusively about himself. He is eager to become baseball's
career leader in runs scored and walks. As long as those goals
match team goals, things can work. If not ...
</P>
<P>
   Will he crash into a wall for a catch? No.
</P>
<P>
   If his often delicate hamstrings so much as twitch, will he go
from first to third on a single to right? No.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be accepting when he loses an at-bat to a defensive
substitution? No.
</P>
<P>
   But is he entertaining, eccentric and incorrigible? Oh my. Those
Hall of Fame skills are nowhere near gone.

RICHARD F. ARENS, 81, MATHEMATICIAN AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Friederich Arens, a mathematician steeped in abstruse
theories and abstractions, died on May 3 at a Los Angeles hospital.
He was 81 and a resident of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, said the University of California at Los
Angeles, where Arens worked for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Arens' reputation rested on his ability to simplify even the
most complicated mathematical problems. This made him a leading
light in the rarefied strata of functional analysis, function
algebras, field theories and quantization.
</P>
<P>
   He helped found the theories of functional analysis, which
observes infinite dimensional spaces, and Banach algebras, named
after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, which concern the
multiplication of continuous sets of numbers..
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and 1950s, he contributed to a theorem allowing
mathematicians to classify the infinite dimensional spaces that
arise in the study of high energy particles. Another theorem he
helped to establish shows that analytic functions of several
variables can be applied in the general setting of Banach algebras.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Dr. Arens shifted his focus to the mathematical
foundations of physics.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Iserlohn, Germany, he came to the United States at
age 6. He graduated from UCLA in 1941 and received a Ph.D. in
mathematics at Harvard in 1945. He returned to UCLA in 1947 after
two years at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. He
retired as an emeritus professor in 1989 but continued to research
and write. His final paper, on quantum information theory, was
published last year.
</P>
<P>
   Arens is survived by a son, Philip, of Los Angeles; a sister,
Hildegard Wuestenberg of Munich; and two half-brothers, Hubert
Arens of Hamburg, Germany, and Ludwig Arens, of Denia, Spain. His
wife, Helen Cornfeld Arens, a violinist and mathematics professor,
died in August.

EDITORIAL: DEMOCRATIC STIRRINGS IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 19:
</P>
<P>
   The attempted coup in the New York state Assembly this week had
a healthy feel to it at first, like a blast of oxygen that aroused
hope of energy and independence among the Assembly's Democratic
majority. Then, within a few hours, the attempt to overthrow
Speaker Sheldon Silver began to look less like an effort to change
the state Legislature's claustrophobic system than a plot to
replace one autocrat with another.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bragman, the second-ranking Democrat in the Assembly,
announced Wednesday that he would try to oust Silver in a showdown
vote next Monday. By the standards of normal combat, announcing
plans to storm the castle five days in advance would seem the
height of folly. Since the first word of the revolt, Silver has
unleashed an army of powerful backers to coax or threaten his
troops to support him, especially those teetering on the fence. The
speaker has also stripped Bragman of his position as majority
leader and demoted two of his close allies. Some old Albany hands
were predicting that by Monday Bragman would be lucky if his office
still had state furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of swapping the secretive and lethargic Silver for a
lively consensus builder is understandable. Over the last six years
Silver's methods have encouraged one of the worst traditions in
Albany _ the coalescing of legislative power in the hands of three
people: the governor, the Senate majority leader and the speaker.
Efforts to open budget sessions or simply to spread legislative
power have often been either rebuffed or simply ignored by the
speaker. Bragman's strength so far has been that he is promising a
``member-driven house,'' an innovation that is already decades late
in coming to Albany's insular and outdated legislative culture.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether Bragman's promises of openness are
sincere or simply a means to grab power. If the latter, the key
difference between Bragman and Silver could be a devastating loss
of clout in Albany for New York City. At present Silver, whatever
his shortcomings, is the city's sole voice in negotiations with the
governor and Senate leader.
</P>
<P>
   In his six years running the Assembly, Silver has sometimes
pushed for education funding, new transit money and other issues
that have aided city residents. On other occasions, however, he has
worried so much about re-electing Democrats in upstate districts
and the suburbs that he has misserved his urban constituents,
agreeing for example to end even the modest tax that commuters pay
for their use of facilities in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, who lives near Syracuse, generally has a political
agenda that is more suburban and conservative than Silver's, and
Bragman's views on abortion, campaign finance reform and gun
control raise troubling questions for traditional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver manages to quell this revolt, as most Democrats still
believe he will, he does not deserve to celebrate a victory and go
around the State Capitol methodically punishing the vanquished.
Instead the speaker needs to register this uprising as a dire
warning that there is trouble in his house and a hunger for
democratic reform among legislators who would like to do the work
for which they were elected. &QL;

UCLA RUNS PAST CANISIUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If playing UCLA _ one of the most storied programs
in college softball history _ didn't make Canisius dizzy, watching
the Bruins run the bases Thursday afternoon certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   The defending national champion Bruins set a NCAA Tournament
record with 10 stolen bases and beat the Golden Griffins 8-0 in
five innings in the first game of a double-elimination regional
tournament at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Natasha Watley also set a single-game tournament record
with four steals and tied, in just her second year, the school's
career stolen-base record of 31. The Bruins' total bettered the
seven steals by Kansas last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know UCLA has a reputation of not being a running team, but
look what we have here,'' Bruins coach Sue Enquist said. UCLA,
ranked No.1 in the region, advanced to face No.3 Long Beach State
at 12:30 p.m. (PDT) today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins executed three double steals and generally ran at
will against the No.6-seeded Golden Griffins. UCLA took advantage
of three Canisius errors, and Amanda Freed pitched a two-hitter,
walked none and struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were a little bit in awe about playing UCLA,''
Canisius coach Mike Rappl said. ``We were taking pictures in the
dugout. I try to stress the importance of playing ball, but I want
them to have fun, too.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA had all the fun Thursday. Freed led off the game with a
double and Watley followed with a walk. A double steal put runners
on second and third, and Freed scored on Julie Marshall's groundout
to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins added a run in the second and broke the game open in
the fourth. With the bases loaded and no outs, UCLA's Tairia Mims
hit a fly ball to right. Outfielder Nicole Guadagna first went in
but couldn't recover in time. The ball glanced off her glove, and
all three runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndsey Klein went 2 for 2 with two RBI and three runs scored.
Watley walked twice and reached on an error once. She stole second
base each time and stole third in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's other games, Leslie Malerich pitched a
three-hitter as Florida State beat Long Beach State 2-0, and No.2
Iowa beat No.5 Bethune-Cookman 9-1 in five innings. Today,
Bethune-Cookman and Canisius meet in an elimination game at 10 a.m.
(PDT), and Iowa plays Florida State at 3 p.m. (PDT). &QL;

`PLACE AD HERE' TAKES ON NEW MEANING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A half-page newspaper ad adorned with a palm tree ran in
Sunday's sports editions of the Hartford Courant and New Haven
Register. It said in part:
</P>
<P>
   (ital)Work in a cold environment? In a dead-end opportunity?
Want to heat up your career? Come join us in Los Angeles. ... Drive
your career forward and put your current situation in the rear-view
mirror. Send us your resume.(endital)
</P>
<P>
   The equal-opportunity employer who placed the ad, trying to
spread a little sunshine, was L.A.-based Fox Sports Net. So who in
Hartford, Conn., and New Haven, Conn., might happen to be the
target audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since it's graduation time, we just wanted to make sure people
at the University of Connecticut School of Broadcasting know where
to find us,'' said Scott Ackerson, the executive producer of Fox's
``National Sports Report,'' well aware that rival ESPN is in nearby
Bristol, Conn. _ since he used to work there himself as a producer
on ``SportsCenter'' with an anchor named Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   And what current anchor, producer, assignment editor, director,
key grip or coffee-go-getter who once upon a time worked at ESPN
with that supposed anchor-monster would want to come west to work
in the same building with him again?
</P>
<P>
   Says Olbermann of the ads: ``For those ESPN employees who can
afford to buy a newspaper, it's a godsend.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE FOX 'TUDE: Ackerson, a Midwesterner and East Coaster who's
been living in Southern California for the last six years, has been
on the cutting edge of the Internet-friendly, analyst-loaded
reshaping of the nightly hour-long highlights show that was
formerly called ``Fox Sports News.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the ``National Sports Report'' has taken the
typical ``SportsCenter'' format to new high-tech heights.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, says Ackerson, who was put in the executive
position for the show at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've taken a good first step,'' he said. ``We find
some people driving it more than others, but one thing we do like
is a lot people really trying hard (to make it work).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a decent amount of time to get it right.
We're taking a look at all aspects now and we're in the process of
filtering it.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the people I've talked to _ not in TV _ the most
universal thing they like is the analysts getting involved in the
highlights. Now we've got to get better at picking the right things
to show. We've lacked a bit in that and the reason is we're all not
used to cutting highlights this way. We're in a process of having a
`highlights seminar' to get everyone working (on the same page).
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of sharing what works, ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' has
already borrowed the live news-flash across the bottom of the
screen that Fox began using on its major highlights show.
</P>
<P>
   Which it borrowed from ESPN2's nightly practice. And didn't CNN
Headline News actually start it?
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows me, despite what you'll hear from our neighbors
to the north, is they do notice what we're doing, they care about
it,'' said Ackerson. ``It's up to us to push forward and after a
certain point, they'll say instead of Fox Sports Net is copying
from ESPN, ESPN is copying what Fox Sports Net does. Hopefully we
can get viewers to realize that.''

THE GOOD AND BAD BEHIND COMEBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Eight of the Angels' 20 victories this season
are come-from-behind wins, which can be a good thing and a bad
thing, according to manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about it is the Angels never feel they are out of
any game. Last month in Toronto, they rallied from an 11-1 deficit
only to lose 12-11.
</P>
<P>
   But Scioscia said falling behind early in games is a bad habit
to get into because it can put an added strain on the hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to reach our potential, we're going to have to
do a better job of shutting down clubs early in the game,'' he
said. ``Catching up is nice, but it can only take you so far. How
many times are you going to come back against a (Mike) Timlin or a
(John) Wetteland?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're not setting up our game plan saying, `Let's
hold 'em to five or six runs in the first four innings, then come
back and get 'em.' I have a tremendous amount of confidence in our
starting pitchers. Certainly our depth has been tested. But we have
enough to get us where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSER CLARIFICATION: Scioscia has been hesitant to use closer
Troy Percival in non-save situations, but he made an exception
Wednesday night when Percival entered the game in the top of the
ninth and the game tied at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Percival walked three batters in the inning, it
worked out. The Orioles didn't score and the Angels scored in the
bottom of the ninth on Scott Spiezio's RBI single to win it 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Percival will pitch the ninth inning in home games that are
tied,'' Scioscia said. ``But it depends on where the other
relievers are at the time, because I have just as much confidence
in (Shigetoshi) Hasegawa and (Mark) Petkovsek as Percival.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past Angels managers, Scioscia will not use Percival on
the road unless it's a save situation. &QL;

FAA ORDERS AIRLINES TO CHECK BOLTS ON BOEING 767 JET ENGINES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration issued an
emergency order on Thursday evening, telling all airlines that use
the Boeing 767 to check the steel bolts holding the plane's engines
in place, after an airline found damage on both bolts under one
wing and one of the two on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the order, the inspection must be completed
within five days, said Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the agency.
Brenner said the review would take five hours for each aircraft,
meaning it could be done during normal overnight maintenance, and
probably would not require any airlines to ground the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't expect any significant impact on the fleet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co., which manufactures the 767, itself advised its
customers on Thursday to conduct the inspection; the FAA made that
advice mandatory on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The bolts in question stop the engines from swinging from side
to side or twisting. There are two for each engine; the plane has
one engine under each of its two wings.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Verdier, a spokeswoman for Boeing, said that as of Thursday,
20 other planes had been inspected, and none showed bolt damage.
But on the plane where damage was found, two bolts were partly
cracked, and one was cracked all the way through, which ``gave us a
little bit of concern,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was one of the earliest off the production line, she
said. The first 767 was delivered in August 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA ordered the airlines to to report back within 20 days on
what they had found. The agency order applies to 120 aircraft
registered in this country. Another 110 are registered elsewhere,
although in practice, their operators are highly likely to conduct
the inspections as well.
</P>
<P>
   Counting the planes built since 1987, 785 of the 767 model have
been delivered. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World
Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways carry passengers on the
planes, and UPS and Airborne use them for cargo. The planes, which
can carry up to 285 passengers, make up more than half the airline
flights across the North Atlantic, according to Boeing.

FOR ENTERTAINMENT, RICKEY'S A STEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's not often a newly acquired player helps two
sports teams in town.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it: Now that the Mariners have acquired Rickey
Henderson, the Sonics' Gary Payton is no longer Seattle sports'
only wild hair.
</P>
<P>
   Payton now can hurl all the TV remote controls at all the
teammates he wants. Few sports fans will notice.
</P>
<P>
   With Henderson, baseball's designated distraction, so much will
be happening that even the Experience Music Project building falls
to second in the public peeves.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get me wrong. Having Henderson around is wonderful.
Hey, I'm a sports columnist.
</P>
<P>
   He is to my job what hooker roles are to actresses: Disturbing,
yet exotic, and necessary to experience just to display range.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Mariners get out of this decision is secondary, and
can be explained in two numbers: $150,000 and .184.
</P>
<P>
   If Henderson is a complete bust as a player and more toxic in
the clubhouse than a paternity-suit rumor, the Mariners can cut him
for a cost of about $150,000 in salary _ almost exactly the wages
of the pool boy for Mariners CEO Howard Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   And .184 is the average of Mariners hitters in the leadoff
position this season. To give an idea how bad that is, well, it's
worse than Ken Griffey Jr.'s average in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the horror. Oh, the humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Though Henderson is old, he's not THAT old _ contrary to reports
elsewhere, he was a mere child, not an adult, when the Crusades
began _ and even on baseball fumes he can hit better than .184.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he was hitting .219 this season with two stolen bases with
the New York Mets. But if the Mariners had that nearly 40-point
improvement all season leading off in front of Alex Rodriguez, John
Olerud and Edgar Martinez, we'd be talking magic numbers already.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, at 40, Henderson led the National League in on-base
percentage at .429. Even if age has caught up with him, he's not
too old to crouch his strike zone down to a pinhole. Camels have
better relationships with eyes of needles than pitchers do with
Henderson's strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Once he's walked, just the threat of a theft by the greatest
base stealer in history has to shake up pitchers. In that way, he's
like Payton: Just standing there, he's annoying to opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Henderson is a liability in the outfield. He's
always had a mediocre arm, and watching him break on a fly ball the
past few years has been a little like watching a teenage driver's
first attempt to parallel park.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, for $155,000, what can be expected? If Henderson just
throws back whatever hits off the left-field wall, the problem is
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   The issue with Henderson has always been his attitude and its
impact on the several dozen clubhouses he's been in.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, chemistry as a baseball virtue is vastly
overrrated. Compared to most other team sports, there is very
little teamwork involved, unless it involves passing notes to the
dugouts from the halter tops circling the bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Little in baseball has changed. Casey Stengel once observed that
his major task as a manager was to keep ``the half of the team that
hates me from the half that hasn't made up their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   In the little picture, Henderson's litany of troubles rarely
involve teammates. Many of his former teammates say he's usually
been helpful, and almost never confrontational. And he's a media
magnet, saving many a postgame clubhouse when there wasn't much to
be said about a particular contest.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in sports is better at saying nothing in an amusing
fashion than Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   His conflicts lie almost exclusively with managers and
management. It's possible that in his 21 years as a major league
player, Henderson has never been played enough or paid enough, in
his own humble estimation.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of perpetual yap was probably at the heart of the
debate among Mariners bosses. There's no way that either general
manager Pat Gillick or club president Chuck Armstrong can look
forward to Henderson's complaints, laments, suspicions and
paranoias. They just finished with Griffey, fergawdsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Merely getting ahold of the guy is a major franchise task. After
Henderson failed to show on the day expected at spring training,
Mets officials had 11 different phone numbers for Henderson. None
worked. Nor did his family or agents have a location.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Lou Piniella, who handled Henderson somewhat
successfully when the Mariners manager skippered the Yankees in the
late 1980s, is persuaded that he can deal with any player, as long
as he is not a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to understand about Henderson is that he is
almost exclusively about himself. He is eager to become baseball's
career leader in runs scored and walks. As long as those goals
match team goals, things can work. If not ...
</P>
<P>
   Will he crash into a wall for a catch? No.
</P>
<P>
   If his often delicate hamstrings so much as twitch, will he go
from first to third on a single to right? No.
</P>
<P>
   Will he be accepting when he loses an at-bat to a defensive
substitution? No.
</P>
<P>
   But is he entertaining, eccentric and incorrigible? Oh my. Those
Hall of Fame skills are nowhere near gone.

KOBE WILL GET HIS RING NO MATTER WHAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Let the heartbreaks commence. Kobe Bryant,
the Lakers' 21-year-old wunderkind, is getting hitched.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of female teeny-boppers everywhere, Bryant
confirmed Thursday he has become engaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' young shooting guard would not reveal the identity
of his betrothed, reportedly an 18-year-old senior at Marina High
School in Huntington Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about it, I walked behind Kobe and took a look at
him,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``He started wondering what
I was doing, and I asked him if he wasn't still wet behind the
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Aren't you a little young to get married?' And he
said, `Nah, I do everything young.' He's quite convinced he can
carry this out, and I'm happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said she was not a Hollywood starlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a movie star, she's my star,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a date had not been set, though the marriage would come
after The Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who signed a seven-year deal for $70.85 million before
last season, said he knew his life was about to undergo a
significant change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``In the past, I've been pretty much
all basketball, stressing myself out with that. She'll provide
balance in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   GET IT GOING: Glen Rice is supposed to be the outside threat
that helps to take pressure off Shaquille O'Neal inside, but thus
far in the postseason, the career .449-percent field-goal shooter
has hit on just 43 of 111 field goals (.387).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have gotten past Sacramento and Phoenix with Rice off
his game, but if he doesn't return to form in the Western
Conference Finals, they can't expect to have the same success
against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a series Glen is going to have to be a key,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, isn't inclined to call plays to get Rice
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't do anything so extraordinary that takes us out of
what we do well,'' he said. ``We'll expect Glen to have the ability
to find his own game at some level in our offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get a rhythm (against the Suns), and rhythm is
important. Now that Rick (Fox) is back playing a good role, I think
we can shorten Glen's minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S A MIND GAME: Portland forward Scottie Pippen acted like a
guy who knew Jackson all too well when he heard Jackson's comments
that if Pippen didn't lead the Blazers in the Western Conference
Finals, no one would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah?'' Pippen said. ``He's just trying to get into my
head. We're not going to buy into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Jackson wouldn't respond to Blazers coach Mike
Dunleavy's early cry for more fouls to be called on O'Neal. Said
Dunleavy on Wednesday: ``If Shaq is allowed to zone up like he was
doing in the Phoenix series _ I think I counted 57 times _ and if
he is allowed to push guys out of the way and gain his position,
it's going to be tough for anybody to beat them. But if it's called
the way it needs to be called, then we're going to have a good
shot.'' &QL;

REPORT FAULTS FBI OVER ITS HANDLING OF NUCLEAR SECRETS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI gravely mishandled its inquiry into Wen Ho
Lee, the nuclear scientist suspected of passing secrets to the
Chinese government, by failing to dedicate sufficient resources to
the task and focusing too narrowly on a single suspect, a secret
Justice Department review has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this week,
officials said, Randy Bellows, a department prosecutor, singled out
the FBI for harsh criticism, even as he faulted other aspects of
the government's inquiry into contentions of spying at its nuclear
labs.
</P>
<P>
   The findings marked the latest chapter in the increasing
friction between Reno and Louis Freeh, the FBI director. On a
separate matter, congressional investigators were studying a 1996
memo by Freeh in which he suggested that Reno had dropped an
inquiry into Democratic fund-raising irregularities to protect her
job.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI declined to comment on the report, which
has not yet been released to Congress. Reno ordered the review amid
widespread public criticism of the government's handling of the Lee
affair.
</P>
<P>
   A government official who was briefed on the Bellows report, the
contents of which were first reported on Thursday by The Associated
Press, said: ``It blames a lot of people. But it's harshest on the
FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, the official said, was faulted for moving too slowly
and failing to devote sufficient resources to the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The report faulted the Justice Department for failing to approve
a search warrant sought by the FBI to conduct electronic
surveillance on Lee, a scientist at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico, the nation's leading nuclear weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   But, Bellows concluded, FBI officials became so distracted by
their pursuit of a search warrant that they missed an opportunity
to search Lee's office computer, which would not have required a
warrant. An examination of that computer later showed that someone
had downloaded highly sensitive nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized the FBI for focusing so exclusively
on Lee that it may have overlooked other suspects. Investigators
did not widen the search beyond Lee until later last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is 60, was never indicted on espionage charges. He
faces 59 felony counts linked to the mishandling of nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was fired in March 1999, has maintained his innocence.
He is now in solitary confinement in New Mexico, awaiting a trial
scheduled to start in November.

 CAMPBELL SAYS FEINSTEIN BACKING CHINA BILL TO BENEFIT HUSBAND  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Republican opponent
charged Thursday that her support of normalizing trade with China
could financially benefit her billionaire husband, Richard Blum.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Rep. Tom Campbell said Feinstein left blanks on her 1999
federal statement of economic interests that could mask substantial
investment in China by Blum. In 1997, Blum said he had invested as
much as $2 million in various Chinese ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Thursday that she and her husband dumped all
their investments in China after the May 1999 economic statement
was filed. In the past, she insisted she maintained a ``fire wall''
between her senatorial duties and Blum's far-flung financial
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Dianne nor her husband have any holdings in mainland
China,'' said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. ``We fill
out these forms very carefully. If Dianne Feinstein had done
something that's not complete, wouldn't we have heard about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of her husband's investments has dogged Feinstein
since she was elected to the Senate in 1992. The possibility of a
conflict of interest was raised in 1996 by her last GOP opponent,
Mike Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who has vowed not to make Blum's far-flung business
dealings an issue, said Thursday he was criticizing Feinstein, not
Blum, for failing to disclose the scope of the couple's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to disclose is the senator's responsibility,''
Campbell said. ``You go to the pages. You see empty columns. That's
her responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwata said Campbell was wrong when he said Feinstein had
left the value of 14 investments blank. The value is listed later,
Kuwata said, under each investment's assets, not after its title.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said Feinstein could settle the issue by releasing her
2000 economic statement, which was filed earlier this month with
the Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under its normal policy, the committee will make the document
public next month. That will be after the Senate vote on granting
China permanent normal trade status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll abide by the rules of the ethics committee, not
Tom Campbell's requests,'' Kuwata said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Feinstein's opposition to stripping China of most
favored nation trading status led to questions of the benefit to
Blum's investments, Blum promised that any future profits from
China would be donated to the American Himalayan Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Blum founded the charity in 1979 to help Tibetans oppressed by
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should remove any perception that I, in any way ...
benefit from or influence my wife's position on China,'' Blum told
The Chronicle at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwata said none of Blum's Chinese investments turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 statement does show Blum maintaining a $100,000 to
$250,000 investment in Newbridge Capital Ltd., a Hong Kong-based
joint venture that coordinates Blum's investments in China.
</P>
<P>
   One of Blum's limited partnerships that holds an interest in
Newbridge is Golden China, L.P., whose assets were listed at
between $500,000 to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Golden China was valued at between $250,000 and $500,000 in
Feinstein's 1996 financial disclosure statement.

<P>
   SCI-STRESS-WOMEN (Undated) _ For more than a half century,
scientific gospel has held that animals, including humans, respond
to stress by preparing to do battle or to flee, a physiological
syndrome commonly known as ``fight or flight.'' But in a newly
published report, a group of researchers asserts that females often
show a very different reaction to stress, one that revolves around
nurturing and seeking the support of others rather than aggression
or escape. This ``tend and befriend'' response, seen both in humans
and in animal species, may be based in hormonal differences between
the sexes, the researchers argue. By Erica Goode.

   SCI-ASTRONOMY-AGENDA (Undated) _ A panel of astronomers, whose

years include looking for earth-sized planets around other suns and
launching a fleet of new xray satellites to search for black holes.

many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you
consider eBay a place. But the show no doubt will be as popular in

   LANGUAGE-IMMERSION (Undated) _ Five years ago, at a stationery
store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished
in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a
smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out
this sentence to the old woman at the counter: ``Je voudrais
acheter le magasin, s'il vous plait.'' The common word for magazine
is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked
to buy the shop. And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a
helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high
school French and one semester at college. I could make my way
through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the
question. Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of
bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to
function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am
a graduate of language immersion. By Charles Strum.

position on the destruction of the universe clear: ``As an
environmentalist, I'm against that.'' Gore gives a droll reading
while playing himself on the animated comedy ``Futurama,'' set in
the year 3000. In Sunday's time-traveling season finale, the hero,
a pizza delivery guy named Fry, has stumbled back to his original
home in 1999, distorting history, creating a rip in the space-time
continuum and making a final big bang imminent. Gore is trying to
get Fry to re-enter the cryogenic tube that took him to the future
and so save the world (not a bad thing to have on your resume if
you want to be president). By Caryn James.

 FOOD FLOWS FREELY AT DOT-COMS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One more reason why you're sadly missing the
boat if you're not working for a dot-com: Eats.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned Thursday that companies traditionally supply their
employees with coffee, free or cheap, and that's it.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot that there is a whole new world of new-age companies
where the workers work at such a frenetic hummingbird pace that
they require constant snackage.
</P>
<P>
   So these stupendously rich companies supply the food and drink,
free. Eric Dew, an engineer at Fire-Drop Inc. in Redwood Shores,
says the bosses there provide free coffee and tea, and every kind
of pop, sport drink and fruit juice you could dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even some beer, which can be imbibed during work hours.
And they cater lunch. And they cater dinner Monday through
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday evening employees don't need a free dinner because
they've made enough that week in salary and stock options to retire
and hire live-in chefs.
</P>
<P>
   WE NEED a name for the genetic mutants who don't drink coffee,
other than ``Mormons.''
</P>
<P>
   We need the no-coffee equivalent of ``vegetarians'' or
``teetotalers.'' Michael Conkin suggests: 1. Antimochans. 2. The
differently hot-beveraged. 3. Nojoes.
</P>
<P>
   WE BUILT this city on rock 'n' roll. Now pack up your guitar and
get outta town.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message being sent to more than 100 local bands and
artists who rent rehearsal space in the Art Explosion building,
17th and Potrero.
</P>
<P>
   The owner leases the building to two guys who invented the Art
Explosion, a nonprofit, and they in turn rent spaces at
below-market rates to starving artists and bands.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? It's eviction time. And the Art Explosion and their
tenants are fighting it, raising money for the legal battle with a
concert at the Paradise Lounge a week from Sunday, 2 to 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When they were all served their 30-day notices, someone slapped
a sign on the building's front door that reads simply:
</P>
<P>
   ``evicted.com''
</P>
<P>
   A FELLOW named Ryan Brooks was hired as the city's new director
of administrative affairs. He was hired by phone, and word spread
around City Hall of the new Irish chief.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor met Brooks at a staff meeting, Brown said, ``You
can't be Ryan Brooks, you're supposed to be Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks happens to be African American.
</P>
<P>
   And when Brooks, whose duties include supervision of City Hall
janitors, introduced himself to two of the janitors, one said to
the other in Spanish, ``He's the new `Irish' boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also speaks fluent Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   LEAFING THROUGH a home-listings magazine, ``Harmon Homes,'' Anne
Sawyer-Scharf came upon a beauty of a Victorian in Placerville.
</P>
<P>
   Among the home's features: ``double butler panties.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what that means, so I'll check with the experts at
Victorian's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   WE'RE NO. 1 ... In croquet. Phoenix teenage croquet phenom
Jacques Fournier defends his world title Saturday morning against
27 other wicked wrist-flicking wicket slickers at the World Croquet
Championship at Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards cq &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Fournier of Phoenix has only a slight edge over local hero Jerry
Stark of the Meadowood Resort.
</P>
<P>
   It could get rowdy because festivities include wine tasting, a
wine auction, dancing, etc., all to benefit kids' charities.
</P>
<P>
   Fun fact: Croquet was so hot in old Hollywood that Harpo Marx
built a $50,000 temperature-controlled room to store his mallets.
Imagine how he must have pampered his balls.
</P>
<P>
   A THIEF crept into the 1,2,3 Wash &AMP; Dry on Hyde and Pacific and
made off with a dryer full of Gwyneth Borden's colored clothes,
ignoring her two loads of whites.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who has probably watched too many cop TV shows would
do, Gwyneth called the police. They were nice enough to come out
and take a report, though they decided against having a sketch
artist draw a composite of the missing laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the theft may be the work of the same person who
for years has been sneaking into Laundromats and homes throughout
the Bay Area stealing single socks.

 CALIFORNIA'S SENATORS ASSAIL BUSH'S PLAN FOR SOCIAL SECURITY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer
entered the election-year war over Social Security Thursday,
calling Texas Gov. George W. Bush's plan for personal retirement
accounts a ``riverboat gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the phrases Vice President Al Gore frequently uses to
attack Bush, his GOP opponent in the presidential race, Boxer and
Feinstein called the proposed accounts ``a risky scheme'' that
would hurt women.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Boxer argued that private accounts would reduce
benefits, and that women are particularly vulnerable because they
tend to live longer than men, earn less and rely more on Social
Security as their sole source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The two Californians led their female Democratic colleagues in
the Senate in praising Gore's alternative, which calls for
buttressing Social Security with general tax revenues when it
starts to run short of money in about 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Social Security proposal, announced Monday, would allow
people to invest an undetermined amount of their 12.4 percent
Social Security payroll tax in personal retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when your investment goes bad?'' Boxer asked.
``Who pays? If it's the retirees, they will be ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   If the government pays, she said, ``we'll all be ruined because
we'll see an S&AMP;L-like bailout.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, who noted that she used to be a stockbroker, said Social
Security was always intended as a foundation for people's
retirement, and one should ``never mess with the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Both Parties Aim at the Issue
</P>
<P>
   The entry of Boxer and Feinstein into the campaign &LR; 
 &LR; election-year debate over Social Security highlights the emphasis
both parties are putting on the issue, with Bush and Gore
coordinating their efforts with allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer called Gore's plan ``safe and sensible.'' ``Vice President
Gore's plan keeps Social Security solvent and thriving for the next
50 years, in contrast to George Bush's risky scheme,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland declared, ``This is
the first in a series of press conferences that will go from now to
November, where Democratic women will stand up for what's right and
stand up for truth.'' Mikulski urged voters to elect Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Boxer, both first elected to the Senate in the
1992 ``Year of the Woman,'' led the attack on the Bush plan, saying
it would endanger women's financial security.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said that if personal Social Security accounts are
allowed, ``the big, big losers are women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply believe that it is not necessary to privatize Social
Security at this time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization _ the shifting of a government program to the
private sector _ has become a loaded term in the debate, brandished
by opponents and avoided by supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has been short on the details of his plan, it
would allow individuals to privatize a portion of their Social
Security accounts. He has said that anyone who wanted to stay with
the existing system could, and the expectation is that many would
opt for the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advocates private accounts as a way to help people earn
more from their payroll taxes than Social Security's current 1.88
percent. Bush says the accounts would especially help minorities
and young workers build wealth and pass it on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not release enough specifics to determine to what
extent, if any, private accounts might remedy Social Security's
projected funding shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Boxer argued that private accounts would reduce
benefits, and that women are particularly vulnerable because they
tend to live longer than men, earn less, and rely more on Social
Security as their sole source of income.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear if or how Bush's plan would reduce benefits for
younger workers, since much would depend on how the accounts were
structured.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Rassell, an economist from the Economic Policy Institute
who joined the press conference, said women caring for children
``have less time to watch the stock market'' and so would see
little benefit from personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tanner, who heads the Social Security privatization
project for the libertarian Cato Institute, argued that Feinstein
and Boxer have it wrong. Tanner said many women lose under the
current system.
</P>
<P>
   That's because widows are entitled to half of their husband's
Social Security benefits. If that turns out to be more than the
benefits due them from their own work, the widows' own
contributions to Social Security are erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``About one-third of all women end up having their taxes go for
naught under that formula,'' Tanner said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner also charged that it is Gore's plan that is risky,
because it would only shift more bonds to the Social Security trust
fund without adding any cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a promise that when the debt comes due, taxpayers
pick up the bill,'' Tanner said, ``but there is absolutely no
guarantee of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Current projections indicate that Social Security benefit
payments will begin to exceed revenue in about 15 years, and that
by 2037, the program will be able to pay just two-thirds to
three-quarters of promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal is modeled on a plan put forth by President
Clinton about a year ago. The Congressional Budget Office, the
General Accounting Office and other budget experts described the
proposal as an accounting maneuver that had no effect on the
government's ability to pay promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contends, however, that his plan would pay down the
national debt and transfer any future interest savings to Social
Security. If the debt is paid down, then it will be easier for the
government to pay benefits in the future, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is in any way a risk,'' Boxer said. ``It is
a very prudent plan.''

A GOOD DAY FOR PAC-10 AT NCAA TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Another women's tennis match, another gut check
for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bruins get to play another day against yet
another opponent they have faced.
</P>
<P>
   To simplify: Ninth-ranked UCLA defeated No.8 Texas 5-2 on
Thursday in the NCAA championships to earn a quarterfinal match
with No.1 Stanford at 2 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great day for the Pacific-10 Conference, as all five
teams reached today's quarterfinals. In addition to UCLA and
Stanford (a 5-1 winner over No.14 Northwestern), other winners
included 12th-ranked USC, which beat No.32 LSU 5-2; 11th-ranked
Arizona State, which beat No.6 Duke 5-2; and No.5 Cal, which beat
No.10 Vanderbilt 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, USC faces No.2 Georgia at 11 a.m., Cal faces No.3
Wake Forest at 5 p.m. and ASU plays No.4 Florida at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity breeds more familiarity at the NCAAs. Fifteen of the
top 18 ranked teams are here, including UCLA and Texas, who already
have faced each other once this season and two other times at the
NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the Bruins were asked to look inside and find that
extra drive to overcome the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the Bruins failed, losing in the third round
and quarterfinals. On March 4, UCLA trailed 4-2 after singles and
swept doubles for a 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, senior Elizabeth Schmidt at fifth singles showed
the most intestinal fortitude in helping UCLA end Texas' 17-match
win streak. She lost 6-3 to Kaysie Smashey before rebounding to
take the match 6-3, 6-0. Then Schmidt teamed with freshman Abigail
Spears and won the one doubles match 8-5 needed after leading 7-2.
Matches end after a team wins five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing the first set, I could have gotten down,'' Schmidt said
of her singles win, ``but I thought to myself, `This is my senior
year. I don't want this to be my last match. Every match could be
my last match.' I had to dig deep. I got confidence in the second
set, and that carried over in the third.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of gut-check tennis that UCLA (17-8) has played
all season, starting with a home loss to Arizona to having to deal
with the loss of top singles player Sara Walker _ who missed a
sizable portion to mourn the death of her mother _ to adjusting to
Walker's return.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it has prepared the Bruins for the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Catherine Hawley and Spears' easy wins, Texas (24-6)
pushed the Bruins in every match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone fought hard,'' Schmidt said. ``That's UCLA tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of pride and we're playing with a lot of
heart,'' said UCLA coach Stella Sampras. ``We're playing our best
tennis now. This is the best we've played.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (18-8) didn't have to fight as hard, but the Trojans got key
wins from second singles Veronika Safarova and third singles Jewel
Peterson. Safarova, a senior, lost the first set to Ana Paula Mores
6-3 before rallying for a 6-2, 6-1 decision. Peterson, a freshman
ranked 17th, won a first-set tiebreaker over unranked Fernanda
Tsucamoto and then breezed in the second set 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that stage, the match was extremely close,'' USC coach
Richard Gallien said. ``The momentum shifted our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans and Bruins hope it stays their way in today's
quarterfinals. UCLA has two 7-2 losses to the Cardinal; USC lost
5-4 to Georgia in the NCAA Indoors. &QL;

NO (FOOT) FAULTING THIS FAMILY RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Karen Huebner doesn't doubt her parents love
her, but she put them to the test when she took a job as USC
assistant women's tennis coach.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a family steeped in UCLA tradition, so much so that her
mother, Gretchen, a UCLA song girl in the 1950s, owns nothing
cardinal and gold and still performs the pompon routines whenever
she watches UCLA score a touchdown on television. She also was
among the many who painted Tommy Trojan blue and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner's father, Larry, was UCLA's tennis captain and led the
Bruins to the 1953 national tennis championship.
</P>
<P>
   Huebner herself captained UCLA for three years and led them to
the 1981 Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
national title.
</P>
<P>
   When she landed the USC post, Larry was thrilled _ he turned on
his pro-USC family to become a Trojan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom said, `Are you sure?''' Huebner said. ``She couldn't
understand me rooting for a Trojan team.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Larry and Gretchen started going to USC tennis functions
and rooting (gulp) for USC tennis. They even drive from their
Fresno home to watch. Every other sport, however, is off limits.
Gretchen is of the ``My favorite teams are UCLA and anyone playing
USC'' mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood is thicker than water,'' Huebner said. ``I learned the
depth of the love my parents have for me.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ADVANTAGE: One reason Southern schools have won six of the
last eight national titles is the players spend countless hours
practicing and competing in great humidity. At these NCAA
championships, nine of the final 16 schools are from below the
Mason-Dixon Line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the first day, just three won. Of these, only Florida
didn't beat another Southern team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams from the South play tough,'' USC coach Richard Gallien
said. ``With the weather and humidity, it's no place for the
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, however, there is no humidity. Instead, there are winds
and aggressive teams that come to the net instead of staying on the
baseline to outlast an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Staying back is what Duke, LSU and Vanderbilt did against
Arizona State, USC and Cal. That's why the three Pac-10 teams are
playing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pressure situations, we tend to sit back and wait for our
opponent to make a mistake,'' said Duke coach Jamie Ashworth, whose
team lost 5-2 to ASU. ``People need to see we need to be more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashworth said the Pac-10 and Southeastern conferences are the
two strongest. Which is stronger could be determined today. USC
faces Georgia and ASU meets Florida. Cal already beat an SEC team
and now plays Wake Forest of the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   NOT NERVES OF STEEL: The ASU-Duke match was closer than the
score indicated. Although the Sun Devils led 4-2 after the singles
matches, Duke led 7-6 in one doubles set and trailed 7-6 in
another.
</P>
<P>
   ASU coach Sheila McInerney couldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to win the lottery or marry a millionaire so I don't
have to go through this,'' she said after her team won. &QL;

IT sits on a bookshelf, inside a souvenir glass from the Nagano
Olympics in the room I use for an office.
</P>
<P>
   And it could have been Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   A pingpong ball, bright red and bearing the words ``Houston
Rockets'' in white block letters, is a link to the past of the NBA
draft lottery and to the story of a franchise that has benefited as
much from good fortune as from hard work.
</P>
<P>
   How many careers and championships would have been changed if on
May 17, 1992, that one ball could have jumped out of the hopper and
sent Shaq to Houston?
</P>
<P>
   Would there even be a debate about a downtown arena? Would the
words Kelvin Cato and $42 million ever be mentioned in the same
sentence?
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday's televised schmaltz, where the only thing
missing is Regis Philbin, it is the Rockets' sole appearance in the
draft lottery and the only time luck failed them.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Patterson, by that time club president emeritus and a kind
of 6-3 rabbit's foot, was the Rockets' official witness to the
actual lottery prior to the TV show to announce the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we were the only team with red, I figured our ball would
be pretty easy to pick out,'' Patterson said that day. ``But when I
looked into the container, all I could see was blue from Orlando,
Charlotte and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept looking and looking, and I couldn't find it. That
little SOB was buried all the way down there at the bottom of the
pile, gasping for air. It couldn't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shaq went to Disney World, the Rockets chose Robert Horry
with the 11th pick in the draft, and since then the lottery
procedure has evolved into something slightly more complicated than
the genetic code for DNA.
</P>
<P>
   But back in another century, before computer combinations and
weighted odds and even pingpong balls, in a simpler age, there was
just a coin flip.
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly 17 years ago today in New York that the late NBA
commissioner Larry O'Brien tossed a silver dollar and it plopped
onto the carpet, giving the Rockets the draft rights to Ralph
Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie, it's heads,'' O'Brien said calmly to then-club owner
Charlie Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson raced across the room to plant a kiss on the owner's
cheek. Thomas embraced his youngest daughter Tracy, who had told
him to make the call of ``heads,'' and in the back of the room Jim
Foley, then the club's media relations director, let out a whoop,
danced an Irish jig and tore away his coat, tie and shirt
Superman-style to reveal a blue T-shirt with orange letters that
read: RALPH!
</P>
<P>
   It was the payoff after a franchise-worst 14-68 season and the
heady culmination of hours of ritual and superstition. The Rockets'
New York traveling party had spent the night before the coin flip
in Jimmy Weston's Pub on 54th Street getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   Foley had brought a ``lucky'' Irish coin, and the group took
turns dipping it in a glass of Irish whiskey. Foley noticed a clock
of Ireland _ with a dozen coins designating the hours _ fixed to
one wall by a heavy chain and mused that it might work well as a
charm. Weston sent out for bolt cutters and had the clock taken
down, and Foley carried it under one arm the next day to the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The group returned to Weston's to celebrate, toasting with
bottles of Dom Perignon champagne that were being charged by phone
from many of Thomas' friends in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never imagine ever doing this again,'' said a
jubiliant Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, he was back. This time for a coin tossed by
new commissioner David Stern, with a young Akeem Olajuwon as the
plum in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   The traveling party had grown. But all of the charms were back _
the coin, the whiskey, the clock, Foley and Patterson, who as GM in
Milwaukee also had won the flip that sent Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   This time Portland owner Larry Weinberg made the call:
``tails.'' It came up heads.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas beamed again. Patterson pumped his fist again. Foley
stripped again. The T-shirt said: AKEEM! Though he also was wearing
another one that said: MICHAEL! As in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it again next year!'' Foley shouted.
</P>
<P>
   But they changed the rules, replaced the coin toss with the
lottery, brought in envelopes, computers and a game show.
</P>
<P>
   On that day in Secaucus, N.J., Patterson reached into his
pocket, pulled out the red pingpong ball and tossed it to me.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how what might have been history came to sit on a
bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take the no-good little SOB,'' he said. ``But I'm still
unbeaten in coin flips.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
BALTIMORE _ This is a city famed for its crab cakes and black-eyed
Susans, as the birthplace of Babe Ruth and the home of the National
Museum of Dentistry. This week it becomes the showplace for
America's sporting gentry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That is, seven of the eight horses in the field for the
Preakness Stakes will be competing for place and show as Fusaichi
Pegasus romps away with the second gem in the Triple Crown. The
handicappers do not see a contestant who can match the tools of the
Kentucky Derby champion. His price _ 3-5 on Thursday _ could drop
to a dollar by race time. This is no way to make an honest living,
betting five bucks to make six.
</P>
<P>
   If Fusaichi Pegasus can weave his way through a wall of 19 in
the Derby, not once needing the sting of the whip to urge him on,
what can the Sieve Seven possibly do to stop him? The best hope is
the smallness of the field itself. Maybe he'll get lonely and bored
and distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Those searching for a weakness may have to be content with this
one: He may be Superhorse, and the favorite to end the Triple Crown
famine, but he didn't get here on his own wings. He needed an
airplane, unlike the Pegasus of Greek mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the ground, Saturday's coming attraction seemed less a
horse race than a fox hunt. In this chase, Neil Drysdale, the Hall
of Fame trainer, is the fox, pursued by writers who want him to
regale them with Bob Baffert-type quips and fence with them like D.
Wayne Lukas. The tall, frosty Englishman does neither. This time
the fox is winning.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were still peeved Thursday after Drysdale had avoided
a mob scene at Pimlico, ordering a van to Barn 7 and standing on
the running board as he gave the driver directions. The maneuver
enabled his colt to walk down a ramp directly into his stall. A
public ceremony planned by track officials went begging in the
process. Casual fans may take the position that if you've seen one
barn you have seen them all. But at Pimlico, Barn 40, on the
eastern side, is reserved for the winner of the Kentucky Derby, and
the area in front had been paved to accommodate the crowd waiting
for this year's champ.
</P>
<P>
   When the unflappable Brit was asked, with obvious sarcasm, if
barricades would be used to keep the media and tourists away, he
didn't bat an eye. ``Not that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that he had not deliberately stiffed the press.
When the van pulled up to the stable area, a race had just started.
``I didn't want to unload and have him walk by the track,''
explained the 52-year-old trainer. Fusaichi Pegasus has his quirky
side, and there seemed to be no reason to tempt fate.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale's decision to pick a site on the backside, almost as
far from the other entries as possible, was criticized by the media
and some insiders as undemocratic, even unrepublican. In a nice
counterpoint, Baffert moved Captain Steve, who finished eighth in
the Derby, into Barn 40. He had qualified for that location before
with Silver Charm and Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was too tempting to resist, so reporters asked the
playful Baffert what he thought of Drysdale's isolation. ``Neil's
got his own agenda,'' he said. ``I'm not getting into that.'' But
Bob clearly misses the spotlight. ``It's lonely at the bottom,'' he
confided.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much room left on the bandwagon, but a handful of
dissenters insist that the Japanese-owned colt can be beaten, among
them Lukas, whose High Yield finished 15th in the Derby. ``I don't
think we should anoint him yet,'' said Lukas, referring to the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The second choice, Red Bullet, one of three entries who skipped
the Kentucky Derby, is fresh and rested and earned respect by
finishing second to the Big Horse in the Wood Memorial. The others
are Hugh Hefner, owned by a friend of the publisher of Playboy, and
Snuck In, the runner-up in the Arkansas Derby and owned by
Houston's Ackerley brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, no colt has skipped the Derby and won the Preakness since
1983, and 71 have tried. Ed Nahem, Hefner's pal, couldn't care
less. His sights are on the place or show money and the prestige
such a finish would bring his breeding operation. What this
achievement would do for the original Hugh Hefner, a prominent
figure himself in the breeding culture, isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   Hef's namesake is starting on the pole, with Hal's Hope on the
outside, the two longest shots at 20-1. Which brings us to another
example of the optimism so dear to this sport. Hal's Hope is also
named after his owner and trainer, the 88-year-old Harold Rose, who
was not discouraged when his horse finished 16th in the Derby. Nor
is he disturbed by the fact that Hal's Hope has a new cut on his
left hind leg to go with the ones he picked up in the Derby. He
also has developed an unsightly skin rash and at midweek
accidentally conked his head on a beam in his stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insignificant,'' said Rose. ``He's feeling so good he doesn't
know what to do with himself.''

DAILY NEWS OWNER SAYS PAPER ISN'T UP FOR SALE
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to correct typo in lede.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Daily News of Los Angeles is not for sale and
there are no plans to sell it to the rival Los Angeles Times now or
in the future, the newspaper's owner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some media reports Thursday suggested that the Times was likely
to buy the paper in the future because of an option it holds,
despite antitrust laws that would forbid such a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion arose after the Times published a story pointing
out that its parent, the Times Mirror Co., holds a two-year-old
option to buy the Daily News if it's put up for sale by
Denver-based MediaNews Group, owner of the San Fernando
Valley-based paper.
</P>
<P>
   William Dean Singleton, president and chief executive officer of
MediaNews Group, said that the option, part of a complex financial
deal, could be exercised only if he agreed to sell the paper, which
he doesn't plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that federal officials have said they would
not approve such a sale to the Times because of antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said the $2.4 million option provision was part of a
$50 million loan package from Times Mirror, which was used to
finance the Daily News' purchase for $130 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to be willing to sell and the Justice Department
would have to agree,'' Singleton said of the option, which was
disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I wanted to sell the Daily News to the Times _ which I
don't _ it would be legally impossible. So there is no exposure,''
Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Times Mirror could not sell the option without first
offering it to MediaNews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither executives with Times Mirror nor its new ownership, the
Chicago-based Tribune Co., returned calls for comments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company issued a statement: ``There is an option to
buy the Daily News that was part of a broad financial agreement
reached in 1998 between Times Mirror and Garden State Newspapers.
The earliest it would be exercisable would be 2003 at which time it
would be subject to all necessary government approvals.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal centered on the loan, and the papers later purchased
California Independent Postal Service, which distributes
pre-printed ads in the papers and to the homes of nonsubscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror and MediaNews have a long history of working
together. Times Mirror helped finance MediaNews' 1986 acquisition
of the Dallas Times Herald with a $60 million loan and the 1987
purchase of The Denver Post with a $70 million loan. Both papers
were owned by Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   If Singleton decides to sell the Daily News between 2003 and
2010, the option allows Times Mirror first right to buy it at a
fair market value. But Singleton said Justice Department officials
investigated the two companies' financial partnership and objected
only to the option provision allowing Times Mirror to buy the Daily
News, saying it would violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department did a one-year investigation, and they
blessed everything we were doing, but they said they would not
entertain the Times exercising the option,'' Singleton said.
``We've been told it couldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department antitrust officials could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Massey, Daily News president, chief executive officer and
publisher, said the deal between Times Mirror and MediaNews'
predecessor company, Garden State Newspapers, requires both parties
to agree to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times Mirror can't force the sale of the Daily News; there
must be a willing buyer and a willing seller,'' Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms, Times Mirror could sell the option back to
MediaNews at any time during the seven-year option window. If it's
still in force by 2010, MediaNews would have to repurchase it.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said he will buy the option back at the first
opportunity, noting its payback value is tied to the paper's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to buy it back today,'' Singleton said, citing the
Daily News' overall appreciation and steadily climbing performance.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton predicted Times Mirror will make an ``outstanding
return'' on its investment in the Daily News as the loan, including
the option, is retired.
</P>
<P>
   For the six-month period ending March 31, the Daily News had
average daily circulation of 200,798 and Sunday circulation of
212,434. Singleton has solidified his Southern California position
by creating the Los Angeles Newspapers Group, MediaNews Group's
largest operating division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Daily News, the group includes the San Gabriel
Valley Tribune, Long Beach Press-Telegram, Pasadena Star-News,
Whittier Daily News, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, San Bernardino
County Sun, Redlands Daily Facts and Lompoc Record.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton said that while he has no immediate plans for more
acquisitions in the area, he continues to be interested in
expanding his operations, now the seventh-largest newspaper group
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said Times Mirror and the Times have no control of nor
influence on the operations or contents of the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Daily News has outperformed expectations at the time
of its purchase. ``For every circulation reporting period since the
purchase, the Daily News' circulation has grown both daily and on
Sunday,'' Massey said. ``The Daily News will remain the voice of
the San Fernando Valley.''

L.A. MAYOR ACCUSES COUNCIL OF UNDERMINING CHARTER REFORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the sharpest clash yet over the new City
Charter, Mayor Richard Riordan's office accused the City Council on
Thursday of subverting the will of voters by trying to strip the
mayor of lobbying responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of dollars in state and federal funding at stake,
the council is set to consider an ordinance today that would
restore lobbying responsibility to Chief Legislative Analyst Ron
Deaton, titularly the council's top bureaucrat but widely regarded
as the most powerful figure in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The new voter-approved charter that goes into effect July 1
stripped Deaton of his state and federal lobbying role, but the
proposed ordinance _ which officials say he crafted _ would restore
it and expand his power in some ways.
</P>
<P>
   An outside legal analysis commissioned by Riordan and released
Thursday found the proposal is ``constitutionally suspect'' and
undermines the new charter's goal of making the council primarily a
legislative body and giving the mayor expanded authority to manage
city departments.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Glushon, a member of the city's elected Charter Reform
Commission, said the proposal was a power grab since the reform
commission felt it was important that the mayor be the city's main
representative at the state and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council needs to listen to the will of the voters,''
Glushon said. ``When someone in Sacramento or Washington wants to
hear from the city of Los Angeles, they look to the Mayor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politics. The mayor wants more authority and the council
doesn't want to give any mayor more authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin said the council was attempting to
usurp the mayor's authority to preserve Deaton's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of millions of dollars each year come to us from the
state and federal government,'' Martin said. ``Making sure we get
our fair share is very crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Deaton was out of town and unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page analysis, attorney Dale E. Bonner of Hogan &AMP;
Hartson said that instead of developing a broad set of state and
federal legislative policies annually, the proposal would include
other local government bodies as part of the council's authority.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that Deaton, the council's top adviser, would be
empowered to shape guidelines for the council to take positions on
almost any issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charter ... prohibits the Council having any
administrative control over the various functions of City
government,'' Bonner wrote. ``The ordinance is constitutionally
suspect and would be subject to legal challenge if adopted by the
Council and signed into law in its present form.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's opinion states that the ordinance expands Deaton's role
in intergovernmental relations and violates the mandatory
separation of powers mandated by the new charter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The charter) vests in the Mayor the exclusive power and duty
to represent the City in intergovernmental relations in accordance
with city policy and supervise the City's intergovernmental
relations function,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The report angered some council members who sit on a charter
reform committee that already approved the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It troubles me that the mayor went to some outside source when
the legal adviser for the city is the city attorney,'' said
Councilwoman Laura Chick, chairwoman of the council's Charter
Implementation Committee. ``The city attorney has carefully
contemplated this and advised the council during a variety of
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the City Attorney's Office, said
the proposal is being reviewed but declined comment on the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sparring match is just one in a string of tense
debates between the mayor and council over how to implement the new
City Charter, approved by voters to try to make local government
more responsive and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, Deaton represents the city in
Sacramento and Washington on a regular basis. Under the new
charter, the mayor would become the city's chief representative
when lobbying for state and federal funds for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, a member of the Charter Implementation
Committee, said he will support postponing the vote on the matter
until further review by the city attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be sure that we have all the facts before us,''
Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Chick said, however, that she is comfortable with the ordinance
as it stands and that the city attorney already reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask three or four different people, if you look around
for them, and get three or four different opinions on what the
charter says. That's why we rely on our city attorney,'' Chick
said.
</P>
<P>
   George Kieffer, chairman of the city's appointed Charter Reform
Commission, said the ordinance is ``in a very gray area'' and that
he plans to review the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may or may not be good policy, but it doesn't necessarily
mean it's inconsistent with the charter,'' he said.

   (UNDATED) _ America's economy has been roaring along, with low
inflation, for so long now that any mention of speed limits and
overheating was becoming decidedly unfashionable. No longer. In
recent weeks, the signs that the economy is being stretched beyond
its limits have become unmistakable. All eyes are now on the

   (UNDATED) _ Next week, the American Congress will vote on
whether to grant China permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) as
part of that country's entry into the World Trade Organization. It
promises to be a razor-close vote. Congress should vote in favor of
the bill, not mainly for reasons of American economic
self-interest, but because PNTR will speed the very changes in
China that critics of the measure say they want to see. &QL;

vote in Congress since the approval of the North American

most-favored-nation trading status on a permanent basis (PNTR),
very little will actually change. But the crucial vote will have
far-reaching repercussions for both countries _ and for both
political parties. Place your bets, gentlemen _ it's going to be a
cliffhanger. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When he was no more than a leading Islamic figure
and part-time opposition politician, Abdurrahman Wahid was known
for his sometimes bewildering changes of course. These rarely
disconcerted his admirers, one of whom compared him to a river.
Viewed from on high, he seemed to be meandering all over the place.
Go with the flow, however, and you would find he was always moving
in the same general direction. Unfortunately, Wahid's
seven-month-old government presides over an Indonesia that is far
from stable. If he is not to follow in the steps of his ousted
predecessor, President Suharto, Wahid needs to chart a straight and
steady course _ and stick to it. &QL;

   RAMALLAH _ In the worst bout of violence for several years,
thousands of Palestinians battled with the Israeli army on May 15.
They were marking al-Nakba Day: the term Palestinians use for the
``catastrophe'' of Israel's establishment and their dispossession
from most of Palestine. The al-Nakba anniversary always casts a
sombre pall over Palestinians, wherever they are. But this time, in
the West Bank and Gaza, the violence was fuelled by other, more
incendiary causes. &QL;

human-wave advance was more successful than earlier invasions of

dangerous by the day. One parliamentary candidate narrowly escaped
a firebombing. Another candidate was kidnapped for 12 days and
beaten. And on May 9, a rural leader of the coalition party and his
son were murdered. The perpetrators have claimed to be from the
Lavalas Family, the political party of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
predecessor and mentor of Haiti's current president, Rene Preval.

where he made his considerable reputation as ``le cost cutter.''
Indeed, Ghosn paved the way for Renault's dramatic turnaround after
he arrived there from the Michelin tire company. Now he must
perform the same, badly needed magic at Nissan. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The seizure of Foday Sankoh is a heavy, but not necessarily
fatal, blow for the Revolutionary United Front which, hours before
its leader was taken, was skirmishing with British paratroopers
only a dozen miles from Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's capture undoubtedly deprives the Sierra Leonean rebels
of their leader and most charismatic commander, who was technically
vice-president of the coalition government of Tejan Kabbah set up
following the September 1999 Lome peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Wednesday night whether the eight-year
civil war was finally drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   One theory was that the rebel effort will now disintegrate and
factions of the RUF will switch allegiance to the government.
Others fear a new commander could emerge, and that the savage,
anarchic struggle will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations between Sankoh and his troops are complex,'' one
diplomat said, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sankoh was taken into custody _ possibly betrayed by some
of his nominal supporters _ rebel strength was put at 10,000 to
15,000, plus unknown numbers of child soldiers and other
sympathizers. This is well down from the estimated 45,000 army
whose units came within an ace of capturing Freetown 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-dawn clash between paratroopers and some 40 rebels,
coupled with a second attack on United Nations peacekeepers at Port
Loko north of Freetown, suggests that, far from being on the
retreat, as some reports had suggested, the RUF continues to be a
threat to the capital, and more than a match for many of its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the presence of British troops, and a U.N. force
beefed up by the arrival of Nigerian troops, several bargaining
chips remain in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate consists of the 350 U.N. peacekeepers held
hostage upcountry. It is not known whether these are being held by
one group or by separate, perhaps rival, rebel units.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF still controls the diamond mines in the north and east
of Sierra Leone, the country's economic lifeblood. It also has
bases in neighboring Liberia, whose president Charles Taylor will
be a vital party to any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. envoy, the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, is heading
to West Africa to meet Taylor and other regional figures. But the
Sankoh episode could make it harder to secure the hostages'
release.

<P>
   The seizure of Foday Sankoh is a heavy, but not necessarily
fatal, blow for the Revolutionary United Front which, hours before
its leader was taken, was skirmishing with British paratroopers
only a dozen miles from Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's capture undoubtedly deprives the Sierra Leonean rebels
of their leader and most charismatic commander, who was technically
vice-president of the coalition government of Tejan Kabbah set up
following the September 1999 Lome peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from clear Wednesday night whether the eight-year
civil war was finally drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   One theory was that the rebel effort will now disintegrate and
factions of the RUF will switch allegiance to the government.
Others fear a new commander could emerge, and that the savage,
anarchic struggle will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations between Sankoh and his troops are complex,'' one
diplomat said, acknowledging the fluidity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sankoh was taken into custody _ possibly betrayed by some
of his nominal supporters _ rebel strength was put at 10,000 to
15,000, plus unknown numbers of child soldiers and other
sympathizers. This is well down from the estimated 45,000 army
whose units came within an ace of capturing Freetown 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-dawn clash between paratroopers and some 40 rebels,
coupled with a second attack on United Nations peacekeepers at Port
Loko north of Freetown, suggests that, far from being on the
retreat, as some reports had suggested, the RUF continues to be a
threat to the capital, and more than a match for many of its
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the presence of British troops, and a U.N. force
beefed up by the arrival of Nigerian troops, several bargaining
chips remain in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate consists of the 350 U.N. peacekeepers held
hostage upcountry. It is not known whether these are being held by
one group or by separate, perhaps rival, rebel units.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF still controls the diamond mines in the north and east
of Sierra Leone, the country's economic lifeblood. It also has
bases in neighboring Liberia, whose president Charles Taylor will
be a vital party to any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. envoy, the civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson, is heading
to West Africa to meet Taylor and other regional figures. But the
Sankoh episode could make it harder to secure the hostages'
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a stumbling block in the negotiations,'' a
spokesman for Taylor said. ``Sankoh was a key part of the Lome
agreement.'' &QL;

<P>
   PARIS -- This month's ``love bug'' and last year's ``Melissa''
computer virus were child's play compared with the damage that
could be done with existing technologies, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   A rogue state, terrorist or other malefactor could wreak havoc,
not with a nuclear or biological weapon but with a computer virus
that could cause massive disruptions or worse throughout the world,
these experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maliciousness of a virus is not limited by technical
obstructions but by the inventiveness of the perpetrator,'' said
Leonard Adleman, Henry Salvatori professor of computer science at
the University of Southern California, who has been studying
computer viruses for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would predict that we haven't seen the worst possible of
them,'' Adleman said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``I don't see
any obstructions to a really bad virus coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, ``The Internet has no perfect defense, and
it can never have a perfect defense.'' In other words, anti-virus
programs can only protect against known viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world should be very frightened,'' said Adleman, who in
the 1970s was one of the inventors of RSA cryptography, which has
become the world's leading computer encryption system.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, at least, it appears that the world's most
critical computers _ those that run electricity generators and the
banking system, for example _ are immune to e-mail-borne viruses
such as Melissa and the love bug, which was sent as an attachment
to an electronic-mail message with the subject line ``ILOVEYOU.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers that perform such key functions are almost all
based on the Unix operating system rather than on Windows, and they
have a much higher degree of security protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people being affected are the users of the systems rather
than the basic infrastructure,'' said Chris Goggans, director of
operations at Security Design International in Annandale, Va., and
London. As a result, he said, the computer virus attacks so far
have been ``annoying but not catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed, however, that they could have been a lot worse. If
the person who had released the ``love'' virus had been ``more
malicious,'' he said, ``It could have caused real problems. There
are certainly ways to cause real nastiness to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   While all of the attacks to date have been ``perpetrated by
amateurs,'' Goggans said, the speed and scope of the love virus
were eye-opening. ``I don't know of a single place that that virus
didn't arrive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone can write 50 lines of Visual Basic code and make
that happen _ someone with a dedicated target and lots of resources
_ what can they accomplish?'' he asked. ``Given the fact that the
vandals can do so much, it stands to reason that if you have high
motivation and a powerful tool, you can do much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Goggans said it would difficult to imagine a successful virus
attack against a basic-infrastructure computer. But in the ongoing
cat-and-mouse game between computer systems on the one hand and
hackers and vandals on the other, he said, the attackers have
consistently done things that had been considered unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Goggans added that, in testing the computer security of its
clients, Security Design International had broken into supposedly
secure computers of banking systems, power plants, hospitals and
major car companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the successful viruses so far have been delivered by
e-mail and required the recipient to open an attachment. The
``ILOVEYOU'' virus exploited a feature of the widely used Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program that is not available in other e-mail
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways to send viruses over the Internet besides
e-mail, Goggans said. For example, it might be possible to hide a
malicious program in a Web-site link so that when someone clicked
on the link, a virus would infect the person's computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not that hard to do,'' he said. ``It would be very
conceivable to hide something in there. In terms of what's going to
happen next, that might be the next delivery mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, it had been thought that for an e-mail
virus to infect a computer, the user had to open an attachment. But
then a virus called ``Bubbleboy'' spread, and all that it required
was that the user highlight the e-mail on the computer screen. No
attachment was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of damage that viruses can inflict was demonstrated in
April 1999, when the ``Chernobyl'' virus destroyed the contents of
an infected computer's hard drive. By comparison, the love virus
only tampered with picture and music files.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the genie is out of the bottle. The world knows how
vulnerable computers are, and some people are talking about it,
even if they are not actually doing anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can bring the entire West to its knees,'' Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist, said recently, according
to the newspaper Kommersant. ``Let us put viruses into their secret
programs like we did recently, and they will not be able to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A global assault of this kind would not require a sophisticated
and expensive delivery system. It could take just one computer
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Given the periodic and increasingly destructive computer viruses
that the world has seen in the past decade, the question now
appears to be not whether but when this kind of attack will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reasonable terrorist organization worth its salt should be
able to do this,'' said a leading computer security expert who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the only foolproof way to protect a computer from
new viruses on the Internet was to disconnect it completely from
networks. &QL;

   PARIS _ It has been little more than a week since the FBI opened
an Internet site to enable people to report fraud and crime on the
World Wide Web, and already it is inundated.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.ifccfbi.gov, received 3,700 complaints in its
first three days, ``which was surprising considering the system is
not well known,'' said the FBI deputy director, Thomas Pickard, at
the world's first international conference on cybercrime here.
</P>
<P>
   Although major villainy like child pornography on the Internet
and rogue programs like the ``ILOVEYOU'' virus grab the headlines,
Pickard's observations were a reminder that like an iceberg, the
vast majority of cybercrime is invisible.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it, he said, is $300 scams that victims put down to
experience and never report or that get low priority on police
blotters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of detection is a major problem, which is aggravated by
lack of awareness on the part of potential victims,'' the Japanese
chief delegate, Toshinori Kanemoto, told the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is about time that governments as well as industry
act to implement a policy for education and awareness building
about Internet security.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said the new reporting center on the Internet should
help the FBI track down crooks who operate across state and
national boundaries _ like the scam artist who he said sold
``autographed'' Mickey Mantle baseball cards to uncounted numbers
of sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd been real, I'd probably wanted to have bought them
myself,'' Pickard said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows the true impact of crime on the Internet. For
example, estimates of the damage caused by this month's e-mail
virus varied widely. ``We were surprised at the very high valuation
put on those losses,'' said Henri Serres, whom the French cabinet
appointed as its data security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the virus attack was a warning of the
damage that could be caused by ruthless criminals, and could be
positive if it made people more conscious of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The conference here is a first attempt to identify the problem
in its global dimensions and offer some solutions for the July
conference of industrialized nations in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day Paris meeting, ending on Wednesday, brings
together government officials, law enforcement officers and
representatives of private industry from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It also offers delegates a chance to discuss divergent
approaches to the problem. While the United States favors a
hands-off approach and the greatest possible degree of
self-regulation, the Europeans see more room for government action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our common interest to restrain the excesses of an
unfettered freedom,'' said the French prime minister, Lionel
Jospin, in his opening remarks to the conference on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans also distrust what they see as a cowboy attitude
toward privacy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The French interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, rejected
the notion that private data about consumers should be freely
traded, or that merchants or governments should have unrestricted
power to snoop into private lives.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that societies must preserve their fundamental values
and be vigilant that ``the new technologies do not become a
universal instrument of control and enslavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology industry representatives were dismissive of a
European Union proposal that Internet operators, such as service
providers, preserve customer and traffic data for three months in
case it is needed in crime investigations.
</P>
<P>
   David Aucsmith, chief scientist at Intel Corp., said the sheer
volume of data flowing around the Internet made it practically
impossible to store everything.
</P>
<P>
   Serres said government involvement in the Internet would not be
so necessary if industry did more to create a secure environment,
which Aucsmith described as ``a partly correct statement'' since
companies have been trying to get people online and make the
Internet as user-friendly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is natural tension between security and ease of use,''
he said, while acknowledging that as far as security goes ``we
could have done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevenement said that France would make combating cybercrime one
of the priorities of its six-month presidency of the European Union
starting in July, and would organize another major conference on
the subject at Poitiers, France, in November.
</P>
<P>
   He said France would support a convention on cybercrime drafted
by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, which proposes permanent
points of contact between governments to deal with the problem and
establish extradition procedures. &QL;

   PARIS _ The British government's decision to equip its air force
with European-made missiles and military transports was a major
setback for the Clinton administration's hopes of getting European
support for flagging U.S. defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe Wins,'' Le Monde newspaper said jubilantly in a
front-page headline Wednesday, describing the deal as proof that
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has rallied to more
independent defense capabilities in Europe, a theme long championed
by France.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the outcome more broadly, British and other European
analysts drew different conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the deal underlines mounting transatlantic
competitiveness in armaments as Europe puts together stronger
companies through cross-border consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed that Britain's involvement in defense matters in
the European Union will require France and Germany to do more to
modernize their own military forces _ or risk seeing Britain revert
to closer ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In offering to buy Airbus Industrie military transport aircraft,
a project still on the drawing board known as A400M, the Blair
government stipulated, as Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said in
Parliament, that ``we hope that we can sign a contract for the
A400M urgently, but this must be based on realistic figures for
purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   London has thus confronted Paris and Berlin with the need for
big investments fast to build the European cargo plane. France and
especially Germany may be unable to afford both Airbus's civil
project, a superjumbo to compete with Boeing's 747, and the
military transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may turn out to be an opportunity for the U.S.
suppliers,'' an industry source said. Lockheed-Martin has C-130Js,
the new Hercules, already in service with the Royal Air Force, and
the British announcement Tuesday included a lease for giant C-17
Globemasters, widening Boeing's presence in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the setback for Washington was unmistakable. It
was only the second time that the European members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization have purchased a non-U.S. weapons
system for themselves. The first was the British-German-Italian
Tornado warplane developed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That was the predecessor of Eurofighter, which will now be armed
with the Meteor air-to-air missile manufactured by a branch of
European Aerospace, Defense &AMP; and Space Co., a multinational
consortium in which French and German companies have a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications of the deal _ for the missile and for cargo
planes to be built by Airbus _ go beyond the $7 billion price tag
on Britain's purchases. Commercially, the potential global market
will be worth 10 times that figure, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing disappointment, the Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said
that ``it was a setback in that we had offered the British an
opportunity to work cooperatively.'' Raytheon Co., the U.S.
competitor, had promised to improve its air-to-air missile with a
major British work share.
</P>
<P>
   But British officials privately said that the Clinton
administration had brought too little influence to bear, too late,
to forestall a European surge in defense industries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies, including Raytheon, seen as unchallengeable two
years ago as they emerged from massive consolidation, have shown
signs of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Blair aide said in private, London shares doubts
in Europe about President Bill Clinton's power to deal with
Congress on export controls for U.S. technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteor missile, as standard European equipment in the
future, will not necessarily impair European warplanes' ability to
fight alongside U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, its technical prowess is designed to compensate
for weaknesses in the Eurofighter warplanes, which lack advanced
features, notably stealth, of current U.S. aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the deal will be felt primarily in terms of
heightened transatlantic industrial rivalry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a European tilt in this order, but it does not mean
that Britain has adopted a permanent industrial policy based on
some political bias in favor of Europe,'' according to Charles
Grant, head of the Center for European Reform, a think tank in
London. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Bush's gamble with your retirement
 &HT;    (Eds: Subs 6th and 8th grafs to clarify 2 percentage points.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the details will redeem it, but at first blush George W.
Bush's much-touted plan looks more likely to deform than to reform
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the pending GOP presidential nominee with boldness in
taking on the issue outside the usual formulas. The baby-boomer
crush can't be willed away by ignoring it.
</P>
<P>
   Without substantial change, the Social Security Trust Fund will,
by current estimates, be exhausted by 2037. Revenues into it could
cover only about 70 percent of the obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Any fix will be painful. Either benefits will have to be
reduced, or payroll taxes increased or benefit ages raised or some
combination of all-of-the-above. Or...
</P>
<P>
   Or the program will have to be radically refigured to somehow
sustain retirement incomes levels otherwise. Bush is proposing
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would let workers use 2 percentage points _ for starters _
of their Social Security payments for private investment. If the
economic winds prove fair, and if they invest either cannily or
luckily, most workers should be able to retire with maybe $300 a
month more than they would get from straight Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck in stock or money markets could financially strand
retirees. Bush says he would hedge the system against that, but in
a bit of a political shell game, he is withholding those and other
details until specific legislation is drafted after, he says, he is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you will have to make Bush president to see just
what he's talking about. Buying a pig in a poke is an inelegant but
apt description of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   What Bush is certainly not talking about is reforming Social
Security. Even if most workers came out a bit ahead, taking
payments from the system would hurry the fund's fatigue to 2023.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, by holding current and imminent retirees harmless,
Bush is betting the appeal to young workers will draw him more
votes than fiddling with the system will cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Could be. Young workers have grown up with overnight wealth
popping up all around them like morning geysers. Why put money into
some stodgy old trust fund when you could be soaring?
</P>
<P>
   And they have been soured on Social Security by longtime
opponents of it claiming it's so doomed they'll never get a dime
back, when in fact the system can be sustained indefinitely with
periodic _ though, as noted, sometimes ouchy _ updatings, as we
have been doing all along.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security, it is worth remembering, is not an investment
scheme. It is an insurance policy, with emphasis on the ``social.''
It hedges all of us _ and indemnifies the society we share _
against the possibility and consequences of dire elderly poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It has succeeded magnificently. There still are elderly poor,
but the desperate poverty of the aged that once shamed the nation,
and the lifetimes of anxious uncertainty that accompanied that, are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to be said for the ``security'' in Social
Security, too.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Next week, the American Congress will vote on
whether to grant China permanent normal trading relations (PNTR) as
part of that country's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the subject of one of the most intense lobbying
efforts seen on Capitol Hill for many years and its outcome is
still in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should vote in favor of the bill, not mainly for
reasons of American economic self-interest, narrowly defined, but
because PNTR will speed the very changes in China that critics of
the measure say they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Both America and China would benefit in economic terms from the
tariff-reduction and market-widening proposals at issue, as with
any trade-expanding agreement. The deal would reduce average
Chinese tariffs from 24 percent to 9 percent by 2005. It would
abolish China's import quotas and licenses.
</P>
<P>
   And it would open up the Chinese market by allowing foreign
companies to set up wholly-owned distribution and sales
subsidiaries, by permitting 49 percent foreign ownership of
telephone companies, and by treating foreign banks in the same way
as domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, in view of this list, few oppose the measure
by claiming that America is giving up too much and China too
little. All the tariff cuts and market openings are on the Chinese
side. America gives up nothing except its ability to impose
unilateral trade sanctions under Section 301 of its trade laws.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue instead either that America would not get any of
the promised benefits because China cannot be trusted to keep its
word, or that America could get the same benefits anyway, without
giving up its unilateral trade-restricting powers. Both arguments
are weak.
</P>
<P>
   China's willingness to fulfill its international treaty
commitments has been, like America's, adequate though not
impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   China has signed four agreements with the United States since
1992. Its compliance with one of them _ an agreement to enforce
intellectual-property rights _ has been good; its record on keeping
its environmental promises has been fair, and on
nuclear-proliferation a bit less so.
</P>
<P>
   It has been bad at dealing with private commercial disputes
inside its borders, though even here there is progress. The record
could be better. But it gives no support to the idea that China is
inevitably negotiating in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that America can get the gains from normal trade
relations without the so-called loss of its Section 301 reprisals
is also implausible.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is that it could rely on its rights under a
bilateral agreement signed in 1979; or, failing this, that the
annual review (with implicit threat of sanctions) of China's status
is anyway consistent with the obligations both countries undertake
as members of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The expert consensus is that neither of these views stands up.
Certainly, under both rubrics there is scope for years of
litigation _ and while that is going on, American firms will be at
least somewhat restricted in their access to Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the real objections to the agreement are political,
rather than economic. PNTR, say its opponents, would stamp
America's seal of approval on a regime that is one of the worst
violators of human rights in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's own annual report on human rights recently
found that China's ``poor human-rights record deteriorated markedly
throughout (1999) as the government intensified efforts to suppress
dissent.'' And if this happens even when China is seeking a new
trade relationship with America, imagine what will happen when it
gets that and America permanently eschews annual review of China's
human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never offer permanent normal trading relations with
Nazi Germany,'' says one congressional opponent of the deal. ``Why
should we do the same for China?''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting question. There are two answers.
</P>
<P>
   First, liberal trade with a country should never be seen as
conferring a nation's moral approval, not least because trade
comprises transactions between people and firms, not between
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has other ways of signalling disapproval to
China _ ways which, unlike trade restrictions, do not curb the
freedom of Americans as well as that of ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Second, China is not Nazi Germany, an irredeemably evil regime
bent on destruction and conquest. It is not as murderous, not as
implacable and not as dedicated to its goal: indeed, its leaders
are divided between those seeking to build a modern economy and
society, and the ``dark forces'' in the army and the government
concerned to build up military power and national assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that China's militarists and reactionaries are
its own foremost opponents of PNTR. They rightly see it as a
threat. The reformist leaders, intent no doubt on keeping the
Communist Party in power, nonetheless believe they had no choice:
the economy is struggling and there seems no other way to spur
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal trade by no means guarantees that China will move
swiftly, or ever, towards a western-style liberal democracy. Only
this week China's president called for party cells to be
established in private companies, on the grounds that the party has
long been the guiding light of ``progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is wicked and fatuous in equal measure _ but also, as
the economy liberalizes, probably unworkable. Trade with foreigners
will add to the pressure, already developing internally, for the
rule of law to be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Gradual progress in the field of commercial law, which is where
a more prosperous bourgeoisie first makes its presence felt, is
especially encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Trade is probably the best thing the West can do to stack the
odds against the regime. Withholding trade will likely do the
opposite, serving only to strengthen the forces of reaction and
their claim on popular support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporting China's entry into the WTO represents the most
significant opportunity that we have had to create positive change
in China since the 1970s, when President Nixon first went there,''
said Bill Clinton in March.
</P>
<P>
   He is right. Congress should grant China permanent normal
trading relations. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The cavalry, in the form of seven British warships
and 1,000 British paratroopers and marines, thundered in and
secured Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader, has been captured. Extra U.N.
troops are being flown in to provide security in the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Are Sierra Leone's problems on the way to being solved? Far from
it.
</P>
<P>
   The main stage in the struggle to put Sierra Leone together is
only now starting. And the main participants in this harsh struggle
seem to have little idea, and no joint idea, which way they should
be heading.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is the immediate problem of reinforcement. Britain
has suggested raising the U.N. force to 13,000. But the U.N. needs
bigger numbers far less than it needs well-trained, well-equipped
soldiers with both the ability and the mandate to attack the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The British troops go some way towards this, but they are not
under U.N. control and their continued presence is far from
certain. A large U.N. force that can do little more than guard duty
is desperately vulnerable to further hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the crucial question of what the next step should
be. Will there be a return to last year's Lome peace agreement,
which gave the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels seats in the
cabinet and Sankoh the status of vice-president?
</P>
<P>
   The government may have to choose between tearing up the
agreement and finding another RUF leader to cut a deal with. If it
decides to tear the deal up, it will have to try to defeat the RUF,
presumably with U.N., and perhaps British, assistance.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government says the question is
``under review.'' Privately, it is looking to Britain to give a
lead. The British, fearing accusations of neo-colonialism, say it
is a matter for Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nation's special representative in Sierra Leone wants
a return to the Lome agreement. The United Nations in New York is
less sure, worried particularly by the agreement's amnesty for
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, whose officials drafted the Lome deal, and whose
presidential envoy to Africa, Jesse Jackson, pushed it through, are
also divided.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was quoted last week as comparing Sankoh to Nelson
Mandela. This week he was trying to sound more diplomatic. But
Richard Holbrooke, America's ambassador to the United Nations, has
described the RUF as ``a bunch of ragtag, machete-wielding
murderers.''
</P>
<P>
   The void in policy is filled, to an uncomfortable extent, by
Liberia's president, Charles Taylor. He and Sankoh met through
Libya's Muammar Qaddafi.
</P>
<P>
   As the leading warlord in Liberia's own brutal civil war, Taylor
helped launch Sankoh and the RUF from Liberia in 1991. Since then
he has supplied them with arms, in return for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberia's 1997 election, which marked the end of the civil
war, he terrorized people into voting for him. Now he is seeking
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   The war in Sierra Leone provides the opportunity to play
statesman, as when he secured the release last week of some of the
U.N. soldiers who had been taken hostage by the RUF two weeks ago.
He says the arrest of Sankoh on May 17 is a ``stumbling block'' in
the release of the remaining 250 or so hostages.
</P>
<P>
   By this he means that he will be extracting a price for their
freedom. He may want something for Liberia, such as aid or, some
say, a state visit to Washington. Or he may just want Sankoh set
free in order to keep him in play in Sierra Leone and to continue
taking his cut.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations, Britain, America and the Sierra Leonean
government all followed the same policy towards Liberia and the
RUF, Taylor could be taken on. But they are at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia, which was founded by black Americans, looks to the
United States as Sierra Leone looks to Britain, the former colonial
ruler. And Jackson, together with other black Americans who are
influential in formulating American policy on Africa, are personal
friends of Taylor's.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the unlikely event of the outside world formulating a
single coordinated policy towards Sierra Leone and Liberia, other
fundamental problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   The country is wrecked and Kabbah's government does not look
remotely capable of rebuilding it. It is hard to find any
politicians or civil servants who are not on the take. Groups in
the army have rebelled, deserted, joined the rebels or just used
their guns to enrich themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created the frustration that the RUF feeds off.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the state is on nobody's immediate list, but defeating
the rebels, and their influence, cannot be done without it. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Scorned and deeply frustrated, the peacemakers from
the U.N. Security Council boarded their flight home from Addis
Ababa at dusk on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Their Ethiopian hosts wasted no time. At around midnight the
following day, they began shelling Eritrean positions; at dawn
their troops moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   They came in waves, like ghosts from the battle of the Somme
transported to the parched Mereb Valley that forms the border
between Ethiopia and Eritrea. And, as at the Somme in 1916, they
were cut down in their thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Ethiopia's human-wave advance was more successful than
earlier invasions of the same kind. One of the crossing points was
not heavily defended by the Eritreans because it was not thought
reachable.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the Mereb River, south of Enda Simeon, the Ethiopians
had to march over mountains impassable to tanks and artillery. The
Eritreans, believing that the Ethiopians would not attempt this,
had only a few trenches and troops on their side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, the Ethiopians had broken through, capturing
nearly 500 Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians also invaded in force across the frontier near
Shambiko, some 40 km (25 miles) to the west. This time they used
their newly acquired tanks, backed by Russian-built fighter-bombers
and helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritreans moved thousands of troops in an attempt to staunch
the breach. But by May 18 they had been forced to withdraw from
Barentu, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
   If the two prongs of the Ethiopian assault can join up on the
road from Barentu to Mendefera, they could swing eastwards,
climbing the mountains towards Eritrea's capital, Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea claimed to have killed or wounded 25,000 Ethiopians in
the first three days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from the military casualties, whatever they really
were, the renewed fighting has displaced hundreds of thousands of
civilians who will now join the 13 million people in the Horn of
Africa facing starvation because of drought and war.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of an intermittently ferocious war, this could
be the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders, Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of Ethiopia,
and Issaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea, seem determined to
slug it out.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how they can return to the negotiating table
until one of them is near defeat _ and tens of thousands of their
young men dead on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. team, led by Richard Holbrooke, America's envoy to the
United Nations, applied intense pressure on both governments before
it left empty-handed. One member of the team said that the talks
had broken down long before diplomacy had run its course.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that political and economic factors, not least the
personal rivalry between the two leaders, were more important than
the original border dispute.
</P>
<P>
   When Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993, many
issues, including their future fiscal and trade relations, were not
defined but left to the good relationship between the two leaders.
The collapse of that friendship left a void.
</P>
<P>
   The war began as a clash over an obscure sliver of borderland.
The Eritreans went on the offensive, believing that the Ethiopian
government would collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethiopians quickly accepted a peace plan prepared by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), but Eritrea held back. Then,
last year, the Eritreans had a setback on the battlefield which
made them realize that their huge neighbor was far better able than
they to sustain a long war.
</P>
<P>
   They too signed the peace plan, but by then the Ethiopians were
no longer in the mood. They backed away from the plan, creating
technical problems that they said prevented them from accepting a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meles saw the war as a chance to establish his nationalist
credentials. A Tigrayan from the north, he was linked with the
Eritreans in the war against Mengistu Haile Mariam's dictatorship,
and had long been suspected of being Issaias's pawn. But the
normally fractious Ethiopians have now united around him, and his
party is likely to have done well at this week's election.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations with the OAU broke down, it took the
unprecedented step of publishing an account of the failed talks. It
did not directly apportion blame, but its account showed that
Ethiopia had been the more obstructive.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side, however, has been prepared to go out of its way to
secure a peace. Both have used the truce to prepare for a
resumption of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has quadrupled its defense spending since the war began
to $467 million last year. After a similar increase, Eritrea spent
$236 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money went to weapons from Russia and Ukraine _
which explains why Russia has been reluctant to allow a U.N. arms
embargo to be imposed on the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia dropped its opposition this week, letting the
Security Council impose an embargo for one year, it is now late for
this to have much effect.
</P>
<P>
   In about five weeks' time, the annual rains should begin
flooding the Mereb River, making war impossible. By then, the
Ethiopians will have tried to reach Asmara and the Eritreans, who
are at their fiercest when cornered, will have done their best to
stop them. &QL;

<P>
   RAMALLAH _ In the worst bout of violence for several years,
thousands of Palestinians battled with the Israeli army on May 15.
</P>
<P>
   They were marking al-Nakba Day: the term Palestinians use for
the ``catastrophe'' of Israel's establishment and their
dispossession from most of Palestine. (Israel, on the other hand,
celebrated its Independence Day on May 10.)
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, five Palestinians were dead, including two
children run over by a Jewish settler, and hundreds were wounded
from army bullets, both real and rubber. On the other side, 15
Israeli soldiers had been injured, five from Palestinian gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   The al-Nakba anniversary always casts a sombre pall over
Palestinians, wherever they are. But this time, in the West Bank
and Gaza, the violence was fuelled by other causes.
</P>
<P>
   One was the passing of yet another unmet deadline: the May 13
target for reaching an Israeli-Palestinian ``framework agreement''
on borders, settlement, Jerusalem, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
   However, an even more inflammatory issue was the Israeli
government's reluctance to release the 1,600 Palestinian political
prisoners still interned in Israeli jails, of whom 600 or so are
now on a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner issue highlights, for ordinary Palestinians, the
similarity between Ehud Barak's government and that of his
unlamented predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election last year, Barak has released about 400
prisoners, but always in niggardly batches.
</P>
<P>
   He has rejected advice from his own Shin Bet intelligence
service that the freeing of another 400 prisoners belonging to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement _ including those with ``Jewish
blood on their hands'' _ would help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without freeing the prisoners, there's no point talking about
peace,'' said a local Fatah leader, Marwan Barghouti, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Did Arafat encourage the protests that day? In a sense, yes. He
told Fatah leaders last week that the prisoners must be the
``central focus'' of the al-Nakba demonstrations and instructed his
negotiators to deal with no other issue in their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat was almost certainly not behind the gunfights,
between Fatah activists, including members of the Palestinian
police force, and Israeli soldiers, that erupted in various parts
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was a sign of the temper of his people that he could
no longer prevent such battles. When one of his security chiefs
went to Ramallah on Monday to tell Fatah men to stop shooting, he
was met by a hail of bullets, and they were not aimed at the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Arafat raises the heat in the
occupied territories when he wants to jolt Israel into coming some
way towards him in the negotiations. But domestic motives also play
a part.
</P>
<P>
   The release of a significant number of prisoners would do a
power of good to his declining stock in the West Bank and Gaza _
and nothing unites the Palestinians so strongly as the death of
``martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a high-risk game. If, after such sacrifices, prisoners
are not released, Palestinians will cast around for more culprits
than the Israelis alone. Some are already doing so.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the clashes, Arafat's chief negotiator, Yasser
Abed Rabbo, submitted his resignation. This, or so went his
official reason, was in protest against the back-channel talks
going on in Sweden between Israeli and Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a quiet warning to Arafat not to sign any
declaration of principles that would dilute Palestinian claims on
East Jerusalem, the right of refugees to return and the release of
all political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo has always been loyal to his leader. The Fatah
activists who took to their guns are loyal to the cause but not,
unconditionally, to Arafat. Their message to him was that any deal
that is acceptable to Israel must also be acceptable to them.
</P>
<P>
   With the occupied territories ablaze, Barak transferred three
villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Palestinian
Authority. It was a transfer from partial to full control that had
been on the negotiating table for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had told the Palestinian leader that the delay was due to
``domestic constraints'' within his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   On May 15, Arafat answered him by unleashing a few constraints
of his own. &QL;

   PORT-AU-PRINCE _ ``Everything is finished for the Espace!''
shouted the men who drove up to Graciamax Jean's house in a
Port-au-Prince suburb at 2:30 one morning this month, before
opening fire at the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, a parliamentary candidate for the Espace de Concertation
(Space for Concord), a coalition of opposition parties, was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Claudy Myrthil, was kidnapped for 12 days
last month and beaten, before being freed in return for a promise
to stop campaigning. He is now hiding. And on May 9, a rural leader
of the coalition and his son were murdered.
</P>
<P>
   In several recent cases of political violence, including the
attack on Jean's house, the perpetrators have claimed to be from
the Lavalas Family, the political party of Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the predecessor and mentor of Haiti's current president, Rene
Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that is true, violence against Lavalas's
opponents has mounted. There have been at least 15
politically-related murders, most of the victims being from the
opposition. Many opposition candidates have stopped campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigning is supposed to be for local and parliamentary
elections. These have been postponed five times since their
original date in November 1998. Haiti has had no parliament or
local officials for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The first set of elections _ there are two _ is now scheduled
for May 21. If the first lot is not held by June 12, a new
parliament cannot sit until January.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition accuses the government, and Lavalas, of trying to
delay these elections until a presidential vote in December, when
Aristide will run again. His popularity might boost other Lavalas
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the problems are logistical. Certainly,
registering 4 million-odd voters and 29,300 candidates is not easy
in a country as chaotic as Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it any help that in March the United States Senate,
prompted by Senator Jesse Helms, blocked funds for the elections,
after Haitian customs officers had seized a shipment of imported
rice from an American company in Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian authorities say the firm under-declared its
shipments; it denies doing so. The government's attitude is
suspicious, or at least unhelpful. It has repeatedly criticized
both the electoral council and its foreign helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Micheline Begin, the director of the local office of the
International Foundation for Election Systems, a Washington-based
group with much experience in Haiti, was declared persona non grata
this week by the government because she had accused Preval of being
unduly influenced by Lavalas. She left before she could be kicked
out.
</P>
<P>
   According to a foreign official, the electoral council is now
closer than ever to being ready, though it will have trouble
training ballot-box staff by May 21.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the last chance: leading opposition parties have
said they may withdraw altogether if voting is not held by then.
Yet even if the election is held, it will not look credible,
especially to Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Few may vote. In the last elections, in 1997, a turnout of less
than 5 percent set off the disputes that led to the current mess.
Foreign pressure on Haiti to hold a ballot soon is increasing. But
a dubious election could be just as bad as no election at all. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When he was no more than a leading Islamic figure
and part-time opposition politician, Abdurrahman Wahid was known
for his sometimes bewildering changes of course. These rarely
disconcerted his admirers, one of whom compared him to a river.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from on high, he might have seemed to be meandering all
over the place. Go with the flow, however, and you would find he
was always moving in the same general direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even now that he is president, Wahid's maneuverings have proved
surprisingly effective at achieving difficult political ends.
</P>
<P>
   They have, however, so far failed to restore confidence in the
economy. And, as President Suharto found in 1998, when popular
unrest forced him to relinquish power after 32 years, economic
failure can topple seemingly stable Indonesian regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Wahid's seven-month-old government presides over an
Indonesia that is far from stable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Jakarta's Chinatown was burned and looted with
the loss of hundreds of lives, precipitating Suharto's fall, the
city has again seen rioting. Far from the capital, fighting between
Muslims and Christians in the Molucca Islands erupted again this
week.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor is already on the way to independence, after deciding
last year to leave Indonesia, a decision met by a welter of
destruction. Elsewhere, notably in Aceh at one tip of the
straggling archipelago, and in Irian Jaya at the other,
secessionist sentiment remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Under Suharto, there was no doubt about what, ultimately,
guaranteed national unity: it was the repressive might of the army.
Yet Wahid has made progress towards defusing the most serious
regional insurrection, in Aceh, while at the same time clipping the
army's wings.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva on May 12, his government signed a cease-fire
agreement with the Acehnese separatists. It is far from being a
lasting settlement, but much closer than seemed likely last year,
when Wahid first promised a referendum on the region's future, and
then changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He deceived nobody with his ``clarification'' that the vote
would merely be to ask the Acehnese whether they wanted to see
Islamic sharia law introduced.
</P>
<P>
   In another hopeful development this week, a court convicted 24
soldiers and one civilian for their part in a gruesome massacre in
Aceh last year.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists were quick to complain that the sentences _ up to
ten years in jail _ were far too lenient. But that the armed forces
have been submitted to civilian justice at all is a huge step
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Even the army's former commander, General Wiranto, faced several
hours of questioning by prosecutors, also this week, about his role
in the debacle in East Timor. He then formally resigned his cabinet
position.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Wahid's apparent dithering _ he had earlier sacked
General Wiranto, only to soften this into a ``suspension'' _ has
been vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   All of this builds hopes that Indonesia may slowly confront and
come to terms with some of the abuses and excesses of the Suharto
years and the chaos that followed. Even Suharto himself no longer
appears certain to escape punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The river may wind its way to the sea in the end. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 525, OR CONTINUE TO 800) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Wahid's wiles work less well with investors. They
have three legitimate concerns: that the president knows little
about economic management, and cares less; that his economic
ministers are at loggerheads with each other and with him, adding
to the policy cacophony; and that his political aims are
interfering with economic policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   Worries on all three fronts helped to set off another alarming
slide in the currency's value this month.
</P>
<P>
   That the president is no economist would not matter if there
were clear leadership within his cabinet. But his chief economics
minister, Kwik Kian Gee, appears at odds with the president. He has
even said he would be ``ashamed'' to promote Indonesia to foreign
investors, as Wahid has done.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Kwik's position appears secure. The president has
sacked two other economics ministers for alleged corruption. Some
suspect their dismissals formed part of a deal to shore up
political support for Wahid in the diffuse coalition he heads. It
has not helped that he has appointed his unqualified brother to a
job in an important bank-restructuring agency.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has dragged the rupiah and the Jakarta stock market
down to levels last seen in October, when Wahid assumed the
presidency in a mood of some optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The lurch was arrested on May 17 by the announcement of an
agreement with the IMF. But even that was uncomfortably reminiscent
of two years ago, when successive IMF aid agreements failed to
prevent a slide into financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he may get away with in politics, Wahid needs to chart
a straight and steady course in economics _ and stick to it. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The manager of the biggest Nissan dealership in
Fukushima prefecture, about 200 miles (320 km) north of Tokyo, is
on edge. He barks commands to line up his troops as the great
boss's entourage is spotted coming down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no traditional Japanese occasion, full of bows and
elaborate protocol. The visitor, the man who runs Japan's
second-largest car company, is a Brazilian-born Frenchman, and he
prefers to get down to nitty-gritty questions about business.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ghosn used to be the chief operating officer of Renault,
France's biggest car company. He made his reputation as ``le cost
cutter,'' who paved the way for the French car manufacturer's
dramatic turnaround after he arrived there from the Michelin tire
company in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Renault came to the rescue of Nissan, investing Y643
billion ($5.4 billion) for a 37 percent stake in the Japanese
company.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ghosn is touring Japan to find out what has gone wrong with
Nissan in its home patch. He swept in to Koriyama for a quick tour
of the first showroom in Japan to sell Renault models alongside
Nissans.
</P>
<P>
   In his rapid-fire English, he quizzes the locals, through an
interpreter, on which cars are selling well and which not. He needs
the answer, fast.
</P>
<P>
   English is now the language of the company, at management level.
Ghosn is adding Japanese to the four languages he already speaks,
but he sticks to English to avoid misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, he holds a meeting with all the sales
and service staff, asking for their complaints and suggestions. It
works a treat, and he learns a lot. He is such a famous figure in
Japan that the local television stations turn up when he goes on
tour. So ``it's good for business too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since last July, Ghosn's job has been to rescue Japan's ailing
car manufacturer; he is chief operating officer, but collects the
title of president after this summer's general meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With the title goes a heavy responsibility. Nissan's plight is
awful: losses in seven out of eight years, a domestic market share
that drifted to an all-time low of 19 percent last year, and a pile
of debt, totalling Y1.4 trillion, plus Y1.2 trillion in its
financing division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like mission impossible,'' he admits, ``but we are
on track to make profits in fiscal year 2000, ending next March. If
we don't do that, we won't be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, Nissan was due to announce results for 1999, which
will probably be slightly better than the consensus forecast of an
operating profit of Y35 billion and a net loss of Y600 billion
after including provisions for closures and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   A year hence, say analysts such as Steve Usher of Jardine
Fleming Securities in Tokyo, operating profits should reach around
Y100 billion-Y130 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn is confident that he can do better than expected in both
1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   How? He aims to hack away the number of suppliers and force them
to take price cuts to provide 60 percent of the Y1 trillion cost
savings needed to get into the black and earn a return on sales of
4.5 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this amazingly bullish forecast is Ghosn's accumulated
experience. He came to Renault in 1996 when it was losing heavily.
Its strategy of merging with Volvo, to round out its product
portfolio, had foundered as Swedish shareholders revolted.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year he had closed three European factories, so that
booming sales from promising new models such as the Megane, Clio
and Twingo translated into profits rather than just unprofitable
sales.
</P>
<P>
   There was uproar when he closed one big assembly plant in
Belgium. While Louis Schweitzer, his boss, took the flak, Ghosn got
on with the hacking.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off: within three years Renault went from
operating losses of FFr6 billion ($1.2 billion) in 1996, at the
depth of its troubles, to operating profits of FFr9.7 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn now has to do the same with Nissan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the two companies, on opposite sides of the globe,
were very similar before Ghosn got to them.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily bureaucratic, they were both staffed by former civil
servants, long on sophistication and short on hard-nosed knowledge
about how to make cars efficiently, and how to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, as in France, such people are resistant to change. But
Ghosn has a rough-and-ready strategy for dealing with this: he
ignores them.
</P>
<P>
   At Renault, he judged that things were so bad that, with the
support of Schweitzer, he could afford just to press ahead. So he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by his Renault experience, Ghosn is likewise ignoring
internal opposition to his changes at Nissan. His view is that the
situation had become so desperate under the old regime that it had
lost all credibility, so he has carte blanche to sort things out.
</P>
<P>
   But he is no autocrat. When he arrived last July, he formed nine
cross-functional teams (CFTs) of middle managers to come up with
plans to transform the company.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kiyoaki Sawada, a senior finance manager leading
one team, these are not like ordinary project teams. ``We had those
before, but everybody just represented their department's
interest,'' he says. The new teams are different.
</P>
<P>
   The CFTs were a device that Ghosn first used in America to bring
about the merger of Michelin and another tire company, Uniroyal
Goodrich. He also installed them in Renault four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is hooked on the cross-functional approach, for several
reasons. It works in a crisis, he says, because people can
understand the need for rapid action. It makes people act outside
their specific areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most companies people make a specific contribution to the
company in their function,'' he says. ``But it is not expressed in
terms of profit, only in terms of performing their function
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Ghosn, who meets all the teams monthly, gets them to
focus on profit creation, which he reckons lies in the interstices
of different company functions. ``Profit is the most global aspect
of a business, and it is cross-functional.''
</P>
<P>
   The first product of the teams helped to form the basis of the
Nissan revival plan unveiled last October. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the land of lifetime employment (at least for many workers in
big companies), Ghosn shocked Japan by announcing the closure of
five factories employing over 16,000 people in Japan alone, cutting
capacity by 30 percent to bring it more into line with sales and
boosting utilization rates to around the 75-80 percent rates at
which car makers begin to make money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Already machinery is being moved out of the doomed plants into
those that will survive, and some workers have been transferred.
</P>
<P>
   Strong demand in the American market (and to a lesser extent in
Europe) means that production is actually running about 10 percent
higher than last year, so extra labor is needed in some other
Japanese factories.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn hopes to avoid actually sacking workers, which is
expensive in Japan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,500 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of his plan _ to rationalize the Nissan and
Renault distribution and dealer networks in Europe _ has just been
announced, and aims to produce savings of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn hopes to cut costs at Nissan's British plant, already
Europe's most efficient, by 30 percent, but thinks more pain is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, more fundamental changes are going
on. The two companies are pooling their businesses, moving towards
joint product development.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's biggest problem was that it has been making reliable
but boring cars, which customers shunned in favor of more
attractive Hondas (in Japan) or Volkswagens (in Europe).
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn ordered no fewer than 22 new models to appear by the end
of 2002. But beyond that, he is planning to build all Nissans and
Renaults on the same ten or so platforms, sharing the basic
floorpan that is the core of a car body and using a common range of
engines, gearboxes and other parts.
</P>
<P>
   The cars will look different, and the two separate brands will
be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   This process seems bound to lead to eventual merger, perhaps
within three years, to coincide with the French government's sale
of its 44 percent stake in Renault.
</P>
<P>
   The executive boards of both companies have considered merging
and decided that it must be the eventual goal, even though nobody
talks publicly about it. But before anything so drastic could
happen, Nissan must transform itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, who no longer holds any position in Renault, could be
creating his next job opportunity, as head of the combined group. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's economy has been roaring along, with low
inflation, for so long now that any mention of speed limits and
overheating was becoming decidedly unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In recent weeks, the signs that the economy is being
stretched beyond its limits have become unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Every measure of inflation has ticked up, particularly consumer
prices. Labor costs are accelerating. And productivity growth, the
elixir of the new economy, has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are now on the Federal Reserve's next policy-making
meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Will Alan Greenspan and his colleagues raise interest rates by
half a percentage point, abandoning their current strategy of
gradually tightening monetary policy in quarter-point increments?
</P>
<P>
   Most economists reckon that they will. The real issue, however,
is more fundamental. Is the extraordinary American expansion of the
1990s at risk of ending in the good old-fashioned way, with
spiralling inflation forcing a hard landing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question depends on three more questions. How
strong is today's inflationary pressure, and how quickly is it
likely to intensify? And will the economy slow down quickly enough
to dampen price pressure without tipping into recession?
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for inflationary pressure is now unambiguous.
Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in the year to March. Even
excluding the volatile categories of oil and food, ``core''
consumer prices rose 2.4 percent, roughly one half of a percentage
point faster than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The GDP price deflator rose by 2.7 percent in the first three
months of 2000, up from 1.2 percent in the middle quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of March's nasty inflation surprise might be
``one-offs'': tobacco prices, for instance, were affected by a tax
increase in New York state. Nonetheless _ and modest as they may be
_ there are broad-based upward trends.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six months, prices of services _ from health care
to hotel rooms _ have risen at an annualized rate of 3.6 percent,
almost a percentage point faster than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   More important for longer-term price pressure, labor costs are
also rising. The employment-cost index, perhaps the most widely
watched gauge of wage pressure, rose 4.3 percent in the year to
March, its biggest jump for more than eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Rising wages and higher benefit costs both fuelled the increase.
For workers in private industry, wages and salaries rose 4.2
percent in the year to March, while overall benefit costs were up
5.5 percent over the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Health benefits, in particular, have risen sharply. In another
recent report, the Minneapolis Federal Reserve noted that
health-care costs in Minnesota were up 10-12 percent from a year
ago. The downward nudge that low benefit costs gave to wage figures
seems to be over.
</P>
<P>
   That America's super-stretched labor market is finally producing
accelerating wages is hardly a surprise. The unemployment rate fell
to 3.9 percent in April, the lowest level since 1970 and the lowest
peacetime level since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a brave economist who actually puts a number on
where the ``natural'' rate of unemployment might be today, it is
almost certainly higher than 3.9 percent. Nor does the tight labor
market show any signs of letting up.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the jump in employment was caused by the temporary
hiring of hundreds of workers for the U.S. Census. But even
excluding that, over 256,000 new jobs, on average, have been
created every month for the past six months. That is substantially
more than the already strong monthly average of 230,000 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 65 percent of Americans aged 16 and over are now
employed, a record high. And every measure of joblessness is at
record lows: unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics, for
instance, have hit their lowest level since records began.
</P>
<P>
   With a labor market this tight, wage pressure is likely to keep
building up. It may do so gradually, but it will be persistent. To
what extent higher wage pressure will fuel inflation depends on
productivity growth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1999, productivity grew so fast that it
more than made up for rising wages. Unit labor costs actually fell.
</P>
<P>
   Recent evidence suggests that this trend may be reversing.
American workers output per hour rose by an annualized 2.4 percent
in the first three months of 2000, well below the 6.9 percent rate
of productivity growth in the final quarter of 1999. As a result,
unit labor costs rose 1.8 percent in the first three months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is still a modest rise, well below the rate of
inflation. Compared with a year ago, unit labor costs have risen a
tiny 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And it is important not to exaggerate the impact of one
quarter's figures. Nonetheless, it seems that productivity growth
is slowing while employment costs are accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Goldman Sachs expect unit labor costs to
accelerate to 3.2 percent by the end of the year. At those levels,
more inflationary pressure will be inevitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of a wage-price spiral, the labor market
needs to calm down. And in order for unemployment to rise a bit,
the economy clearly needs to cool off: not just to its sustainable
rate of growth, but quite possibly below that for a while. For only
if the economy grows below trend will unemployment begin to edge up
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Again, accelerating productivity means that no one knows exactly
where America's sustainable growth rate now lies. But it is
certainly below the annualized 7.3 percent by which the economy
grew during the last three months of 1999, and below the 5.4
percent it grew in the first three months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible (but still highly uncertain) guess is that
America's sustainable rate of growth now lies between 3.5 percent
and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Can the economy slow to that level, and beyond, without a hard
landing? So far, it is hard to see much evidence of serious
slowdown. In many ways, the first quarter's GDP estimates
understate just how much demand has been booming.
</P>
<P>
   A huge trade deficit and drops in inventory dragged down overall
GDP growth, even though overall consumption grew by a staggering
8.3 percent at an annual rate, and investment in equipment and
software soared almost 24 percent, as companies stopped worrying
about Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   This rip-roaring rate is unlikely to continue. The post-Y2K
effect will not recur. And much of the consumption boom was
probably due to the exceptionally mild winter, which may have
induced people to spend more than they might normally have done.
</P>
<P>
   Some statistics are still strong: April sales of new houses were
firmer than expected. But retail sales unexpectedly fell in the
same month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given that exports are likely to rise in today's
more vibrant global economy, and that inventories will need to be
built up, GDP growth in the second quarter of 2000 could still be
well over 4 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To achieve a sustained slowdown, interest rates clearly need to
rise. But by how much?
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets have priced in a high probability of
short-term rates rising a full percentage point, to 7 percent, this
year. Some analysts expect an even more aggressive tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at J.P. Morgan, for instance, now forecast that the
federal funds rate will reach 7.25 percent by August, which implies
a total rise of 1.25 percent in only four months.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rapid tightening may well not happen, but it is not
unprecedented. In 1994, Greenspan raised short-term interest rates
by 1.5 percent in a matter of months.
</P>
<P>
   Quite plausibly, rates could rise enough to slow down the
economy sufficiently without bringing on a calamity. But once a
boiler has started steaming, it is certainly hard to carry on
boosting it without blowing it up. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It is, by common consent, the most important trade
vote in Congress since the approval of the North American
Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it hardly looks that way. When the House of
Representatives decides, next week, whether to give China
most-favored-nation trading status on a permanent basis (PNTR, in
the jargon), very little will change.
</P>
<P>
   China will enter the World Trade Organization whatever happens.
And America is not being asked to cut its tariffs one jot.
</P>
<P>
   But this vote will dictate the terms under which the $100
billion trade between America and China is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   It will influence how far American companies will share in the
modernization of the Chinese economy that WTO membership is likely
to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   It will determine whether American negotiators are involved in
the final few discussions over the terms of China's WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
   And as if all that were not enough, the vote is one of the most
important national-security decisions for many years.
</P>
<P>
   If America and China are left at odds on trade, this will
bedevil resolution of other urgent problems _ over Taiwan and the
deployment of a missile-defense shield _ that need attention.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is a cliff-hanger. To pass or defeat the bill, 218
votes are needed. At the moment, neither side has them.
</P>
<P>
   On the most recent formal count by Congress Daily, 167 members
of Congress are in favor, 160 are against and 108 are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Informal, and more accurate, tallies suggest that both sides
have nearly 200 votes and the real pool of undecideds is nearer 40.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, heavy votes in favor of the bill in both the House
Ways and Means Committee (34-4) and the Senate Finance Committee
(18-1) seem to have persuaded some of the waverers. But many are
still unsure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some support the bill on its merits, but worry about the
reaction of their constituents and so are taking time to screw up
the courage to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   David Dreier, one of the leading Republican supporters of the
bill, says he reckons that 150 members of his party will vote for
it. That is the number of Republicans who voted for annual renewal
of China's trade status last year.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow-Californian, Robert Matsui, who is organizing support
for the measure among Democrats, says he has over 60 votes lined up
and hopes to get nearer 70. If so, the bill would squeak through.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality the vote is so close that any calculations could
be easily overturned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   David Bonior, the bill's leading Democratic opponent, says that
two-thirds of his party will oppose it, 40 more than opposed the
annual renewal of the China trade bill last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The evenness of the contest is surprising. Considered in the
light of the usual (mercantilist) terms for judging trade deals,
the arguments in favor of the Chinese agreement look overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, China would cut average tariffs from 24 percent
to 9 percent by 2005; eliminate import quotas and licenses; open up
its retail market by allowing foreigners to set up wholly-owned
distribution and sales subsidiaries; allow minority foreign
ownership of telecoms companies and securities houses; and stop
discriminating against foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   In return, America would give up nothing but its ability to
impose unilateral trade sanctions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The forces of persuasion have been no less one-sided. For once,
no one can accuse President Bill Clinton of ignoring a
foreign-policy matter. He has set up a ``war room'' to rally
support for the bill, modelled on the one that oversaw the
relentless effort to win the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   He will meet face to face with all the undecided congressmen.
Last week, he gathered together virtually everyone who was anyone
in the conduct of foreign policy for the past quarter-century:
former presidents, former secretaries of state, former secretaries
of commerce, even a long serving former Senate leader, Mike
Mansfield, still sprightly at 97.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the opponents of the China bill staged a rally
starring no one more lustrous than Goldie Hawn, an even sprightlier
actress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 725) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Both John Sweeney, the head of the AFL-CIO, the main union
federation, and his opposite number at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, Tom Donohue, have promised to do whatever it takes to
swing the vote their way.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been as good as their word. The difference is that
business groups have outspent unions by about ten-to-one and have
inundated congressmen with visits and meetings in their own
districts. You cannot throw a brick in the Capitol these days
without hitting two or three business lobbyists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hence the intriguing question: why, despite this overwhelming
preponderance of influence, money and argument, is the China vote
so close?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Republican opposition to the bill is driven by
political concerns over national security and human rights. The
Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have been giving
congressmen briefings that explain, in detail, how China is using
its export earnings to upgrade its weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at a time of tension between China and Taiwan, and not
long after last year's revelations of Chinese spying in American
nuclear laboratories, the impact has been considerable.
</P>
<P>
   Several free-trading Republicans, who voted for annual renewal
of Chinese trade, have come out against PNTR on national-security
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, China's deteriorating record on human rights _
detailed in a recent report by the State Department _ has
galvanized a group of Republicans for whom moral and religious
questions trump business arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the main organizations of the religious right, such as
the Family Research Council, once run by Gary Bauer, are strongly
against trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger explanation for the persistent strength of the
opposition has nothing to do with the merits of the argument or
national debate at all.
</P>
<P>
   All politics, as a former Democratic speaker once said, is
local. Many Democratic congressmen, including some who accept the
intellectual arguments for PNTR, will still vote against it because
this is election year and they are relying on union members, rather
than businessmen, to support them in close races.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was a comparable decision, over NAFTA in
1993, the free-traders won because some Democrats defied the unions
and voted along with Republicans in favor of the bill. The next
year, the Democrats lost control of the House for the first time in
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of argument or business money can change the power of
that example, or alter the fact that labor has made defeat of the
China bill its top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   So what, if anything, might change the debate in its final days?
One possibility is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Sandy Levin, a
Democrat, and Doug Bereuter, a Republican, to set up what they call
a ``Helsinki-style'' commission, with members drawn from both
houses of Congress and from the administration, to report each year
on Chinese human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents condemn this as toothless, but it might give wavering
Democrats the fig leaf they need to vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
   So might an unusual recent development: the emergence of a
number of dissident voices inside China supporting PNTR. (This is
significant because such voices are being heard for the first time:
most exiled Chinese dissidents in America have condemned the
proposal.)
</P>
<P>
   But the vote remains on a knife-edge. It will be won, or lost,
one congressman at a time. And, if it fails, the world will be left
to pick up the pieces. &QL;

&HT;     ANOTHER SMALL TIME FLICK FROM WOODY ALLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more revealing bits in the new Woody Allen movie _
which, incidentally, is comprised of bits, as most Woody Allen
movies are anymore _ involves Allen digging a tunnel. Behind him is
Michael Rapaport, urging him to wear his miner's hat backward. And
Allen, as dim lowlife Ray, complies, flipping the hat around so
that light on his head shines the wrong way. He's entirely
indifferent as to how ridiculous he looks, because as Rapaport's
Denny tells him, it's fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' is populated with the thickest collection
of stooges ever assembled in one of Allen's comedies, as if he has
finally capitulated to the pervasive notion that, from the Farrelly
brothers to the Dogma 95 guys, there's comedy inherent in violent,
stupid people.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Allen is out of his league, or that he's
as culturally lost as he was in, say, ``Celebrity.'' But his movies
lately are aching for conceptual wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   In its false embrace of stupidity, the film is already a distant
cousin to Lars von Trier's ``The Idiots,'' also just out.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast that includes Tracey Ullman (as Frenchy), Jon
Lovitz, Tony Darrow and a tearfully funny Elaine May, ``Small Time
Crooks'' takes us on a basic route back to Allen's halcyon days,
when his quickie farces refused to let you come up for air. For the
first half of ``Small Time Crooks,'' the jokes, physical shtick and
sight gags _ as cheap or impolite as some of them are _ are
breathlessly funny transports to that era. What's missing is any
discernible trace of a mission beyond getting easy laughs, which
evaporate in the final act, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that Allen was aspiring to do something more
than entertain on a mass scale _ it's odd that his most widely
distributed and, DreamWorks thinks, his most potentially mainstream
film happens to be one about the bliss of ignorance. An ex-con
exasperated with his gig as a dishwasher, Ray restlessly hatches a
plan to rob a bank by buying the storefront across the street,
where Frenchy will bake cookies while the boys dig a tunnel leading
to the bank. The early sequences have the insouciant, whimsical
snap of Allen's stronger one-act plays and short stories. But it's
difficult to see Ray's scheme as fodder for anything more
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   After the boys do things like strike a water main and mistakenly
dig their way into the boutique next door, it would take divine
intervention for the film to rise to creative higher ground.
Twenty-five years ago, that dank, birth-canal-like tunnel would
have led straight to Elliott Gould's brain. Instead, Frenchy the
ex-stripper and Ray the ex-con become the tasteless, gaudy
multimillionaire owners of Sunset Farms Cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchy dreams of being a respectable New York socialite instead
of the flamboyant Noo Yawk holdover from Ullman's ``Tracey Takes On
. . .'' sketch show that she is. The decision to recruit Hugh Grant
as the urbane British art dealer to whom Frenchy turns for culture
(not to mention the decision to have him wear a scarf) further
illustrates the uninspired territory ``Small Time Crooks'' has
waded into.
</P>
<P>
   In the best role she's had in years (as Frenchy's dim cousin,
Mae), Elaine May plays what should be dubbed the Woody Allen
half-wit, a woman whose obtuseness is a hysterical matter of fact.
He's been writing these women for about 10 years, women whose
vapidity begs a surreal hypothetical. But May's enlightened dryness
rescues the part from being an insulting half-wit redux, despite
the cruelty fueling the comedy behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The best lines here are the meanest ones _ hurled at Ullman and
May. ``I'm gonna slam your head off,'' Ray tells Frenchy with the
sort of contempt held over from ``Deconstructing Harry,'' but with
a Ralph Kramden growl. A line like that is funny because it just
sounds pathetic and impossible _ screwball banter as a delightful,
empty threat.

 &HT;    Corporate good works
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne McCollors, stylishly dressed in a red and blue
plaid polo shirt, navy blue pleated pants and brown dress shoes,
knew that volunteering could be dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   A process analyst with Andersen Consulting in Atlanta, McCollors
joined with 30 colleagues this spring to renovate a portion of
Piedmont Park. He spent the afternoon spreading mulch with a
pitchfork around the park's playground area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I would get dirty, but I had to go back to work
afterwards,'' says McCollors, 24. ``I had to shake mulch out of my
shoes and cuffs, but it was a fun-filled day.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of corporate volunteerism is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, company brass view community service projects as a
way to raise employee morale, foster diversity, build teamwork, and
bolster the corporation's community image.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see a different side of the people you work with,''
says McCollors.
</P>
<P>
   And, hopefully, consumers see a different side of big business,
suggests Suzanne Apple, vice president of community affairs for
Atlanta-based Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteering . . . extends our customer service into the
community, and contributes to building our reputation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteerism has become so ingrained in the country's corporate
fabric that many organizations now use the theme of helping others
as part of their marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In television and print advertisements today we are told that to
BellSouth, ``Community Matters,'' that Coca-Cola is ``Reaching
Out,'' that ``AT&AMP;T Cares,'' and Philip Morris is ``Working to Make
a Difference.''
</P>
<P>
   What adds weight to these slogans are the hundreds of volunteer
projects these companies sponsor, helping to feed the hungry, house
the homeless and beautify neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers detailing such efforts can be staggering. Andersen
Consulting, for instance, holds 50 volunteer projects a year in
metro Atlanta, some involving as many as 600 of its 1,800 local
employees. A third of all BellSouth employees in metro Atlanta _
about 7,000 people _ belong to the Pioneers volunteer program,
averaging 38 hours a year in various projects. And half of Rich's
4,200 local employees volunteer annually, contributing 9,400 hours
of service.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reveal a dramatic shift in corporate thinking that
began about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSIONAL APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that companies saw volunteerism as something
nice to do,'' says Jeffrey Hough, vice president of corporate
affairs for the Points of Light Foundation, a Washington,
D.C.-based volunteer advocacy organization. ``The company's
volunteer projects might have been focused on a pet cause of the
president. But now companies are becoming much more professional in
their approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a company's community involvement related
directly to the conscience of the company's leadership, says Tom
Smith, a newly retired IBM executive of 30 years and a board member
and past chairman of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate volunteerism, he argues, was analogous to people who
helped rebuild a neighbor's barn when it burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it for one another, (being) fairly confident that one
day their own barn would burn down,'' says Smith. ``They wanted
their social dues paid in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   But as companies became larger, more impersonal and less in
touch with their communities, community involvement declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies couldn't see any return,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 study conducted by the Points of Light Foundation, 31
percent of the corporations surveyed said they connected
volunteerism to company business. In a similar survey last year, 81
percent of the companies polled connected volunteerism with
business strategies, including all those companies with more than
100,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Every company in the new survey reported that supporting
volunteer programs improved its public image, and 97 percent felt
volunteerism built teamwork skills.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that companies consciously use their
volunteer programs to strengthen specific business goals:
</P>
<P>
   _ 83 percent connect volunteer programs to their company's
public relations activities;
</P>
<P>
   _ 64 percent to their marketing and communications efforts;
</P>
<P>
   _ 60 percent to developing employee skills;
</P>
<P>
   _ 58 percent to job recruiting and retention.
</P>
<P>
   While there's nothing wrong with companies using volunteerism to
make them stronger, Smith thinks that real change and growth didn't
come until corporate leaders realized their companies had to
reflect the needs, interests and diversity of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteerism is very personal,'' says Smith. ``It's about
people and their own hearts, what they feel is really valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollors says he didn't understand Andersen Consulting's
emphasis on community service when he joined the company a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doubtful and suspicious'' of Andersen's motives, he
says. But after volunteering on a few projects, he changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteering . . . has been of tremendous value to me. I
realized that I wanted to be part of something bigger than just my
job, and that by becoming a better person I became a better
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot officials also recognize the impact volunteerism has
on its employees _ and its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decentralized company with 971 stores in North and
South America, Home Depot stays in touch with local community
concerns by having one employee at each store responsible for
targeting areas of need and pulling together volunteer projects
that offer solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made giving back and community values one of our core
values,'' says Home Depot's Apple.
</P>
<P>
   OLYMPIC LEAP FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   The growth of corporate volunteerism mushroomed across the
country in the early '90s. In Atlanta, it took the formation of two
volunteer agencies and one mega-event to ignite an explosion of
corporate altruism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Hands On Atlanta, an umbrella organization offering
companies a variety of ways to connect with service projects, was
formed. Then, in 1992, the Metro Atlanta Corporate Volunteerism
Council was created to help companies develop volunteer programs.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Atlanta Olympics that ultimately pulled the
corporate and volunteer communities together. ``The Olympics
spurred a lot of companies forward,'' says Linda Parrish, president
of the corporate volunteerism council. Olympic organizers ``turned
to corporations to be the backbone of their volunteerism efforts.
That galvanized companies.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympics ended, many of those companies redirected
their volunteer forces elsewhere. The impact on the metro area's
nonprofits has been immense.
</P>
<P>
   At Hands On Atlanta, corporate volunteers now contribute 100,000
hours of service at 400 agencies annually, doing everything from
tutoring children to providing meals for the homeless. The
organization depends on companies for a quarter of its 25,000
volunteers. In 1999, 425 companies volunteered with Hands On
Atlanta. In 1991, there were fewer than 10.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, many business leaders recognize today that creating
a better community through volunteerism feeds the bottom line. It's
a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is a business, not a charity, and what we do, we do
because it helps our business,'' says David Arneke, with AT&AMP;T in
Georgia. ``And the better off the community, the better off our
business.''

 &HT;    Chopra hopes to give up the limelight and seek spiritual growth
in obscurity
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Deepak Chopra is an industry: books, videos,
greeting cards, retreats, enlightenment, relaxation, focus, money,
success, weight loss, weight gain, more enlightenment. The author
of more than 25 books _ a half-dozen bestsellers _ and a denizen of
America's popular consciousness, Chopra was named one of the
century's 100 icons and heroes last year by Time magazine. Indeed,
the globe-trotting San Diego-based guru has risen to one-name
status. Forget the Chopra. For millions he is simply Deepak.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is coming to an end. Chopra, 53, an Indian-born
physician who left a successful career in endocrinology in the
1980s to pitch the benefits of Transcendental Meditation before
creating his own particular brand of self-awareness, says he wants
to trade it all for a search for serenity. In a few more years, he
says, he's off to obscurity _ giving up his reported $15 million a
year in earnings to seek spiritual growth somewhere away from the
public eye. ``I hope by the time I die, I will already have sunk
into anonymity,'' Chopra says.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting barefoot in a hotel room in Portland and speaking by
phone in his soothing Indian accent, Chopra says 90 percent of any
newspaper article is about the writer writing, not the speaker
speaking. ``Objectivity,'' he says ``is a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   So in deference to the man _ and the industry _ here then is
Deepak Chopra in his own words:
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post: You have said, seek the company of those
who are looking for the truth but run from those who believe they
have found it. A lot of people believe you have found it. What
would you say to them?
</P>
<P>
   Deepak Chopra: If I'd found it I would be by now sunk in
oblivion and anonymity and wouldn't be writing. I write what I
explore.
</P>
<P>
   PBP: You write a lot about exploring the magical and the
miraculous. There is a culture that believes that this can be
explored with hallucinogenic drugs. Do hallucinogenic drugs help in
this exploration?
</P>
<P>
   DC: They do. They have had a place traditionally in many
cultures as a means to initiatory rites and they have been part of
ritual and so on, so there is no question that hallucinogens and
mind-altering drugs can give somebody a genuine spiritual
experience. The problem is they lead to dependency and sometimes to
psychosis and they're dangerous. And when they're not part of a
ritual and part of a tradition they lead to lack of integration.
There is a thin line sometimes between a genuine spiritual
experience that can be integrated with everyday reality and a very
flashy spiritual experience that cannot be integrated into a
reality . . . so while I believe that, yes, hallucinogens have had
a role in traditional cultures and continue to have a role, in the
more fashionable parts of America that's an excuse more than
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   PBP: You have said that you are looking for God and that once in
a while you get glimpses of her. When was the last time you saw
her?
</P>
<P>
   DC: I get glimpses of God almost every day these days, my
attention is so much into that experience and I'm taking more and
more time in silence. I just returned from a retreat in Thailand,
and every three months I take a week of silence. I do have more and
more of the experience of . . . silence.
</P>
<P>
   PBP: Who are you voting for for President?
</P>
<P>
   DC: It's tough choice but I'm certainly not voting for Mr.
George Bush Jr. (laughs). I probably will vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   PBP: Can you get a sense of their spiritual development?
</P>
<P>
   DC: I have a sense of their development, yes. I think Gore, is,
from what I know of him . . . a very avid reader and the very fact
that he has championed ecology for a long time means he has a sense
of the web of life. He's more eclectic, he's more international.
Bush called the Greeks Grecians the other day and people of East
Timor East Timorians. That doesn't say much. He couldn't name the
most important heads of states of many countries.
</P>
<P>
   PBP: You've said that poverty is a reflection of an impoverished
spirit. Is that always the case?
</P>
<P>
   DC: Unless it's voluntarily sought. But if it isn't voluntarily
sought, you know, as Mr. Oscar Wilde once said, there is only one
category of people that think more about money than the rich, and
that's the poor. In fact, the poor can think of nothing else. In my
view wealth is a state of consciousness as is poverty, and poverty
is the lack of creativity. I also believe that it's a shame that it
exists today, with all the resources that we have and all the
technology and all the creativity. As we evolve into a more
spiritual society, then we will take the collective responsibility
to eliminate it. I have personal plans for tackling this, which I
can't share with you right now because I'm still developing them.
But I have a very personal desire to participate in the elimination
of poverty in the world.

 &HT;    Florida coast dig reveals centuries old settlement
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Archeologists who dug around the Jupiter
Lighthouse during its recent renovation say they have uncovered the
first physical evidence of a 1700s English settlement previously
mentioned only in historical records. The findings, they say, are
the oldest evidence ever of an English presence in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''It provides proof that the site is more historical than
previously believed,'' said Conservancy Director Bob Carr, who held
a news conference on the site Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Recovered were a fragment of a tobacco pipe made from Jackfield
Ware, a British lead pottery, and a piece of tabby, a plaster-like
substance commonly used as building material in English colonies,
said field archeologist James Pepe of the Architectural and
Historical Conservancy in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Both finds, dug up near the mound on which the lighthouse sits,
were carbon-dated to the 1734-1800 period, Pepe said.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts were linked to the Grenville settlement described
in archival records. They will be displayed at the Florida History
Center and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are scant records of the area known as Grenville,
Carr and Pepe said records do show an English settlement in the
Jupiter Inlet area in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   Archival records show that in 1770, Dutch mapmaker William
Gerard De Brahm created the first well-known map of the area and
referred to the Jupiter Inlet area as the Grenville Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1773, English geographer Bernard Romans travelled to the
Jupiter Inlet to map the Florida coast and wrote that the area was
called Grenville. The Grenvilles were most likely an English family
given a grant to the land when Florida was owned by England
(1763-1783).
</P>
<P>
   In 1815, with Florida under Spanish rule, Spaniard Eusebio Gomez
asked the king of Spain for land that included an English
settlement. The area he received was 12,000 acres in the Grenville
(Jupiter Inlet) area. Pepe says that a land grant application was
given to Gomez which included the Grenville area.
</P>
<P>
   Carr says the detailed history of the English settlement is
probably somewhere in England. ``Nobody's ever dug for it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists also carbon dated oyster shells at the lighthouse
site that are believed to have been placed there by Native
Americans in the period 925 to 950 A.D., Carr said. Carr said this
is a significant find because they are the first artifacts taken
from the north side of the inlet. Carr said there are probably many
English artifacts, including structures, that could be found with a
more comprehensive dig _ one that would cost about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the discoveries at the Jupiter Lighthouse, the only other
finds of British artifacts in South Florida were in Miami, Carr
said. He said they were dated from 1790 to 1810 and discovered in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Any future excavations on the federal property would depend on
Coast Guard permission and getting the money to do it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservancy was hired to do a surface excavation required by
the federal government as part of the grant that paid for
lighthouse renovations.

 &HT;    Yet another great man is gone
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ When I heard of Jerry Flemmons' death back in
September, I found that I couldn't write about it. This surprised
even me since I had been able to write about my father only a few
hours after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmons and my father are interconnected in my life in many
ways, though they barely knew one another.
</P>
<P>
   But I could not write about Flemmons. Perhaps it was because he
was a writer himself. Actually, it is a sacrilege that I even talk
of us both being writers in the same paragraph. I hack. Flemmons
wrote. Not that Flemmons would be offended by the comparison. He
was as unassuming a man as I have ever met.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you don't know Flemmons and have never read any of
his work. I'm sorry for you because you have missed something
special. Look in Texas bookstores for any of his several books.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades Flemmons wrote for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram. He was a reporter, then a travel writer and a
columnist of such excellence as to put the rest of us to shame.
Really. This is not false modesty and I'm not the only writer who
would say it.
</P>
<P>
   It is Flemmons' fault that I am a journalist today, but don't
hold it against his memory. There is no way to know how many people
he inspired with his prose.
</P>
<P>
   I met Flemmons before I ever read the first word of his work
though. He came to my house to interview my father, the war hero.
</P>
<P>
   How Flemmons found out my father was a war hero I'll never know.
Certainly, I didn't know it at the time and neither did my brother
or sister. Like many of those who served in World War II, my father
refused to talk about his experience.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, my father the medic drove an ambulance through
``heavy'' enemy fire to rescue a single soldier trapped in the
middle of a battlefield and drove him out again, getting shot in
the process. That is what it says on his presidential citation. Not
that I found out about that
</P>
<P>
   Flemmons in his quiet, folksy manner got my father to talk about
it all _ not that I overheard the interview and not that my father
ever spoke about it to his children. I read it in Flemmons'
multi-part story ``War+25,'' one of the many articles and series he
wrote which won writing awards.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, maybe ever, my father revealed those
horrible and bloody days. The 30 minutes that earned him a few
medals was only a part of the story. There were the two weeks he
was missing in action that we had never heard about. My mother
received a terrible telegrams that he was MIA-presumed dead. He was
found in a foxhole two weeks later, delirious with pneumonia,
unable to tell anyone how he had managed to survive behind enemy
lines.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Flemmons' article that I first understood the power
and meaning of journalism. It was from Flemmons' article that I
first understood my father. You know which was most important.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know it as a young boy, but I was hooked from that
moment. I never admitted wanting to be a journalist until I went to
college _ mostly because I didn't think I could do it _ but I never
forgot Flemmons and how he went about his business and the
craftsmanship of his work.
</P>
<P>
   I was privileged to get to meet him again years later as a
journalist and got to tell him that he was my inspiration. He
smiled slightly and changed the subject. But later he came back to
me and told me that he remembered my father well and said with all
sincerity that he was a great man.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was. And so was Jerry Flemmons.

 &HT;    '60s generation won
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _My wife keeps up with fashion news. ``Did you read the
story about the new dress code at that big Atlanta law firm?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered. ``Is it in the paper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here in the Living section,'' she answered. I figured
the law firm had cracked down on some yuppie lawyer for not wearing
a necktie to work.
</P>
<P>
   Was I in for a shock! Powell Goldstein Frazer &AMP; Murphy, one of
Atlanta's biggest and most prestigious law firms, is doing away
with coat and tie except for courtroom appearances! I couldn't
believe it. The last wall breached! A staid silk-stocking law firm
going from Brooks Brothers to Wal-Mart!
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspaper really messed up on that story,'' I said. ``What
do you mean?'' she asked. ``They put it in what used to be the
women's section. It should have been the top story on Page 1 with a
big black headline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should they have done that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's the biggest story we've had so far in this
century,'' I explained. ``You must be crazy,'' she replied. ``It's
not bigger than Janet Reno kidnapping Elian at gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand,'' I said. ``Powell Goldstein Frazer &AMP;
Murphy lawyers dressing in garden clothes ranks right up there with
V-E Day and General MacArthur making the Japanese sign in Tokyo
Bay. ``You're off on one of your tangents,'' she said. ``This means
total and unconditional surrender,'' I said. ``We've lost and
they've won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't making any sense,'' she said. ``Who lost and who
won?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s generation has won,'' I continued. ``They've invaded
and subdued one of the last bastions of traditional values. Now
everything will fall like dominoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know you were such a stickler for formal dress,'' she
said. ``I have a hard time getting you to wear clothes that aren't
muddy and sweaty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garden clothes are one thing,'' I said. ``Work clothes are
something else, unless your work happens to be cutting pulpwood or
collecting garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The story says the firm had to make their lawyers start
dressing down because of their clients,'' she said. ``All those
kids who've made millions in new technology wear yard clothes to
work. They're turned off when their lawyer shows up in pinstripes
and lace-up shoes. They say it's good business to dress like their
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gee,'' I said. ``What happens if they represent a nudist
colony?''
</P>
<P>
   The new dress code at Powell Goldstein Frazer &AMP; Murphy is
mandatory, which shocked me. When I was trying to enforce a
modified dress code (socks, shirts and occasional haircuts) at the
newspapers in the '70s, the liberals argued that dress codes in the
workplace constitute cruel and unusual punishment and therefore are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that what one wears on the job has nothing to do
with job performance. Oddly, when one of the strongest objectors
got a job with The New York Times he promptly shed his bellbottoms
and headed for Brooks Brothers. I thought a reporter or
photographer out meeting the public ought to dress at least as well
as a clerk at the local department store.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon I got a call from an acquaintance, a weekly
newspaper editor who had gone to Athens to do some shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought you ought to know,'' he said. ``Two hippies are
going around Athens posing as a reporter and a photographer for the
Constitution. I think they're on drugs or something. They stopped
me on the street and tried to ask me some questions, but before
they could rob me I ran away and hid in a department store. Then I
called the police. I thought you ought to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have anybody in Athens?'' I asked our city editor after
I hung up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do,'' he said. ``We have a reporter and a photographer
doing a street poll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the new dress code at that law firm belonged on the
front page of the newspaper is that it's a trend story,'' I
explained to my wife, ``and you have to spot trends early. If
silk-stocking lawyers don't buy pinstripe suits and lace-up shoes
anymore, nobody else will either. Brooks Brothers will go out of
business. People will be wearing blue jeans and tank tops to
funerals. Wall Street will panic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are young people so fond of ugly clothes?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' I said, ``it's the uniform of a revolution. You
ever see Fidel Castro in a coat and tie?''

 &HT;    At war with roaches
 &HT;    Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Early in the morning I flipped on the kitchen
light and caught a movement of something large in my peripheral
vision.
</P>
<P>
   My home invader turned out to be a fearless tree roach about the
size of the Taco Bell dog.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind an occasional ant, spider, scorpion, gecko or wasp.
Roaches, however, are intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   My aversion to roaches extends to these big, flying tree roaches
that don't actually live indoors. They just wander in once in a
while to see if you have anything that can be pawned.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago when I was stationed in Florida, the natives there
referred to the same creatures as palmetto bugs. That's a nicer
name, but a roach is a roach whether it lives in trees or in
palmetto bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people like roaches. Nevertheless, some people appear
to tolerate the pests.
</P>
<P>
   If I couldn't rid my house of roaches, I'd move. Sleeping under
bridges and eating worms would be better than living in a
roach-infested house, in my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   That's harsh, I know. But we are shaped by our experiences. I
once had an experience with roaches that gave me nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   After I was discharged from the military, I worked for a few
years as a firefighter in a metropolitan city's busiest fire
station. Our district covered the city's worst slums.
</P>
<P>
   One day I was using a lath hook to open a hole in a ceiling so
my colleagues could put water on a fire. Suddenly, the entire
ceiling collapsed on my head.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK CLOUD OF ROACHES
</P>
<P>
   When the ceiling gave way, a black cloud of cockroaches came
down with the plaster. A jillion or so cockroaches fell inside my
fire coat and down inside my pants and boots. I was covered in
scurrying cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   The usual crowd of spectators and my firefighting buddies were
entertained when I burst out of the burning building performing my
new cockroach dance, a free-style frenetic creation that included
stripping out of my clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed the need for a new parking lot to my amused
co-workers who ignored me and put out the fire. After that, I often
thought many of the fires we fought were started by citizens
desperate to win a battle with their cockroach adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   This particular morning I was locked in a stare-down with the
big tree roach as I slowly slipped one hand under the sink for the
bug killer. I grabbed the wasp-and-hornet can and hit the intruder
with a powerful blast.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because my chemical weapon was not species-specific, it
took a lot of juice to best my opponent.
</P>
<P>
   I felt good about my victory despite a recent symposium in
London organized by the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare
where studies were presented that claim cockroaches can feel pain
and have the capacity to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   These people evidently are trying to get humans to stop
torturing cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies presented at the symposium announced discoveries
that slugs, snails and flies also feel pain. Cows, they say, can
react emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   If an animal feels and reacts to pain similar to the human
reactions, then that animal deserves special protection, according
to many supporters of animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of giving special protection to cockroaches doesn't sit
well with me. I'm not terribly concerned whether a cockroach is
discomfited when I kill it.
</P>
<P>
   What if these people find that pathogenic staph bacteria also
feel pain? What if the AIDS virus feels pain? Do we protect their
lives are the expense of our own?
</P>
<P>
   I say that if an animal dares intrude itself into my house or my
body, then it deserves what it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, I'd treat a human intruder the same way.

 &HT;    Woman on a mission
 &HT;    By Pamela Smith McCall
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The rapid click click click of heels on the
linoleum floor Temple Beth Or announced the arrival of Rabbi Judy
Chessin _ a sound followed by her expansive smile and rich, deep
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The smile radiates confidence, of the sort needed to juggle
hectic life and job: She's the 42-year-old mother of two sons, the
wife of a professor of Judeo-Christian Studies at Hebrew Union
College in Cincinnati, and is also known as a forceful preacher.
She's also a woman on a mission _ that of carrying her faith,
Reform Judaism, out into a world that knows relatively little about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Chessin became a rabbi 15 years ago in a religion that has only
accepted women in that role since the early 1970s. She was among
the first 100 ordained women in the Reform Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make her a feminist?
</P>
<P>
   She does refrain from using the masculine gender when speaking
of God. But she sees her role as more a ``teacher and guide than a
commander and presider.'' She said this helps open the door to
Judaism _ particularly for women who have been abused by their
fathers, and who are therefore ``never going to relate to a father
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Chessin is equally dedicated to her role as mother,
being a rabbi is ``an ideal job _ so much of temple life is
family-oriented.'' She has been rabbi at Temple Beth Or, with a
congregation of about 200 families, for 15 years. Chessin said her
mission as rabbi is ``to help carry forth Judaism into the world.''
She wants to make Judaism ``accessible, positive and joyful'' _
especially for young people. That way, she says, her children and
others will want to pass the faith along.
</P>
<P>
   The most rewarding part of being a rabbi, said Chessin, is
``sharing intimate moments _ times of rejoicing and tragedy.'' She
also loves being in a position to ``facilitate community through
religious observances.''
</P>
<P>
   Chessin says one of the hardest parts of her job is ``keeping it
all going when finances are tight. Everyone is struggling.'' The
synagogue sets a fee for each family membership, and Chessin said,
``It's high.''
</P>
<P>
   But the business of managing the synagogue, while important,
isn't what gets her words flowing. She wants to talk about her
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Judaism is a relatively liberal movement within Judaism
with respect to interpretation of Torah, the Jewish Bible.
</P>
<P>
   She draws upon a well-known story. ``The miracle of, say, the
parting of the Red Sea was not so much what happened to the sea as
the miracle of an oppressed people finding freedom, collecting
themselves together, and creating this amazing nation that has
continued to this day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we look to God to do Red Sea miracles then we are
disappointed; and (today) we ask why God didn't do it at Auschwitz.
But if the miracle is that the Jewish people survived, that's where
we can see God's miraculous actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Chessin thinks all people need some help and inspiration from
God, though, ``We do not have the concept of original sin or the
sinfulness of humanity. Judaism says we have the good inclination
and the evil inclination which are constantly at war. We need to
give as much fuel as possible to the good inclination.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she went on to say, evil is necessary _ if only to balance
out and contrast the good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also our inclination to consume, to build, to grow. It's
our power. If we have no hunger for power, we won't produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Chessin said there is a story written by rabbis that tells how
the evil inclination was found and put in jail. ``All of a sudden
no one had any more babies, no one went to work, no one had any
ambition, no one built houses and nothing happened because everyone
was sitting around being pure and good,'' she said with a laugh.
``So it's a little of the spice and leavening of life. What they
did is this: They blinded the evil inclination and let it back into
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of this concession, she said, is that we continue our
struggle between both sides. ``I love that view, because I think it
is a realistic view of humanity. It puts the choice and
responsibility within ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has no illusions about human nature. ``We live in a
secular society, a humanistic society, where anything goes.'' To
counteract this, she said, ``if there were a sense that there
actually is something out there that cares, and that makes demands
upon us, it's a better world.''
</P>
<P>
   Chessin's response to living in a predominantly Christian
culture is: ``I love Christians. I feel that if our world were all
(genuinely) Christian, we'd be in a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   Then who is this God of modern-day Judaism? Maimonides, a major
Jewish theologian of the 12th century, said you can't define God
because our words are inadequate. ``You had to say God is not
whatever we are. God is not kind in what we think of kindness, but
something far beyond what we could ever define.''
</P>
<P>
   As God said in the Book of Exodus, ``I am what I am.'' According
to Chessin, this is God saying, ``You'll never get it. So let's
just get on with it!''

&HT;     RIDING ON HORMONES IN `ROAD TRIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the last 20 minutes, not-as-lewd-as-you-think ``Road
Trip'' is a gangbusters adolescent comedy with one eye on
unglamorous undergraduate realism _ an old Ford Taurus, a sexually
frustrated teaching assistant and virtual pennilessness are among
the supporting characters.
</P>
<P>
   The other eye, meanwhile, is on the possibility of doing
something (anything, really) to spin the fantastic from the
mundane. This includes, but is not limited to, a character named
E.L. (Sean William Scott) stealing a van from the school for the
blind; Kyle (DJ Qualls) the gangly shut-in stepping with brothers
at a black fraternity in Alabama; and a strangely exhilarating
four-man sing-along to Twisted Sister's ``I Wanna Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most superficial, ``Road Trip'' is one of those
laws-of-cheating essays meant to make young men nod in agreement.
But the film, co-written with Scot Armstrong and directed by Todd
Phillips, who co-directed the hazing documentary ``Frat House,'' is
also about the liberty of experiencing the world _ or, as much of
it as you can see driving from Ithaca, N.Y., to Austin, Texas, in
two days.
</P>
<P>
   It's a feat Phillips and Armstrong accomplish without asking any
of its four stars to hump an apple pie. The difference between
``Road Trip'' and last summer's now iconic ``American Pie'' is that
this new film, with its similar preoccupations, doesn't punish
curiosity with humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   What the two films share is a fascination with the absurdity of
the emotional-sexual evolution of boys. But what some mistook for a
poignant/raunchy coming-of-age comedy, so to speak, was executed
like an achingly inept horror film, carried to glory by its four
endearing young explorers and a killer dismount. Slightly more
mature and better assembled, ``Road Trip'' goes one better on
``American Pie'' by teasing out the idiosyncrasies in four guys
existing in a personality grab bag. The film also boasts an actual
narrative, however standard, as well as selfless MTV jester Tom
Green, for a second ply of comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   Set on the campus of the ``fictitious'' University of Ithaca,
the film is loosely the story of Josh and Tiffany, and, in the
limited parlance of campus tour guide Barry (Green), ``their most
challenging challenge ever'': the long-distance relationship.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a few days since Josh (Breckin Meyer) has heard from
Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard), who goes to school 1,800 miles away in
Austin. He's afraid she's cheating on him, but he's having trouble
reconciling monogamy with his attraction to Beth (Amy Smart), a
cute girl being hounded by Josh's Ancient Philosophy T.A. (Anthony
Rapp).
</P>
<P>
   One night after a party, apparently tipsy on ``sex lies and
videotape'' and Zima, Beth quizzes Josh with his camcorder about
what he likes in a girl. That just devolves into toplessness and
sex caught on a tape that's accidentally mailed to Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to save a relationship the average freshman would have
allowed to evaporate after a month apart, but without the cash to
fly to Austin, Josh decides to drive. He and his revved-up slacker
buddy E.L., played by Scott, the embarrassed jock from ``American
Pie,'' talk a taciturn, traumatized-looking virgin named Kyle, who
has Emo Phillips' demeanor and the face of Snoop Dogg, into letting
them borrow his dad's Taurus and credit card. Because he has
nothing else to do but study, Josh's pothead-genius roommate Rubin
(Paulo Constanzo) tags along, leaving the feeding of his pet boa to
Barry, who can't wait to see it eat a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   They have the weekend to get to Austin and back in time for a
philosophy exam that Josh needs to pass. The journey is raucous,
with the guys doling out male dating rules as though they were on
``Sex and the Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Things go disastrously wrong with the Taurus, Kyle's hotheaded
sheriff father (Fred Ward, the funniest he's been since ``Tremors
2'') gets involved and the film threatens to get haywire, taking a
detour into unnecessary grossness featuring a violent slice of
French toast.
</P>
<P>
   But once it gets to Austin, the film _ with its whiplash pacing,
dizzying energy and plausible, inspired grasp of girls _ feels
truncated, solving problems with anticlimactic terseness. It's as
though, just as Josh had to get back to Ithaca in time for his
philosophy exam, the film had to clock in at 90 minutes to make
that 11:35 multiplex late show possible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its petered-out story, the ideas about young men are
shockingly progressive: sexual stimulation of the prostate turns
out to be a good thing, as does losing it to a full-figured woman,
which Kyle does with a sister named Rhonda.
</P>
<P>
   Staggeringly in-tune with his black and Hispanic cousins, Kyle
may be the only man in Hollywood who knows what to do with a
42-35-48 and truly espouse the passions in Sir Mix-A-Lot's ``Baby
Got Back.'' The Kyle-Rhonda tryst is used as a joke but, like a lot
of the action in ``Road Trip,'' it's rendered sincerely. Even
Green, whose sick humor resists cynicism and irony even at the risk
of plain stupidity, has an exterior charm that belies his
sociopathic behavior, which for my money, is a cry for help.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his coolness resides in the fact that he plays dumb so
you don't have to. Just as bracing is the movie's innocence, which
is banking on Josh and Beth's passion surviving the remaining years
of college. Try two semesters, tops.

ANOTHER DESTRUCTIVE COMPUTER VIRUS SURFACES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just weeks after the insidious ``love bug'' email virus crippled
computer systems with its evil message of love, a new variant of
the virus known to be even more destructive and less loving is
making its way around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The latest email-based virus, known to rapidly change its form
and cause more severe damage than the now-infamous love bug, was
reported at several large companies late Thursday. But it does not
appear to be spreading quite as fast as its amorous predecessor,
largely because firms have been beefing up security in recent
weeks, computer experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the trademark ``ILOVEYOU'' subject line that accompanied
the earlier virus, the new virus changes subject lines each time it
is spread, and obliterates key files on the computers it infects.
It generates a not-as-loving subject line which starts ``FW:'', and
the body of the email contains an attachment similar in name to one
recently sent from the infected computer, except that the file
extension, for example ``.doc'' or ``.exe'' is switched to
``.vbs''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any email attachments with the VBS extension should be deleted
immediately and should not be opened,'' warned Internet security
firm Computer Associates. If the attachment is opened, the virus
has the ability to randomly rename files on the computer's hard
drive, giving the computer the equivalent of a lobotomy. But before
it renders its host useless, the virus will send itself to all
other users in the victim's address book. Its ability to slither
its way into networks in that way puts it in the ``worm'' category
of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Like the love bug and last year's Melissa worms, the latest
virus is isolated to the Microsoft Outlook email system, according
to antivirus software maker Trend Micro.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say that the size of the data attachment in infected
emails is significantly larger than recent viruses, which might
actually help to prevent its spreading because heavy traffic in
large attachments often cause email systems to get clogged or
outright crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worm grows in size as it spreads and can therefore clog a
network with a large amount of email traffic and will likely bring
down mail servers,'' said Computer Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of large attachment size, plus recent efforts by many
companies to update their Internet security systems, may render the
virus less destructive than the love bug.
</P>
<P>
   The recent virus activity has heightened awareness of the
vulnerabilities of new information technology. The love bug virus
spread like wildfire earlier this month in such high-security
places as the Pentagon and at many large corporations, and damages
are estimated to be in the billions.

THE UPI ARMY _ AN ADVENTURE, NOT JUST A JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a job is just a job. Sometimes it is a calling.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calling to those who once worked _ and the few who
remain _ at United Press International.
</P>
<P>
   Once as I was considering applying for a transfer to New York,
the wire service's mecca, my wife asked about the money. It was the
same as what I was earning at the time in Dallas or Denver or
Chicago or wherever we were _ I thought about transferring to New
York a lot. It wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPI isn't a religion, and we're not missionaries,'' Harriet
said, ``We won't be storing up stars in heaven for depriving
ourselves in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right about the money, but she was wrong about the
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any former Unipresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the mystique, it's lasted for me for three decades
since I left, and that's three times as long as I spent as a
Unipresser,'' says Bob Cox, whom I served with in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   UPI was sold Monday to News World Communications Inc., which
publishes The Washington Times and was founded by the Rev. Sun
Myung Moon, leader of the Unification Church. It was the fifth sale
in two decades that also included two bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Thomas, the dean of the White House press corps, who spent
57 years at UPI, resigned the day after the announcement. Former
Unipressers questioned the value of the existing service without
her as a headliner.
</P>
<P>
   United Press was founded in 1907 by newspaper publisher E.W.
Scripps and merged with William Randolph Hearst's International
News Service in 1958 to become UPI.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its heyday,'' says The New York Times, ``UPI was the chief
rival of The Associated Press and had a stable of future industry
leaders _ including Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley _ who scored
a number of scoops.''
</P>
<P>
   But UPI fell on hard times as newspapers, driven by the bottom
line, saw no reason to support two general-interest wire services.
That business usually went to the AP since it was a member-owned
cooperative. UPI sold off the remaining radio clients to the AP
last summer, and its existing service is directed primarily at the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   UPI's recent trials would have killed many companies. But not
this one. I asked former staff members who keep in touch by e-mail
to explain what has kept UPI alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of competition with The Associated Press was
uniquely invigorating, and there was a perverse sense of bemusement
and pride in thriving in UPI's legendary cheapness _ the thrill of
using your wits to get a competitive job done in the frequent
absence of adequate resources,'' says Tom Foty, who was with the
UPI Audio Network in New York in 1977-1984.
</P>
<P>
   UPI was cheap. Old-timers tell of a period when bureau managers
had to turn in pencil stubs to get new pencils _ and would steal
pencil stubs when visiting other UPI bureaus. Maybe that's true;
maybe it's not. But it described the service well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a certain smugness about the AP, but we
Unipressers were always too tired to be smug,'' said David Kelley,
who worked at UPI in 1978-1990 in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. ``We
worked 80- to 100-hour weeks in the line bureaus because we thought
what we did mattered.''
</P>
<P>
   UPI did attract its share of characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about Helen Thomas. Few know that in its
heyday, UPI had her equivalent in some way or other in each and
every state operation ...,'' says Robert Kieckhefer, who spent 28
years in Chicago and Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddballs and nutcases one and all, but talented journalists
who got the job done with flair, affection and ability. One of us
against three from AP wasn't a fair fight _ it was no contest. We
were always having more fun, and that made it easy to do a better
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``People,'' Kieckhefer said. ``It's always about people _ not
gray, anonymous, bureaucratic organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Basken spent 14 years at UPI, including five at the White
House, and notes a common thread among those who left for more
money, a wider audience or just plain job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it seems that many if not most who did leave, even if they
found what they were looking for, soon could be heard telling those
left behind that they missed something about UPI, be it the
camaraderie, the freedom, or just the old feeling,'' Basken said.
</P>
<P>
   I know that feeling well. I spent 10 years at UPI and left in
1977 after a tour as executive editor of national broadcast in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   I miss UPI every single day.

&HT;     NOTHING CAN STOP THE DINOSAURS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resistance is futile, if you have kids: Disney's ``Dinosaur''
has stomped into town.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth stars of this animated extravaganza _ sure to be a
T-rex among early summer movies _ are computer-generated creatures
rendered with awesome detail, and they play out their story against
dazzling, shot-on-three-continents scenery. Technically, it's a
step beyond ``Jurassic Park'' and on a par with the impressive,
recent Discovery Channel series, ``Walking With Dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim is photorealism, which is largely accomplished:
``Dinosaur'' is now surely the benchmark for computer animation.
Painstaking attention was paid to such details as reptilian
musculature and lemurs' fur _ 1.1 million hairs per animal, Disney
says _ and it pays off in gee-whiz dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, the spectacle of a massive flock of
winged creatures soaring out from behind a gorgeous waterfall. Or,
in scenes reminiscent of classic old wagon-train movies, a herd of
dinosaurs of all sizes and shapes trekking across a sweeping
desert, as predators nip at their heels.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget who made this picture. While the realism is
striking, the 48 animators assigned to the project still managed to
Disney-fy the dinosaurs, giving them distinctive personalities
easily gauged by youngsters weaned on ``Aladdin'' and ``The Lion
King.''
</P>
<P>
   This hints at the film's weakness, at least for adults:
``Dinosaur'' is another refrain of the old Disney song. A young
outsider, aided by a sidekick _ often fuzzy _ overcomes odds and
turns into a hero, pairing off with a spunky love interest. Parents
will instantly recognize the pattern. But the story is one that
kids can't get enough of, with a message they can hardly miss,
since they've seen it plenty on PBS and the more well-intentioned
Saturday morning shows: that cooperation, compassion and openness
to new ideas are good, and rigid, Darwinian thinking isn't. Family
film or not, this has a slightly soppy ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney), a personable young
iguanodon _ for budding paleontologists, that's a Cretaceous
herbivore that grew to 30 feet _ who is raised by a family of
lemurs on an island where he's the sole dinosaur. The furry,
wide-eyed lemurs are bouncy and cuddly and no doubt already
available at your local toy store. The patriarch (Ossie Davis)
thinks it's crazy to adopt a dinosaur (they EAT us, he says), but
his wise and kindly wife (Alfre Woodard) prevails _ so Aladar grows
up to become the clan's friend and mascot, like a five-ton puppy.
All's well until a cataclysmic meteor storm destroys the island
(nice effects) and Aladar and his adoptive family are forced to
seek a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Hounded by vicious raptors, the refugees finally join a herd of
various herbivores (this is a stoutly pro-vegetarian picture)
headed for their nesting grounds, a paradise of water and shelter.
The leader is a Type A iguanodon named Kron (Samuel E. Wright), who
plays drill sergeant to the exhausted herd. He has no use for
weaklings _ for him, it's strictly survival of the fittest, and
stragglers will usefully distract the predators. Nice-guy Aladar
and his family disagree, and befriend a couple of aging laggards
(Joan Plowright, Della Reese). Meanwhile, Kron's haughty sister
(Julianna Margulies) catches Aladar's eye; he needs same-species
companionship.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably needless to add that they finally do reach the
promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Directors Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton deserve a medal for
their handling of logistics. They employed so many technical people
that the credits run seven minutes! The by-the-numbers script is
from John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs, who worked from an
original screenplay by Walon Green (``The Wild Bunch,'' ``The Hi-Lo
Country''), which may explain the picture's Western overtones. The
voice work is mostly outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should note the PG rating. There's little bloodshed, but
several fight scenes, lots of loud roaring and some overwhelming
special effects sequences could vex younger viewers.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has decided to drop out of the
race for U.S. Senate, and will call a news conference later Friday
to detail his decision, two aides to the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani informed his staff about the decision Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's decision to drop out of his contest with Hillary
Rodham Clinton comes after a tumultuous three week period for the
mayor. Giuliani first announced that he had been diagnosed with the
early stages of prostate cancer, and than said he was seeking a
separation of his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. At the same
time, Giuliani has increasingly been seen in public with an Upper
East Side woman he described as a ``very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement jolted a political career that began with
Giuliani's stint as a sharply aggressive and high-profile federal
prosecutor in New York in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue as mayor, while facing treatment for prostate
cancer and dealing with his separation from Hanover, his wife of 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   His current second term as mayor ends on Dec. 31, 2001, and term
limit laws prevent him from seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has often said how much he has enjoyed his job running
the city, where he has been credited with bringing a drop in crime,
cleaner streets and with other improvements in the quality of life.
And he has frequently made it clear that his major political
interest is to be executive.
</P>
<P>
   The only statewide job that would appear to be appealing to
Giuliani, who never formally announced his Senate candidacy but was
clearly the front runner, is the governorship. But that job is
currently held by George Pataki, a popular Republican whose second
term does not expire until 2002. Pataki, who has ruled out a run
for the Senate seat as a replacement to Giuliani, has told
reporters that in all likelihood he would run for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has shown his openness to an eventual gubernatorial
run, telling a radio show caller who made the suggestion, ``What
you say is certainly a reasonable, rational analysis and people
have privately offered me the same analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   He will have a ready-made war chest, $9.2 million which federal
campaign financing laws allow him to keep for a future run. But
holding on to the money could alienate donors and Republican
leaders. Federal law bars him from transferring the dollars to a
replacement candidate. But Giuliani could pass on the money to a
state or national Republican Party committee, which in turn could
spend it on behalf of another candidate. Other options are to
return the money to donors, or give it to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's departure also puts the state Republicans on the
spot. As the mayor decided on the course of his treatment, and then
whether to run, the days ticked by ahead of the state Republican
convention in Buffalo on May 30, when the party formally names its
candidate. Republican leaders fretted over who would take up the
banner. Without Pataki, who is the strongest possible candidate,
Republican leaders have given the most attention to Rep. Rick A.
Lazio of Long Island. A survey from the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute that was released May 16 had Mrs. Clinton leading Lazio
by 50 percent to 31 percent. The survey's margin of error was plus
or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible contender is Rep. Peter T. King, also of Long
Island. Pataki, as the state's leading Republican, will have the
strongest voice in making the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Both are less known than Giuliani, lack his campaign war chest
and would face in Mrs. Clinton a candidate who has been campaigning
for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Many questioned just how much Giuliani wanted the Senate job. At
times he seemed less than enthusiastic about campaigning. Some
political observers wondered how attractive he found the prospect
of being a junior member of a legislature rather than a political
leader.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The announcement came after a remarkably rapid series of events.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of two weeks, the personal life of a politician who
so often demanded his privacy was splayed open to all. First came
his disclosure at a news conference on April 27 that he had an
early, treatable form of prostate cancer. Two weeks later, after
tabloid reports and whispers about his relationship with another
women accelerated, a visibly shaken Giuliani announced _ again to
reporters _ that he was separating from Hanover. In the same news
conference, Giuliani, 55, emphasized that he would rely even more
now on his ``very good friend,'' Judith Nathan, an executive who
lives on the Upper East Side with her teenage daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The public disclosure caught Hanover by surprise. She responded
with her own public statement, a tearful one, in which she blamed
her husband's past relationship ``with one staff member'' as one of
the reasons from their marital problems. A spokeswoman for Hanover
identified that staff member as the mayor's former communications
director, Cristyne Lategano. Both Lategano, who is now married to
Nicholas Nicholas, and Giuliani denied having a romantic
relationship. The former aide later became the president of NYC &AMP;
Co., the city's visitor and convention bureau, with backing from
Giuliani.

EVEN COMIC STRIPS HAVE THEIR PITFALLS OF TASTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LANCE MURRAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last place in a newspaper that one would expect readers to
be offended would be the comics pages.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past few years, words and images have shown up in the
comic strips that have sent some readers running to their phones,
typewriters or e-mail software.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about the seven dirty words pointed out years
ago by comedian George Carlin, because those words would never show
up in daily newspaper comics. But other words that many parents
don't want their children to use have. And cartoonists have used
images that have shocked some of our readers.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to offend anyone, so I'll use descriptive phrases
instead of the words themselves. Bear with me.
</P>
<P>
   The first word, one that I've probably gotten more phone calls
about than any other, is ... well, it rhymes with ``Jabba the
Hutt'' and is something that Han Solo likes to kick. This word has
appeared several times in the past year in comic strips, and each
time readers have called to say that the word is inappropriate for
a family newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   I agree. It is unseemly, and the callers are correct: It doesn't
belong in family-oriented comics.
</P>
<P>
   Another word that appeared recently in a ``Non Sequitur'' strip
is the word used for the escape of gases from the human body. The
comic strip used the word in the context of aging men being ``old
__,'' but that doesn't lessen the objectionable nature of the word
to some readers.
</P>
<P>
   Other words that are common vulgar exclamations have appeared in
the comics pages in the past couple years. These words are often
part of a phrase, preceded by the word, ``Oh, ...'' Get the
picture?
</P>
<P>
   The complaints usually come from parents who don't want their
children exposed to objectionable material and from older readers
who are sensitive to what they perceive to be bad language.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers also called recently about a story line in
``Gasoline Alley'' that had a couple of its characters lost in the
woods with no clothes on. The readers thought that nudity, even if
it was cartoon nudity, was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   A man called several years ago to vociferously complain when
Sally Forth was shown getting dressed and her bra was visible.
</P>
<P>
   I take every complaint about taste seriously because these
readers would not contact the newspaper unless they were upset by
the comics' contents.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a couple of times when I told readers that I
thought they were being overly sensitive and to just let a joke be
a joke. But I also have agreed with other readers that some words
cross the line between acceptable language and poor taste.
</P>
<P>
   These readers have wondered why we don't edit out the words in
question or alter the comic in some way. Why didn't I draw clothes
on those characters?
</P>
<P>
   Because the comics are copyrighted works of original art, we
can't change them. I could pull that day's strip completely, and we
would do so if one of Carlin's famous seven words appeared.
</P>
<P>
   But that is an extreme measure. Some might call it censorship,
and at the least it would deny fans of that strip who might not be
offended the access to that comic. We would probably run a
substitute strip instead.
</P>
<P>
   The words we are dealing with are common in everyday
conversation these days. You hear them _ and even worse ones _ on
prime-time TV nearly every night. I've heard the word that rhymes
with ``Jabba the Hutt'' on children's cartoon shows often.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that they are in common use, though, doesn't lessen a
newspaper's obligation to use intelligent, decent language. So to
that end, when readers complain about objectionable words in
comics, I take the time to write the syndicates or talk with their
representatives in person to let them know what my readers think.
</P>
<P>
   I know some people will look at all this as silly, but I've been
a cartoonist, and I know there are plenty of ways to get a laugh
without being offensive. This is an issue of concern to many
newspaper readers.
</P>
<P>
   If it's important to them, it's important to me.

BAFFERT DOESN'T MISS THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Bob Baffert has been relaxed this week, as befits
the trainer of an 8-1 shot in Saturday's Preakness at Pimlico. All
the pressure is on Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and his
trainer, Neil Drysdale, while little is expected of Baffert's
charge, Captain Steve, who ran eighth in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help if they would load him backward,'' quipped
Baffert, when asked how Fusaichi Pegasus could be beaten. ``Maybe
we could beat him with a head start, or if he ran into the Stanford
band.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert won the Preakness with Silver Charm in 1997, and Real
Quiet in '98, after they had also won the Derby. Their Triple Crown
bids came up short in the Belmont Stakes. No longer the focus of
attention, Baffert claims to be enjoying his secondary role.
Meanwhile, Drysdale is running around trying to make sure
everything is perfect for the sometimes temperamental Fusaichi
Pegasus. The 3-5 morning-line favorite is stabled on the
backstretch, instead of in the stakes barn, and can be viewed only
with security clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil's a very private person,'' said Baffert. ``He knows other
people will be deflecting the cameras. He knows (being stabled on)
the front side is a distraction to a horse. It doesn't take much to
get his horse going. Most of the horses I have brought here are
like me, laid-back. Everybody has their own style. I like to share
my horses with everybody. But I don't blame him for keeping his
horse separate because the media hordes can really bug a horse.
Neil's got his own agenda, and I'm not going to get involved in
that deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhausting trying to win a Triple Crown. I went through
that for two years, and I came out of it exhausted. The media wants
you to give them a lot of time, and this is when you want to
promote your sport. You only get two chances _ the Triple Crown and
the Breeders' Cup. Neil said this wasn't going to change his life,
but they're already asking him for autographs. It got so bad for me
that I had to work on my handwriting so people could read it. And
it's still terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fusaichi Pegasus appears to be the headline-grabbing
superstar the sport has long hoped for, Captain Steve has a chance.
Owned by Mike Pegram, who also owned Real Quiet, Captain Steve got
blasted in the Derby just after he took over the lead turning for
home. Wheelaway, who is being held out of the Preakness for the
Belmont June 10, came over sharply under Richard Migliore and wiped
out Captain Steve and Robbie Albarado. Wheelaway finished fifth,
and the Derby only awards purse money to the top four finishers, so
there was no inquiry or foul claim at the time. The Churchill Downs
stewards subsequently gave Migliore a five-day suspension for
careless riding.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Captain Steve had been run too hard chasing a
furious Derby pace (:45 4/5, 1:09 4/5, 1:35 2/5), and would have
stopped even if he wasn't bothered. It is expected that Albarado
will take a firm hold of Captain Steve in the early-going and find
a position behind the front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie rode the horse to my instructions,'' said Baffert. ``I
wanted him to ride him early, and get the jump on them. I told him
to ride him hard from the three-eighths pole to the eighth-pole,
and maybe we could stagger in from there. But Wheelaway came over
and that was it. Even if he was clear, he wasn't going to win. He
may have been fourth, or so, but he only got to run a mile and
one-16th before that horse came over on him. Plus, he had to chase
a fast pace.''
</P>
<P>
   With Captain Steve finishing far back, Baffert, once a target,
is now just a member of the Preakness pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come here at 8-1, it's different,'' he said. ``When
you win the Derby, you come in flying high. When you get beat in
the Derby, you're just looking to get a piece of the pie. I'm
getting off at this stop. I'm going to take one more shot. I'm not
going to the Belmont. Captain Steve has run so well for us
(12-4-0-5 career record), and he's just short of being a
millionaire ($960,256 in earnings). He's worked great this week and
he really looks happy. That's all you can ask for at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm hoping to get a good
break, and we'll see what happens. Fusaichi Pegasus is a very good
horse, but it's my job to make him earn it.''

NBC NOT PLAYING GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give NBC some credit for telling viewers right up front that its
coverage of the summer Olympics _ all 437 1/2 hours _ will be via
tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   The only live telecasts outside of unforeseen breaking news will
be of studio host Bob Costas, who will tell viewers that all events
were taped but present the day-old events as if they were currently
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is hoping that viewers won't mind, but the network is
expected to face stiff competition from pro football and the
baseball playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will be airing more than three times the coverage it showed
during the Games in Atlanta, and it will be spread over NBC and its
sister cable stations, CNBC and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC itself will have a total of 164 1/2 hours of coverage, while
MSNBC will supplement 10 a.m.-5 p.m. during the week and 10 a.m.-4
p.m. on the weekend. CNBC will have Olympic programming 5-9 p.m.
during the week and 4-9 p.m. on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Using tape-delay makes sense. There is a 15-hour time difference
between Sydney and the East Coast and 18 hours from the West. The
finals of most Olympic events will occur between 4-7 a.m. EST, not
exactly the time most Americans are watching television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we paid $705 million for the rights
and it would be a good idea to broadcast the games when people are
watching,'' said NBC spokesman Kevin Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   The taped coverage is nothing new. Ninety-six percent of the
1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona was taped, and 60 percent of NBC's
coverage from Atlanta was taped.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of live and taped coverage caused some confusion among
viewers, but NBC hoped to reduce that by announcing their plans
early. ``The results are not unimportant,'' Sullivan said, noting
that instantaneous scores and results will be found on
NBCOlympics.com. ``Most people watch for the story lines, the
patriotism and human drama.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sullivan, NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol did not
ask the International Olympic Committee to change the events
schedule in Sydney to accommodate American viewers, as NBC did
before the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul.

   CBS will be airing the third and fourth rounds of the
``MasterCard Colonial'' 3-6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. CBS's Gary
McCord told reporters that the pressure is building on Davis Love
to win a tournament. ``He is in desperate need of a win to get back
in the flow,'' McCord said. ``There are some dastardly things in
the back of his mind, and one of those is Tiger Woods. Davis
acknowledged that he is trying to keep up with, and ward off,
Woods. In this game, you have to worry about yourself. It takes too
much time and energy to worry about other players.'' McCord was
equally frank about Jesper Parnevik. ``He is great for the Tour
because he brings that much needed fanatical fringe,'' said McCord.
``He's eccentric, he's different and he's good. His pink pants, his
turned up hat, eating volcanic ash _ all that is good.'' McCord
also said that Parnevik has another side to him. ``Jesper is
actually very quiet and introspective,'' he said. ``He is a
world-champion chess player, which shows you that he has some
depth.''

COLOR LINE DEFINES SOUTH AFRICAN OPINION ON MUGABE'S ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Midway through the political turmoil in Zimbabwe,
a South African paper asked two of its reporters covering the story
to debate in its pages whether the media were being fair to
President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the journalists is black, the other white.
</P>
<P>
   The black journalist, arguing that the press had diminished
Zimbabwe's independence leader by accusing Mugabe in recent weeks
of formenting violence against his own people, wrote: ``Zimbabweans
deserve acknowledgment of their history.''
</P>
<P>
   The white reporter, taking an opposing view, countered: ``A
leader should be judged and condemned or praised on the present.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Zimbabwe, where more than 20 people have been
killed in a violent campaign season ahead of what is widely
regarded as the country's most important elections in two decades,
has sparked a vigorous and emotional debate in newsrooms across
South Africa. Black and white journalists, viewing Zimbabwe's
crisis from divergent historical perspectives, tend to agree that
after 20 years in power, Mugabe should go.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't agree why.
</P>
<P>
   ``You carry your baggage about Africa, that it is all wars and
famines and dictators,'' said Abbey Makoe, a reporter and columnist
for the Sunday Independent. ``I cannot ignore the contribution
Mugabe made. When I say he should go, it is not because he is
barbaric, but because he should go into history with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Already facing its worst economic slump in at least a decade,
Zimbabwe has become increasingly violent since late February, when
government supporters began seizing white-owned commercial farms.
The invaders, orchestrated by veterans of the 1970s war for
liberation, claim they are only taking back land stolen from their
ancestors by colonial settlers. While most rural blacks eke out
meager lives on modest communal plots, 4,500 whites own more than
30 million acres of prime farmland. Blacks fought for independence
to correct that imbalance, but it endures 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Politics precipitated the land grab. In February, voters
rejected a new constitution sponsored by Mugabe, handing the ruling
party its first defeat in two decades and giving momentum to
growing opposition movement ahead of parliamentary elections,
scheduled for June 24-25. The draft would have allowed the
government to seize land without compensation. When it failed,
Mugabe encouraged the war veterans to invade white farms.
</P>
<P>
   While the farms have been the primary targets, violence has
spread. Farm workers and businessmen thought to support the
opposition, as well as opposition candidates themselves, have come
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the crisis in Zimbabwe is fundamentally about land or
politics, race fundamentally shapes the way people respond to it.
Black journalists in South Africa complain that their white
counterparts have focused too much on violence against whites.
</P>
<P>
   When the first white farmer was killed, for example, the media
gave the man's name, age, background, interviewed his widow, told
how many children he left behind, and covered his funeral. They
gave mere mention of a black policeman killed the same night in a
similar attack. It wasn't until late April before the mainstream
South African press noticed that black farmworkers bore the brunt
of most of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``British papers and the BBC have covered Zimbabwe as if whites
were all that mattered,'' said John Battersby, editor of the Sunday
Independent. ``But the story is about a black opposition movement
being crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Many white reporters now see Mugabe fomenting violence to save
his political career. For them, the issue seems clear cut. The
president has presided over a corrupt government, ruined the
economy, and terrorized his people. For many black journalists,
Zimbabwe has many shades of gray. Even if Mugabe has mishandled
land reform, the issue needs to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mugabe was a great hero in 1980, but people see through him
now,'' said Xolela Mangcu, a newspaper columnist. ``But because
whites are against Mugabe, blacks take the other side. That's
ironic. Even now, we continue to base our reactions on the actions
of whites. That makes us perpetual victims of whites _ prisoners of
our own history.''

<P>
   When Robert L. Johnson, president and founder of Vermont-based
Omega Optical Inc., asked his hourly employees to sign
noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements nine years ago, few
firms were requesting lower-level employees to sign such covenants.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, most companies reserved those contracts for top
executives who were privy to the kind of confidential or
proprietary information that, if revealed, could cost a firm its
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   But as intellectual property has developed into a primary
economic engine, US employers are no longer restricting these
agreements to the top tier of the corporate hierarchy. In some
cases, technicians, analysts, programmers _ even clerks _ are being
asked to sign on the dotted line.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, companies are seeking to protect more material than
ever before. Business plans, customer lists, pricing data,
investors' names, marketing and sales strategies, and just about
anything deemed valuable but not necessarily covered under standard
copyright or patent laws may be considered proprietary or a trade
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Old notions of corporate loyalty and retention have given way to
a job-hopping frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   That Rolodex on your desk, those policy guides and address
books, the contact list you keep in your computer file at work,
even the creative ideas you come up with in the middle of the night
_ they're all fair game in the war against the misappropriation of
trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is a great deal of tension over what an
employee can take when he or she leaves,'' especially at high-tech
firms where talent is hard to keep, said Ariel D. Cudkowicz,
general counsel at Seyfarth Shaw in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information in your head is information you may have
gathered over the years and it may appear to be yours,'' he added,
``but the courts could ask whether you had the information when you
started or if you acquired it because the company invested in you,
trained you, and showed you how to build up a customer base. As
long as companies take action to protect it, employees cannot walk
away with that kind of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: Do rank-and-file employees really
know that much about their bosses' strategic plans? Legal experts
say the answer depends on the worker and the case.
</P>
<P>
   Take Adrian Lofton, 28, of Baltimore. He was a laser eye
technician at TLC Laser Eye Center when he was fired last February.
Lofton found new work at another firm, but his lawyer maintains
that the company shied away from hiring him after TLC told the
prospective employer about the noncompete agreement Lofton had
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, Adrian received another offer from a company TLC
considers a competitor and TLC threatened my client and the
competing firm in a letter stating that the noncompete agreement is
legally binding,'' said Lofton's attorney, John Vecchione of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the agreement bars Lofton from working at any other
laser center within 60 miles of TLC's numerous regional offices.
Vecchione declined to reveal the length of the restriction. In a
related case, however, a former TLC technician signed an agreement
that bars her from working for any TLC rivals for one year. A TLC
spokesperson said the company could not comment on pending
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian Lofton did not solicit clients and he was not privy to
any trade secrets,'' said Vecchione. ``In fact, I don't really
think there is anything about this business that would be
considered a trade secret. Usually, these agreements are for people
with specialized knowledge about the way a corporation works.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on who owns certain information are not limited to
workplace agreements. In a recent decision, the Second District
Court of Appeals in Los Angeles adopted a legal premise widely
known as the inevitable disclosure doctrine. It assumes that
employees who leave one job for the same position at a competing
firm are likely to divulge business strategies or certain trade
secrets simply because the new job is so much like the old one.
Under such circumstances, said the court, giving away trade secrets
may be unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine is being invoked on a case-by-case basis by
management-side lawyers who say it is a valuable weapon in the
pursuit of court injunctions to prevent former employees from
sharing trade secrets with rival firms.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' lawyers argue that restrictive covenants and temporary
injunctions are actually being used by employers seeking to stymie
competition by preventing ex-workers from joining a competitor's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management lawyers will say these kind of agreements protect
trade secrets,'' said San Francisco attorney Cliff Palefsky. ``What
they really do is prevent other employers from stealing their
rivals' employees, and they prevent employees from going to
competing firms. They can also have a chilling affect on start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the employees' standpoint,'' he added, ``these agreements
are terrible. Why? Because there really isn't any job security in
this economy. So, you really need to have a skill that you can take
from place to place. The idea that someone who is no longer paying
you, and might have even laid you off, can now turn around and
prevent you from working somewhere else is harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Omega founder Robert L. Johnson doesn't see it quite that way.
He maintains that in 1991, when he asked his hourly workers to sign
noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements, he was simply trying
to protect trade secrets. The company is among a handful in the
country that manufacture optical interference filters, the glass
filters that help certain microscopes and telescopes filter light,
and provided filters for the Hubble space telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the noncompetition agreements raised a ruckus among some
of Omega's employees. Lee Madden, then an $11-an-hour accounts
receivable and data-entry clerk, refused to sign the agreement and
was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the noncompetition part was out of line,'' said Madden,
47. ``I did not take the job with that provision. Plus, I was not a
scientist, so to restrict my employment after I left made no
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   When Madden left Omega, he joined nine other ex-Omega workers
who had either been fired or had quit. They launched an
employee-owned company called Chroma Technology Corp., now one of
the fastest-growing high-tech firms in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, five years later, Johnson sued the start-up and its
founders, alleging unfair competition and breach of the duty of
loyalty. The suit, which sought an estimated $15 million in
damages, argued trade secrets were used to launch the rival firm.
</P>
<P>
   Filed in Windham County Superior Court, the suit goes to the
heart of the current debate revolving around information and what
is secret, says Vermont lawyer Bernie Lambek, who represents
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, you cannot take trade secrets acquired in the
course of employment and use them if they do not belong to you,''
he said. ``The knowledge those employees had wasn't general
knowledge. It involved the creation of extremely specialized
filters, the really high-tech end of the optical interference
filter industry. Nobody else could replicate what Omega was doing.
These were key research and engineering design people who left to
start Chroma. These weren't auto mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The company environment was intentionally located in
Brattleboro because openness has never been an issue here,'' said
Johnson, a 52-year-old physicist. ``Unlike Boston or Silicon
Valley, where people can easily walk across the street and get a
job at a competitor, the people who work for me have always been
local. They aren't bringing information when they come. They learn
it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Kabbel, 52, a plant manager and co-owner of Chroma, said
the information he gleaned while working for Omega was public
knowledge. Kabbel was a $12-an-hour technician who operated and
repaired machinery. He said most of what he learned was available
in scientific journals and was routinely taught at a
company-sponsored apprenticeship program. And, he says, Chroma's
current manufacturing technology and processes, which rely on
robotics and other high-tech methods, are now dramatically
different from Omega's.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Judge Robert Grussing III ruled in favor of Chroma.
The judge also found that ``the defendants did not start the new
company by taking equipment or documents from Omega.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has appealed. ``Just before the workers left Omega, the
company was drawing up noncompete and confidentiality agreements,''
said Lambek, his lawyer. ``So when they left, they knew the
information they took was considered confidential and proprietary.
That should be enough.''

US ACQUISITION SCENE TAKES ON A FOREIGN FLAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !Bienvenidos a los Estados Unidos! Did you bring cash?
</P>
<P>
   The language keeps changing, but the story is being repeated
with striking frequency. Foreign acquirers are buying American
companies and, more often than not, paying big premiums to make the
deals work.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about an American company selling to a
foreign corporation. New England's supermakets are already owned by
British, Dutch, and Belgian giants. But it's time to get a
multilingual scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   This has already been a busy week: first, Pioneer Group of
Boston struck a $1.2 billion deal to sell to Italy's third largest
bank, Unicredito Italiano SpA, only to be eclipsed the next day by
the $12.5 billion sale of Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass. to Terra
Networks SA of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the prices were eyepopping even though the
sellers faced problems. Lycos was struggling to break out of its
second-tier Internet status and Pioneer was faring much worse,
reeling from serious business setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It's been so busy barely anyone recalled that Primark Corp. sold
Boston's Yankee Group to British financial media giant Reuters
Group PLC for $72.5 million in cash just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, 558 American companies have announced plans
to sell to foreign buyers through the first four months of this
year, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. That's up
more than 35 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of reasons that foreigners, principally
European companies, are aggressivley buying American businesses.
Most important: mergers and acquisition activity within Europe has
grown dramatically and America's investment bankers have set up
shop overseas to scour the globe for sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how many billions of dollars are available in the
foreign marketplace, I think investment bankers are quick to
realize there is a market ready, willing and able to acquire
companies around the world, including in the United States,'' said
Allen Michel, a Boston University professor who specializes in
mergers and acquisition research.
</P>
<P>
   Some industries in particular are lending themselves to foreign
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service deals become more attractive as America
relaxes regulations, and Europeans are paying huge premiums for
typically second-tier targets.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, especially British companies, have moved in on
American utilities, in part because they have already gone though
the complex deregulation now taking place here, according to Linda
Varoli, a senior analyst at Merger Insight.
</P>
<P>
   National Grid Group PLC's $3.2 billion agreement to purchase New
England Electric System last year was only one deal among many.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stickiest issues in the foreign purchase of an
American company: how to pay. Cash deals create instant tax bills
for sellers, but stock swaps are not particularly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very true US investors prefer cash over foreign
equities,'' said Boston money manager Bernie Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the two deals announced this week. Pioneer's rich
cash agreement has even silenced the company's griping dissident
shareholders. Lycos, though it commanded a high price on paper, has
watched the value of the Terra Networks shares to be used in the
stock swap sink 21 percent since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock swap problem: poor liquidity. Like many foreign
stocks, their American Depositary Receipts traded in the United
States are thin in numbers (ADRs are traded securities representing
actual foreign shares that have been deposited with a trustee).
</P>
<P>
   Terra's problem was especially acute because its parent company
owns 67 percent of all the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson took cash the first time his Yankee Group was
sold, to Waltham-based Primark, and didn't have to consider the
option of getting paid in foreign stock. We think we know what he
would have decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Depositary Receipts sound pretty good to us if it's
Sony, but if it's some company that's thinly traded, there's
questions of liquidity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's not always the case, said Varoli at Merger
Insight. A handful of stock-swaps have involved foreign buyers that
did not even have US-traded securities at the time of the
agreement, like the pending acquisition of Snyder Communicatins
Inc., a Maryland advertising company, by Havas Advertising of
France. Buyers simply agree to create depositary receipts before
the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies are starting to realize they're going
to have a (US stock market) listing here to be more competitive
bidders,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   You can count on it. Ciao.

STEPPING IN FOR EVERETT, LEWIS FUELS SOX' SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Red Sox made their move to first place, he was
everything you could ask for in a center fielder. He caught every
ball hit his way. He hit for average, he hit with power, he stole
bases, he scored runs and drove in others. And by the end of the
day, his uniform usually required a second washing.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett?
</P>
<P>
   No, although Everett almost certainly will be back in the Sox
outfield during the three-game weekend series against the Detroit
Tigers, with the Toronto Blue Jays arriving Tuesday for another
three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   But until Wednesday, when he returned from a sore right
quadriceps injury with three hits as the Sox DH, Everett was on the
bench while the Sox won six of seven in Baltimore and Toronto. He
was a spectator while the Sox engineered a 4 1/2-game swing in the
standings _ from second place, 3 1/2 games behind the Yankees _ to
first place and a one-game edge entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the center of the diamond was Darren Lewis, the same
man who was supposed to be relegated to the shadows when the Sox
acquired Everett from Houston last December, then signed him to a
four-year, $30 million deal a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lewis, the Sox' center fielder on each of the last two
wild-card winning teams, stepped in for Everett and responded with
the greatest offensive splurge of a big-league career that began in
Oakland in 1990, when he was summoned from the minors when Hendu,
Dave Henderson, went down with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who was batting .167 when the trip began last Thursday in
Baltimore, singled in the ninth inning of that first game, when
Everett first pulled up lame. He then reeled off four three-hit
games over the next five games, and singled in his last at-bat
Wednesday before feeling a tug in his left hamstring, which caused
him to leave in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who hit only .160 last September and just .215 after the
All-Star break _ in part because of the jammed wrist he suffered on
a headfirst slide into second base in Toronto last June _ hit .583
on the trip, going 14 for 24. The four three-hit games eclipsed
anything he has done before in a five-game span. He scored eight
runs, drove in four, and stole four bases. He beat out a push bunt
for a hit Friday night in Baltimore, then two days later took
Orioles ace Mike Mussina deep for a home run, his first in 315
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis takes a .352 average into the weekend. More important, the
32-year-old Lewis created a renewed awareness of his value to a
winning ballclub, even if he is now serving in a secondary role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect timing,'' said Jeff Frye, another forgotten veteran
who was part of a group effort by the Sox reserves that enabled the
Sox to thrive despite the absence of the sore-legged Everett, the
disabled Nomar Garciaparra, and the ailing Jason Varitek
(bronchitis).
</P>
<P>
   ``But even though he's had success in the role,'' Frye said,
``that still doesn't mean it's easy. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rice, the Sox hitting coach, said he doesn't really know
what it's like to come off the bench cold and play infrequently,
because he was never in that role. ``But when you're not playing
every day and you get the chance, you've got to turn it up a
notch,'' Rice said. ``And you've got to be ready. You've got to do
a little extra to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis needs no prompting to do the extra labor required.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works hard,'' first base coach Tommy Harper said. ``Darren
Lewis is a professional. You never have to worry about him. He's
ready to play center field, right field, pinch run, pinch hit. He
stays ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got some hits, but he deserved them. He worked his butt off
to get those hits. The guy practices everything. He practices like
he's going to play. He takes extra hitting, he practices getting
good jumps, he practices base stealing. In spring training, he
asked me a million questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis came to spring training knowing he would have a reduced
role. During the spring, he said that the time might come where he
would think about asking for a trade, if he felt he couldn't
tolerate the lack of playing time. But that time hasn't come. If
anything, Lewis now takes exception to any suggestion he'd rather
be elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be here,'' he said recently. ``I want to win. I want
that ring. I'm a part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always the potential for trouble, Harper said, when a
starter loses his job. ``But he doesn't complain,'' Harper said.
``He just goes to work. Sure, it could have been a disruption to
the team, but that's not him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quiet, but he's a very intense guy, Darren Lewis. You
have to know him. Darren Lewis is Darren Lewis. Once he starts
doing something, as a coach you have to back off and let him do his
thing. He'll discuss any subject on the field, and he'll listen,
but once he starts putting it into practice, he goes full-bore. He
doesn't like anything to disrupt him.''
</P>
<P>
   You look at Darren Lewis before a game, headphones on, listening
to his favorite rap music, and you could mistake him for just
another player killing time until the action starts. Some guys play
cards, or do crosswords, or watch videos.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis? Look at the eyes. He's already in full battle
mode. He carries a chip on his shoulder the size of Wendell Kim.
``It's nothing personal,'' Harper said. ``It's just Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he gives to you, you can't put in the paper. It just
shows up in wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Lewis gave himself up with a daring headfirst
slide into home to break a tie score. ``You know I'm going to do
that,'' he said. ``I'm a ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``Old school,'' he said.

BRUSH THE SEALER OR STAIN ON DECK

<P>
   Q. If I do my own deck, cleaning it and applying sealer or
stain, what is the best way to apply the sealer or stain? Roller or
brush?
</P>
<P>
   RICH HADJIAN, North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Brushing is best because brushing will get the sealer or
stain deeper into the wood, providing better adhesion. Some pros
first roll it on, then brush it in. To me that is double work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My seasonal cottage is open only in summer. This year when I
opened it for the summer, it was terrible, with mold growing on the
walls. How can I remove the mold, and keep it from coming back next
year when I close the cottage up again?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE DERBOGHOSIAN, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The secret is not to close the cottage. That is, when you are
ready to close it for the winter next fall, keep the windows open
by an inch or so, making sure they are secure. You may have to
invest in burglar bars if you are to keep the windows open. Oh, you
have casement windows, that open like doors. Then leaving them open
is not practical. In that case, cut some vents in the walls, high
up near the ceiling. They can be any size, and being high up will
allow air to circulate well, releasing excess water vapor or
keeping it from building up in the first place, which was the cause
of the mold.
</P>
<P>
   For the mold there now, apply a mix of one part bleach and three
to five parts water. Paint it on and let it dry. Wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The tank in one of my toilets is dripping water; it is very
rusty, and is staining the floor. The water in the tank is clear,
so the water must be picking up rust from some other source. How
can I prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   S. S., Westborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. One of two things is happening.
</P>
<P>
   1. The tank drain (the opening where the water goes into the
bowl when the toilet is flushed) is leaking a bit, and the clear
water in the tank is running past rusting metal, picking it up as
it drips. The solution there is to tighten that drain connection;
there is a bolt on the bottom of the tank that you can turn.
</P>
<P>
   2. Water vapor is condensing on the cold tank and turning into
water; it gathers on the bottom of the tank and may be running into
a rusy bolt or other metal before it drips. The trick here is to
stop the condensation. You can have the tank lined with 1/4-inch
Styrofoam insulation. Or, wrap the tank with a terry cloth cover.
Some people have had good luck installing a mixing valve to bring a
bit of hot water into the tank. Ventilate the bathroom, using the
exhaust fan more often if you have one, or keeping a window and
door open, releasing a lot of water vapor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your recipe of hydrogen peroxide and cream of tartar on the
stained bathtub worked beautifully. The bottom of the tub is
pristine again. But only the bottom. Your recipe required
sprinkling cream of tartar on the surface wetted with hydrogen
peroxide, but it does not stick to the sides and other vertical
surfaces. How can I treat them?
</P>
<P>
   PAT McNAMARA, Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Vertical surfaces usually don't need treatment because they
are not dirty. But if yours does, make a paste of the hydrogen
peroxide and cream of tartar and smear this on the surface, leave
for an hour, scrub and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Or smear on Ivory Shampoo, or Soft Scrub, let stand for an hour,
scrub and rinse. Someone called to tell us that Ivory Shampoo is
nowhere to be found. So, use any kind of shampoo. When you see what
it does to a stained bathtub, it boggles one's mind to consider
what it does to our hair and our scalps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My cedar deck is several years old and sound, but with a
rather bad finish on the floorboards. I had it sanded and it has
weathered a bit. A Sherwin-Williams representative told me to put a
sealer on it immediately. Is this necessary, now or ever?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT PHELPS, Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really. Cedar naturally resists decay, so there is no
need to preserve it. A sealer will make it more water resistant,
but if it is beginning to weather, it may turn the deck even
darker. Besides, a sealer is required every year, adding to the
chores you have to do for a so-called maintenance-free structure.
Weathering is what cedar does best, so why not let it? If you don't
think much of the sealer, or of weathering, apply one coat of a
semitransparent stain. You have a choice of earth colors, and in
three to five years you can do it again, with one coat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a seasonal house. The dryer in that house vented
into the vertical plumbing stack. Can I do that with the dryer?
</P>
<P>
   CURIOUS
</P>
<P>
   A. No, no, a thousand times no. A dryer should be vented to the
outdoors. A gas dryer must be vented to the outdoors. Venting
anything other than the sewer system into a stack like that will
probably not hurt anything, but it is illegal to do so.
</P>

ATLANTIC PIECE TAKES A SWIPE AT HARVARD PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the current issue of The Atlantic Monthly, Christina Hoff
Sommers levels a withering accusation at Harvard professor Carol
Gilligan: Sommers says she tried four times to access the research
materials Gilligan used for her best-selling 1982 book, ``In a
Different Voice,'' and was rebuffed. The research that launched
Gilligan's career and won her tenure at Harvard, Sommers suggests,
is either too flawed to be shared with scholars, or does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishing, if true. But more astonishing is the fact that
neither Sommers nor the Atlantic ever contacted Gilligan to verify
their claim. A claim that proved to be, as we say in journalism,
too good to check. ``I was amazed they didn't call me,'' says
Gilligan. ``The research is all there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommers and Gilligan occupy the antipodes of the proto-academic
discipline known as gender studies. Gilligan's ``Voice,'' which
advances the unremarkable premise that women and men have different
moral sensibilities, has sold 600,000 copies and won her a $250,000
Heinz award for ``transform(ing) the paradigm for what it means to
be human.'' In 1994, Sommers, then at Clark University, set herself
up as the anti-Gilligan, with her own bestseller, ``Who Stole
Feminism?'' Sommers argued, convincingly, that the liberal
intelligentsia had hijacked gender studies, and she won a large
following among conservative women.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her Atlantic article on the status of boy vs.
girl achievement studies, Sommers interrupts the narrative for an
attempted drive-by character assassination of Gilligan. She calls
Gilligan's research data ``tantalizingly inaccessible,'' and offers
two examples of her assistants asking Gilligan's own assistant for
the data. ``I made four attempts to reach Gilligan,'' Sommers told
me. But in fact she made none. All of the attempts were made by
factota who didn't reveal they were working on a book for Sommers.
The one example Sommers gave me is simply duplicitous: ``Dear
Professor Gilligan, I am a student at Harvard College and I'm doing
research involving your book . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly surprising, Gilligan says, that her assistant didn't
offer up her research transcripts to a purportedly interested
undergraduate. ``We signed confidentiality agreements with the
subjects of these interviews,'' Gilligan says. ``I'm not running a
secret operation, but we're not going to hand out raw data just
because some student calls up and asks for it.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of defending herself, Sommers says other scholars have
questioned Gilligan's research. (So what?) Her assistants would
have identified themselves, if asked, she says. But she fears that
the mere mention of her name would have tipped off Gilligan to
Sommers's intentions. (So what?) ``Did Woodward and Bernstein tell
Nixon what stories they were working on?'' Sommers asks. She seemed
startled to learn that yes, Woodward and Bernstein often checked in
with Nixon's press spokesman Ronald Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't the Atlantic find it strange that Gilligan isn't quoted
defending herself against Sommers's dramatic accusation? ``Sommers
said to me that she tried unsuccessfully to reach Gilligan,''
reports story editor Michael Curtis. He says Sommers's article
wasn't subjected to the usual fact-checking scrutiny because it was
a book excerpt, not an assigned article. Gilligan will have to
defend herself in a letter to the editor, which won't attract quite
as much attention as Sommers's cover story.

<P>
   Life is much too short for me to read my friend Bob Cullen's new
book, ``Why Golf? The Mystery of the Game Revisited.'' Why golf?
Who cares? In his book, Bob purports to examine the intellectual
underpinnings of the sport, which are about as solid as the
intellectual underpinnings of gender studies, if you gather my
drift. Inevitably, a book like this will end up quoting John Updike
a lot, as he's one of the few bogeymen, other than Cullen himself,
who can string two coherent sentences together.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen also quotes liberally from Arnold Haultain's 1908 classic
``The Mystery of Golf,'' which has just been republished by
Houghton Mifflin. ``Mystery'' is a lovely book, written in a clear,
simple prose that any writer would envy. The inevitable afterword
by the aforementioned Updike shows how the language has suffered in
the past century. When the Bard of Beverly extols ``the fluid,
multiform, neo-Platonic complexity of golf,'' I think we can all
agree it's time to head for the clubhouse.

WITH SMALL STEPS, GORE MAY MISS A FOOTHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ This was Vice President Al Gore's crowd.
Thousands of senior citizens, a group that most strongly supports
Gore, cheered loudly as he dished out the usual pledges made by
presidential candidates in Florida: protect Social Security, beef
up Medicare, provide prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But among the crowd at the AARP convention this week were people
such as Janet Mayhew, 69, who seemed to crystallize a concern
enveloping the Gore campaign. ``To me, Gore hasn't got a platform.
He has not said what he would do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such reaction chills the Gore campaign, which has spent more
than a year distributing position papers on nearly every imaginable
topic but now finds itself trailing Republican George W. Bush in
national polls. Clearly, Gore does have a platform, but it is
perceived by many voters as a status-quo, preserve-the-prosperity
campaign _ and the vice president is finding that may not be enough
to win.
</P>
<P>
   After running in 1992 with Bill Clinton on the theme of ``It's
the economy, stupid,'' Gore can fairly claim to have been part of
the administration that helped right the economy. But, to rephrase
a 1992 campaign theme song, he can hardly hope to win by telling
voters, ``Don't stop thinking about Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gore, who lived through, with Clinton, the searing setbacks
to some big policy dreams _ including universal health care and key
environmental proposals _ is running a campaign based much more on
incremental notions. Gore wants to preserve Social Security instead
of radically changing it as Bush proposes; he wants better health
care for children before considering how to enact universal
coverage; and he has abandoned a proposal he once backed to
increase the gas tax 50 cents a gallon as a way of cutting
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The making of Gore's campaign strategy became evident 18 months
ago, when the vice president first suggested his slogan would be
``practical idealism.'' Since then, Gore has put forward what he
believes is a realistic, if less audacious, agenda, while vowing
not to take ``risky'' steps that could upset the prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects, it may not be a time for big, bold
deviations because you can't argue with success,'' said Roy Neel,
the vice president's former chief of staff and now an informal
adviser. ``It is up to Bush to sell big, bold programs. He is the
challenger; he is the one who wants to change horses. The
attraction of the vice president's positions is that they are
solid, level-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, when asked why the vice president
has not put out a more expansive series of proposals, responded
with a single word: ``Experience.'' Lehane said Gore would unveil
plenty of new and innovative proposals, but there is no plan for a
dramatic strategic shift. Instead, he said, the campaign is
confident that the election can be won with a ``responsible vs.
irresponsible'' strategy, with Bush cast as the irresponsible
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But some wonder whether such a strategy is playing into Bush's
hand. Yes, Bush's plans to partially privatize Social Security and
to enact big tax cuts are controversial, but they have also become
the major focus of the campaign. Instead of being a debate about
maintaining prosperity, as some within the Gore campaign had hoped,
the presidential election is being waged to a significant degree on
Bush's issues.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said Gore's problem is that
the public has a solidly established and somewhat negative
perception of the vice president. It may be too late to change that
perception, so Gore may believe his best hope of winning is to
attack Bush as unworthy of the presidency. After all, that is
similar to the strategy Bush's father used against Michael Dukakis
to win the 1988 election. At this point 12 years ago, the elder
Bush was 17 points behind in the polls, but he beat Dukakis by
raising doubts about him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rothenberg said, such a strategy could backfire on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore is in trouble,'' Rothenberg said. ``The public
sees Gore as a politician rather than a vehicle for change. So he
has to make Bush the issue. He does need to rough Bush up, but the
longer he stays negative, the more the public will discount future
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore strategy was on vivid display Wednesday at the national
convention of the AARP, the nation's best-known senior citizens
lobby. Gore spent much of his speech attacking Bush's plan to allow
younger workers to put an unspecified portion of their Social
Security taxes into private investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could say that's the end of Social Security as we know
it,'' Gore said, warning that Bush wanted to ``take the security
out of Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Many AARP members shared Gore's doubts, but there was also some
friendly advice for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a good salesman, you sell your product, you don't
just knock the other guy's product,'' said Lois Tupa of
Jacksonville, Fla., who attended the AARP speech and who expects to
support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he is wary of making grand promises that have
little or no chance of congressional approval. While that may come
across as less-than-visionary to some voters, Gore thinks his
approach will be more credible in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made tremendous progress, but the progress should be
seen not as goals achieved but progress made,'' Gore said in an
interview aboard Air Force Two late last year. ``Not as work
completed, but a foundation laid for further progress.''
</P>
<P>
   During the primaries, Gore's cautious approach initially drew
some criticism within the Democratic Party, especially when
compared to the way former senator Bill Bradley was drawing support
for his bold proposal for universal health care. But Gore won the
primaries by tearing apart the Bradley plan as too risky, and the
vice president is repeating that strategy as he warns voters about
Bush's tax cut and Social Security plans.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Gore aides insist that all is well. But privately,
some said the campaign has made serious mistakes since wrapping up
the nomination. They noted that Gore for weeks did not have a news
conference, souring his relationship with the news media, and that
he has spent too much time attacking Bush instead of promoting his
agenda. The aides also said Gore was hurt by the perception that he
was pandering to Cuban-Americans on the Elian Gonzalez case by
saying it should be resolved in family court.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of these and other problems, the campaign on June
1 will have a new deputy campaign manager for communications, Mark
Fabiani, a former special counsel to Clinton. Fabiani, who earned
plaudits for his defense of Clinton during the Whitewater and
campaign finance investigations, is being touted as the message
maven, with responsibility for overseeing all press relations and
public statements. He declined to speak on the record until he
assumes his position.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Democratic official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, acknowledged that there is ``a lot of hand-wringing
within the party about Gore's approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Gore is that he seems energetic and packed
with ideas, but those are mostly modest and uncontroversial policy
initiatives,'' the official said. ``I couldn't tell you what his
pivotal issue is. So the whole task in front of him is to figure
out how to get credit for the very popular presidency of Bill
Clinton. That is difficult, so he has to cast doubts on Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that strategy should have been most effective at the
AARP meeting. But the real message from the event may have come
just after Gore left the podium. The convention hall remained
packed with several thousand people awaiting the next speaker,
Louis Rukeyser, the host of PBS-TV's ``Wall Street Week.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Rukeyser told a series of Clinton jokes and went on to
suggest that the Gore-Bush campaign will be a bore. But the crowd,
supposedly dominated by Democratic loyalists, hardly seemed
offended. After all, not withstanding Gore's dire warnings about
the dangers of investing, they wanted to hear Rukeyser's advice for
getting rich in the stock market.

 CHRYSLER HAS A HIT WITH A CRUISE BACK IN TIME  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They seem to appear by the decade: cars that capture American
drivers and their current lifestyles. The Ford Mustang, the
Volkswagen Beetle, the Chrysler minivan, the Mazda Miata, and as
the millennium ended, Volkswagen's New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive cults spring up around them. We wait in line to buy
them, often paying more to dealers than the manufacturers
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Chrysler PT Cruiser, part truck, part minivan,
part Beetle. Today's hot car looking like the car that yesterday
might have sat idling outside a bank job.
</P>
<P>
   Drive the PT Cruiser in creeping morning traffic along the
avenue and a remarkable thing happens: other drivers motion for you
to lower your window because they want to talk about your car, even
as you roll along.
</P>
<P>
   Park it on a city street and a crowd gathers, extolling its look
with words they might use to describe the aura of that street
itself: hip and hot, sassy and sharp, funky and fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their idea was to get attention, they got attention,''
Kevin Kelly, a retail design and marketing man, says as he checks
out the Cruiser on Newbury Street in Boston this week. ``Look at
the cars along the street here. This one stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does, as people stop to run their hands along its
lines, pop the hood, open the trunk, sit inside and grab the wheel.
Nearby Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and BMW autos go unnoticed, as does a
glistening Norton motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a truck and a minivan,'' says Carolyn
Talley, a building supply store manager. ``I love this car.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler had hoped to sell 50,000 PT Cruisers annually. They
sold more than 8,000 last month, the first sales period, and
already there are six month-waiting lists to buy more. The company
is ramping up for annual sales that could reach 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   All this in the age of the thundering SUV, for a car that has a
modest four-cylinder engine, is not very big (though surprisingly
roomy), and has dealers adding $2,000 and more to the
manufacturer's suggested retail price, which ranges from $16,000 to
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the low price surprised most people who stopped by in
Boston, where the Cruiser was parked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what, $30,000, $35,000?'' Talley asks when challenged to
guess the price for a Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Many were surprised by the size _ about that of a Beetle, though
with a higher, longer roofline. They had seen pictures of the
Cruiser in magazines, looking like a big four-door sedan out of the
1940s, and assumed it would be as big as those old cars _ or
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be the size of one of those monstrous SUVs,
which I hate,'' says Alan Fincke, a realty agent. ``It's compact.
It's really a sharp car.''
</P>
<P>
   What the PT Cruiser is, in fact, is a front-wheel drive vehicle
with moderate power and distinct styling, from its retro outer
shell down to its black on white gauges and Art Deco interior door
handles.
</P>
<P>
   It seats five adults _ four comfortably _ and its back seat
folds down, leaving van-like cargo space all the way into the
trunk. Its appeal crosses generations and demographics, from
students looking to hop into something hip to older couples looking
to recapture some essence of their automotive past.
</P>
<P>
   It is function in a form that seems to dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got that retro look,'' says Tom Zbruz, a graphic design
student. ``That's what got me.''
</P>
<P>
   His pal and fellow student, Luis Taforo, adds, ``It's hot. It's
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back in time in this thing,'' says Nick Raportoru, a
heating and air conditioning technician.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a PT Cruiser Web site _ ptcruiserclub.org _ has been
launched. Cruiser paraphernalia _ models, accessories, key chains _
abounds. On the Web site, owners and aficionados chat about the
car, swap customizing tips, information about Cruiser-related
events, and share pictures of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   All this over a car which is only now hitting the streets, a
modern phenomenon that Diane Peterson, a district manager for the
Pottery Barn, says, ``Looks most like a '40s gangster car.''
</P>
<P>
   Retro or modernist; minivan, truck or car; gangster wagon or
London taxi clone, the PT Cruiser has captured America's motoring
fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Luis Taforo as he runs his hands along a front fender in
tactile assessment of the styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta catch me one of these,'' he says.

`CROOKS' A FUN TRIP BACK TO ALLEN'S EARLY DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SMALL TIME CROOKS 
Written and directed by: Woody Allen 
Starring: Allen, Tracey Ullman, Elaine May, Hugh Grant, Jon Lovitz,
Michael Rappaport, Tony Darrow, George Grizzard, Elaine Stritch 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: PG (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' finds Woody Allen back in a comfortable
comic groove. It's probably the kind of movie people have in mind
when they wish he'd make movies like the ones he used to make.
Allen swears that ``Small Time Crooks'' is a very different
proposition than ``Take the Money and Run,'' that his new comedy
about criminal dimwits trying to engineer a bank job is
character-driven while the earlier one was gag-driven. True, you
don't expect Allen's nebbishy ex-con dishwasher named Ray to hand a
note to a bank teller, only to have the latter respond,
incredulously, ``This is a gub?'' Still, Ray isn't exactly light
years away from the earlier schlep, and neither is ``Small Time
Crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that makes it a lot funnier are the bookending
presences of Tracey Ullman as Ray's wife, Frenchy, an ex-stripper
turned manicurist, and Elaine May as her dim-bulb cousin, May.
Allen says he was worried about holding his own between these two
comic artists. It's not false modesty. May doesn't need gags. She's
hilarious just being a beat or two behind the rest of the world.
It's as if she hung an Out to Lunch sign around her neck years ago
and has never had reason to remove it. She's the queen of
obliviousness. Ullman's Frenchy is the patron saint of pushiness.
She's always putting in her two cents' worth. The joke here is that
her two cents' worth is worth millions.
</P>
<P>
   When Ray and his associates plan to rob a bank by renting the
store next door and tunnelling in through the basement, we think
we're in for a reworking of ``Big Deal on Madonna Street.'' And we
are, but only for five minutes. To cover the basement excavation,
Frenchy starts running a cookie shop out of the store above. The
bank job is literally a washout when Ray and the other diggers
encounter an unexpected outcome right out of silent comedy.
Meanwhile, the cookie boutique upstairs, intended as the merest of
fronts for the bank job, is a wild success. A cop too smart to be
bothered writing a report on the nonsense in the basement looks at
the customers lining up for Frenchy's cookies and gives Ray a word
of advice: ``Franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie takes its time achieving liftoff. And it's really two
films _ the first dealing with the bank caper, the second about
what happens to Ray and Frenchy after they strike it rich. Here,
too, the pace and energy levels aren't unflagging. ``Small Time
Crooks'' lasts maybe 10 minutes too long. But it's mostly pretty
funny, especially after Frenchy meets an art dealer and smooth
operator played by Hugh Grant and decides that a little social
climbing is in order. The mere sound of her pitch-perfect New
Yorkese was enough to set me laughing, and it's fun to watch Grant
oil his way through the role of the art-dealing shark, which
includes keeping a straight face when Frenchy's pronunciation of
crudites rhymes with Luddites.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a recapturing of the wistful appeal in some of
Allen's earlier films in Ray's rueful resignation to the
inevitability of at least a certain percentage of his life going
spectacularly wrong. Allen hasn't always played resignation; here
he plays it with throwaway charm, sometimes in surprisingly
delicate ways. When he's showing a visitor around his and Frenchy's
amusingly vulgar new digs, stuffed with antiques, he can't quite
get straight whether it's Louis XIV or Louis XV and wriggles out by
describing it as ``top Louis.'' ``Small Time Crooks'' may in the
end be small time Woody Allen, but it's the kind of movie you can
settle into, secure in the expectation that you can steal from it
more than a little vintage Allen fun.

CYPRESS HILL STAYS REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cypress Hill has a warning for all those wannabes who think
they're going to find instant success in the rock and/or hip-hop
fields: ``It's a fun job, but it's still a job. And save your
money, too. . . . There's gonna be another cat coming out next year
sounding just like you.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning appears in the dual Cypress Hill hits, ``(Rap)
Superstar'' and ``(Rock) Superstar.'' They are actually the same
song with a different arrangement tailored for each market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving you a dose of reality,'' says Cypress Hill's
B-Real. ``We're talking about the hardships of the business,''
B-Real says of the double ``Superstar'' tunes _ the rap version of
which features guests Eminem and Noriega, while the rock version
has a guest cameo from Everlast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rewarding job and I wouldn't trade it, but you've
got to love what you do,'' says B-Real. ``You've got to deal with
the fact you might have a single the record label doesn't think
radio is going to play. And if radio won't play the single, then
the record label won't get behind your video.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've also got critics who are always going to bash you, so
you've got to be a strong-minded person. You've also got to be on
time with your interviews and your studio sessions, and keep a
rapport with your fans. When you're hot, you're hot. And when
you're not, this business lets you die a slow death.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Superstar'' tracks are on Cypress Hill's new double-CD,
``Skull and Bones,'' which were produced by DJ Muggs, another
founding member along with B-Real and Sen Dog. And not only are the
singles tailored for double markets, but so are the two CDs _ one a
pure hip-hip CD, the other a rap/rock hybrid (with screaming guitar
solos) along the lines of what's hot today with acts like Korn,
Limp Bizkit, and Rage Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never pursued (rock) very much before,'' says B-Real.
``We felt we needed to keep our roots firm in hip-hop. Some hip-hop
fans are not going to understand what we're doing. But maybe, with
time, they'll accept it or at least have that (rock) CD as a
collector's item. And some fans prefer the rock CD to the hip-hop
CD. But we're giving them the power of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cypress Hill was actually on the tip of the rap/rock crossover
trend when it recorded with Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam on the
``Judgment Night'' CD back in 1993, before Korn and Bizkit took
off. And let it be said that Rage Against the Machine also once
opened a tour for Cypress Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if these groups owe us anything,'' says B-Real.
``Maybe we were a source of some inspiration for them, just as when
we came up, Public Enemy and the Beasties were sources for our
inspiration. Now they all got to be on top of the game, because
it's competitive out there. But I like Limp Bizkit. I think their
stuff is pretty dope. And I like Korn and Rage Against the Machine.
Rage really perfected (rap/rock) and knocked the door wide open.
They made it possible for acts like Bizkit and Reveille to come
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised,'' B-Real says of these crossovers. ``You
have to realize that rock and hip-hop are two musics that people
didn't think would be around for long. Both are rebellious musics
and people spoke out against them. Now you have them cross-mixing.
When you cross-mix two forms of music that people counted out from
day one, it can get interesting.''

   Wailing on: Although reggae pioneer Bob Marley died 19 years
ago, his band the Wailers continues to keep his legacy alive. Four
Wailers from that era _ Aston (Family Man) Barrett, Marcia
Griffiths, Al Andersen, and Earl Lindo _ are still singing his
songs of ``redemption, freedom, and roots,'' says Barrett, the
band's bassist who is in a fight to gain royalties from some of the
songs he says he co-wrote with Marley, including ``Easy Skankin',''
``War,'' and ``Survival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd write together after having a few joints to get the
inspiration going,'' says Barrett, whose group plays the Roxy
Thursday in a command-performance event with Gregory Isaacs and the
Skatalites. It's the strongest reggae bill of the season, now that
there's no more Reggae Sunsplash.
</P>
<P>
   The Wailers' latest album is a live disc, ``The Wailers,''
recorded in Negril, Jamaica. It's a fine, roots-flavored disc
blending new songs with versions of Marley's ``Lively Up Yourself''
and ``Buffalo Soldier,'' among others. It's available through the
group's Web site at www.wailers.com.
</P>
<P>
   As for his royalty battle, Barrett says he's trying to recoup
royalties from the Marley family (now headed by Bob's widow, Rita),
which won the rights to Marley's estate after a long court battle
with his record label. ``We just want something out of the
settlement,'' says Barrett, speaking for the Wailers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Wailers are touring six to eight months a year
``and carrying the music around internationally,'' he says.

   Volunteering in 2000: Jefferson Airplane's ``Volunteers'' album
from 1968 was one of the monumental records of the late 1960s. It
was the focal point of the band's appearance at Woodstock _ and is
being revived by surviving members Paul Kantner and Marty Balin
(who are now with the Jefferson Starship) at the House of Blues on
May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Volunteers' era was a year after the Summer of Love,''
says Kantner from his Bay Area home. ``It was when the flower
children grew thorns.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to reprise ``Volunteers'' just ``bubbled up one day,''
notes Kantner, who says the band will do most of the album,
including the songs ``We Can Be Together,'' ``Good Shepherd,''
``The Farm,'' and ``Wooden Ships,'' written by Kantner with David
Crosby and Stephen Stills. The music will be ``semiacoustic,''
accenting vocal harmonies and 12-string guitar. ``I call it
gangster folk,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a misconception Kantner wants to clear up about the
record. ``People thought of it as a political album, but it was
really nonpolitical,'' he says. ``We felt there was no real point
of dealing with politics any more than dealing with nuns in a
Catholic school head-on, or dealing with the Hells Angels or the
police head-on. . . . We were just saying, `Look what's happening
in the streets,' not `Go burn something down.' ''

DON'T GO OUT OF YOUR WAY FOR `ROAD TRIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ROAD TRIP 
Directed by: Todd Phillips 
Screenplay by: Phillips, Scot Armstrong 
Starring: Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy Smart, Paolo
Costanzo, DJ Qualls, Rachel Blanchard, Anthony Rapp, Fred Ward, Tom
Green 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexual content, crude humor, language and drug
use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' wastes no time lowering the summer movie bar.
Aimed at the ``American Pie'' audience, it works hard and no less
brainlessly to top that film's juxtaposition of pie and
masturbation. Before its four college buddies frantically drive
from Ithaca to Austin to retrieve a sexually compromising video, it
ups the gross-out ante with humor tied to anal probes, toe-sucking,
sperm banks, the eating of live mice, and, in its piece de
resistance, a kind of intimacy between a nasty short-order cook and
a couple of pieces of French toast.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``American Pie,'' it's actually quite innocent beneath its
eruptions of biological and other uproar. In fact, if the gross-out
bits are the ones you're curious about, you can get most of those
from the trailer, including the car explosion scene. Even that's
part of the masturbatory fantasy that ``Road Trip'' represents. It
begins when Breckin Meyer's emotionally insecure wrestler and even
more academically insecure freshman, Josh, worries that his
girlfriend since childhood, now attending college in Texas, has
dumped him after he doesn't hear from her for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on his own campus he meets Amy Smart's blond,
uninhibited beauty. She, it soon develops, lives only to have sex
with him when he tells her he's available. The complications begin
when it turns out that she also likes to videotape her sex life.
Thanks to the wrestler's wacko friend, MTV's Tom Green, whose main
interest in life is watching a pet snake eat mice, the video gets
sent to the Austin girlfriend. Not that Josh altogether minded.
He's interested in the new girl and, with the help of his pals,
rationalizes that it isn't cheating if you're in different area
codes or were too wasted to remember the details.
</P>
<P>
   But when the lifelong girlfriend calls from Texas and says she
was away attending a relative's funeral, Josh hits the road. Along
for the ride are `American Pie'' veteran Seann William Scott, as
the loudmouth know-it-all; Paulo Costanzo's pothead, and DJ Qualls'
nerd, who's invited only because he has the use of his father's car
and the others have no alternative transporation. The airheads
trying to persuade one another they're party animals can drive the
film only so far before signs of strain deepen into fault lines
into which the film plunges, never to be seen again, except
repeatedly on video at frat mixers.
</P>
<P>
   It's all totally predictable, filled with manufactured raunch
posing as anarchy. Trying to be hip, it makes the quartet the butt
of a few jokes after they stop at a black frat house in Tennessee.
There, in an episode combining racism and sexism, the nerd
undergoes his long-awaited sexual initiation. A little later on,
the loudmouth becomes the butt of an unexpected experience with a
nurse. Before it's over, ``Road Trip'' falls back on Viagra jokes
and tidy resolutions, proving that you can miss just as easily when
you aim low as when you aim high. ``Road Trip'' occasionally wills
itself to rude, crude life. But most of the time it's pretty limp.

SENSE OF PLACE ENLIVENS MURDER TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
STORM TRACK 
By Margaret Maron 
Mysterious Press, 260 pp., $22.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the strong allures of mystery fiction is its generally
rich sense of place. Among its better practitioners, setting rises
to the level of character. It's my contention that well-chosen
mysteries are better than Baedeker's as guides for the adventurous
traveler. Just think of James Lee Burke's tangy, humid New Orleans
or Robert Parker's or William Tapply's gritty and romantic profiles
of Boston, Sara Paretsky's spiky Chicago, or John Straley's raw
Alaskan cityscapes. Such locales shape and shadow the lives of
their denizens while seeming fully alive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is relevant to ``Storm Track,'' by Margaret Maron.
Although this is the author's seventh Deborah Knott mystery, the
series is new to me, and a very nice surprise, too. It's set in the
flat land of central North Carolina in fictional Colleton County,
an earthy realm where the Old and New South overlap. Knott herself,
a former lawyer and now a district judge, is a hybrid, part of a
fairly prosperous professional circle but rooted in rustic
heritage. Her father was once a moonshiner, maybe still is, and the
pull of the land and the power of a specifically Southern sense of
family are among Maron's strongest attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Knott has 11 brothers, many of whom live nearby, leading to
sweetly chaotic get-togethers featuring a herd of pickup trucks,
the consumption of cold beer and fried chicken, and the percussion
of screen doors banging as close-knit people come and go.
</P>
<P>
   It is to her credit that Maron made me homesick for a place I
knew mainly as a child: I was born in the Tarheel State not far
from Maron's fictional locale, with its truck farms, barbecue
joints, and combination of simmering, longstanding racial tensions
and a widespread familiarity between blacks and whites uncommon in
much of the north.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Maron's characters seem to spring to life
with immediacy _ and this should be read as praise _ is their
provinciality. She connects them indelibly to conventions of place
and specific folksy forms of speech. People say ``though''
(pronounced thew) for through, use the double-conditional ``might
could,'' savor the vinegar in their pork barbecue, and load
coleslaw onto their hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason I haven't mentioned the plot of ``Storm
Track'' yet. Suspense and helpings of nasty violence are indeed a
part of Maron's arsenal, and she has a decent sense of story. But
that doesn't seem to hold the primacy it does for many, if not
most, other writers of successful mystery fiction. In fact, it's
not until a quarter of the way through the novel that we hear about
the murder of Lynn Bullock, a local nurse and notoriously cheating
wife, found strangled with her own black lingerie in the Orchid
Motel.
</P>
<P>
   The crime elicits concern, of course, but in small-town Southern
communities like this, such events are typically treated as macabre
shared distractions and fuel for wildfire gossip and moralizing.
</P>
<P>
   Says one suspect in the murder, a young lawyer and one of
Bullock's many lovers, ``I swear to God, she must've spent her
formative years studying `Dynasty' as if it were a documentary on
tasteful dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   More violence ensues when Bullock's elusive killer pursues a
black woman he believes witnessed him leaving the room of the
murder victim. By mistake, he ends up stalking Clara Freeman, the
wife of the new minister of Balm of Gilead. But typically, even
more engrossing than the suspense of the pursuit itself is Maron's
masterful treatment of the characters involved. And no two
characters in the populous ``Storm Track'' are more dynamically
drawn than this pious, God-fearing woman and her well-meaning,
guilt-riven husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm Track'' moves forward at a leisurely pace, in keeping
with the late-summer rhythms of the rural South. Yes, a storm is
bearing down on the state as the novel's action gradually
intensifies, a hurricane called Fran very much like the real Fran
of 1996. But while the people of Colleton County eventually buy
some bottled water and flashlight batteries, there's little of the
frantic energy and TV-induced panic familiar to storm-freaked New
Englanders.
</P>
<P>
   Maron seems more interested in the mysteries of character and
nature than the workings of crime and detection. She reverses the
usual formulation, exploiting the conventions of crime fiction to
dissect human relationships and celebrate the world that her fully
fleshed-out characters occupies.
</P>
<P>
   Although she does this extremely well, I recommend Maron with
one notable reservation (that may, admittedly, have something to do
with knowing only this one book in the series). ``Storm Track''
teems with characters _ brothers and countless cousins and
colleagues and numerous other folk, too. It's impossible to keep
track of them all _ even when they sport Southern-fried names like
Kidd and Kezzie and Tater and Skeeter.

   Usually, the plunking of Shakespeare into a contemporary setting
just means a lazy director trying to look hip while covering for
the vocal inadequacies of an insufficiently trained cast. But
Michael Almereyda's ``Hamlet'' is a refreshing exception. He not
only solves the problem of throwing an arresting ``Hamlet'' onto
the big screen with a tiny budget. He and his cast, with a suitably
brooding, recessive Ethan Hawke in the title role, persuasively
connect with the energies in Shakespeare's tragedy. Literally, they
pick the play up and run with it. Working fast and rough, like a
pavement artist furiously trying to finish a chalk drawing before
looming rain clouds wash everything away, Almereyda's ``Hamlet'' is
a restless, urgent encounter with this protean text.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a hurtling series of images, racing to keep up with
what's being detonated by the language. Although the text is
trimmed, few filmed versions of ``Hamlet'' seem as alive to the
words. Never does this version unfold as the usual series of set
pieces. This is a situational ``Hamlet,'' hung on a viable conceit
in a Manhattan divided between midtown suits _ career-agenda types
preening and puffing through their sterile glass-and-steel citadels
of power _ and downtown grunge. Hawke, in a pond-scum goatee and
chic pointy knit wool patterned hat from the politically correct
side of the Arctic Circle, is, naturally enough, a filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in the contemporary world of this ``Hamlet,'' means he
has two problems. The first, of course, is Hamlet's usual disgust
at his newlywed mother and uncle, both too in love with advancement
to be in love with each other. They married before the body of
Hamlet's father was cold, and in fact were the ones who chilled the
dead king. Hamlet's second problem is image overload and sensory
bombardment pounding his head. At one point, an overhead jet drowns
out a speech. MovieFone eclipses another. The ``Oh what a piece of
work is man'' soliloquy comes from a laptop. And the
videocam-toting Hamlet ironically delivers ``To be or not to be''
from a Blockbuster Video's action film aisle.
</P>
<P>
   He lives downtown in a cozy underlit book and image-strewn grad
student's apartment. He has little use for the film's Elsinore
Hotel or Denmark Corporation _ in an office slab where Sam
Shepard's Ghost, spotted by a security guard, inhabits a backstairs
Pepsi machine. Hamlet is tortured because he really doesn't want to
kill his mother and uncle, although he enjoys unnerving them when
he doubles as Player King and makes them sit through his accusatory
video. This malaise-ridden Hamlet convinces us he knows from weary,
stale, flat and unprofitable. Hawke has said he grew up admiring
Olivier's Hamlet. But he doesn't regenerate Olivier's febrile
intensity. He's conflicted, but imploded _ a Hamlet in the image of
Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Almereyda's devices and transpositions work. But he
catches you up in a chase after the play's existential core. His
casting is a plus, too. Diane Venora, who may be the only Gertrude
to also have played Hamlet (and, less remarkably, Ophelia), easily
sketches the queen's uneasy suspension between ambition and
conscience. Kyle MacLachlan, with his Nutcracker profile, sleekly
conveys Claudius' strongest emotion, namely, annoyance at the
perpetual grad student taking the fun out of his corporate
takeover. Julia Stiles' pasty-faced, sullen Ophelia, trying to hide
her upper-crust status under an East Village wardrobe, seems the
one who's really trapped. And Bill Murray surpasses Polonius' usual
addled interference to project a sleazy insider's arrogance, unable
to see that he's in over his head when he sends his daughter to
Hamlet wearing a wire. Almereyda snatches surprising amounts of
sponetaneity from the film's world of media overkill. This is a
sizzling, invigorating ``Hamlet.'' Even when its conceits only play
like conceits, it's alive.

MATCHBOX TWENTY SWIMS THE MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mr. Grammy Man.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Rob Thomas's mates in Matchbox Twenty now kiddingly
call him after he won three Grammys for his collaboration with
Carlos Santana on ``Smooth,'' including song of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is now a celebrity, but a reluctant one whose band
members are merciless in their rib-tickling abuse. As Thomas
observes, ``Whenever I'll say to our drummer, Paul (Doucette), that
I think you're rushing that drum fill, he'll answer, `Oh, I'm
sorry, Grammy-O. Excuse me.' But it's all in fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is our friend and this gives us something to use against
him,'' says Doucette, laughing. ``Throughout all of this, Rob has
been like that wild-eyed kid who is thrown into his favorite toy
store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy focus, while on singer Thomas rather than on the
band, has actually been a way for Matchbox Twenty (whose new album
``Mad Season'' comes out Tuesday) to grow closer.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear when Thomas, who dropped out of high school
and hitchhiked around the South before the Orlando-based Matchbox
was formed, turned down the cover of Rolling Stone because the
editors wanted him on the front without the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know who we are. And I know that without one member of this
band, we wouldn't be Matchbox Twenty,'' Thomas says of the
musicians formerly known as Matchbox 20. They now like the number
written out because that was the original spelling before Atlantic
Records asked to change it. That was before they sold 10 million
copies of their 1996 debut album, ``Yourself or Someone Like You,''
which spun off the hits ``Real World,'' ``3 a.m.,'' and ``Push,''
while giving the band the freedom to do what it wanted this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Such freedom, coupled with a larger studio budget that enabled
the band to hire orchestral string players on several tracks, led
to more studio experimentation and caused some of ``the big,
catchy, poppy numbers to get left off the record this time. They
just didn't fit what we were trying to say with this album,'' says
Thomas, whose group plays Avalon next Thursday during a
get-reacquainted tour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Matchbox Twenty has too much of a pop sensibility to
suddenly make an esoteric album. The new disc gambles with some
arrangements _ lovers of the first record may not like everything
here, especially the gushy ``Last Beautiful Girl'' and moody ``Rest
Stop'' _ but there remain enough radio-friendly pop hooks to assure
maximum mainstream appeal, as on the midtempo ``Bed of Lies'' (``I
don't want to be somewhere I don't belong'') and the ballad ``If
You're Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And the mainstream is right where Matchbox Twenty wants to be.
They don't fit in with manufactured teen idols like Britney,
Christina, and the Backstreet Boys, nor do they fit with the
opposite extreme _ the aggressive bad boys from Korn to Kid Rock.
But they've got their own niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs a left and a right _ and a right down the
middle,'' says Thomas. ``And we're right down that middle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to make the same record again, though,'' he
adds. ``When we sat down this time, we said, `Wow, we sold a lot of
records. Let's pat overselves on the back, and let's move on and
see who we are now.' We had to start all over. Because in the end,
you look around and you see so many great bands who aren't selling
records. It puts a perspective on what selling records means. You
realize that that was then, and this is now and that you're
starting over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to make myself a place in the celebrity world, and
it's not for us to try to get on the top of the heap. It's all
about being able to stand up proud and say `Listen to my record, I
like my record.' Because in the end, I think when musicians make
records, what they're really thinking about is that other musicians
and songwriters are going to listen to that record. I want to know
that the people I respect would listen to this and say, `This is a
good record.' Nothing more. That's the reason you do it. I think
you have to have a little bit of an ego just to have the audacity
to think that people want to hear what you're doing. The ego's not
a bad thing at all _ everyone has it. It's what you do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Matchbox did was to increase, not diminish, the democracy
of the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go in and just jam. We would take a song and start
playing it and everybody would throw in ideas on the direction they
thought it should take,'' Thomas says. ``Let each person do what
they do. That's why you're in a band.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also why he's not interested in making a solo record,
despite industry pressure to do so after his Grammy success.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, I can't imagine playing music without these
guys,'' he says. ``It's an unbelievable thing if you have five guys
that you trust and it works like a machine. Everybody takes care of
different things and everybody is watching each other's back. It's
good to have that security, to know you're not in this alone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, don't look for Matchbox Twenty to play 200-plus gigs a
year anymore _ a pace the group set while becoming successful.
Lifestyle changes have occurred since the first record _ Thomas has
gotten married and guitarist Kyle Cook has a new baby _ so Matchbox
won't be quite the same road warriors of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do something that makes everyone happy and
comfortable,'' says Mr. Grammy Man. ``We're a family band and all
of us are in this together.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs are natural movie stars. To paraphrase Al Franken,
they're big enough, they're reptilian enough, and, doggone it,
people like them. In Disney's new ``Dinosaur,'' they've got
virtually everything. For its first two-thirds, the film is a small
miracle of freshness in an image-overloaded world, hitting our eyes
with a sense that it's moving movies forward a step, like
``Jurassic Park,'' like ``The Matrix,'' like ``Toy Story.'' The
ever-advancing world of computer graphics renders the awesome
beasts with hitherto unknown degrees of subtlety and detail. When a
gigantic brachiosaur trudges forward, its flesh, suspended from a
massive backbone, sways slowly. When other dinosaurs open their
mouths and bellow, the skin stretched between their upper and lower
jaws vibrates.
</P>
<P>
   What's also new is the way the keyboard wizards blend the
computerized dinos with actual landscapes. These backgrounds are in
some cases computer-enhanced _ a sky or a river may be painted in
or touched up. But Disney's cameras roamed the world for locations
_ Samoa, Australia, Venezuela, Hawaii, and Jordan as well as
Florida and California. It makes for a certain grandeur. The cattle
drive in ``Red River'' never had the spaciousness of this herd of
dinosaurs trekking across a vast desert on their way back to their
nesting grounds after a meteor shower decimates them _ and nearly
kills this film's protagonist, an iguanosaur named Aladar (voiced
by D.B. Sweeney).
</P>
<P>
   Disney being Disney, the film anthropomorphizes the dinosaurs.
They speak. They also scramble time lines by coexisting with
mammals. But at least they don't sing. And they're not made
insufferably cute. The film echoes previous Disney animations, most
notably ``Bambi'' and ``Tarzan,'' when Aladar's mother is killed by
a toothy carnosaur before he's even hatched from his egg. After the
egg is borne on a dizzying journey by a prehistoric bird, and
Aladar emerges, he's raised by a family of furry lemurs. He's Bambi
with scales. Cute, but, like Bambi, not insulated from cruel forces
of nature. When flaming meteors torch the lemurs' island, the
adolescent Aladar is big enough to carry his adoptive family on his
back while he swims to the next landfall.
</P>
<P>
   Before he joins a migrating tribe of his own kind, he must
outrun a colony of vicious little raptors nipping at his
hindquarters. Bringing up the rear of the trek, he's put in his
place by the leader of the pack, Kron, a dinosaur in the figurative
sense as well as the literal one, and Kron's right-hand man,
Bruton. Ironically, considering the limited future of the
dinosaurs, hard-liner Kron takes a Darwinian view, pushing ahead
with a survival-of-the-fittest policy, not unreasonable considering
the world he lives in, and the fact that he must stay ahead of
carnosaurs. Samuel E. Wright brings the right tonal weight and
crustiness to Kron, while Peter Siragusa's voice convinces us that
Bruton is anchored in Kron's perspective, but concedes possible
merit to Aladar's. Bruton's sister (voiced by Julianna Margulies)
feels the young dinosaur may be the one to lead the herd to the
future, that his patience with weaker, slower dinosaurs and his
openness to teamwork may be the way to go as the film heads into
``Lion King'' territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' is a fable, and a hugely and sometimes wondrously
watchable one, even if its emotions retreat to certain levels of
programmed predictability as the film proceeds. Amid the splendors
of its dinosaur's-eye view of the world, ``Dinosaur'' throws some
violent images at kids, but they're justifiable; the film would be
dishonestly saccharined without them. One thing that's certain is
that Disney is not just releasing its usual summer animation with
``Dinosaur.'' It's a bold leap, but a necessary one, to an entirely
new level of animation and a new kind of artifice. Otherwise,
Disney would itself risk becoming an entertainment dinosaur. But
Disney's new animation studio, kept under wraps for six years,
emphatically passes the test with ``Dinosaur.'' Throughout the
history of film, nothing turns campier faster than dinosaur movies.
This one will have a much longer shelf life than most.

ALLIES AT THE MARCH: MOTHERS AND POLICE OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The deafening roar had nothing to do with the
Million Mom March. The timing was still perfect.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks away from the main stage on the Mall, scores
of people milled around the National Gallery of Art, waiting for
friends and relatives to arrive at the rally. Just before noon,
just as the first speakers began railing about gun violence, a
quaking rumble and piercing sirens compelled the throng around the
National Gallery to turn their heads away from the Mall and walk
back out onto where Constitution Avenue meets Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The stir was caused by 2,500 police officers on motorcycles,
riding in pairs. They came from Cincinnati, Dayton, and Chelsea.
They came from places as wealthy as Greenwich, Conn., and as
riddled with poverty as Washington, D.C., itself.
</P>
<P>
   The officers were of all colors. They smiled and waved at the
crowd of all colors, which waved back. Their motorcade held up
people trying to get to the Million Mom March for 15 minutes. No
one seemed to care. Rare are the moments that police and masses of
people are relaxed enough to enjoy each other.
</P>
<P>
   The procession was part of National Police Week, to remember the
14,000 American cops who have been shot and killed since 1792. As
the police headed to their own sober festivities, it was fitting
how they skirted so close to the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers at the march was Mary Ann Viverette, a vice
president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and
police chief in Gaithersburg, Md. Unlike Rosie O'Donnell, Sarah
Brady or even children's singer Raffi, Viverette received no
mention in the next day's news. The media may have missed on of the
march's most powerful allies. It must be a sad day for the National
Rifle Association when mothers who have lost their children and
cops who have lost their colleagues to gun violence get together.
</P>
<P>
   Viverette said the IACP wants thorough background checks on gun
purchasers, and that shorter ones, as desired by the gun lobby,
sacrifice ``the safety of our communities and potentially
jeopardizes the people we are sworn to serve. The police chiefs of
this country want the violence to stop. The Million Mom March has
the same goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Williams, former police director of Newark, N.J., and
president of the Police Foundation, a law enforcement research
group, said several staff members went to the rally. He has argued
for fewer guns on the streets, saying they are regulated less than
cars, children's pajamas, and teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that the NRA and other organizations that have
been standing up for gun rights with no restrictions can withstand
this tidal wave that will spring up in the future,'' Williams said.
``If I were running for president, I would now have to really think
hard about my position on guns. There's no safe haven now for
legislators on unfettered rights to weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no safe haven particularly if the organizers of
the Million Mom March can exploit their common ground with the
police at election time. If they organize right, they can do what
few people have been able to do, to force politicians to choose
between the NRA and the people and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians, particularly law and order conservatives, love
photo-ops with the police at the same time they take money from the
NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the IACP, the Police Foundation, and the Police Executive
Research Forum support gun measures supported by the vast majority
of Americans, but blocked by the conservatives who have kept
Congress from enacting any gun legislation since the massacre at
Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   The police organizations support serious background checks,
waiting periods and closing the loop hole where firearms can be
purchased at gun shows without such checks. They also support
trigger locks and measures to get firearms out of the hands of
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the march as 750,000 people who came to speak for
victims who no longer can speak for themselves,'' said Mary Malina,
communications director of the Police Foundation, who attended the
Million Mom March. ``We all have a stake. We all are affected by
gun violence. Ask an emergency room physician. Ask a cop who never
knows if someone has a gun. There's a natural symbiosis not just
between cops and mothers, but with public health officials, all of
us. Maybe there a real silent majority on the issue of gun
control.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Few of the sons and daughters of Asian immigrants who
will pick up $1,000 scholarships in a ceremony at the University of
Massachusetts in Boston this weekend any idea where the money is
coming from, or why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about Southeast Asian kids _ Lao, Vietnamese, Hmong,''
said Xeng Her, whose Hmong people fled the hill country between
Vietnam and Laos after the Vietnam War. ``It's like niss-eye or
something. I can't really pronounce it. Probably some Asian
organization helping students.''
</P>
<P>
   Her, 17, who will use his award to study science at Bridgewater
State College, is mostly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind his scholarship, and 29 other scholarships
being awarded to children of immigrant families throughout eastern
Massachusetts are in fact nisei (pronounced knee-say) _
second-generation Japanese-Americans. And the awards, the
recipients, and the donors, all are part of a story that is
profoundly American.
</P>
<P>
   The nisei were among 120,000 Japanese-Americans yanked from
their homes, businesses, and campuses on the West Coast during
World War II and confined in barbed-wire-encircled camps by a US
government doubtful of their loyalty. In response, religious and
academic leaders appalled at the racist injustice were forming a
group to get the young men and women whose educations had been
interrupted back to school.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Fumio Robert Naka went from being a UCLA sophomore,
to internee, to degrees at universities in Missouri, Minnesota, and
Massachusetts. He also went from being classified as of doubtful
loyalty to earning a top security clearance, helping develop
stealth avionics and ending his government career as chief
scientist for the US Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America,'' said Naka, who now lives in semiretirement
in Concord.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 nisei were able to continue their educations as a
result of volunteers who helped them get FBI clearances, money for
living expenses, and scholarships from universities that still were
willing to accept people of Japanese heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is payback for us,'' said Glenn Kumekawa, who
attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, through the efforts of
volunteers who organized as the National Japanese American Student
Relocation Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we are helped, we often don't appreciate the
opportunity that is given to us,'' said Kumekawa, who became an
urban planner, a University of Rhode Island professor, and director
of the Coalition of Northeast Governors. ``Only much later did we
understand, at a time of tremendous anti-Japanese, anti-Asian
feeling, the effort that had to be exerted'' to get the students
out of camps and back to campus.
</P>
<P>
   That effort ``was an affirmation of decency and fair play,'' he
said. ``I am stunned when I go back and look at the efforts that
were made.''
</P>
<P>
   The deep connection to that effort is shared by John W. Nason,
who during World War II was president of Swarthmore College, near
Philadelphia, and chairman of the volunteer effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back over a kind of varied career,'' said Nason, who
is 95, ``I think of what I did in the student relocation council as
the one most-significant thing I've done in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nason is particularly pleased that the Japanese-Americans _ whom
he still calls ``the students'' _ now are helping Southeast Asian
students. ``It demonstrates what we hoped to accomplish,'' he said.
Rather than feel angry and hostile, ``as they have every right to
feel. . . they feel so much a part of the country and so concerned
about those less privileged than themselves. . .''
</P>
<P>
   To the nisei, the decision to focus on Southeast Asians was an
easy one, having little to do with race, and a lot to do with need.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were uprooted from their homes, they were sent to camps,
they were resettled far away and had to adjust to their
resettlement,'' Kamekawa said. ``There is a parallel.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of doing something as payback for the support given the
nisei arose in the early 1980s, at a picnic 15 nisei attended on
the blueberry farm of Lafayette H. Noda, a professor of
biochemistry at Dartmouth College. It became a favorite project of
Kamekawa's sister, Nobu Hibino, who completed her undergraduate
degree at Boston University after she was forced to leave the
University of California at Berkeley. Soon afterward, she helped
start the Nisei Student Relocation Commemorative Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the nisei were involved in a tense debate
over a new movement to press the US government for an apology and
compensation for the wartime internments, which enabled whites in
the West to buy up Japanese homes, farms, and businesses for
pennies on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Many nisei wanted not to stir up the past; others thought an
apology would be enough. Harvard Law School Professor Alan M.
Dershowitz, whom they consulted, persuaded them to insist on
compensation because, as Dershowitz put it this week, ``if no sense
of pain felt by those who do these things, the apologies are
hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz recalled meeting with a big group of people concerned
about the issue, and applauded the actions of the well-to-do nisei
who, when $20,000 per person compensation began to be paid, donated
theirs to the relocation commemoration fund. He said he is urging
Holocaust survivors who have become prosperous to put compensation
paid to them into a fund for victims of contemporary holocausts.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Naka, the internee who became a defense
intelligence specialist, had dinner with former Secretary of the
Air Force John McLucas, a friend of nearly 30 years with whom Naka
had worked on top-secret projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Bob, were you ever evacuated?' and I said
`yeah,' '' Naka recalled. ``He said, `all these years we worked
together, I never had the nerve to ask.' Then he said, `Only in
America. Anywhere else, you'd have been blackballed for the rest of
your life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I think too,'' Naka said. ``Only in America.''

&HT;     AUTHOR MAKES WAVES WITH BOOK ON IRISH HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was an idle Thursday afternoon at the Albany
Ancient Order of Hibernians hall. The drink was Guinness Extra
Stout. The food was corned beef sandwiches. The crowd was cops and
politicos. The talk was Irish history.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Golway, author of a new book celebrating 1,000 years of
Ireland's heroes, was preaching to the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Golway invoked the names of Wolfe Tone, Padraig Pearse and other
iconic figures in what he called ``the trauma, the triumph and the
tragedy of Irish history.''
</P>
<P>
   Golway's ``For the Cause of Liberty'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $26),
for which he received a six-figure advance after three publishing
houses engaged in a bidding war, is meant as unabashedly
revisionist history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Irish history is told by academic or British
journalists,'' said Golway, himself a journalist with the New York
Observer, an edgy and irreverent Manhattan weekly. ``Readers get
the idea that the Irish were either crazed or terrorists. Guys in
trenchcoats and ski masks. Anything but heroic.''
</P>
<P>
   Golway said the book has received a negative reaction in
England. ``I was trying to shed the same light on Ireland as
historians do on American freedom fighters like George
Washington,'' Golway said.
</P>
<P>
   He made several trips to Ireland to research the book, including
an interview with Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney.
They met in a pub and drank whiskey. Golway's entree came by way of
delivering the poet some Cuban cigars _ ``perfectly legal in
Ireland,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three and maybe four whiskeys,'' Golway, at least in
this telling, was sufficiently lubricated to attempt to edit a line
from a Heaney poem into more grammatical usage.
</P>
<P>
   Golway suffers the copy editor's curse. The 44-year-old Staten
Island native worked as a sports reporter at the Staten Island
Advance, as a sports copy editor at the New York Post, editor at
the Empire State Report and, for the past 10 years, as city editor
and political columnist at the New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   He interprets the political machinations of New York City in
810-word columns under the inherited title ``Wise Guys.'' ``It's
dangerous for a blowhard columnist to go much more than 810
words,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One hot topic of the moment for his Albany crowd was the recent
breakthrough in the negotiations for peace in Northern Ireland
following the Irish Republican Army's historic promise to ``put IRA
arms beyond use'' and to allow independent observers to inspect the
IRA's hidden arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's unprecedented pledge appeared to clear the way for a
resumption of the aborted power-sharing government. Britain took
back self-rule after implementation of the 1998 Good Friday peace
accord derailed. The troubled six-county northern province of
Ulster has been decimated by decades of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I end my book on the positive note of the Good Friday peace
accord, which may be the first book of Irish history with a happy
ending,'' Golway said. ``I think Gerry Adams has done an
unbelievable thing to convince an unbeaten guerrilla army to put
the guns away and try politics. He put his own life on the line for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Golway credited the economic surge of the Republic of Ireland,
nicknamed ``The Celtic Tiger,'' with helping to lay the groundwork
for the peace process. ``The shipyards in Belfast are rotting away,
unemployment in Northern Ireland is around 18 percent and being a
privileged Protestant there has gotten young people nowhere,''
Golway said.
</P>
<P>
   He has observed Protestant youths riding a train named the
Enterprise from Belfast to Dublin to shop. ``They see these young
computer programmers in the Republic driving BMWs and living in
mansions and seeing everything they don't have in the north,''
Golway said. ``There will come a time when that border won't mean
anything to the young generation. Brittania doesn't rule the waves
anymore. The European Union is changing the landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   After publishing three books of Irish history, in the past five
years, Golway is taking a break from the long form. ``I want to
relax with my family this summer and not worry about working on a
book,'' said Golway. His wife, Eileen Duggan, stays at home with
their two children, Kate, 6, and Conor, 5. They live in Maplewood,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Both Golway and his wife grew up on Staten Island. Both their
fathers were firefighters, but they worked in different precincts
and didn't know each other. Neither did Golway and Duggan, who met
as adults in Manhattan.

</P>
<P>
   Reminiscences about favorite pubs peppered the afternoon's talk.
Golway occasionally joins at a Manhattan watering hole the First
Friday Club, an informal gathering of Irish-American writers and
others that includes Frank and Malachy McCourt, Peter Quinn, Dennis
Smith and William Kennedy when he's in the Big Apple. They used to
meet at Eamon Doran's pub, but that closed. So did Tommy Makem's
place. Even the group's dynamic has changed. ``I'd say business
people now outnumber writers three to one,'' Golway said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt was an integral member in pre-``Angela's Ashes''
days, when he was simply a retired New York City high school
teacher. ``We knew Frank was working on a memoir, but who knew what
it would become?'' Golway recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Golway and McCourt shared a reality check at this year's St.
Patrick's Day party at the White House, hosted by President
Clinton. ``We both just couldn't believe where we were,'' Golway
said.

 CHRYSLER HAS A HIT WITH A CRUISE BACK IN TIME  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They seem to appear by the decade: cars that capture American
drivers and their current lifestyles. The Ford Mustang, the
Volkswagen Beetle, the Chrysler minivan, the Mazda Miata, and as
the millennium ended, Volkswagen's New Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive cults spring up around them. We wait in line to buy
them, often paying more to dealers than the manufacturers
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Chrysler PT Cruiser, part truck, part minivan,
part Beetle. Today's hot car looking like the car that yesterday
might have sat idling outside a bank job.
</P>
<P>
   Drive the PT Cruiser in creeping morning traffic along the
avenue and a remarkable thing happens: other drivers motion for you
to lower your window because they want to talk about your car, even
as you roll along.
</P>
<P>
   Park it on a city street and a crowd gathers, extolling its look
with words they might use to describe the aura of that street
itself: hip and hot, sassy and sharp, funky and fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If their idea was to get attention, they got attention,''
Kevin Kelly, a retail design and marketing man, says as he checks
out the Cruiser on Newbury Street in Boston this week. ``Look at
the cars along the street here. This one stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does, as people stop to run their hands along its
lines, pop the hood, open the trunk, sit inside and grab the wheel.
Nearby Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and BMW autos go unnoticed, as does a
glistening Norton motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhere between a truck and a minivan,'' says Carolyn
Talley, a building supply store manager. ``I love this car.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler had hoped to sell 50,000 PT Cruisers annually. They
sold more than 8,000 last month, the first sales period, and
already there are six month-waiting lists to buy more. The company
is ramping up for annual sales that could reach 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   All this in the age of the thundering SUV, for a car that has a
modest four-cylinder engine, is not very big (though surprisingly
roomy), and has dealers adding $2,000 and more to the
manufacturer's suggested retail price, which ranges from $16,000 to
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the low price surprised most people who stopped by in
Boston, where the Cruiser was parked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what, $30,000, $35,000?'' Talley asks when challenged to
guess the price for a Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Many were surprised by the size _ about that of a Beetle, though
with a higher, longer roofline. They had seen pictures of the
Cruiser in magazines, looking like a big four-door sedan out of the
1940s, and assumed it would be as big as those old cars _ or
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be the size of one of those monstrous SUVs,
which I hate,'' says Alan Fincke, a realty agent. ``It's compact.
It's really a sharp car.''
</P>
<P>
   What the PT Cruiser is, in fact, is a front-wheel drive vehicle
with moderate power and distinct styling, from its retro outer
shell down to its black on white gauges and Art Deco interior door
handles.
</P>
<P>
   It seats five adults _ four comfortably _ and its back seat
folds down, leaving van-like cargo space all the way into the
trunk. Its appeal crosses generations and demographics, from
students looking to hop into something hip to older couples looking
to recapture some essence of their automotive past.
</P>
<P>
   It is function in a form that seems to dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got that retro look,'' says Tom Zbruz, a graphic design
student. ``That's what got me.''
</P>
<P>
   His pal and fellow student, Luis Taforo, adds, ``It's hot. It's
fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back in time in this thing,'' says Nick Raportoru, a
heating and air conditioning technician.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a PT Cruiser Web site _ ptcruiserclub.org _ has been
launched. Cruiser paraphernalia _ models, accessories, key chains _
abounds. On the Web site, owners and aficionados chat about the
car, swap customizing tips, information about Cruiser-related
events, and share pictures of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   All this over a car which is only now hitting the streets, a
modern phenomenon that Diane Peterson, a district manager for the
Pottery Barn, says, ``Looks most like a '40s gangster car.''
</P>
<P>
   Retro or modernist; minivan, truck or car; gangster wagon or
London taxi clone, the PT Cruiser has captured America's motoring
fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Luis Taforo as he runs his hands along a front fender in
tactile assessment of the styling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta catch me one of these,'' he says.

GENE RESEARCHER SAYS LAPSES LED TO PATIENT'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gene therapy researcher Dr. Jeffrey Isner, slapped last
month with federal allegations of failing to protect human research
subjects, conceded Thursday to lapses in reporting a patient's
death. But, he said, most of the US Food and Drug Administration's
findings against him are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Isner's comments, his first since the FDA leveled its charges,
are contained in a 19-page response to the agency's warning letter
of April 28 that said he violated regulations governing clinical
trial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Isner agreed that the stress of chest surgery
to perform the gene implants might have played a role in the deaths
of two people in the program. But he maintained that the FDA found
no evidence that the therapy itself actually caused the fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, 52, a superstar cardiologist at St. Elizabeth's hospital
and professor of medicine at Tufts University, said he and the
hospital were eager to cooperate with regulators and resume his
experimental trials. If successful, he said, the gene therapy ``is
likely to change the way medicine is practiced.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinical gene therapy trials are to test a method aimed at
growing new blood vessels to bypass arterial blockages in the heart
or the leg. The trials are sponsored by Vascular Genetics Inc. of
Durham, N.C., a company Isner co-founded in 1997. The American
Society of Gene Therapy has said Isner's financial stake in the
company is a potential conflict of interest, but Isner and hospital
officials say the link doesn't influence the research.
</P>
<P>
   Isner contended that two deaths out of the 85 treated in several
gene therapy trials was actually a good record, given how
chronically ill the patients were. It was a mistake, he agreed, not
to report one of those deaths to a hospital watchdog committee, but
said it had been properly reported to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   In the written response to the FDA, the hospital and Isner say
that 16 of the FDA's 21 findings were in error: some were minor
issues of documentation while others involved whether patients not
medically eligible for the research were wrongly admitted to the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   On another major complaint, Isner said a chain of slipups led to
a patient undergoing the gene therapy despite having a lung tumor
which enlarged subsequent to the therapy. Patients with cancer are
supposed to be excluded from the therapy trials, because the genes
used produce a protein that potentially could speed the growth of a
tumor. Among the mistakes, says the response, was a
``communications error'' in which a report of a chest X-ray was
never filed in the patient's chart.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says, however, that in the course of screening
patients for the trial, doctors diagnosed many other cancer cases
and the one cancer victim admitted to the trial has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Isner, who spoke to the Globe along with hospital president
Michael F. Collins, said the St Elizabeth's gene therapy trials
differ significantly from highly publicized trials going on at the
University of Pennsylvania, in which a healthy 18 year-old patient
died last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not dealing with healthy young patients,'' Isner said.
The volunteers for the trial were either about to lose their legs
because of blocked arteries or suffered from terminal heart
disease.``This is as sick as you get,'' he said, adding that in
every case he told the patients that the experiment was ``a roll of
the dice'' and wasn't a therapy they could count on.
</P>
<P>
   One patient died in October 1998, four months after she suffered
an abnormal heart rhythm and two days after receiving the gene
implants. It was this death that the FDA said the researchers
failed to report to the hospital's Institutional Review Board
</P>
<P>
   In February the FDA directed St. Elizabeth's to halt all gene
therapy trials: six have already been completed and two active ones
remain on hold, said a hospital spokeswoman. FDA investigators
spent five days in March at St. Elizabeth's scrutinizing research
records.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions were contained in the warning letter, accusing
Isner of ``a serious lack of knowledge of your responsibilities as
a principal investigator.''
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the FDA, Isner and hospital officials said they
had already or would in the future take a number of corrective
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were to follow all research protocols and enforce the
criteria for admission to a trial; report all serious adverse
events including deaths as soon as they're discovered; communicate
more closely with a patient's other doctors to check on his or her
health and train staff in following protocol rules. In regards to
the missed cancer diagnosis, hospital officials said a committee
will set up to focus on the health histories of all patients in
whom ``suspicious lesions'' are revealed during screening.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Collins and Isner said that henceforth research
volunteers will be informed about previous adverse events or deaths
of patients receiving the treatment. They will also be advised that
Isner and St. Elizabeth's have a financial interest in the research
because they hold equity in Vascular Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the hospital president, said that he takes ``full
responsibility'' for the flaws highlighted by the FDA. ``I'm not
happy that things were found that could be improved upon, but we
have taken a good faith effort to review all of our policies and
practices. I'm very anxious to cooperate with the FDA and get off
hold and go on with the research.
</P>
<P>
   The next move in the case is up to the FDA, which can impose a
range of penalties or simply re-open the trials if it is satisfied
with the response and plan for corrections.

&HT;     AFTER HIATUS, COUNTRY SINGER RETURNS WITH `INNOCENT YEARS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GOODSPEED  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If fans of country singer Kathy Mattea are upset that it's been
more than three years since her last album, they won't be when they
hear why.
</P>
<P>
   They also won't be disappointed when they hear what she learned
from her ordeals on ``The Innocent Years,'' released earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   First, her mother, Ruth, was gravely ill. Then her father, John,
was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Her record company, Mercury, got a new
owner, which always casts doubt on an artist's future. Capping the
long, emotional roller-coaster ride, last June she turned 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those things combined made me reassess my life,''
Mattea said in a phone interview from her home in Nashville, Tenn.
``When you are helping one of the people you love most in the world
re-evaluate their life and death, you can't help but re-evaluate
your own.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting album took on a life of its own as she threw out
songs she had been planning to include, added others and began
writing for the first time in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an album about getting to the essence of what life's
about and living as a grownup in the real world with your eyes
open,'' said Mattea, who has earned two Grammys, five Country Music
Association awards and four Academy of Country Music awards plus 16
Top 10 singles since signing with Mercury in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Topics of the 11 songs on ``The Innocent Years'' include the
loss of youth on the title cut; surviving the Depression on ``Why
Can't We''; finding lasting, true love on ``I Have Always Loved
You''; and that love guiding a couple through death's final embrace
on ``That's the Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way the album hangs together thematically and looks
at a common theme from many points of view,'' Mattea said. ``That
is something I was able to accomplish on this record that was a
rare thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that the CD is a mournful look at morbid
topics. Musically, it's Mattea's blend of country, folk, bluegrass
and Celtic influences. And Mattea's solid vocal interpretations and
ever-present positive outlook permeate, as on the first single, the
uptempo, melodic ``Trouble With Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bounce around to it and everything but if you really
listen to it it's about faith and how God doesn't really answer our
prayers in the way we expect him to,'' Mattea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes God can see the picture in a way you can't. And many
times in my life things I thought were disasters turned out to be
blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Her family's crisis is an example.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, her father's goal for the day was to get out of
bed and crawl to a chair to watch television so he would not be
bed-ridden. After operations and chemotherapy, his cancer is in
remission. He's approaching 80, playing golf several times a week
and lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother struggled with a number of health problems that now
are under control.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Mattea and her songwriter husband of 12
years, Jon Vezner, began writing together _ the title track and
``Callin' My Name.'' More are in the works, and they're trying to
have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   She also stopped worrying about things that used to bother her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a sense that life is a real finite thing and how
precious it is. I didn't want to waste time and energy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mattea considers the title track the album's centerpiece. It
works on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a metaphor for society and where we're headed and
the sense that people can't grow up as innocently as they did once
_ and the things we've lost along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   She also took a bigger role as co-producer, which allowed bolder
strokes for her artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Mattea ranks the album among her best, a high point on a road
she began traveling when she started singing in church in her
hometown of Cross Lanes, W.Va. She moved to Nashville in 1978 as
part of a bluegrass band and worked a number of jobs, including a
stint as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Her job as a demo singer for songwriters eventually landed her a
contract with Mercury, and Mattea moved into the fast lane. Part of
the journey included a performance on the South Lawn of the White
House for President Clinton, a gig she landed with the help of one
of her fans _ Vice President Al Gore, who used to catch her act
when he was a senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Mattea is planning to hit the road soon in support of ``The
Innocent Years,'' on tour with Asleep at the Wheel; there's also a
European tour, a Christmas tour and the beginnings of her next
album.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, she'll remember the lessons of her
parents _ and especially her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad struggled to live because he loves us, but his life is
simple. He has a garden, putters in the yard, plays golf,'' Mattea
said. ``We forget that the essence of life is really in the simple
things but we can get caught up in so much other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stay grounded and live like a real human being.''

&HT;     CATFISH PARADISE FOUND AT TEXAS RESERVOIR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RALPH WININGHAM  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THREE RIVERS, Texas _ Weaving in and out of gnarled, weathered
tree limbs that poke through the surface of Choke Canyon Reservoir
sometimes makes a person wonder how such a bleak-looking site could
be so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Although the above-the-surface appearance is less than eye
appealing, what lurks below is something fishing dreams are made
of, particularly for the summer and early fall months. This is as
close to a catfish paradise as anyone can imagine, and with just a
little luck and the right equipment, the result can be a big fish
fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no telling how many blues and channel cats are in
here,'' guide Charles Brown said during a recent early morning
outing at Choke Canyon, 50 miles south of San Antonio. ``I'd like
to have someone with an underwater camera film under here just to
see how many catfish are in this lake. I think it would be scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's method of catching enough catfish for a monster fish fry
is simple and similar to most of the guides and other fishermen who
work over the lake each summer.
</P>
<P>
   He uses a single hook _ the Daiichi Bleeding Bait Circle Wide
hooks work particularly well _ on a 6-inch piece of leader line
topped by a small slip sinker. The hook is dipped into a bucket of
smelly cheese bait and gently lowered into the water. After the
bait hits bottom, the line is cranked up about 1 or 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wraps his hooks with a small piece of polyester batting,
like that used to stuff pillows, in order to keep the cheese bait
on the hook. He also makes his own bait, like several other guides
at Choke, although the main ingredient in any of the concoctions
seems to be stink.
</P>
<P>
   This type of fishing is not brain surgery. When something tries
to take the bait, you set the hook and crank the fish into the
boat. If the catfish is 12 inches or longer, it goes into the fish
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one gets to make the trip home,'' Brown said time after
time during our fishing foray.
</P>
<P>
   Each fisherman is allowed to keep 25 fish, most of which will
range from a little more than a pound up to 2 or 3 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger fish move into the shallows, but not in the numbers
that you will find in water that is 10 to 15 feet deep,'' Brown
said. ``It's not unusual to limit out on the little ones like
these, but an average catch of bigger fish in shallow water is
about 10 or 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Although our trip began at 7 a.m. and we were back in the dock
at 2:30 p.m. with 60 keepers, Brown said catfish can be fickle and
bite at any time of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his favorite fishing holes are ``the ones near the
dead tree stumps.'' Like most of the guides, he has his spots that
seem to hold fish and he can easily find them in areas of the lake
that all look the same to anyone who has not spent years on the
water.
</P>
<P>
   He added that with the lake level about 21 feet low, boaters
have to be cautious when running around looking for fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of fishing is really good for kids and people who
just want to put a lot of fish in the boat,'' he said. ``It's easy
and fun. Fishing shouldn't be work.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting moments during our trip was watching
a swarm of honeybees sweep across the sky just a few feet above our
heads. The bees were spread out across an area of about 30 feet and
flew by for at least a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen swarms out here before, but they are normally more
compact,'' Brown said as we all stopped to watch the buzzing show
and tried not to draw attention to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Having a swarm of bees try to land on the boat, even if they
weren't the Africanized ``killer'' variety, would not have been a
fun thing.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to our fishing, we found that whenever the catfish
being hauled in were mostly undersized, Brown would crank up the
motor and head for another favorite spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, you will normally catch a little larger
fish by using a float that lets the bait dangle about 3 feet below
the surface,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added that blue catfish are more numerous than channel
cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't catch the big blues like this,'' he said. ``You have
to use a trot line or jug line to catch the 50 or 60 pounders.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with many fishermen looking for fine table fare rather
than a rough and tumble struggle between man and fish, the smaller
cats are the best eating size, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>

Brown at 830-780-2162.)

IT'S TOUGH `GROWING UP BRADY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever watched a rerun of the late-'60s, early-'70s
sitcom ``The Brady Bunch'' _ and let's face it, if you've done any
channel-surfing at all, you've no doubt landed upon it; it's that
ubiquitous _ and if you've thought, ``What went on behind the
scenes must be more interesting than what's on the screen,'' Barry
Williams wants you to know you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who portrayed Greg, the ``hip,'' oldest brother, on
the series, wrote a bestselling 1992 memoir on his life as a Brady
_ including all the sundry spin-off TV films and series _ that has
been adapted into a TV movie, ``Growing Up Brady.'' It's an
affectionate look at a show that's been both roundly celebrated and
mocked for its innocence and its goofiness, but it's likewise a
show that has endured and even risen in stature over the
intervening decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing Up Brady'' reveals some of the endless disputes over
scripts creator Sherwood Schwartz _ who was also responsible for
the other sitcom in the twin towers of '60s silliness, ``Gilligan's
Island'' _ had with ``Bunch'' head Robert Reed, who portrayed
sensible dad Mike Brady. It also essays the numerous romantic
trysts the series produced, particularly between Williams and
Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia, the ``perfect'' Brady sister.
But it airs its laundry in a manner befitting the series _ sweetly
and fairly, with all sides' perspectives represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about score settling, it's not mean-spirited; it's
respectful, it's true to spirit of what really happened,'' Williams
says. ``That is the way I remember things, the way I see and feel
about it, and I'm glad that this is the story. It's not about me
getting beat up by father (as ``Come On, Get Happy,'' Danny
Bonaduce's ``Partridge Family'' biopic, was). Or,'' Williams adds,
deadpan, ``by Ann B. Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady'' creator Schwartz and his son Lloyd, who served as a
writer and director on the series, also spoke to set the record
straight. Though both Schwartzes in separate interviews used the
same phrase to describe Williams' book _ ``A lot of it took place
in his head'' _ they confirm the generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood Schwartz _ who conceived of the series after reading a
newspaper item about blended families, and quickly pounded out a
script out of fear that someone else would come up with the idea of
a comedy about two families merging into one (only to watch the
development process take a whopping four years before the show made
it to the air) _ still shakes his head over some of Reed's
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a stickler, he used to read with the script in one
hand and the other he had in the Encyclopedia Britannica,''
Schwartz remembers. ``Every day of every week, he was pain in the
neck, and you can go a little further south of that. If something
didn't ring the truth bell with him, he'd walk off the set and not
tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would visit him in his dressing room and say, 'What's
wrong?' and he'd say, 'If you don't know, I can't explain to you.'
He would say, 'Did you see the last script?' Well, that was a
direct insult _ it was my script. He'd say, 'Do you know what scene
we're doing now?' Again, a direct insult, I was the executive
producer, I should sure as hell know what scene we're shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   One time, Reed took offense to Mike entering the kitchen, seeing
his wife and maid cooking up some strawberries for a baking
contest, and uttering the line ``This smells like strawberry
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a joke, but it's a cute way to get into the scene,''
Schwartz says. ``And Robert says, 'It just so happens that
strawberries, while cooking, have no odor.' Minutes and dollars are
flying away while we're sitting there discussing this. I said, 'Can
you say, ``This looks like Strawberry Heaven?'' Fifty thousand
dollars later, I changed one word.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed also balked when the script called for him to slip on some
eggs that fell out of the refrigerator. ``Robert said, 'The truth
of the matter is, contrary to popular belief, when your shoes hit
eggs, they're sticky. You don't slide at all.' This one cost
$150,000. I told him, let's rehearse the scene and get to your
point later. So he opens the refrigerator, the eggs fall out, and
he just by accident steps on them and falls on his a--. So I'm
standing there, looking down at him, and he's wagging his finger in
my face, saying, 'That doesn't prove a thing!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz soon learned to do his homework before handing Reed a
script. He contacted the Federal Communications Commission over an
episode in which the Bradys install a pay phone in their house for
the kids, knowing that Reed would declare such an act was illegal.
Schwartz found his loophole _ they were legal in Santa Monica _ and
toyed with Reed when the actor demanded to know where the Bradys
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz recalls, ``I told him, 'California.' He said, ``I know
that _ where in California?'' 'Oh, Southern California.' He said,
``I know that, too, given that we see all these palm trees. But
where in Southern California?'' Schwartz hemmed and hawed for a
while longer before telling Reed the Bradys lived in Santa Monica.
``I heard him yell 'S---!' and slam the phone down. That was one of
the best phone calls of my life. It wasn't very nice of me, but
since he had caused me enough sleepless nights and caused Paramount
enough money, I thought he deserved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed stormed off the set of the last episode of the series and
was summarily written out of it. Nonetheless, he returned for all
the sundry Brady spinoffs, from variety shows to dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, when we were doing 'The Brady Girls Get Married,'
he was in a play in New York at that time and had another week to
go, but he bought himself out of the show, flew himself out here
and showed up saying, 'No one is going to marry off my two oldest
daughters but me,''' Schwartz remembers.
</P>
<P>
   For the subject of Brady nookie, we turn to Lloyd Schwartz, who
says, ``I was on the set and assumed the position on ensuring that
there weren't any next editions of Bradys running around.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time when we started on the show, I was 22 and Barry
was 15, so I was like his uncle or big brother,'' Lloyd says. ``We
had a lot of talks. He was very interested in Maureen, and I had to
keep that from happening on the set, so I told him, 'When you start
to get interested in her, take a look at her hands. She has very
small hands, they're like little girl hands _ so look at them and
stop thinking about her that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz says he was largely successful at keeping
extracurricular romance to a minimum on the set, but a scene in
``Growing Up Brady'' in which Williams and McCormick flirt wildly
while shooting a scene, though exaggerated, is based on fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 23 years old and this was the first scene of anything I
had ever directed,'' he remembers. ``I had gone to UCLA film
school, and no where in any book does it say what to do when a
brother and a sister are hot for one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept doing the scene, and there didn't seem to be any
mistakes in their line readings, but I could just see the steam
coming out of them. I made them do 13 takes to try to lose that,
when usually we'd just do three. The crew wasn't really paying
attention, and Barry and Maureen weren't aware of it, so everyone
was wondering what I was doing, if I had lost my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Williams' ``date'' with his TV mom, Florence Henderson,
``That's totally in Barry's head,'' Lloyd and Sherwood agree. Lloyd
explains: ``Florence was married at time and had 4 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And to hear Lloyd tell it, the luckiest guy on the set was none
other than _ Lloyd Schwartz. ``Whenever we cast for Barry's
girlfriends, we always cast older _ that way, they didn't need an
on-set teacher. So a lot of the girls we cast were 19 playing 16.
And I was about 23. So they were never right for him, but they were
always right for me. When we watch reruns sometimes, my son will
say, `That's a good episode.' And I'll look at Greg's girlfriend
and think, `That was a great episode!''' &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Growing Up Brady.'' &QL;

  L.A. Opera's Hemmings 
to be feted at concert 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many operatic luminaries who keep watch over Peter
Hemmings' office at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, there's one
prominent photo of a bespectacled, middle-age man sticking his
tongue out behind Hemmings' back.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings is laughing in the picture, probably because he's well
aware of what mischief his friend David Hockney _ artist, fellow
Englishman and sometime opera designer _ is up to. Having spent 43
years running orchestras and opera companies on three continents,
including the past 16 years with Los Angeles Opera, Hemmings seems
to have acquired a sixth sense of knowing when something big is
sneaking up on him: a promising young tenor, an about-to-be-hot
director like Julie Taymor or a business opportunity that may not
come round again.
</P>
<P>
   That instinct has well served the founding general director of
Los Angeles Opera (formerly L.A. Opera), who will retire next month
and return with his wife, Jane, to England, where four of the
couple's five children live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to retire,'' Hemmings, who turns 66 this
year, says over a midafternoon cup of coffee at his downtown
office. ``My wife and I have been traveling the world _ we've been
married for 38 years _ and we want to get back and be near our
children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving L.A., Hemmings will spend the next several weeks
being made much of. On Monday night, he'll be honored with a
celebratory concert and black-tie evening gala with a top ticket
price of $2,500 at which singers Placido Domingo, Jennifer Larmore,
Carol Vaness, Rodney Gilfry and others will perform. Actor Michael
York will emcee the event at the Dorothy Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spotlight that night will be squarely on Hemmings,
Domingo also will command much attention. In July, the superstar
Spanish tenor, who currently serves as Los Angeles Opera's
principal guest conductor and artistic adviser, will assume
Hemmings' creative duties when he takes over as the company's
artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings won't exactly be spending his golden years puttering
about in the garden _ though he admits he'll miss tending the
orchids at his Pasadena home. Recently appointed to the board of
directors of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Britain's
premier opera venue, Hemmings has been asked to serve as a ``talent
scout'' in Europe. He also will continue pursuing the idea of
creating a small opera house in the English Midlands, near
Birmingham, ``which is a scheme I've worked on for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hemmings' old job will be split in half. Domingo, 59,
will add his L.A. artistic directorship to the similar post he
holds with Washington Opera, and will attempt to balance those
demands with his already groaning schedule of opera performances,
recording sessions and concert hall recitals. Ian White-Thomson, a
former Borax USA executive, will serve as the company's executive
director and chief financial overseer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hemmings was brought up in the European tradition of a
single, omnipresent hands-on opera manager who supervises every
aspect of the company, he recognizes that a charismatic figure like
Domingo will be able to attract new donors and subscribers,
particularly in this celebrity-driven town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as, 'There's only one way to run an
opera company,''' Hemmings says, ``and in recent years the
complications have grown greater: the involvement of the unions,
the need to charge very high prices and to do very substantial
fund-raising have all escalated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that, in the end, the best fund-raising is done
by the person who is responsible for the artistic programming _ me,
at present, and Placido in the future. Because the people who give
big amounts of money want to be at one with the director of the
company. I'm not saying they interfere, but they like to feel that
they have the ear of the director of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings will leave behind an institution that in less than a
generation has gone from scratch to being one of the nation's
half-dozen largest opera companies. With a $22 million budget, a
subscriber base of around 17,000 and a schedule of eight
productions and more than 50 performances a year, Los Angeles Opera
belongs to what's generally considered the second tier of U.S.
opera companies behind New York's Metropolitan Opera, Chicago's
Lyric and San Francisco Opera _ all older by decades than upstart
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut production in September 1986 of Verdi's
``Otello,'' with Domingo in the title role, Los Angeles Opera has
attracted such esteemed directors as Andrei Serban, Peter Sellars
and Sir Peter Hall, and designers like Hockney, Gerald Scarfe and
Taymor, before her fame skyrocketed when Disney hired her to direct
``The Lion King.'' Besides its longstanding relationships with
established stars like Domingo and Vaness, under Hemmings Los
Angeles Opera has helped launch the careers of a number of young
performers through its resident artist program. One, Gilfry, will
close out the company's current season by starring in its June 3-17
production of ``Billy Budd,'' Benjamin Britten's adaptation of
Herman Melville's novella.
</P>
<P>
   What Los Angeles Opera is selling, Angelenos are buying in
record numbers. Paid attendance for the company's 1998-99 season
(the last for which complete figures are available) was a record
149,106, or 89.4 percent of capacity for the 3,086-seat Dorothy
Chandler. Subscription records also were set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the resident artist program, Hemmings, who has a
classics degree from Cambridge, sounds particularly proud of the
company's initiatives aimed at widening its local audience base,
such as the In-School Opera Program, which brings opera to more
than 22,000 L.A. County public school students each year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Achilles' heel, asserts Allan Ulrich, classical
music critic at the San Francisco Examiner, has been a lack of
consistently high-quality conductors and the absence of a musical
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of (Hemmings') problems is that he never found the
consistently fine musical leadership that a major house deserves,
and he knows this and we've talked about it,'' Ulrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich also thinks the company's programming has grown more
conservative in the last few years, in part, he believes, because
Hemmings backed riskier productions early on, then found himself
facing budget shortfalls. Still, Ulrich cites the Hockney-designed
version of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' a 1995 production of
Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' conducted by Los Angeles
Philharmonic musical director Esa-Pekka Salonen and a 1997
production of Monteverdi's ``The Return of Ulysses'' as recent
examples of strong work.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings acknowledges that ``our development was retarded in the
early part of the last decade'' due to factors like the 1992 civil
disturbance, the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and the recession
fueled by defense industry cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult two or three years for everybody, and
especially for fund-raisers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemmings expects Los Angeles Opera will add a ninth opera to
its season before long, after the Los Angeles Philharmonic takes up
residence in the new Walt Disney Concert Hall, beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we can safely say that in the next 10 years we'll
be up to 10 operas and 100 performances, which would make us the
second-biggest opera company in the States. And we are the only
major opera company that has that potential.'' &QL;

happens on the other side.'' she said. (Vejnoska, Atlanta

   CHINA-TRADE-EXPERTS (Undated) _ Intellectuals and others who
make up the American ``strategic class'' are suddenly focusing
their attention on China. Yet unlike traditional sinologists, who
have made a broad study of China's complex history and culture,
this new crop of experts are preoccupied with a much narrower
question: will China be our next enemy? Within the circumscribed
world of strategists, this sharpened approach is stirring bitter
debates over how to interpret China, while in the larger political
arena it is having an impact on pressing policy debates in
Washington, including next week's congressional vote on China's
trade status. By Kurt M. Campbell.

&HT;     HOMOSEXUAL DOCTOR SUES AIR FORCE OVER DISCHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They didn't ask, but John Hensala decided to
tell anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco resident believed that to serve in the Air
Force as a psychiatrist, he had to be honest about his
homosexuality, a decision that led to an honorable discharge in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years later, Hensala claims the military is
going against its own regulations, trying to recoup more than
$71,000 in scholarship funds from him even though he was more than
willing to stay in the service. Hensala sued the Air Force in
federal court on Thursday, seeking a judge's order that says he
doesn't have to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala, 35, may face some invasive questioning from Air Force
lawyers during depositions and a possible trial, but he said he
will never regret his decision to reveal that he is homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was very important from a psychological standpoint
to be open about my personal life to co-workers,'' Hensala said.
``I didn't want to be in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Chet Curtis, an Air Force spokesman, said he had not seen
the lawsuit and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala's lawyer, Steve Collier, said his client has faced a
financial ``witch hunt'' since he left the military, and claims
that Hensala did nothing to violate his contract with the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Collier said that under the law, the Air Force could have
demanded the funds back only if his client had committed
misconduct; refused to serve; engaged in homosexual acts; or made
the statement in an effort to escape service.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a court order restraining the Air Force from
collecting the scholarship funds, plus legal fees and costs.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Hensala entered into a ``health
professions scholarship contract'' with the military in 1986. It
meant the government provided money for school in exchange for
service in the Air Force Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala, who earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford
University, had his tuition and expenses paid by the Air Force when
he attended medical school at Northwestern University until 1990.
He also had a residency at Yale and a fellowship at the University
of California at San Francisco that the Air Force didn't subsidize.
</P>
<P>
   After attending summer training programs and two six-week
clerkships with the Air Force, Hensala was sent in 1995 to begin
active service as a psychiatrist at Scott Air Force Base near St.
Louis, an assignment that Hensala said he was willing to take.
</P>
<P>
   When he told his superiors about his sexuality, there was a
formal inquiry, including interviews with Hensala and several
witnesses. He received notice in February 1997 that he would be
honorably discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Hensala turned down an option for a hearing before an
administrative discharge board, the lawsuit states, deciding that
it would be futile.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that the Air Force ordered Hensala to pay
back the scholarship funds on Nov. 19, 1997, the day he was
formally discharged. Hensala petitioned to have the order
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   But in an Air Force administrative review, officials stated that
Hensala ``failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that
he was not a person who engaged in, attempted to engage in . . . or
intended to engage in homosexual actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials also suggested that he revealed his
homosexuality to get out of duty ``that he had agreed to perform in
return for the advanced educational assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force Board for Corrections of Military Records panel
agreed with the findings, and Hensala said he had no other remedy
except a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Collier said the lawsuit probably will not lead to any challenge
of the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, but both the
lawyer and Hensala said it highlights its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that people make a stand against a very
discriminatory policy,'' Hensala said. ``A lot of people were
looking forward to a change.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Last year was a horrible year to be a farmer. Demand
for American agricultural products dried up in Asia while, in
Europe, consumers began to object to genetically-modified American
legumes and grains. But wheat corn and soybeans were still produced
in huge quantities at home.
</P>
<P>
   As prices tumbled, farmers watched their debt soar. Many
teetered on the edge of ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the end of the spring planting season finds farmers
in remarkably good shape. First, the warm weather has allowed them
to get well ahead, and about 80 percent of the corn is emerging
already.
</P>
<P>
   Second, according to a recent survey of Midwestern farmers by
the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, 50 percent of them are reporting
average or above-average income, up from 12 percent in the middle
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   More farmers say they are repaying their loans. And prices for
cropland are rising: in Minnesota, up 4 percent from the last
quarter; in Montana, up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If these glowing numbers were the result of some shift in
economic conditions, they might be cause for jubilation. But they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors are keeping doom at bay for many small farms. The
first is off-farm income: according to the Agriculture Department,
almost 90 percent of the total income of rancher or farmer
households now comes from outside earnings.
</P>
<P>
   And the second factor is federal aid. Last year, the federal
government paid out some $22 billion to farmers, up from $16
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean farmers off
federal handouts. That act ended price supports for common crops
such as corn and wheat, encouraging farmers to switch instead to
more unusual plantings in response to market demand.
</P>
<P>
   But last year proved they were still relying on government money
in the form of emergency payments and loans, and this year will
probably prove it again.
</P>
<P>
   According to Neil Harl, an economist at Iowa State University,
agricultural exports will rise only marginally, to $50 billion,
this year; but farmers will still flood the market with wheat and
corn, assuming they will be helped out again by Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   A fair assumption. On April 13, Congress approved $7.1 billion
in extra help for farmers. This is, after all, an election year,
and most of that money will conveniently arrive in the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers might find Congress less kind when the pressure to
win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can count on
that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says Harl.
</P>
<P>
   If the government scales back support, farmers will have to find
other ways of surviving. Some will look abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department estimates an increase of some $2
billion in agricultural exports if China joins the World Trade
Organization. That would perk up farmers. Yet China's arrival as a
proper trading partner may not be unalloyed good news.
</P>
<P>
   Harl thinks the Chinese will also use freer trade to acquire
more advanced technology, so that they can harvest bigger and
better crops. ``What we're going to watch closely is how rapidly
they can ramp up their own internal agriculture output to meet
their needs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious farmers will also be looking for new ways to add value
to their products. Many are tempted to join producer-owned
cooperatives, where farmers can make higher profits by pooling
resources and cutting out middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   But Cenex Harvest States, America's largest farmer-owned
cooperative, recently reported a 71 percent fall in earnings in the
first half of its fiscal year _ the result, it claimed, of high oil
prices and continued weakness in agricultural markets.
</P>
<P>
   Supply-chain or contract agriculture, by which farmers supply
specific outlets or companies under strict growing and marketing
arrangements, has become widespread: in 1997, two-thirds of all
such contracts involved small farmers, but they accounted for only
27 percent of the total value of production.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in 1998 the National Commission on Small Farms found
that ``the setting of prices under near-monopoly conditions allows
the major processors and retailers of agricultural products to
capture an increased price spread, bankrupting farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, there is always the possibility of some sort
of supply shock this year. Subsoil and topsoil moisture in the
Plains states are well below the levels of last year, though recent
rains have improved things a little. Dry land means lower yields,
so those crops that struggle through should fetch a better price.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who can't bring in a sellable crop at all, there's
always that old standby: federal emergency assistance for farmers
who lose their crops to some unkindness of nature. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Never in the history of human wealth-creation has so
much been pocketed so quickly by so many.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now boasts 300 billionaires and 5 million
millionaires, with Silicon Valley adding 64 new millionaires every
day. Nine million Americans have household incomes above $100,000 a
year, up from just 2 million in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   If Great Britain was the first country to produce a mass middle
class, the United States is the first country to produce a mass
upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when politicians think, as they must, of courting the rich,
their first thoughts often turn to the smooth-turfed watering holes
where the rich used to gather when there were fewer of them.
</P>
<P>
   Country clubs have traditionally been places where affluent,
white (mostly Protestant) Americans could get together to play
golf, drink, eat mediocre food and casually discuss business.
</P>
<P>
   Talking politics was never polite, but, come election time, the
members would line up behind Republican candidates, including that
consummate club member, George Bush, Sr.
</P>
<P>
   But George W. would be wise not to take this group for granted.
He may have solid country-club credentials and even a decent golf
swing, but America's country-club Republicans are not the
dependable political force they once were
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the country clubs have changed. Wealthy young
Americans are not queuing up to join as their fathers did; many
would rather spend what little spare time they have at a health
club.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of those who do join are more diverse. ``People like
me _ Jewish females _ can now join,'' says Jennifer Laszlo-Mizrahi,
a political strategist. And people like her vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But that misses the larger point: that America's economic elite,
wherever one may find them and whatever they may look like, have
become increasingly detached from the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The National journal, analyzing voting patterns in 100 of
America's wealthiest towns over the past five presidential
elections, found that the Democratic share of the vote increased
steadily from 25 percent in 1980 to 41 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bill Clinton carried 13 of the 17 richest congressional
districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy voters who would once have been country-club Republicans
are turning up in the Democratic Leadership Council, says Mrs.
Laszlo-Mizrahi. Indeed, Jesse Jackson has referred to the DLC, the
conservative wing of the Democratic Party, as the ``Democratic
Leisure Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are an increasing number of wealthy Americans defecting to
the Democrats? One reason, according to ``Bobos in Paradise,'' a
new book by David Brooks, a senior editor at the Weekly Standard,
is that the new rich feel more in sympathy with them.
</P>
<P>
   These nouveaux-millionaires, he writes, have found a way ``to be
both dippy hippies and multinational fat cats''; hence all those
hiking boots and biking shorts in the corridors of corporate power.
</P>
<P>
   In general, too, the Democratic Party scares the rich much less
than it used to. Bill Clinton's lasting contribution to the
political scene has been to convince voters that the Democrats are
no longer the party of redistribution, says Bill Kristol, the
editor of the Weekly Standard.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may disagree over how much credit Clinton deserves for
the boom, but most will concede that he has not messed it up.
``Their stock portfolios did better under Clinton than they did
under Reagan,'' says Mrs. Laszlo-Mizrahi.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful explanation for shifting country-club
allegiances lies with the Republican Party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not your father's country club any more, and it's not
your father's Republican Party either,'' says Marshall Wittmann of
the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have let in a lot of people who would have been
blackballed at the country club. The party has become more Southern
(as the Democrats embraced civil rights), more working class (as
Ronald Reagan broadened the party's appeal) and more driven by
social issues (as abortion and gay rights energized the religious
right).
</P>
<P>
   Kristol notes that 1994 was the first election in which going to
church, rather than having wealth and flaunting it, was a better
indicator of whether or not someone would vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Country-club Republicans care about pocketbook issues, not
social crusades. They may snigger at a gay joke on the golf course,
but they would never ride a bus across the country to protest
against gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They favor free trade (unless they work in an industry
threatened by cheap foreign imports), have faith in international
institutions and produce the required corporate guff in favor of
affirmative action. And they do not view government as the enemy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Pew Research Center for The People &AMP; The Press
found that 61 percent of moderate Republicans agreed with the
statement that ``government often does a better job than people
give it credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   An extraordinary 91 percent agreed that ``this country should do
whatever it takes to protect the environment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075 WORDS) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   These are all views at odds with the increasingly influential
blue-collar, populist wing of the Republican Party. As the National
journal noted in its assessment of party-hoppers, ``Culturally
speaking, the center of gravity in the party has shifted from the
country club to the stock-car track.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when rich Americans stick with the Republicans _ as most
still do _ the richest congressional districts produce some of the
only remaining moderate Republicans, says Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   He himself went on safari to the affluent Chicago suburb of
Winnetka to study this mysterious species, and concluded: ``To be
elected in Winnetka you have to demonstrate you are on the correct
side of the cultural divide that splits the GOP between the sane
moderates and the Bible-thumping crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder that Winnetka has been represented for 20 years by
John Porter, a Republican who is pro-choice, pro-gun-control and
has been endorsed by the Sierra Club. His replacement (for he is
now retiring, and the seat is hotly contested) may well be a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for George W. Bush and Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Rich voters are more up for grabs in this election than they
have ever been. The candidates have until November to persuade them
to vote like country-club Republicans or country-club Democrats.
And to perfect their golf swing at the same time, with luck. &QL;

sombre pall over Palestinians, wherever they are. But this time, in
the West Bank and Gaza, the violence was fuelled by other, more

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Country clubs have traditionally been places where
affluent, white (mostly Protestant) Americans could get together to
play golf, drink, eat mediocre food and casually discuss business.
Talking politics was never polite but, come election time, the
members would line up behind Republican candidates, including that
consummate club member, George Bush, Sr. But George W. Bush would
be wise not to take his father's group for granted. He may have
solid country-club credentials and even a decent golf swing, but
America's country-club Republicans are not the dependable political
force they once were. ``It's not your father's country club any
more, and it's not your father's Republican Party either,'' says
Marshall Wittmann of the Heritage Foundation. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 was supposed to wean
American farmers off federal handouts. That act ended price
supports for common crops such as corn and wheat, encouraging
farmers to switch instead to more unusual plantings in response to
market demand. But last year proved they were still relying on
government money in the form of emergency payments and loans, and
this year will probably prove it again. This is, after all, an
election year, and most of the money will conveniently arrive in
the autumn. But farmers might find Congress less kind when the
pressure to win friends is over. ``I am much less convinced we can
count on that kind of largesse next year and down the road,'' says
an Iowa State University economist. &QL;

seven-month-old government presides over an Indonesia that is far

  L.A. Opera's Hemmings 
to be feted at concert 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the many operatic luminaries who keep watch over Peter
Hemmings' office at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, there's one
prominent photo of a bespectacled, middle-age man sticking his
tongue out behind Hemmings' back.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings is laughing in the picture, probably because he's well
aware of what mischief his friend David Hockney _ artist, fellow
Englishman and sometime opera designer _ is up to. Having spent 43
years running orchestras and opera companies on three continents,
including the past 16 years with Los Angeles Opera, Hemmings seems
to have acquired a sixth sense of knowing when something big is
sneaking up on him: a promising young tenor, an about-to-be-hot
director like Julie Taymor or a business opportunity that may not
come round again.
</P>
<P>
   That instinct has well served the founding general director of
Los Angeles Opera (formerly L.A. Opera), who will retire next month
and return with his wife, Jane, to England, where four of the
couple's five children live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to retire,'' Hemmings, who turns 66 this
year, says over a midafternoon cup of coffee at his downtown
office. ``My wife and I have been traveling the world _ we've been
married for 38 years _ and we want to get back and be near our
children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving L.A., Hemmings will spend the next several weeks
being made much of. On Monday night, he'll be honored with a
celebratory concert and black-tie evening gala with a top ticket
price of $2,500 at which singers Placido Domingo, Jennifer Larmore,
Carol Vaness, Rodney Gilfry and others will perform. Actor Michael
York will emcee the event at the Dorothy Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spotlight that night will be squarely on Hemmings,
Domingo also will command much attention. In July, the superstar
Spanish tenor, who currently serves as Los Angeles Opera's
principal guest conductor and artistic adviser, will assume
Hemmings' creative duties when he takes over as the company's
artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings won't exactly be spending his golden years puttering
about in the garden _ though he admits he'll miss tending the
orchids at his Pasadena home. Recently appointed to the board of
directors of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, Britain's
premier opera venue, Hemmings has been asked to serve as a ``talent
scout'' in Europe. He also will continue pursuing the idea of
creating a small opera house in the English Midlands, near
Birmingham, ``which is a scheme I've worked on for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hemmings' old job will be split in half. Domingo, 59,
will add his L.A. artistic directorship to the similar post he
holds with Washington Opera, and will attempt to balance those
demands with his already groaning schedule of opera performances,
recording sessions and concert hall recitals. Ian White-Thomson, a
former Borax USA executive, will serve as the company's executive
director and chief financial overseer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hemmings was brought up in the European tradition of a
single, omnipresent hands-on opera manager who supervises every
aspect of the company, he recognizes that a charismatic figure like
Domingo will be able to attract new donors and subscribers,
particularly in this celebrity-driven town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as, 'There's only one way to run an
opera company,''' Hemmings says, ``and in recent years the
complications have grown greater: the involvement of the unions,
the need to charge very high prices and to do very substantial
fund-raising have all escalated in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that, in the end, the best fund-raising is done
by the person who is responsible for the artistic programming _ me,
at present, and Placido in the future. Because the people who give
big amounts of money want to be at one with the director of the
company. I'm not saying they interfere, but they like to feel that
they have the ear of the director of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings will leave behind an institution that in less than a
generation has gone from scratch to being one of the nation's
half-dozen largest opera companies. With a $22 million budget, a
subscriber base of around 17,000 and a schedule of eight
productions and more than 50 performances a year, Los Angeles Opera
belongs to what's generally considered the second tier of U.S.
opera companies behind New York's Metropolitan Opera, Chicago's
Lyric and San Francisco Opera _ all older by decades than upstart
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut production in September 1986 of Verdi's
``Otello,'' with Domingo in the title role, Los Angeles Opera has
attracted such esteemed directors as Andrei Serban, Peter Sellars
and Sir Peter Hall, and designers like Hockney, Gerald Scarfe and
Taymor, before her fame skyrocketed when Disney hired her to direct
``The Lion King.'' Besides its longstanding relationships with
established stars like Domingo and Vaness, under Hemmings Los
Angeles Opera has helped launch the careers of a number of young
performers through its resident artist program. One, Gilfry, will
close out the company's current season by starring in its June 3-17
production of ``Billy Budd,'' Benjamin Britten's adaptation of
Herman Melville's novella.
</P>
<P>
   What Los Angeles Opera is selling, Angelenos are buying in
record numbers. Paid attendance for the company's 1998-99 season
(the last for which complete figures are available) was a record
149,106, or 89.4 percent of capacity for the 3,086-seat Dorothy
Chandler. Subscription records also were set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the resident artist program, Hemmings, who has a
classics degree from Cambridge, sounds particularly proud of the
company's initiatives aimed at widening its local audience base,
such as the In-School Opera Program, which brings opera to more
than 22,000 L.A. County public school students each year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Achilles' heel, asserts Allan Ulrich, classical
music critic at the San Francisco Examiner, has been a lack of
consistently high-quality conductors and the absence of a musical
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of (Hemmings') problems is that he never found the
consistently fine musical leadership that a major house deserves,
and he knows this and we've talked about it,'' Ulrich says.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich also thinks the company's programming has grown more
conservative in the last few years, in part, he believes, because
Hemmings backed riskier productions early on, then found himself
facing budget shortfalls. Still, Ulrich cites the Hockney-designed
version of Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' a 1995 production of
Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' conducted by Los Angeles
Philharmonic musical director Esa-Pekka Salonen and a 1997
production of Monteverdi's ``The Return of Ulysses'' as recent
examples of strong work.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings acknowledges that ``our development was retarded in the
early part of the last decade'' due to factors like the 1992 civil
disturbance, the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and the recession
fueled by defense industry cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a difficult two or three years for everybody, and
especially for fund-raisers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Hemmings expects Los Angeles Opera will add a ninth opera to
its season before long, after the Los Angeles Philharmonic takes up
residence in the new Walt Disney Concert Hall, beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we can safely say that in the next 10 years we'll
be up to 10 operas and 100 performances, which would make us the
second-biggest opera company in the States. And we are the only
major opera company that has that potential.'' &QL;

   AUCTION-PARTIES (New York) _ With Sotheby's, Christie's and now
Phillips battling for supremacy in the auction world, the grueling
round of brunches, cocktails parties and dinners given over the
past two weeks to promote the firms' crucial multimillion dollar
May sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary artworks in New
York has left many art lovers reeling from social exhaustion. For
seasoned warriors in the cutthroat art world, attendance at such
events is often less a matter of making whoopee than determinedly
pursuing contacts, deals and artworks that are likely to slip out
of reach in one's absence. By Christopher Mason.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-HANDBAGS-FASHION (New York) _ Designers have pounced on a
new trend. Tod's, Lambertson Truex and Burberry are among a number
of companies that have recently introduced or plan to introduce
matched sets of handbags, meant for the woman who must have two.
``Women tend to use a larger bag for practicality, a smaller one
for fashion and social reasons,'' noted Richard Lambertson of
Lambertson Truex. ``We believe in merging the pair.'' By Ruth
LaFerla.

<P>
   SCANDINAVIAN-CHIC (New York) _ For some time now we've been in
the midst of some sort of Nordic intermezzo, stylewise. The
appetite for mid-century modern American furniture led, inevitably,
to a taste for the clean-lined Scandinavian designs of the same
era. Manhattan is full of 25-year-olds who burble passionately
about the Finnish master Alvar Aalto and his Danish contemporary
Hans Wegner, and there are entire stores and magazines devoted to
this new/old esthetic. It seems there's now an appetite for the
entire Scandinavian lifestyle. By Penelope Green.

<P>
   ASIAN-CELEBS (Undated) _ Just as Asian culture has penetrated
the worlds of cuisine, decorating and fashion in the past few years
(prayer-bead bracelet, anyone?), Asian-American women have emerged
as formidable, stylish figures. By Jennifer Tung.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-BOURDAIN (New York) _ Anthony Bourdain, who for eight
years has been the executive chef at Les Halles, has emerged as a
literary chef, as appreciated for quips as steak frites, a kind of
Clifford Odets with a mandoline. By Ginia Bellafante.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Plant vigor, Anne Raver says, depends
upon the functioning of mycorrhizae _ Latin word that translates to
``fungus-roots'' _ ad refers to the symbiotic associations between
fungi that colonize inside and outside of feeder roots. It's that
old you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours.

   HAPPINESS-INDEXES (Undted) _ Social scientists as well as
communities from Jacksonville to Honolulu are beginning to say,
``It's not just the economy, stupid.'' They are looking beyond
purely economic numbers _ at health and crime statistics, clear-air

   CHINA-TRADE-EXPERTS (Undated) _ Intellectuals and others who
make up the American ``strategic class'' are suddenly focusing
their attention on China. Yet unlike traditional sinologists, who
have made a broad study of China's complex history and culture,
this new crop of experts are preoccupied with a much narrower
question: will China be our next enemy? Within the circumscribed
world of strategists, this sharpened approach is stirring bitter
debates over how to interpret China, while in the larger political
arena it is having an impact on pressing policy debates in
Washington, including next week's congressional vote on China's

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is the only time you can strut buck naked for
miles across San Francisco and not find yourself wearing jailhouse
orange at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Examiner Bay to Breakers run, which will be held
Sunday, is famous for the goofy costumes its participants wear. But
each year a growing number of the race's 80,000-plus runners shed
their costumes and hit the road wearing nothing more than running
shoes, socks and, maybe, a baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Nude runners come from as far away as Australia and Algeria or
as close as Berkeley and Burlingame to participate in the race that
stretches 7.5 miles from one side of San Francisco to the other.
Some runners have said that the Bay to Breakers provided their
first nude, public experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running nude and unpunished across 8 miles through the streets
of a major city was something I had to try,'' said Mike Marinaci in
a posting on a Web site devoted to nude running.
</P>
<P>
   For 364 days of the year, public nudity in San Francisco is
against the law. But on race day the police tend to look the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public nudity is against the law. . . . But when you're
keeping track of 80,000 runners and another 50,000 people watching
them, we have other things to worry about first,'' said police
spokesman Sherman Ackerson. ``Our top goal is to make sure that
everyone there gets home safely. After that we trust our officers
to use their discretion in handling the situation appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 years ago, people began showing up in the race in the
barest of essentials, often in jock straps or thongs. But in the
mid-1980s an increasing number of men and women began jogging bare
or even painting decorations on their naked bodies. Some guys have
gone naked except for a rubber mask over their faces. The masks of
presidents have been popular, especially Nixon, Reagan and Clinton.
But Elvis is still king.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of running the Bay to Breakers in the buff has become
so popular that there is a Web site devoted to the
``Bare-2-Breakers'' race. The group responsible for the Web site
for years has given hats to nude runners, and on Sunday also will
give T-shirts to all naked finishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us something to wear home,'' wrote one participant in
an Internet posting that did not include a real name.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates put the number of nude runners in recent years from
100 to 300. (Shoes, socks and fanny packs don't count as clothing
on Bay to Breakers day).
</P>
<P>
   Most clothed runners take the show of skin in stride. Few
complaints have been received by city officials or race organizers.
</P>
<P>
   But one nasty letter last year got Mayor Willie Brown's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter was shocked, when, as the race got under way, a
big percentage of the participants had NO CLOTHES ON,'' Cleo
Clancey of Garden Valley, Idaho, wrote. ``She said one-third of the
runners were in this state of nakedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancey did not attend the race, but her daughter shared plenty
of tales with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter and a few other participants yelled to those NUDE
runners to `get some clothes on' and the nude people yelled back,
`get some clothes off,''' Clancey wrote in the May 28, 1999,
letter.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor wrote back that ``less than 100'' of the estimated
80,000 runners were unclad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For generations a small number of participants have run the
course unclothed,'' Brown wrote in his Aug. 4 letter to Clancey.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a police standpoint actual arrests present
complications,'' Brown wrote. ``First, they must have a complaint
from someone offended by public nudity.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, he added, it is difficult to line up an unclothed
runner, a complainant and police officer amid thousands of race
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he wrote, any attempt to enforce the city's public
nudity laws during the race would detract from the Police
Department's traffic management duties.
</P>
<P>
   The only recorded police hassle was in 1997 and did not result
in an arrest. It happened when a naked runner separated from his
pack to use a Port-a-Potty. The police singled him out, telling him
public nudity was illegal. The police didn't arrest him, but the
runner wasn't allowed to finish the race.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medically, there are few recorded problems from running without
clothing or support.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just need to exercise common sense,'' said Dr. Steve
Bretz, an attending physician at San Francisco General Hospital's
emergency room. ``If it's sunny, you should liberally apply
sunscreen to those areas that are normally unexposed.''
</P>
<P>
   For women, the doctor offers this advice: exercise without a bra
before embarking on the 7-mile jaunt.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Bare-2-Breakers assure men that their anatomy
will survive undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how floppy you are, nature takes care of male
genitals during exercise by tightening the scrotum,'' the Web site
advises. ``The ancient Greeks and Native Americans engaged in
competitive sport without clothing or injury.''
</P>
<P>
   But the naked runners face injuring their vanity.
</P>
<P>
   The last couple of years, people began chanting ``Viagra!
Viagra!'' at the sight of naked men. Another year, a group of women
raised numbered signs rating the naked guys as they passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are always really fat and ugly,'' said Crisicq Loya,
of Daly City, who has run or walked in five of the past eight Bay
to Breakers races. ``I have never seen an attractive man running
naked here before. . . . The good-looking ones are more modest.''

<P>
   Facing an invasion? Posting a line of guards along your border
is a good idea. That's exactly what Canadian health authorities are
doing _ except their sentries will be chickens, dispatched to the
country's southern border to serve as an early warning system in
case West Nile virus moves up from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although West Nile virus mainly infects birds, it can be
transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Infected people _ especially
the elderly _ occasionally develop encephalitis. Last summer, the
virus struck New York City, making 46 people ill and eventually
killing seven, and as a result, the city spent an estimated $10
million on controlling mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   No human infections have been reported since last summer, but
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in
March that the virus had been found in mosquitoes wintering in New
York. So a new outbreak may yet occur this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus probably traveled to New York in an imported exotic
bird. Although the virus has yet to move north to Canada, the
Canadian health authorities plan to catch it in the act if it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be putting out sentinel chicken coops from
Saskatchewan to Atlantic Canada,'' says Harvey Artsob, chief of
zoonotic diseases at Health Canada's Laboratory Center for Disease
Control, Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   There will only be a few chicken coops in each province, so the
sentinel chickens will be thinly spread along about 2500 kilometers
of border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big country,'' Artsob says.
</P>
<P>
   Because the virus doesn't cause any symptoms in chickens, the
sentinels will be tested once a week for a viral antibody. Dead
birds found in the wild will also be tested. &QL;

   A new type of CD or DVD that is part prerecorded and part blank,
ready for recording, will soon be hitting the shops. Devised by
Kodak, the discs will let you add your own snippets to commercially
recorded audio, video or games discs, and will allow short runs of
customized CDs to be made more cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak likens the discs to a programmable read-only memory (PROM)
chip, and is calling them CD-PROMs or DVD-PROMs.
</P>
<P>
   At present, it is very expensive to make small numbers of
customized CDs or DVDs, as the whole of each disc has to be
individually recorded onto a blank. Making a stamper to press short
runs is even pricier.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's new discs could change all that. The stampers used to
press them transfer whatever sound, video or computer data is
common to all the discs. At the same time it presses a plain spiral
groove into the remaining blank part of the disc, which is then
coated with a light-sensitive cyanine dye.
</P>
<P>
   Customized sections can then be recorded relatively quickly onto
the blank spiral groove, to produce a disc sporting a mix of
pressed and recorded data that plays like an all-pressed disc.
Alternatively, the dyed area can be left blank for home recording
on a personal computer or CD recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will let people update the content of an optical disc
without cluttering the hard disc on their PC. The update then
travels with the removable disc,'' comments Emil Dudeck, director
of optical disc technology at Technicolor. ``It's a nice idea if
the cost can be kept down.''  &QL;

<P>
   Dams on the River Rhone in Switzerland are threatening to turn
the crystal waters of Lake Geneva into a deoxygenated, weed-covered
dead zone, say researchers at the University of Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 40 years, engineers have built nine large
hydroelectric dams on the tributaries of the Upper Rhone, the main
source of water for the lake _ the shoreline of which is known as
the Swiss Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been to disrupt the seasonal flow of the river.
The dams capture the peak summer flows from melting snow and
glaciers, and release the stored water through turbines during the
winter to provide electricity. Crucially, the dams have eliminated
the summer floods that were once a feature of the river and which
generated currents that brought badly needed supplies of dissolved
oxygen into the otherwise stagnant depths.
</P>
<P>
   Now biologists Jean-Luc Loizeau and Janusz Dominik have
calculated the impact of the dams on the lake. They have found that
the average number of days when flows into the lake are high enough
to generate these density currents has fallen from 55 a year to 15.
As a result, they say, the lake bottom is being starved of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   This deoxygenation could soon have unwelcome consequences at the
surface, Loizeau says. Lake Geneva contains a lot of phosphorus
locked up harmlessly in its sediments. But it is only held in place
by ``a barrier of oxidized sediments where the sediment meets the
water,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This barrier is maintained by oxygen in the bottom layers of the
lake's water. Lose this deep-water oxygen, Loizeau says, and the
barrier is breached, allowing phosphorus to pour up into the lake.
This over-fertilizes the water and sparks a process called
eutrophication, where algae form smelly toxic tides which suffocate
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for the whole lake for there to be a minimum
of 4 to 5 milligrams of oxygen per liter of water in the lake's
bottom,'' Loizeau says.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less and there will be a release of phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible, even probable that this is happening now, but
we are not yet sure,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, the phosphorus will trigger the growth of plankton,
which will, in turn, consume more oxygen and allow even more
phosphorus to escape. The net result could be a runaway breakdown
of the lake's chemical health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a feedback loop,'' Loizeau says. &QL;

   In the wake of the Love Bug virus attack, computer scientists
are warning that future viruses aimed at intelligent mobile phones
and personal digital assistants (PDAs) may be even worse. They
could record your conversations and forward them to others, delete
money from electronic wallets or rack up huge telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``These viruses could spread rapidly in future,'' predicts David
Chess, an antivirus researcher at IBM's T. J. Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Computer viruses attack devices that are programmable, and
spread when there is some link between one device and another.
Early viruses spread mainly via infected discs handed from user to
user. Today the main avenue of infection is by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes viruses a threat is that we're so well
connected,'' says Charles Palmer, a specialist in network security
and cryptography research at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests there is a huge potential for viruses to spread
via future programmable mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   In current and next-generation phones, and in PDAs, designers
have several ways to prevent virus damage. First, they can limit
the devices' programmability, leaving them without the capacity to
run viruses. Current phones already fall into this category _ but
future generations will be much more capable.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to store important programs in read-only
memory so that a virus cannot overwrite them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drawback then is that the phone cannot be upgraded,'' says
Edward Felton, a computer scientist at the Secure Internet
Programming Laboratory at Princeton University in N.J. And this
strategy cannot protect data that the user adds, as it must be
stored in a writable memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A virus that changes your mom's number to a premium-rate
number in Nigeria could rack up huge bills,'' Palmer says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is possible to ensure that a phone's built-in
programs are separate, so that one program cannot start another. If
the virus cannot dial out, it cannot spread.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say there is huge pressure on cellphone
designers to add functions, and that this will increase the chances
of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody sends you a telephone number by e-mail, you want
to be able to click on that number to dial it,'' says Avi Ruben, a
specialist in Internet security at the AT&AMP;T Laboratories in Florham
Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are prototypes in development that allow
this kind of threat,'' Felton adds.
</P>
<P>
   When e-mail attachments can trigger other applications, they
could dial out, start recording software for personal surveillance,
or wipe out the contents of files such as electronic wallets.
</P>
<P>
   However, Charles Davies, chief technology officer for the
British PDA maker Psion, argues that this scenario is unlikely, at
least for devices that run the widely used EPOC operating system,
which he helped to design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to seem smug or complacent but I just don't see
it as a big threat,'' Davies says.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer sees the way forward in mathematical proofs that show
whether a system is secure, and calls for more research into the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only choice we have in the long run,'' Palmer says. &QL;

&HT;     DNA USED TO COUNT GRIZZLY BEARS IN GLACIER PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Mont. _ Clever scientists have come up
with a new grizzly bear census in Glacier National Park by using
DNA in bear hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new technique, the bear counters estimate that
there are 332 grizzlies in the park, located in northwestern
Montana. By comparison, a 1970 census based on bear sightings came
up with an estimate of 200 bears in the park.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by Katherine Kendall, an ecologist and bear
researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey, designed hair traps
that lured the elusive grizzlies with sweet-smelling liquid
concoctions of rotten fish and cattle blood that had been brewed
for weeks in warm 55-gallon barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists then poured some of the gunk on piles of rotting
logs and surrounded each site with strands of barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the source of that irresistible aroma, the bears had
to cross the barbed wire that snagged small pieces of their fur.
Kendall and her colleagues then recovered the fur snippets and
produced a who's who of grizzlies, based on the fur's DNA and the
DNA in scat _ bear feces _ found at the 331 traps in the
1.2-million-acre park. Dr. Lisette Waits performed the analyses of
the genetic material in the nucleus of the bear cells at the
University of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall noted that conducting a grizzly census by DNA was
cheaper and less disruptive to the bear population than previous
ways of counting bears through live capture and the use of radio
collars and aerial tracking.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies once roamed most of the North American continent, but
habitat destruction and conflicts with humans have reduced their
range by 99 percent in the lower 48 states. Researchers estimate
there now are fewer than 1,000 grizzly bears south of the U.S.
Canadian border.

TWO SIDES TO `WONDERLAND' PROTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The broadcast networks introduced next season's prime-time
lineups this week amid the usual pronouncements about how network
TV is in better shape today than those of us media folk who analyze
it for a living would have you believe. Looking at the preliminary
schedules, and having an idea of which shows are being considered
to replace those that are certain to fail, it's clear that a lack
of invention and fear of risk continue to play large roles in
network TV decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's heartbreaking when ambitious series like Peter
Berg's ``Wonderland'' aren't even allowed a full gallop out of the
starting gate. We knew ``Wonderland'' would not show up on ABC's
schedule since the network axed the drama, set in a mental ward of
a big city hospital, after two episodes earlier this year. No
growth potential was the reason.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote, and rather harshly, that the network was weak-kneed and
pathetic in its decision to discard the series, and that a ratings
excuse wasn't good enough for a show that so clearly needed time to
take root.
</P>
<P>
   Criticisms from mental health organizations that ``Wonderland''
unfairly portrayed the mentally ill as violent is what doomed the
series, especially when advertisers began to bail.
</P>
<P>
   I watched four episodes of the series and noticed a balance that
would give viewers a much better insight into the world of not only
the mentally ill but also the people who work with them. Based on
that, I refuse to back down from that point.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has long been the network that took risks in picking up
pilots others would not, such as ``Nothing Sacred,'' about a
liberal Roman Catholic priest, and ``Cracker,'' about a
psychologist who helped the police solve crimes. And it's also been
the network that caves in to pressure from protest groups. Some
Catholics figured a priest who sees the gray areas of any kind in
religious doctrine ought not be a priest, and psychology
associations complained that the lead in ``Cracker'' drank too
much, gambled too much and was an adulterer.
</P>
<P>
   But an e-mail came in recently from Katherine Garivay that
should be shared. Under the subject of ``Wonderland _ Been There?''
Katherine said I didn't have the whole picture, and she proceeded
to paint it for me.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that if it were not for protests, there would
still be segregation, society would have made no accommodations for
physical disabilities, and women who are victims of spousal abuse
would have no safe place to go.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote back in agreement on that point.
</P>
<P>
   She went on:
</P>
<P>
   ``True, the public needs educating, clarification, and
understanding when it comes to persons who are sick with mental
illness,'' she wrote. ``And, yes, there are those who jump at every
mention of a negative portrayal of any affliction. Usually, you
would find that those consumers are the caregivers, family members,
or friends or someone who has a similar misfortune. When someone
reacts from the heart, they can be impulsive and not completely
objective when there poses a threat, real or implied.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the advocacy of the mentally ill is a real and difficult
battle. There is much misinformation in the real world. There is a
real need for those who speak up and make noise because there are
children who suffer from the same illnesses. Children, not just
adults. Children are the minority of the mentally ill. Would you
care to see a child, in the interest of a pet project, portrayed in
such a manner? These children grow up and become adults. They will
be the future.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to urge me and other critics to be careful of
endorsing projects that not only offend but also disseminate
information that, down the line, could be harmful, if that
information is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As for mental health in particular, she wrote: ``I am presuming
that you have been blessed by not having a serious mental illness
plaguing someone you care about. I think you would certainly be
more objective and not so harsh in your criticism. You have to live
it to believe it. I have.''

INOCULATE YOUR COMPUTER AGAINST VIRUSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: After reading about the ``Love Bug'' virus,
I've been afraid to open any e-mail attachments. Is there some way
to tell which ones are safe?
</P>
<P>
   _ Loveless
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOVELESS: You know what ticks me off? That a bunch of
little four-eyed cockroaches without social lives can intimidate
anyone into even asking that question.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet used to thrive on cooperation and trust, and
because of that, it was a special, idyllic place. Turns out it's
just like the rest of the world, though, susceptible to the lowest
urges that motivate our pathetic little species. Some pinhead with
no conscience wants to validate his existence, so he finds a way to
mess with everybody's e-mail and wreak computer chaos for a week,
all so he can brag about it to the rest of the zeros he hangs out
with. We're all so impressed. Gee, can we be like you?
</P>
<P>
   Virulent as it was, the sad part about the ``Love Bug'' outbreak
is that it appears to have been written by a real bonehead _ or
group of boneheads _ with no sense of style or even the
intelligence to cover his _ or their _ tracks. The virus code was a
Windows script, a list of tasks for a computer to complete, in a
language close enough to regular English that even nonprogrammers
could get a clue what it was meant to do. Oh, and cleverly included
in the script were things like nicknames, e-mail addresses and lots
of other smoking guns, all pointing to the dweebs who thought this
little stunt was so funny.
</P>
<P>
   If you know what you're doing, the code is easy to extract
without infecting your computer. Any decent e-mail program will
display the name of an attachment without actually extracting it.
Because Windows depends on a filename extension to know what to do
with the file, you can tell which kinds of files to dump.
</P>
<P>
   If the file has a .VBS or .JS extension, delete it. It's a
script, you don't know what it does and you don't want to find out.
It executes when you open it.
</P>
<P>
   If you see an .EXE or .COM or .BAT, be very wary. These are all
extensions that Windows will attempt to execute. The file could be
harmless, but unless you know for sure, dump it.
</P>
<P>
   You also need to be suspicious about documents created by any
application program that has a script language, and that includes
all the stuff in Microsoft Office. A virus writer can create an
Excel or Word file that launches a destructive script when it's
opened. The newest versions of the programs warn users that a
script is about to execute, but that doesn't always stop them from
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, please buy a good anti-virus program like McAfee or
Norton, and keep it up-to-date. These guys release virus signature
updates at least monthly, and they burn the midnight oil to come up
with overnight fixes for new viruses like the Love Bug. You might
also download a free copy of ZoneAlarm (www.zonealarm.com), a
personal firewall program that now includes a defense against
script viruses.

<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: When are you going to put together a book of
your weekly columns? Your advice is the most competent available.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DEAR DE: Whoops! Somehow I got Heloise's mail.

   ``These sites offer phony documents of shockingly high
quality,'' said K. Lee Blalack II, staff director of the Senate
permanent subcommittee on investigations. ``The distribution of
these counterfeit materials is growing because of the expanding
technology of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Blalack led a five-month investigation to find out how to get ID
documents that could be used for criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers passed out copies of phony documents that put the face
of Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who chairs the Senate
subcommittee, on a U.S. Army Reserve identification card, a
Connecticut driver's license and a Boston University student ID
card. The selection of fake IDs, created in the basement of the
Russell Senate Office Building, cost about $50 to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, for a fee, the operator of a Web site allows Internet
users to download programs or buy software that will print driver's
licenses, birth certificates, immigration cards, job certificates
and school transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   One site, for example, promised that its Fake ID Kit version 2.0
would provide ``college diplomas, new birth certificates, green
cards, Social Security cards, updated drivers licenses, plus
more!'' And all for just $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   While selling fake legal documents is against the law, the sites
often dodge
</P>
<P>
   that issue by labeling the documents ``novelties'' or
``souvenirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fake IDs are nothing new, especially to college students with a
thirst, but the Internet offers counterfeiters a high-speed,
low-cost way to entice customers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the subcommittee could not determine precisely how many
counterfeit documents are being used to commit crimes, David C.
Myers, identification fraud coordinator for Florida's Division of
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, said that about 30 percent of the
phony IDs he sees now come from Web sites, up from 1 percent two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that some false-ID sites have received more than
10,000 inquiries on a single day, and that a single ID seller can
generate more than $1 million a year in income.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said more police training on how to spot fake IDs would
help. But stopping fake documents will be difficult because sellers
can operate from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one exhibit showed a Web page containing this
announcement: ``We have moved our Web site to the UK but continue
to process orders for our clients from around the world. ... In the
next few months, we expect to be shut down again but we will bound
back as always from another part of the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins suggested that lawmakers may need to create tougher
penalties for making and using fraudulent documents, which now
range from three to 25 years in prison, depending on the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Brian Stafford, director of the U.S. Secret Service, said he
doubted new laws could keep ahead of the Net-based vendors. A
better approach, he said, would be to spend more money on the
research needed to improve ways to identify people based on
immutable physical characteristics, such as fingerprints and
patterns in the eye's irises.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: It's official. Hillary Rodham Clinton is the
New York Democratic Party's choice to run for the U.S. Senate
against ... against whom?
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's long-presumed opponent, New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, dropped out of the race to deal with his recently
revealed prostate cancer and marital problems. Which leaves Hillary
in a quandary, seeing as how she spent months gearing up for a
no-holds-barred battle with Giuliani and now will have to take on
someone entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just hope that whoever runs against her is up to the task.
America wants _ needs _ a break from the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   RUDY GIULIANI: I was hoping _ lots of Americans were hoping _
that he would run. He might have been the Republicans' only hope to
keep Clinton out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you can certainly understand Giuliani's
decision. His personal problems are daunting enough without taking
on a long, tiring and sure-to-be unspeakably nasty political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: The president was on the scene Tuesday night,
basking in reflected glory as his wife accepted the Senate
nomination in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted that the president is here,'' Hillary said. ``I
am so grateful for his support. I would not be standing here
tonight were it not for Bill and were it not for all he has done
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a happy couple. Seeing them together sort of makes you warm
all over, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ROSIE O'DONNELL: If you were offended by O'Donnell's rude
treatment of Tom Selleck on her TV talk show and/or repulsed by her
hopelessly unfunny stint as host of the Grammy awards, then you had
to be horrified by her shrill and obnoxious performance as
ringmaster for the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   But there's good news for Joan Rivers: She is hereby relieved of
her long-held designation as the most annoying woman in show
business. Rosie makes Joan look like Miss Congeniality.
</P>
<P>
   ELIAN GONZALEZ: Now the anti-Castro zealots in Miami are
throwing a fit because the 6-year-old Cuban kid was photographed
wearing a blue scarf around his neck _ supposedly proving that he
is being brainwashed by Fidel Castro's operatives while awaiting
the outcome of a court case that could clear the way for him to
return to Cuba with his father. Cuban officials said that the scarf
is part of the school uniform worn by Cuban kids and has nothing to
do with brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said that Eli n's wardrobe is none of America's
business.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: The Republican presidential nominee-to-be is
moving up in the polls, burning up the TV interview circuit and
coming up with some new policy initiative every few days or so. Is
the Texas governor on a roll or what?
</P>
<P>
   It's a long time from May to November, yet Bush seems to be
gaining momentum at a rate that could carry him right through
Election Day. But Bush backers should beware: The further ahead he
gets, the meaner his opponent will get.
</P>
<P>
   AL GORE: I used to like this guy. Even before Bill Clinton
tabbed Gore as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate back in
1992, I wrote a column urging Slick Willie to choose the
then-senator from Tennessee as his running mate. It may have been
the last time I agreed with Clinton on anything.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's close association with Clinton, however, seems to have
turned the vice president into an unprincipled worm who will say
and do anything to get ahead. Maybe this will work with some
voters, but I'm guessing that after nearly eight years of
Clintonism, most Americans have had it up to here with that brand
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY KNIGHT: The Indiana basketball coach is a jerk, no doubt
about it. But don't some of these big-time college athletes need
somebody to grab them by the throat once in a while?
</P>

 &HT;    SALE OF FAKE IDENTIFICATION BURGEONING ON THE INTERNET

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From teenagers trying to buy beer to sophisticated
criminals trying to defraud banks, thousands of Americans are
turning to the Internet to obtain fake driver's licenses, birth
certificates and other identification documents.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts at a Senate hearing Friday, computer-savvy
con artists are getting better by the day at churning out
authentic-looking IDs from Internet sites with names such as
fakeid.net and fakeids.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites offer phony documents of shockingly high
quality,'' said K. Lee Blalack II, staff director of the Senate
permanent subcommittee on investigations. ``The distribution of
these counterfeit materials is growing because of the expanding
technology of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>

documents that could be used for criminal activities.

Connecticut driver's license and a Boston University student ID
card. The selection of fake IDs, created in the basement of the

   TRADE-DEFICIT-CHINA (Washington) _ Democratic Reps. David Bonior

<P>
   CHINA-TRADE-SPLIT (Washington) _ As the China trade bill nears a

<P>
   When I ordered 13 heirloom roses last fall, I vowed that I would
prepare the rose beds before winter, working in plenty of compost
and some aged manure to give those shrubs and climbers a good
start.
</P>
<P>
   Did I accomplish this noble goal? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   My roses arrived two weeks ago, 13 slender little plants with
fragile leaves, sticking out of long tubular plastic pots. So I
stuck them in the vegetable garden, which has a nice, crumbly feel
after 15 years of compost and plenty of earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   Then I decided to study what is really going on beneath the
surface. If I could picture all those transactions between bacteria
and fungi, protozoa, nematodes, micro-arthropods _ the interactions
called the soil food web _ I might work more on feeding my soil. A
friend told me about a good Web site, www.soilfoodweb.com, which
explains the basic biology in articles and links to other sites
while providing images of the key players in this process.
</P>
<P>
   Plant vigor, I'm learning, depends upon mycorrhizae (a Latin
word meaning fungus roots) and refers to the symbiotic associations
between fungi that colonize inside and outside of feeder roots.
</P>
<P>
   It's that old you-scratch-my-back-and-I'll-scratch-yours. In
healthy soil, a naturally occurring fungi called
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM, for short), colonize the
cells of a plant's feeder roots. In exchange for carbohydrates made
by the plant during photosynthesis, these fungi bring phosphorus,
other minerals and water from the soil to the root. They also
protect the roots from root-rot fungi and parasitic nematodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plant is like the feudal warlord,'' said Dr. Elaine
Ingham, a soil scientist at Oregon State University in Corvallis.
``It puts out the protein and carbohydrates to feed all the
warriors to protect it against all those bad guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria, as well as fungi, swarm around those plant roots,
slurping up the sugars. The bacteria, which are high in protein,
are a feast for protozoa and beneficial nematodes. They convert the
protein into nitrogen, which can then be used by plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria and fungi also break down woody tissues, stems, leaves
and the dead roots of plants, turning them into nutrients for
somebody in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why good gardening comes down to compost, compost,
compost.
</P>
<P>
   Ingham runs a company called Soil Foodweb Inc., which analyzes
soil and diseases for growers and helps them develop organic
systems. Like many microbiologists, she uses the expression food
web, rather than food chain, because the biochemical interactions
are not one continuous chain. A fine-tuned food web doesn't need
fertilizer, or even lime. Acidic soil usually occurs when the soil
is compacted and anaerobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add fertilizer to the soil, the plant will take up a
tiny bit of it, but if you don't have a lot of bacteria and fungi
to take up the rest, it will leach right out of the soil,'' Ingham
said. And who needs it, if you have a food web making everything
from soup to nuts.
</P>
<P>
   And another thing, she said. Don't rototill if you want good
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Good, crumbly soil is made out of aggregates of sand, silt and
clay particles held together by the gums and gels formed by
bacteria. Fungi, root hairs and roots bind these aggregates, and
the arthropods, insects and earthworms build the tiny rooms that
let air and water trickle through.
</P>
<P>
   Ingham paints a picture of what the grasslands in the central
valleys of California were like before the Europeans first came
with their plows in the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil was so rich, they could put seeds in and walk away,''
said Ingham, who has pored over the journals of those early
farmers. ``There were no insects, no diseases.'' Manure or compost
was unnecessary, because the symbiosis taking place in the soil
gave the plants everything they needed.
</P>
<P>
   The glory days lasted for more than a decade, before destructive
fungal disease and insect infestations became a problem. ``By
plowing and not adding residues back in, they were destroying the
food web, which wasn't holding on to nutrients or maintaining
disease suppression,'' Ingham said.
</P>
<P>
   By the post-World War II years, verticillium wilt a fungal
disease that attacks everything from strawberries to string beans,
was threatening crop productivity. And though farmers used stronger
and stronger chemicals, the fungi just developed stronger
resistance. And now, methyl bromide, ``which basically sterilizes
everything,'' Ingham said, is used before every planting of
strawberries and other crops in commercial fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's every bit as toxic as arsenic,'' said Ingham, who has
been working with strawberry growers in San Luis Obispo, north of
Los Angeles, to switch to more organic methods. ``But methyl
bromide doesn't kill the root-feeding nematodes that can go down
eight feet.'' It doesn't kill pathogens, either, she said, which
can go dormant and germinate later from spores.
</P>
<P>
   And since there are no beneficial organisms left in this soil,
it's essentially dead. Chemical fertilizers must be added for those
strawberries to grow, and there is nothing to keep the nitrates
from leaching into the water table.
</P>
<P>
   These soils have ``less than a half a percent of organic
matter,'' Ingham said. A hundred years ago, they had 8 percent to
14 percent. What do we have left? Sand, that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ingham basically uses compost to rebuild these degraded soils.
To help growers envision what to aim for, she measured life teeming
in soil taken from a protected area in the Santa Maria Valley, near
San Luis Obispo. In a single teaspoon of soil she found 600 million
bacteria; ``a couple of miles of fungal hyfea,'' she said,
referring to their microscopic threads; 10,000 protozoa; 30
beneficial nematodes; and too many other organisms to recount here.
</P>
<P>
   So don't throw that banana peel in the trash. Put it in your
compost pile. Your roses, and everything else, will thank you.

&HT;     TEARS OF SADNESS FOR A WINNING JOCKEY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ One of the great sensory experiences of racing is
turning for home in the Kentucky Derby with the wind in your face
and the wall of sound rolling like thunder from the throats of
150,000 fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux lives for the moment when the sound washes over
him.
</P>
<P>
   It often wakes him in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Others have compared this tidal wave to a religious experience.
It charges the body with electrical waves, triggering a long rush
of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys such as Desormeaux have been so overcome by the
sensation that they cry like babies when they reach the wire at
Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   When Fusaichi Pegasus roared to victory two weeks ago with
Desormeaux in the pilot's seat, tiny rivers formed on the jockey's
face.
</P>
<P>
   But these were not tears of joy. These were tears for a
14-month-old son who only weeks earlier had been diagnosed as being
totally deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated when I heard the news,'' Desormeaux said. ``I
mean, what can you say about the depression that me and my wife
feel? My son will not be able to hear so many things, and it kills
me that he couldn't hear the cheering at Churchill.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux paused and studied the tops of his shoes. ``Hopefully
he will be able to feel the roar of the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   From the day that Jake Desormeaux was born five weeks premature,
Sonia and Kent Desormeaux suspected that his hearing was impaired.
He wouldn't respond to voices _ only to the stomping of a foot on
the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   But they clung to threads of hope until an examination was
conducted the Monday following Desormeaux's overwhelming victory
aboard Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial, the colt's final
tune-up for the Triple Crown series.
</P>
<P>
   The couple started to sob at the doctor's office. That is when
9-year-old Josh Desormeaux tapped his mother on the leg and said,
``It's OK, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux, like most jockeys, is accustomed to heartbreak and
pain. He plays the only sport in which the participants are
followed by an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a game that will walk on you when you're down.
</P>
<P>
   One day you are winning the Kentucky Derby, and the next you
watch as trainers turn and walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Pimlico, Desormeaux will take a second leap toward
greatness aboard that fire-breathing monster known as Fusaichi
Pegasus _ the winged horse of the Greek lore.
</P>
<P>
   People in Baltimore have already conceded the Preakness to this
fabulous 3-year-old, and if this happens, the racing community will
hold its collective breath until the June 6 Belmont Stakes, when
the final jewel in the crown is run.
</P>
<P>
   The Triple Crown has become the ghost of thoroughbred racing.
Twenty-two years without a Kentucky-Preakness-Belmont parlay is the
second longest gap in racing history _ the longest drought coming
between Citation in 1948 and Secretariat in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   To know there were no Triple Crown winners in the '50s, '60s,
'80s and '90s is to understand the quiet desperation within this
industry.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the inner turmoil of Kent Desormeaux is to weigh
the pressure that has been dropped like barbells on his tiny
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five elite riders in United States, his life has been
anything but calm.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the bush tracks of South Louisiana, Cajun Country,
Desormeaux took off to Baltimore and in 1987 he led all jockeys
with 450 victories. Determined to test the deep water of the
Southern California circuit, he won several riding titles and he
set a national record in 1989 with 598 winners.
</P>
<P>
   But with the victories there was always the attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Dismounting, Desormeaux would scold trainers for not doing a
better job of preparing the horse. He was accused of not riding out
horses to the wire when he had no obvious chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, trainers became tired of the nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Desormeaux gladly accepted the mount on trainer
Bob Baffert's Real Quiet, and proceeded to win the first two legs
of the Triple Crown before losing by a nose at the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Baffert has turned his back on both the jockey and
his agent, citing Desormeaux's demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Baffert's cold shoulder was a hidden blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of riding Baffert's Captain Steve, he pilots the horse
America now embraces. And he embraces a new perspective on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothin' in life is good all of the time,'' Desormeaux said.
``In this business, the good times roll, and the bad times roll,
too. You just got to roll with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Desormeaux will carry the weight of the industry on
his back, and the sadness for a child in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely enough to inspire maturity within a man.

SAY SO LONG, DRAGON LADY AND CHINA DOLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
 By JENNIFER TUNG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Old Navy commercials shown during the Academy Awards in
March, a new spokeswoman was promoting the cheap, cheerful clothing
line: Lisa Ling, the 26-year-old co-host of ``The View'' on ABC.
Ling, wearing red capris and white T-shirt, said cheekily, ``A good
pair of shorts is hard to find, unless you know where to look.''
Behind her, a group of hunky young men sprinted by in cargo shorts.
</P>
<P>
   I was amazed. Not at the sexual innuendo but at the sight of a
young Chinese-American woman representing an enormous clothing
company, on national television, on Oscar night _ the ultimate
convergence of celebrity, glamour, and fashion. Suddenly Ling, with
her crisp looks and newscaster-like delivery, was a style icon.
</P>
<P>
   That might not sound like a big deal today, but I remember
seeing a very different Ling on television as a kid in the 1970s.
My sisters and I were in our family room watching a re-run of the
1967 James Bond movie, ``You Only Live Twice.'' One of the first
scenes takes place in Hong Kong, or more precisely, in a bed in
Hong Kong, where Agent 007 kisses a long-haired Chinese woman with
blunt bangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that Chinese girls taste different from all other
girls?'' he asks her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think Chinese girls bet-tuh, huh?'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not better, just different _ the way Peking duck is different
from Russian caviar, but I love them both,'' Bond says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dah-ling, I give you very best duck,'' Ling says.
</P>
<P>
   Then she jumps out of bed right before two men with machine guns
burst in and riddle Bond with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's Ling was the amalgam of almost every Chinese female
stereotype: a submissive sex nymph speaking in breathy, broken
English, and a calculating dragon lady. (If she'd leapt out of bed
and into a lab coat and thick glasses, the cliche would have been
complete.) She is also the only representation of Asian women in
film or television that I remember from my childhood _ aside from
the ``ancient Chinese secret'' laundry lady in the Calgon
commercials. At the time, I didn't know enough to be angry or
offended. I was just embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   But lately there has been an Asian population explosion in the
pop culture landscape. In Hollywood, there's a new kind of A-list
that includes Asian It Girls like Ming-Wa, Bai Ling, Michelle Yeoh
and Lucy Liu. Beaming from a billboard in Times Square is CoCo Lee,
the Hong Kong-born, San Francisco-bred singer whose first United
States album, ``Just No Other Way'' was released two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an Asian style invasion: Vera Wang, the
fashion designer, on the cover of Town &AMP; Country this winter, Ahn
Duong, the artist, on the cover of Banana Republic's new catalog
just last week. Fashion models like Devon Aoki and Ling are
fixtures on the runways. Asian faces are even infiltrating society
pages. The actress China Chow and the Visionaire editor Cecilia
Dean are downtown scenesters who appear regularly in Vogue's party
pictures. W magazine's May issue alone features a profile of Wendy
Deng discussing the Asia Society and marriage to Rupert Murdoch, a
story about Hong Kong-born Grace Leo Andrieu, owner of the
celebrity-studded Hotel Lancaster in London, as well as a 12-page
swimsuit portfolio starring Aoki.
</P>
<P>
   But if Asian women are busting out of the China doll
stereotypes, their new image does tend to borrow some of the old
cliches. They may no longer be mousy math whizzes but they're still
brainy. Clawed dragon ladies might be out but style queens with
sharp tongues and sharp wardrobes are very in. ``We're never
portrayed as bimbos,'' said the Malaysian-born designer Yeohlee.
``It's because of our flat chests.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they aren't physical. On screen, Asian women
often combine sexiness and action heroism with unusual ease, like
Michelle Yeoh, the actress whose long glossy hair flies as she
leaps tall buildings in the Jackie Chan movies. Lucy Liu, the
acerbic Ling Woo on ``Ally McBeal,'' will be a kickboxing cop in
the film version of ``Charlie's Angels'' in November alongside Drew
Barrymore and Cameron Diaz. (It's somehow harder to imagine the
neurotic Calista Flockhart chasing down bad guys with a gun.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite such new cool roles, the effort to create a hip identity
that can include Asian-ness rather than try to hide it is still
pretty new and often self conscious. When I met Lisa Ling at an
event for Nutrisse home hair-coloring products two months ago, she
said: ``What I try to convey to other Asians with my sense of style
is that we can defy the stereotypes that we are submissive and not
gregarious. We don't have to conform. I can be obnoxious and
blunt.'' As if to prove her point, Ling added, ``So many Asians are
label whores. Have you noticed that?''
</P>
<P>
   But even Ling's bravado only set in a few years ago. ``I hated
being Chinese as a kid!'' recalled Ling, who was born in
California. ``I was teased mercilessly. I went to public school,
and the kids called me `Risa Ring.' Kids would come over to my
house, and it would smell like Chinese food, and that was
embarrassing. Or if I had friends over, my dad would say, `Tell
them to go home' in Chinese, right in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded vigorously in agreement, remembering the time a
classmate of my younger sister's came over after school, smelled
rice cooking and asked if we had pet gerbils. My sister explained
the odor by saying that our heating system was broken.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always clear growing up in Albuquerque, how to bridge
the divide between my Chinese heritage and my desire to fit in with
the tall, tanned set at the tennis club. My parents, a scientist
and a classical pianist, spoke Cantonese to each other, and to us,
when we were small. In our house, high style was my grandmother
wearing a cheongsam and singing Chinese opera as we kids padded
around the house in our embroidered Chinese pajamas with frog
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   But away from home, being Asian could be nerve-racking. My white
and Hispanic classmates flattened their noses with their fingers to
mock my wide features. When we had to line up by height I was
always shortest and last. My beauty ideals were the blond models in
Seventeen and in the ads for Ocean Pacific, the Southern California
clothing company. When Madonna hit the charts, I wore crucifixes,
black lace gloves and rubber bracelets up to my elbows. My New Wave
phase followed: head shaved on the sides, dyed orange hair forced
skyward with gel and diluted glue.
</P>
<P>
   If only I had had a role model like Margaret Yang, the quirky
high-school girl in last year's film, ``Rushmore,'' who played rock
guitar, acted in avant-garde school plays and got the boy in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden embrace of Asian women and culture?
</P>
<P>
   The designer Vivienne Tam, who was raised in Hong Kong (and
whose style guide ``China Chic'' will be published in September by
ReganBooks), links it to the new global economy and the opening up
of Asia. ``When Hong Kong went back to China in 1997, I think there
was more awareness around the world of Asian culture,'' she said on
the phone from her Seventh Avenue office. ``And then Prada and Miu
Miu started the whole chinoiserie trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe Eng, the author of ``Warrior Lessons: An Asian American
Woman's Journey into Power'' (Pocket Books), said its not the rest
of the world but Asian women themselves who have changed. ``We are
the crop of daughters who finally had choices,'' Eng, 37, said.
``We didn't have the same sense of duty and boundness of our
mothers, so we took our own paths and went into acting, comedy and
entertainment. The number of Asian women entering FIT and Parsons
is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eng also pointed out that Asians are not only fashion forward
but their ethnicity is integral to their style. ``You see lots of
15-year-olds wearing Hello Kitty and chinoiserie,'' she said. ``And
older Asian women have an androgynous look, and that is what makes
the look sensuous. We used to think of Asian models as chiseled and
Eurasian-looking, now some have very small eyes, and others have
square jaws. Anything goes.''

`DINOSAUR' HATCHES EXPRESSIVE, REALISTIC CHARACTERS `ON LOCATION'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not every day that you see an animated movie conclude with
a ``filmed on location'' credit, much less one that lists more than
a dozen locations on three continents. Yet that's the type of
realism that the makers of the new movie ``Dinosaur'' were after.
Location filming was done in Australia, the United States and South
America, then computer-generated models were placed seamlessly into
the live settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an animation standpoint, there are a few issues with
(doing this),'' says Michael Belzer, one of the supervising
animators on the film, which opened Friday in wide release. ``But
the primary one is that you as an audience see live action. (And
when) you put a computer-animated character within that, all of a
sudden you raise the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' has indeed raised the bar. Although you can quibble
about the lack of originality in the film's story _ an orphan
dinosaur's life journey, including an Exodus-like trek with other
dinos to find an elusive paradise _ it's hard not to be amazed by
the movie's animation, which not only incorporates live-action
backgrounds but also presents what may be the most expressive
characters in animation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us first became aware of the movie when its stunning,
wordless five-minute preview _ a short film in itself _ screened
before showings of ``Toy Story 2'' last fall. But the movie has
been in the works, in one form or another, for a dozen years.
Director Paul Verhoeven and effects whiz Phil Tippett were among
the first people connected to the project, back in 1988. When they
couldn't bring it to fruition, it made its way to Disney, where
work began about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Belzer, who was the supervising animator on a character named
Baylene, was one of the late-comers to the project _ he spent 2 1/2
years on it. Baylene is the largest character in the film, a
dignified, aged brachiosaur voiced by Joan Plowright. Although
Baylene is a computer creation, Belzer refers to her weight (70
tons) and height (70 feet) as if she were a real, living creature.
To him, she is _ and he made her so.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to dinosaurs, of course, size matters. So an
important part of the animators' efforts involved matching the
movements of their virtual creations with the actual size and
weight of the dinosaurs that once roamed the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started by going to paleontologists, finding out about the
bone structure (of dinosaurs), how these creatures really moved and
existed,'' Belzer says. ``And on top of that we would say, `OK, we
got the basic material, let's put in the artistic license, have
some fun with it and put the character in with all of that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The research also involved visiting zoos and having animals
brought to the set. The movie's animators learned about dinosaur
movements from ostriches, hippopotamuses and Komodo dragons (which
influenced another Belzer-supervised character, a puppylike
ankylosaur named Url). Belzer's own crew studied elephants to learn
about brachiosaur movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught us a lot, not just in terms of motion, but really
what the skin was doing,'' Belzer says. ``The body structure of an
elephant is very similar to that of a brachiosaur. So we were able
to look at the pillarlike shape of the legs, and as the foot came
down, realize that inertia doesn't so much go north and south, but
it's more of a rotational inertia. We tried to incorporate a lot of
these principles into the muscles and skin of the brachiosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those principles come into play in one of the movie's
most dramatic scenes (warning: mild spoiler ahead). The dinosaur
herd, moving across a vast desert in search of their paradisical
``nesting grounds,'' cross a ridge only to discover more desert.
Their intractable leader sends strong dinos in search of water,
leaving behind Baylene and other misfits befriended by Aladar, the
movie's hero. Aladar discovers, however, that water is not far
below the surface of the desert, and with the help of Baylene's
tremendous foot pressing down on the sand, he dredges up enough
water to quench the thirst of the herd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty tough scene, because it had to do with a lot
of different elements,'' Belzer says. ``Basically, they constructed
a set here in Burbank on a stage (and had) sand (brought in). They
had a (tank) of water set underneath the hole that Baylene's foot
presses down into.''
</P>
<P>
   The water was then pumped in to where Baylene's foot was
supposed to be. But, because the character's foot was a
computer-graphic model, adjustments had to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a hard-cast, half-size sculpture was made of Baylene's foot
that was rigged to actually push down into the sand,'' Belzer says.
``It wouldn't move; it was just a hard, static piece. But that
allowed the water to actually come up onto the shape of a foot. So
we used that as a template or reference for our animation to go on
top of.''
</P>
<P>
   Belzer, who worked on the Tim Burton-produced stop-motion
features ``The Nightmare Before Christmas'' and ``James and the
Giant Peach,'' wasn't just a late-comer to ``Dinosaur'' _ he was a
late-comer to computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was resistant to the computer for a long time,'' he says,
adding that the tide turned when he took a job at Pixar Animation
Studios, the brains behind ``Toy Story'' and ``A Bug's Life.'' ``It
gave me my first taste of the computer. I really embraced it with
the help of Pixar. I think they really helped me appreciate that
it's nothing to be scared of, it's just opening up a new venue.''
</P>
<P>
   Belzer believes that computer-animation is the right medium for
``Dinosaur,'' which originally was planned as a
puppetry/stop-motion film. The computer allows the freedom to
accurately depict the huge creatures, which have inspired
filmmakers _ especially animators _ almost since the beginning of
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's just animators (who are fascinated by
dinosaurs),'' Belzer says. ``It's the public in general. I think
there's a genuine fascination with these giant things that used to
roam the earth. That's what draws the question of, `How would these
things move?' When I stood under a skeleton of a brachiosaur, I
realized at that time, `This is the character I'm working on? My
God, it's huge!' ''

MUSIC FOR NOTHING? FREE NAPSTER DOWNLOADS DIVIDE BANDS, FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February, when Texas Christian University administrators
decided to block their Web-surfing students from entering a site
called Napster, they did so because the site was causing the
campus' computers to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   So many students were logging onto Napster to download MP3 files
_ electronic versions of songs _ that the computer's server kept
crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Upgraded hardware was eventually installed, lessening the
problem, but the Napster music-community site remains off-limits to
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to turn Napster back on, it wouldn't be a
(computer) problem,'' says Dave Edmondson, assistant provost for
the school's information service department. ``Now it's a copyright
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, a very big one.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, the controversy swirling around the
San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster and whether it infringes on
copyright laws has been the hot topic in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bands, record labels and music lovers are divided on the
subject. Napster supporters, such as Public Enemy singer Chuck D,
champion the site for offering artists without major-label deals or
radio play a chance to get heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the radio of the new millennium,'' the vocalist said
during an interview this year at the South by Southwest music and
media conference in Austin. ``So many artists don't get a chance to
be on the radio or MTV, or be on a major label. This is how they
get heard. Why would you wanna deny them that?''
</P>
<P>
   For young people like Jennifer Cooper, an 18-year-old TCU
freshman, it's a dream come true. ``I've stopped buying CDs now
because of Napster and MP3s,'' she says. ``Who wants to pay for
music when you can get it for free?''
</P>
<P>
   Napster critics say, however, that the site breaks copyright
laws. When users download songs onto either their hard drive or a
CD, they get the song, but the artist doesn't get any money.
Critics liken it to walking into a music store and stealing a
record.
</P>
<P>
   That's why artists such as Metallica, which sued Napster in
April, and rap star Dr. Dre have started a campaign against
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's suit has gone to extremes: The group members
recently delivered to the court the names of 335,000 people whom
the band accuses of illegally obtaining its songs through the site.
Band drummer Lars Ulrich personally wheeled in the 60,000 pages of
text. The group released a statement saying the alleged violations
of its music were logged by a computer consulting firm, NetPD.
</P>
<P>
   Through various chat rooms and message boards, an ever-growing
circle of Metallica fans has trashed the band's legal actions. On
Napster's Web site, one fan wrote that the name of one of the
band's CDs, Master of Puppets, perfectly epitomized the metal
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Metallica versus the Internet,'' Ulrich said
in a statement on the band's Web site. ``We know that the Internet
is the future in terms of spreading your music to your fans, and
we're excited about that. But we want to control how that's done,
just like we've always controlled what we make.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because
it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that
they're going in this direction,'' Napster's founder, 19-year-old
Shawn Fanning, said in a statement. ``If we got the opportunity to
explain to the band why Napster exists and why fans enjoy Napster,
perhaps we could bring all of this to a peaceful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokeswoman Deborah Orr estimates the number of people
using Napster totals in the millions. Users simply log onto
Napster's site, do a search for a particular song and, when they
find another user who has it, trade one of their tracks for the one
they want. With the click of a mouse, the songs are either stored
on the computer's hard drives or transferred to CD via CD burners.
</P>
<P>
   Something else that's troubling the music industry: Sometimes,
Napster users get hold of material that hasn't been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to a friend and said, `Hey, you wanna copy of
our new record?''' Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas said in a
recent phone interview. ``And he was like, `Well, I've already
heard half of it.' He got it all off the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is ambivalent about Napster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a band that hasn't been as fortunate as us,
that's who it's good for. It gives them a chance to get heard,''
Thomas says. ``But for bands like us, it's like people are hearing
our stuff but we're not getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Durst of the immensely popular rap-metal act Limp Bizkit,
whose upcoming tour is being sponsored by Napster, says Napster's
the wave of the future, and his band's gonna ride it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could (not) care less about the older generation's need to
keep doing business as usual,'' he said at a news conference
announcing the launch of the tour, which will roll into the Bronco
Bowl in Dallas on July 22-23. ``We care more about what our fans
want, and our fans want music on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle will rage for months, until it is decided in the
courts. In the meantime, Napster is still up and running _ although
TCU has banned it _ and Cooper says she will keep downloading songs
wherever she can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure, it's not fair that they're (the artists) not
making any money off of it,'' she says. ``But it's not like the
music industry is morally right in the first place. I'm sorry, but
I don't agree with having to pay $18 for a new CD.''

IN THE YEAR 3000, TRAVOLTA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO LAUGHS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATTLEFIELD EARTH
</P>
<P>
   John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Sabine Karsenti
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Roger Christian
</P>
<P>
   PG-13, 117 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Remember Y2K? Now another millennium has flown by, and what's
left of mankind scampers around icy mountain crags, wearing scraps
of fur and hide and eating rats raw. In the year 3000 humans are
enslaved by 9-foot-tall aliens called Psychlos, after their planet,
who came and conquered all the Earth's peoples. It took them nine
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Humans are so traumatized they communicate in grunts while
slowly relearning all the old cliches. ``A good woman is hard to
find,'' someone says. Actually any woman is hard to find, save the
lithe and smoldering Chrissie (Karsenti), who is around to be
paired with the bounding hero of the piece, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler
(Pepper).
</P>
<P>
   Jonnie would defy the oppressors. They want the earth's gold,
these Psychlos, who are none too natty themselves in outfits that
put one in mind of Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion in ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' Their chief of security, Terl, runs the show. Despite the
simian hairdo and ludicrous nose apparatus, Terl occasionally
reminds one of Travolta. Anyway, the movie frequently is so murky
that it is hard to tell who is who or what is what.
</P>
<P>
   The gist seems to be that if Jonnie can race over here to do
this and then rush over there to do that, the Psychlos will be sent
packing. At that Terl just throws back his maned head and emits
phony roars of laughter (not Travolta's strongest vocal suit).
</P>
<P>
   Then the humans hop into some thousand-year-old jet fighters as
if they were in ``Independence Day.'' A huge glass dome cracks and
shatters, which is bad for the Psychlos. Terl ends up in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Psychlos bat Earthlings around and subsequent warfare
results in moderately graphic injuries and death.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Some musings, but no sex to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A small amount.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE: This is an amazingly bad movie adapted from a novel by
L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology. Since
Travolta is dedicated to that belief, it has been conjectured that
the film is intended to push moviegoers in that direction, perhaps
with subliminal messages. Considering its overall ineptitude, that
is hard to imagine. Is it a trick?
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 9: Much too loud and violent for the little ones.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12: Absurd twaddle that few would take seriously, and no
great harm will be done.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP: It's their money.
</P>
<P>
   GLADIATOR
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed,
Richard Harris
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Ridley Scott
</P>
<P>
   R, 150 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The Romans always could lay on a battle, and we begin with
legions led by the general Maximus (Crowe) performing their
catapult-and-pike routine on a mob of howling tribesmen in the
forests of Germania. Arriving late as usual by plushly appointed
carriage, the emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix), and his scheming
sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), pay their respects to their father,
Marcus Aurelius (Harris), and give a wary nod to the general.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is unease in the command tent. With his son an
unbalanced weakling, the elderly emperor plans to pass power to
Maximus, who would really prefer to go home and tend his fields and
be with his wife and young son. But the frail and dying Aurelius
needs him to effect a major shift of authority from the throne to
the Senate. Rome is to become a republic again.
</P>
<P>
   Commodus is not comfortable with that idea. In short order his
father has gone to his end even more quickly than his condition
indicated. Maximus is taken off to be executed but escapes. Not so
lucky, his wife and son are crucified and burned alive by
Praetorians dispatched by Commodus. When next we encounter the
grief-stricken general, he has been sold to a gladiator merchant
(Reed) and sent to a training camp in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Invincible on the battlefield, Maximus butchers all comers in
the ring and is soon ready for the big time in Rome. After
decimating half an army in the Colosseum, he becomes a hero of the
people. But how does he stand with Commodus?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Those who are about to die salute you, and that's just
about everybody. Decapitations, mutilations _ even a tiger gets his
in the ring, stabbed in the belly.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None, though gladiators could be excused a
four-letter outburst or two.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12: Forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-13: An individual parental decision. Until the end, when
the melodrama and digital enhancement go over the top, the film is
an entertaining experience. But then there is the violence.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: Undoubtedly most of them (boys anyway) have
already seen the film. On balance, a thumb's up.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER STAGE
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt, Peter Gallagher,
Ethan Stiefel, Donna Murphy, Sascha Radetsky, Eion Bailey, Ilia
Kulik
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Nicholas Hytner
</P>
<P>
   PG-13, 113 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Culled from stiff auditions, the teen-age dancers come to New
York to train at the American Ballet Academy and vie for a chance
to join the American Ballet Co. This crop includes Jody (Schull)
with a lovely face but a weak turn-out, bad feet and the wrong kind
of body; Maureen (Pratt), supremely talented but bulimic and
miserable; and Eva (Saldana), also gifted, but with a possibly
ruinous attitude problem. Sergei (Kulik) is from Russia and in
clubs tells girls he is Mafia, not a ballet dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan (Gallagher), the duly arrogant academy director, drives
them hard. Three boys and three girls will be chosen for the
company, with the decision to be announced after a workshop
performance before a packed house at Lincoln Center. Pressure? It's
enough to make Maureen buckle and run off to her calm, funny,
Columbia pre-med boyfriend (Bailey). After a lot of abuse, Jody
thinks she might be a better Broadway dancer.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal note she weighs the attentions of Cooper
(Stiefel), an established company star, and a classmate (Radetsky).
Eventually the three resolve the matter before an audience of
thousands in a number choreographed for the workshop by the
flamboyant Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   In a film that doesn't devote much effort to inventing original
characters and situations, careers and relationships take shape _
or don't _ strictly according to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: The dancing gets risque and Jody and Cooper go to bed,
though the act goes unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Some.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7: Too young.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10: Parents should make a cautious judgment, but most
children will enjoy the film.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP: The film's formulaic approach may annoy some
viewers. Otherwise they should have fun.

THE TELLTALE CHEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 21)  
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Screaming orders (``Calamari followed by filet
poivre! Am I waiting for a frisee?'') to his coterie of beloved
line cooks at Les Halles as he neared the end of his 13-hour day at
9 p.m. on Thursday, Anthony Bourdain was interrupted from his work
by diners darting in to shake his calloused hand.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Bourdain has emerged as a literary chef, as
appreciated for quips as steak frites, a kind of Clifford Odets
with a mandoline. Last year, after nearly three decades of
monitoring 30-quart stockpots, searing meat and, too often, his own
fingers, Anthony Bourdain decided that the world might want to know
how grizzly things can get around a Garland stove.
</P>
<P>
   Bourdain, who for eight years has been the executive chef at Les
Halles on Park Avenue South, sent an unsolicited article about
restaurant deceptions to The New Yorker, and to his surprise, the
magazine's editor, David Remnick, called Bourdain at work to let
him know it had been accepted. When the article ran, it caught the
attention of a book editor at Bloomsbury USA, who persuaded the
chef to spin his blustery culinary decrees (``Margarine? That's not
food. I can't believe it's not butter? I can.'') into a book.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Kitchen Confidential,'' a 307-page memoir, which
has been optioned by David Fincher, who directed the movie ``Fight
Club,'' elevating Bourdain to a celebrity status chefs usually
achieve after marketing their sauce lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great meal,'' said one man who seemed to stand at about half
of Bourdain's lanky height. ``My wife had the scallops. My sister
had the tuna. My other sister had the tuna.'' Bourdain thanked the
diner, though compliments on fish dishes might not flatter a man
who presides over a restaurant known for its in-house butcher, and
who flushes with animation at the mention of tete du veau, the
arcane veal dish he describes as ``mashed up face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is heaven tonight,'' Bourdain said of the restaurant's
large but not overwhelming crowd. He was turning out a mere 180
dinners, 70 fewer than the average.
</P>
<P>
   Even truer heaven for Bourdain might be an evening when no one
asks him to violate one of his creations. An order for onion soup
came in with a request to ``torch and nuke it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask us to do some pretty ugly things to the food,'' he
said. ``But I don't throw plates anymore. I don't try to make
people cry anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10, Bourdain left the remainder of the night's duties to his
charges. Removing his chef's coat and topping his black acid-wash
Levis with a T-shirt and jacket, he walked to Chicama, a Peruvian
restaurant about 10 blocks away, where he convenes with other chefs
after hours to eat marinated fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want is the kind of food I've been cooking
all day,'' he said, somewhere between rants about his hatred of
vegetarians (``Vegetarians are the enemy of everything good and
decent in the human spirit,'' he writes in his book), the chef
Emeril Lagasse and the unseemly concept of brunch.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicama, Bourdain received no special treatment. Though no
other chefs could join him this evening, he sat down to ceviche
negro, sea urchin and mojitos.
</P>
<P>
   Bourdain has a contract to write two more nonfiction books, one
on Typhoid Mary and the other about a round-the world odyssey on
which he will consume demi-glace-free fare like monkey brains. As
much as he relishes the writing life before him, he said, smoking a
cigarette at the end of supper, it makes him insecure as turning
out cassoulet every day does not. ``Now I'm wondering, will people
like me?'' he said. ``Why hasn't my agent called?''

STAGGERING TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS ANEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 N.Y. Times.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foreign goods continued to pour into the U.S. in March at a
faster rate than exports poured out, widening the massive trade
deficit as the heady value of oil imports in March surged thanks to
a nine-year high in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit, a broad measure of the international trade behavior
of the U.S., showed that Americans imported a record $30.18 billion
more than they exported in March, the Commerce Department reported
Friday. That figure is up a sharp 5 percent from February's gap,
which was revised downward to $28.71 billion from the originally
reported $29.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The data came in slightly above many economists' estimates, and
highlighted the massive levels of consumer demand in the U.S. as
low unemployment, rising equities and rising wages have rendered
consumers confident to continue spending money at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trade gap widened, exports rose a solid 2.9
percent, indicating that the foreign demand for U.S. goods is
rising as overseas economies continue to rebound. Even though
aircraft _ which often exert a large influence on overall exports -
slumped due to a strike-related slowdown at Boeing (BA:NYSE),
overall exports rose solidly on strengthening overseas demand for
U.S. autos, computer parts, industrial machinery and farm products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, oil dominated the growth in the value of imports,
which rose 3.4 percent to $117.44 billion. The value of imported
crude oil rose to a record high of $7.6 billion as crude oil prices
reached a nine-year high in March at around $34 a barrel and
averaged $26.38 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, the trade deficit with China declined slightly to
$5.09 billion from $5.62 billion in February, while the deficit
with the European Union widened significantly to $5.66 billion from
$3.53 billion in February. The shortfall in trade with the ailing
Japanese economy widened to $6.82 billion from $6.73 billion the
prior month.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has frequently said that the fat trade
deficit is something of a thorn in the side of the record-long U.S.
economic expansion, voicing worries about the size of the deficit
and the imbalance between the supply side and the demand side of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   American's heavy reliance on foreign goods is also seen as
damaging because it in turn makes the U.S. dependent on inflows of
foreign capital through investments. If U.S. stock markets continue
to stagnate as they have in recent weeks, foreign investors might
get impatient and begin to pull money out of U.S. stocks and bonds,
which would lead to a weaker dollar and a heightened risk of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to slow economic growth and bring supply and
demand in the U.S. back to a sustainable level, the Fed has raised
interest rates six times over the past year. In theory, higher
rates slow growth and curb demand by making it more costly for
consumers and business to borrow and spend. But, as evidenced by
the persistent levels of the trade gap, the economy has had little
reaction to rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That has caused the Fed to get more serious about its efforts.
At its latest meeting on May 16, the Fed upped the magnitude of its
rate increase to 0.50 percentage point from the 0.25-point
increments of the previous five moves.

Cox staff and wire reports.)

<P>
   Rudy Giuliani ended his campaign for the Senate in New York
today, leaving Hillary Clinton temporarily without an opponent. The
decision, announced at a televised news conference, ended weeks of
speculation about his political future that was sparked by recent
disclosures of prostate cancer and a marital separation. The New
York mayor has said medical treatment might interfere with his
political campaign. With Giuliani out, it is thought that Rick
Lazio, a congressman from Long Island, will step in to run. Lazio
had been preparing for a Senate campaign until Gov. George Pataki
backed Giuliani in August.
</P>
<P>
   RETIREES CAN KEEP BUSY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush proposed incentives today to encourage older
Americans to volunteer, saying the nation should make better use of
``the healthiest, most energetic, best-educated generation of
seniors in history.'' Speaking at the McCracken County Senior
Center in Kentucky, Bush proposed a ``silver scholarship'' program
in which senior citizens would serve as tutors in after-school
programs in exchange for $1,000 educational scholarships. The money
could be used by the seniors' children, grandchildren or other
young people in need. Bush also said that if elected he would seek
an increase in funding for the Senior Service Corps from $183
million to $250 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   GORES SLIP AWAY TO MARK 30TH
</P>
<P>
   Al and Tipper Gore slipped out of town by Marine helicopter
today to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary at the Delaware
shore. Aides said the couple _ with a Secret Service detail, a
military aide and press aide in tow _ were borrowing the beach home
of campaign chairman Tony Coelho and would return to Washington on
Sunday. Gore recently promised campaign reporters, apparently
without consulting the missus, that they could accompany him on
vacation travels in a small press pool. White House aides notified
reporters of the trip just this afternoon _ after the Gores were on
their way.
</P>
<P>
   SAVE NEEDED IN VERMONT FOR MCCAIN TO MAKE A NOISE
</P>
<P>
   John McCain will be in Montpelier, Vt., Saturday to try to
salvage his ability to influence the party platform at the
convention. The Vermont Republican State Convention meets Saturday
to elect 12 delegates and 12 alternates. McCain won Vermont's
winner-take-all primary in March,
</P>
<P>
   65-35 percent, but it now appears that party regulars _
supporters of George W. Bush _ will win the majority of delegate
seats. Under party rules, someone can raise matters on the
convention floor only if the majorities of six state delegations
support the move. Vermont was one of seven states won by McCain.
After Bush forces seized the Michigan delegation, McCain controls
only five. He can't let Vermont slip away.
</P>
<P>
   CASTING A WIDE NET FOR A NO. 2
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush sent letters to 450 Republicans seeking advice on
a running mate. He also suggested in an interview that he would
accept someone who favors abortion rights _ within limits. ``I
assure you that your views and any advice you render will be kept
confidential,'' Bush wrote to senators, representatives, governors,
state GOP committee members, state party chairmen and
Bush-for-president committees. Separately, Bush was asked by Fox
News TV if he would consider teaming up with someone who, unlike
him, favors abortion rights. Bush said he'd consider Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Ridge, who supports his state's strict legislation on
abortion and favors a ban on late-term, ``partial-birth''
abortions. By contrast, New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman vetoed a
bill that would have banned the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   STICKING A WEDGE BETWEEN THE BROTHERS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign is trying to pit brother against brother in
the debate with George W. Bush over Social Security. It circulated
a column in which Florida Gov. Jeb Bush warns against letting all
of the state's pension funds ride on the stock market. Bush wrote
in the April 18 Tallahassee Democrat of his concern that state
workers' retirement money was at risk because stock market losses
had caused the Florida Retirement Fund to lose about $8 billion in
a week _ $4 billion in one day. Jeb Bush argued it would be prudent
to put part of the $12 billion pension surplus ``and place it in a
reserve that is not affected by changes in the market'' in order to
``cushion future volatility'' and assure long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSIDER ANGLING INSIDE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush likes to emphasize that he's a political outsider
from Texas, not a Washington insider. Increasingly, however, he's
making his opinions known on Capitol Hill, arguing that policy made
now could affect his presidency later. Joining with Republican
leaders and the Clinton administration this week, he urged Congress
to vote in favor of normal trade relations with China. He said he'd
make phone calls seeking support if House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
asked him. And through back channels, Bush also complained when
Congress was voting on setting a deadline for pulling U.S. troops
out of Kosovo. Bush and his foreign policy adviser, Condoleeza
Rice, warned lawmakers that such a deadline could limit his
flexibility if he wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT FOLLOWS `FELLOW TRAVELER', `PINKO'?
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party hopeful Pat Buchanan criticized George W. Bush for
supporting permanent normal trade relations with China, calling him
``a Clintonite fellow traveler.'' Buchanan, in a prepared
statement: ``Mr. Bush endorsed a Clinton trade policy that has
given Beijing $300 billion in trade surpluses since 1993, money
Beijing has used for the military buildup that now threatens Taiwan
and the U.S. 7th Fleet,'' Buchanan also condemned Bush for opposing
a bipartisan effort to set a date for withdrawal of U.S. troops
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   MOVING UPTOWN TO BIGGER DIGS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's national campaign headquarters is moving again _ to
Nashville's MetroCenter on June 10. It will give the campaign staff
about three times the space it now has as it gears up for the fall
campaign against George W. Bush. The operation has been
headquartered in tight quarters in a bargain-priced location since
the vice president uprooted it from Washington in October. ``We had
to really cut the budget, but the facility has been great for the
transition. It brought people together,'' said campaign chairman
Tony Coelho. Gore credits the move to Nashville for jump-starting a
primary campaign that was being bruised by a stronger than expected
challenge from Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL STEPS MISSING THE FOOTHOLD
</P>
<P>
   It was Al Gore's crowd in Orlando, Fla.: thousands of senior
citizens at the AARP convention. But among the crowd were people
such as Janet Mayhew, 69, who seemed to crystallize a concern
enveloping the Gore campaign: ``To me, Gore hasn't got a platform.
He has not said what he would do.'' Such reaction chills the Gore
campaign, which has spent more than a year distributing position
papers on nearly every imaginable topic. Clearly, Gore does have a
platform, but it is perceived by many voters as a status-quo,
preserve-the-prosperity campaign _ and the vice president is
finding that it may not be enough to win. His strategy has been to
put forward what he believes is a realistic, if less audacious,
agenda, while vowing not to take ``risky'' steps that could upset
the prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL POLLS PROVIDE THE CLUES
</P>
<P>
   Never mind those national polls that show George W. Bush
slightly ahead of Al Gore. The electoral system designed by the
founding fathers makes it almost impossible to predict November's
outcome by national polls alone since the battle is fought by
separate elections in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
The presidency is decided by who can put together 270 electoral
votes. Each state has a share of votes based on population, and
whoever wins a state claims all of its votes. But analysts say
national polls serve an important purpose by providing insight on
how candidates are doing with certain groups like women or
independents, on people's feelings about their personal qualities
and positions on issues, and by measuring broad movement.
</P>
<P>
   SO SIMILAR, YET SO DIFFERENT
</P>
<P>
   Here's one difference between Tipper Gore and Hillary Clinton.
At last weekend's Million Mom March for gun control, Clinton,
wearing a light spring pantsuit and straw hat, was so busy working
the crowds, she created rally gridlock. Fellow blonde baby boomer
Gore, with a white T-shirt tucked into blue jeans, marched arm in
arm with other women, without an entourage and relatively
unheralded. The two women's different styles at the march provided
a vivid contrast between their current approaches to their public
roles. The New York Times quoted one person who knows them both:
``Hillary went as a candidate; Tipper went as a mom.''
</P>
<P>
   A MAN CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan lost much of his social conservative base when he
bolted the GOP, and now has alienated many supporters of his
adopted Reform Party _ including some state leaders who prefer the
party run nobody and forfeit the $12.6 million in federal funding.
With Buchanan registering just 4 percent in the polls on the eve of
his self-imposed deadline to break into double digits, the Reform
Party seems headed for its worst presidential showing yet. Old
Buchanan supporters are leery of his embracing a party that shares
few of his views on abortion, homosexuality and other social
issues. And supporters of Reform Party founder Ross Perot are
concerned that he wants to take over and reshape their
organization.
</P>
<P>
   SOUND-ALIKE NAME GAME OVER
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Gebhardt, whose sound-alike primary challenge to
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri had Democrats in a
frustrated frenzy, dropped his candidacy. Gebhardt filed paperwork
withdrawing from the 3rd District primary and will not appear
alongside the veteran congressman on the Aug. 8 primary ballot. The
state GOP denied being behind the challenge, but GOP activists said
Gebhardt often attended Republican meetings in St. Charles County.
Gebhardt-with-a-B, 65, said his decision was ``doctor's orders.''
</P>
<P>
   UPHILL BATTLE IN FLAT STATE
</P>
<P>
   With a Presbyterian church as his backdrop, David Johnson, a
Democrat who serves as a policy adviser to Indiana Gov. Frank
O'Bannon, cast himself as a champion of Hoosier values in beginning
his campaign to unseat Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican seeking a
fifth term. Johnson declared it was ``time we have a new senator
who will put these values into action,'' as he stood outside the
Indianapolis church where his father was once pastor. It will be an
uphill battle for Johnson, who has raised $412,000 in
contributions. Lugar has amassed $2 million.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was so much good will blowing through the
Altman Building on West 18th Street the other day _ generated, in
part, by bottles of warm Carlsberg beer _ it hardly seemed like a
fashion show. ``Fashion Strikes Down From the North!'' the
invitation promised, in charming, Ikea-esque ``English is my second
language'' prose, beckoning you to a three-day exhibition of
fashion, food and design conceived by a magazine called Stockholm
New. ``Frontline Nordic Gastronomy! Blondes with Braids!''
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 on the night of May 10, the building was filled with
hundreds of men and women with terrific skin smoking cigarettes.
``All Swedish people know each other, and I believe they're all in
this room,'' said Johan Svensson, the art director of Jane
magazine, explaining the absence of Americans. ( Svensson is not
Swedish, although his wife, Maria Virgin, is. Virgin is the fashion
editor of Stockholm New, an English-language magazine of Swedish
fashion and design with a circulation of 53,000.)
</P>
<P>
   A forest of fake fir trees lurked just inside the door, guarding
a phalanx of five-inch-high Dalecarlian horses, the red-painted
wooden horses that are the Swedish mascot. Other Swedish symbols
were represented, too: a silver Volvo Cross Country; a display from
the cheap-chic retailer H&AMP;M featuring young Swedes in low-priced
leather; and beautiful furniture in pale wood and wool made by
contemporary Swedish designers, including a chair that looked like
a fat comma designed by Bjorn Dahlstrom for a company called Cbi.
</P>
<P>
   Short films played as a backdrop to the catwalk show: there were
clips of flames, of feathers floating in a river and, I think, of
tick larvae. The models drifted by in clothes by five designers.
Swedish furniture is smooth; Swedish fashion is rather furry.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, you could take plates of smoked salmon to tables
covered with a vintage Marimekko design (Melooni, in orange, blue
and black) that looked so right and so contemporary after all these
years, you felt you had to have it. Marimekko is a Finnish company,
but no matter; Nordic countries like to stick together.
</P>
<P>
   It was all very attractive and so familiar, because for some
time now we've been in the midst of some sort of Nordic intermezzo,
stylewise. The appetite for midcentury modern American furniture
led, inevitably, to a taste for the clean-lined Scandinavian
designs of the same era. Manhattan is full of 25-year-olds who
burble passionately about the Finnish master Alvar Aalto and his
Danish contemporary Hans Wegner, and there are entire stores, like
Totem on Franklin Street, and magazines (hello, Wallpaper), devoted
to this new/old aesthetic. It seems there's now an appetite for the
entire Scandinavian lifestyle, lock, stock and herring.
</P>
<P>
   May 22, the American Craft Museum will be the host of a seminar
on Swedish furniture design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be talking about the fact that Scandinavian design has
become a global phenomenon,'' David McFadden, chief curator at the
museum, said. ``Why? Because there's something so human about it.
Something spare and lean and wonderfully hopeful. It's that feeling
I like very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Brule, 31, and the editorial director of the
Nordic-worshiping Wallpaper, said, ``You could look at this whole
thing as part of a broader Nordic moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How did it start?'' he asked. ``You remember going to your
Auntie's house and she had all these weird Danish pieces, and then
it started to look really odd. In the 90's you wouldn't touch it,
but now it looks right. It's not made out of a gel, and it doesn't
have those scary spindly legs. It looks clean and maybe a little
bit honest. That's why people are still switched on to this
midcentury moment and by default great Scandinavian products. Look
at cell phones. Those countries are way ahead of us in terms of
cell phone penetration.''
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned to Brule the Marimekko tablecloths, how beautiful
they looked and how weird it is that something you once dismissed
as hopelessly retrograde could seem so fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a girl in our office who dresses in head-to-toe
Marimekko, and she looks fantastic,'' said Brule, who will be
spending the summer in his new '60s modern house outside of
Stockholm. ``You see the store in Stockholm, and it's so
progressive. And it makes Miu Miu look not particularly
progressive. If you go on to look at Swedish fashion design, you'll
see that it's not particularly tricky. I think a lot of fashion,
that's fashion with a capital `F,' has become very tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   At his store Moss, on Greene Street in SoHo, Murray Moss sells
the work of Pia Wallen, a contemporary designer, whose felt
slippers and wool blankets with a Swiss cross have become like
chocolates to people who can pronounce Arne Jacobsen properly.
(It's arn YAK-ob-sen, and Moss also sells his vintage stainless
steel flatware, which appeared in the movie ``2001: A Space
Odyssey.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from a lack in the diet,'' Moss said, using a
nutritional metaphor to explain the taste for all things
Scandinavian. ``You've had the gleaming stainless steel and
aluminum and techno fibers in fashion and techno music and all of a
sudden, the way you say, `Too much salt!' you say: `Where is the
humanity in all this? Where is something tactile? Where is
something fragile for God sakes!'''
</P>
<P>
   Moss says the essence of current Scandinavian style resides with
Droog Design, a Dutch collective with an intellectual bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scandinavian thing is a ripple effect,'' he said. ``Here's
Droog: you get the designer Hella Jongerius, and she shows a
carbon-fiber chair with this very raw felt that looks like a pelt
out of `King Lear' or something. It's from this company Not Tom,
Dick or Harry _ get it? _ and the woman whose company it is raises
sheep, she shears them herself and weaves the wool herself and
sells it to Hella, who incorporates this raw wool into her chair,
and the result is the hot-cold product. It's Baked Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if anything is a trend, that's an example of it,'' Moss
added triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   There were all kinds of hot-cold things at the Milan Furniture
Fair last month, like a steel cube chair by a Dutch partnership, Do
Create, which you warm up yourself by whacking with a sledgehammer
(included with the chair).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a cartoonish example of what we're talking about,''
Moss said. ``It's a not-subtle manifestation of the idea that now
we need to sense human interaction in design.''

 By RUTH LA FERLA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Pratique, always pratique.'' Announcing her credo
in a Gallic drone, Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, a freelance fashion
editor, was about to put it to the test. She reached into the
depths of her Hermes Birkin bag _ a high-capacity satchel that
could, in a pinch, hold her Yorkie _ and pulled out a minuscule
shoulder bag spattered with tawny LVs.
</P>
<P>
   Trim and flat as a postcard, it would see her through lunch. De
Dudzeele's second sack holds little more than a lipstick, a credit
card and a set of keys _just right for this professional vagabond,
whose day might take her from an office to a boutique in the Nolita
neighborhood of lower Manhattan to Seventh Avenue and back, ending
in a late-night dinner with friends. A woman who lives the maxim
``You can't be too streamlined or too thin,'' she reaches
reflexively for her Louis Vuitton Pochette whenever she heads for a
restaurant, leaving her tote at the office or the coat check.
</P>
<P>
   De Dudzeele, who has spent the better part of her career
obsessing over details of self-packaging, is at home with the
notion that a big bag packs power, while its smaller companion
carries a different sort of clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bag may be so small it barely holds a lipstick, but it's
definitely the status bag,'' said Laird Borrelli the co-author,
with Valerie Steele, of ``The Handbag: A Lexicon of Style''
(Rizzoli). The tote, by contrast, is usually more humble, Borrelli
pointed out. ``I think of the canvas L.L. Bean version carried by
Conde Nast editors,'' she said. ``Both together function as a
survival kit for the glamour puss.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Spade, the handbag designer, who personally subscribes to
the two-bag system, said: ``For a while, I think it was just people
in fashion who carried two bags. But now a lot of people have
picked up on the idea. It's a trend, absolutely. The small bag is
so prevalent now that you have to carry another bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers have pounced on the trend. Tod's, Lambertson Truex and
Burberry are among a number of companies that have recently
introduced or plan to introduce matched sets of handbags, meant for
the woman who must have two. ``Women tend to use a larger bag for
practicality, a smaller one for fashion and social reasons,'' noted
Richard Lambertson of Lambertson Truex. ``We believe in merging the
pair.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrelli said that the trimmer, daintier bag is the one with the
fancier provenance. ``It was associated way back with the
chatelaine of the castle,'' she said. ``Her servants did the
marketing. She was required to carry no more than embroidery tools,
a handkerchief and smelling salts.'' Placed on a lunch or dinner
table, the contemporary model becomes ``a bibelot,'' she added,
``part of a milieu and also part of the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women feel as she does that the compact style denotes
class. Marian Rivman, a New York public relations consultant,
stashes a small shoulder bag inside her satchel to pull out at
receptions and meetings. ``The Queen of England, you always see her
with a handkerchief and little purse, and she's not carrying a
dime,'' Rivman rationalized. ``A small bag means refinement. It
means you have your stuff together.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, it's sexy. ``Do you really want, in a room full
of men, to go fishing into your tote for a business card?'' Rivman
asked pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Beatty Adler, an art dealer and the vice president of
Richard Feigen &AMP; Co., finds her small bag liberating. She walks to
work each day with a shiny brown leather tote from Tod's. ``If
you're busy and have a lot of things on your plate, you carry it
around in the hope you might be able to get them done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But its weight and the burden of chores left undone sometimes
leaves her winded. ``I often feel like a donkey,'' she said. That's
where her second bag comes in. A medium-size fake Kelly, it makes
her feel like a sprite. ``Sometimes I feel it's my right not to be
burdened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As style watchers see it, the small bag is a badge of hip. ``It
reflects a woman who is definitely streamlining herself,'' said
Daniel Harris, who wrote ``The Content of Women's Purses,'' an
essay published in 1995 in Salmagundi, a literary magazine. ``You
can actually take it out on the dance floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast, the larger bag represents a stodgy matron with a
big dowdy purse that impedes her mobility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as such an image may be, it hasn't induced most
two-bag women to part with their thunderous totes. The reason,
Harris suggested, is that the large bag is an emblem of ``a woman's
migration from private life into public life,'' as a consequence of
which the bag functions as ``a surrogate home'' replete with items
more commonly found on desk tops and dressing tables, and even in
the kitchen sink (like a can opener).
</P>
<P>
   Adler, for one, views her large bag as a traveling survival kit.
It houses art magazines, auction catalogs, paperbacks for reading
in a cab, part of the contents of her lunch and her children's
hockey and lacrosse schedules. ``You never know,'' she said, ``when
you're going to get stuck in an elevator.''
</P>
<P>
   Marta Ibarrondo, a freelance advertising art director, said:
``Personally, I feel like I'm always traveling. I work in New York,
but on most days I carry as many things as when I'm in an airport _
cookies and sunflower seeds, nail polish, face cream _ you name
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are those who swim against the current. It takes a
leap of courage, but from time to time Irene Albright forsakes her
tote for something trimmer. The owner of Imelda's Closet, a fashion
rental business that caters to stylists, Albright believes in
rigorous editing. She has, accordingly, reduced the contents of her
purse to a small Filofax, a wallet, a compact and keys.
</P>
<P>
   Though she struggles to make less do more, she asks herself from
time to time if she's being realistic. ``Can I keep this up?'' she
asked. `` Who knows? One lives in hope.''

CHINA WATCHERS FIGHTING A TURF WAR OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By KURT M. CAMPBELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If business and political leaders have focused on China in
recent months, so have the intellectuals and others who make up the
American ``strategic class'' _ that collection of academics,
commentators and policy-makers whose ideas help define the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike traditional Sinologists, who have made a broad study
of China's complex history, intricate culture and social relations,
this new crop of experts are preoccupied with a much narrower
question: Will China be the next enemy?
</P>
<P>
   Within the circumscribed world of strategists, this approach is
stirring bitter debate over how to study and interpret China, while
in the larger political arena it is having an impact on pressing
policy debates in Washington, including next week's congressional
vote on China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   This week President Clinton said in a speech: ``One of the
biggest question marks of the 21st century is the path China will
take. Will China emerge as a partner or an adversary?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, American Sinologists are enjoying more attention as
Washington debates China's economic future and military intentions.
But with this popularity has come an erosion of their traditional
monopoly on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest and most high-profile China has been since
Tiananmen,'' said Bates Gill, a China scholar at the Brookings
Institution, referring to the 1989 student uprisings in Tiananmen
Square in Beijing. ``Business has never been better, in a sense,
but with the increasing attention has come greater political
polarization. China watching now can be a dangerous game, with
political minefields everywhere you step.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the newer crop of experts, who are much more likely to
have a background in strategic studies or international relations
than China itself, are generally much more suspicious, watchful for
signs of China's capacity for menace. They argue that the
traditional China hands practice a kind of intellectual
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
   The strategists believe they bring a fresh perspective and some
intellectual rigor into a world previously dominated by ``panda
huggers'' who had a romanticized view of China and played down the
United States' national security interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sinologists have been hit with two great shocks in the
last 20 years,'' said Philip D. Zelikow, the director of the Miller
Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, a Cold War
historian who concentrated on Europe when he worked at the National
Security Council. ``The first was the re-evaluation of Mao and the
brutality of Chinese communism that culminated at Tiananmen. The
early giants of the field, like John Fairbanks, were almost
uniformly blind to the harsh realities of communist rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The second shock, he continued, is the current struggle with the
strategists and the traditional foreign-policy elite ``to wrest
control of the formulation and execution of America's China policy
away from the Sinologists. The China specialists are losing their
monopoly to shape and interpret U.S.-China policy, because their
narrow range of expertise is increasingly inadequate to the task.
The Sinologists have practiced 100 variations on the theme of `you
don't understand China.' In some cases they are right, but in most
cases it doesn't matter. Broad-ranging policy expertise is more
critical in policy formulation toward China.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in Washington agree. A number of congressional staff
members, Republican politicians, conservative journalists, former
intelligence officers and a handful of academics have created a
loose coalition called the ``Blue Team'' to prepare the nation for
what they see as the coming conflagration with China. (The term
comes from a Chinese military exercise in which the assigned
opposition force _ presumably Taiwan supported by the United States
_ wears blue hats while the People's Liberation Army is in red.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, some traditional Sinologists share this threatening
view. Arthur Waldron, a professor of Chinese history and
international relations at the University of Pennsylvania, for
example, argues: ``There is a potent mix of xenophobic nationalism,
historical persecution and renewed authoritarianism that has been
stoked and manipulated by China's communist elite. They are
building more missiles and seeking to externalize their internal
problems .... But the motivations for war derive from a very
different set of origins than the motivations for economic
modernization. We underestimate, at our peril, China's capacity to
do us harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many other longtime China scholars counter that the new
band of strategists, largely ignorant of China's complex culture
and history, exaggerate Beijing's geopolitical ambitions and as yet
fledgling military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character assassination has been so rampant and policy
critiques so politicized that the normal rules of evidence ... have
been among the first casualties,'' said Robert S. Ross, professor
of political science and Chinese studies at Boston College.
``Particularly egregious have been many of the claims of those
neo-Cold Warriors ... to follow a policy of containing the China
threat.''
</P>
<P>
   To many China scholars, the strategists are suffering a Cold War
hangover. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the
foreign policy establishment has at times turned its attention to
post-Soviet nuclear cleanup, international terrorism, humanitarian
aid and the global economy. China, the Sinologists argue, is simply
the latest antidote to what one senior White House official
described as ``enemy envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the strategists concede that they now have a sense of
renewed purpose after a prolonged period of melancholy and
nostalgia. ``Strategists tend to get excited by the rise and fall
of great powers, and they see China as the new anti-hero,'' said
Jeff Legro, professor of government at the University of Virginia.
``And yes, there is more spring in the step since China's arrival
on the international power scene.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, China studies have grown hotter as interest in Russia
has cooled. Stephen Rosen, the director of the Olin Institute at
Harvard University, said: ``China's rise and other strategic
developments in Asia are very much on the horizon in the study of
international relations. There is a growing trend among our
graduate students and fellows to consider the big questions
associated with China, namely its strategic culture and
geopolitical mind-set. This is part of an important redirection of
intellectual effort away from Europe and toward Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   David Shambaugh, director of the China policy program at George
Washington University, said that there were no solid measures of
student interest, but added, ``My class on China's military power
is now oversubscribed, as are similar classes taught by my
colleagues at other universities around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several major foundations, including the Smith
Richardson, Bradley, Scaife and Olin foundations, have made sizable
grants to primarily conservative academics, policy think tanks and
universities in recent years to explore the strategic ramifications
of China's ascent.
</P>
<P>
   And over the last year, foreign-policy journals like The
National Interest, International Security and Survival have
featured extended debates on China's growing political and military
power.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this century, interpretations of China have been
buffeted by politics. A generation of China specialists at the
State Department in the 1950s were unfairly vilified during Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's public hearings into the question of ``Who Lost
China?'' Those political concerns are in some ways evident today.
</P>
<P>
   As Mitchell B. Reiss, the dean of international affairs at
William and Mary College, said: ``China has become a kind of
national Rorschach test for the United States onto which we project
our hopes and fears. China is seen by some as the world's largest
market for American goods, by others as a repressive regime that
violates human rights, by a dwindling minority as a strategic
partner, and by many strategists as a growing threat to U.S.
national security interests.''

<P>
   In 2000, volatility has turned into a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming steadily more variable over the last five years,
stock prices have reached new levels of instability this year. The
Nasdaq composite index now routinely rises or falls 3 percent in a
session. That used to be rare: Between 1971, when the Nasdaq was
created, and the end of 1997, there were only 40 days with moves of
3 percent or more. In 1998 and 1999, there were a total of 35. In
the 4{ months since Jan. 1, there have been 34.
</P>
<P>
   Many professional traders and money managers view the increased
volatility as an ominous sign, directly connected to the rise in
day trading. With trading costs falling, chat rooms spreading
rumors and securities markets fragmenting into competing electronic
networks, it is no wonder prices swing wildly, they say. And that
should worry even people who are not CNBC habitues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When intraday volatility is high, people lose confidence in
the meaning of price,'' said Robert Schwartz, professor of finance
at Baruch College.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a more benign explanation for the rise in
volatility, said Greg Duffee, a professor at the business school of
the University of California at Berkeley and a former researcher
for the Federal Reserve. Understanding it requires a short primer
on efficient market theory, which luckily is not as dry as it
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In its most rigorous (and absurd) form, efficient market theory
says investors can never beat the market except through luck,
because stocks are always properly valued based on the information
available to investors. So stocks should rise and fall only in
response to new data. Company X reports earnings that are lower
than expected; Company X's stock falls. Company Y announces a new
biotechnology breakthrough; Company Y's shares rise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the real world, efficient market theory has lots
of holes. An investor who researched Company X thoroughly might
anticipate those ``lower than expected'' earnings. A biotechnology
expert might see Company Y's breakthrough coming before other
investors do. But efficient market theorists regard those cases as
rare. And few serious investors disagree with the theory's
practical implication that it is very hard to beat the market over
long periods.
</P>
<P>
   So never mind the day traders, and forget fragmentation.
Volatility may be rising simply because investors must digest more
information every day. With product cycles shortening, with
breakthroughs every week in technology and biotechnology, no one
should be surprised that share prices are bouncing all over, Duffee
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the day-trader theory were right, he said, there would be
telltale statistical evidence. ``Imagine it's just more trading
that's causing more price changes, and not more information,'' he
said. ``Then people are just pushing prices, and you're going to
see a lot of negative serial correlation'' _ what went up Monday
comes down Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Duffee conceded that in the last six months the Nasdaq has
taken just that kind of round trip, from 3,500 to 5,000 and back,
he said thorough analysis over longer periods finds no such
oscillating trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eyes can't determine statistical significance,'' Duffee
said. ``I'm not saying markets are efficient. I'm saying, if they
were inefficient in this way, it would be really easy to make a
boatload of money.'' And whenever that's true on Wall Street,
someone steps in to make it _ and the inefficiency disappears.
</P>
<P>
   For the clincher, Duffee said, look back at past occasions when
trading volume rose sharply. The best example came in 1975, when
brokers were forced to compete on commissions for the first time.
``Trading just exploded,'' he said. ``Volatility didn't.''

BUT DO YOU KNOW THIS ABOUT THAT?
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   A gender gap study shows that men
know more about things like who's running Russia and women know
more about allergy shots.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center, which does studies on people and the
press, regularly analyzes the information gender gap by giving pop
current event quizzes. In the latest one, which matched others in
the past, men answered more accurately than women questions like,
``Does the Dow Jones company own a news organization?'' and ``Which
country was accused of spying and stealing nuclear technology from
the U.S.?''
</P>
<P>
   Any kind of gender study is bound to offend someone, but this
one doesn't seem that incendiary once you get past the initial
implications that men are deep and women are lightweights.
</P>
<P>
   Men, according to the study, are inclined to know more about
business and government, which some of you might remember from
Trivial Pursuit days.
</P>
<P>
   But women come in higher on health, education and cultural
subjects. More women than men answered correctly about the Supreme
Court ruling on parental notification about abortion. More women
know who Ellen DeGeneres is.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that what we know best reflects what
we're interested in. In other words, cholesterol and abortion
speaks to women more than the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   That could be true. Many a woman is probably content to leave
wastewater politics to someone else while she studies the latest
finding on chromosomes and disease.
</P>
<P>
   (Warning here: I'm generalizing and so are the researchers. Of
course there are exceptions and some women can't get enough of
political dealings _ ask me about ``West Wing''_ and some men can
talk all night about school test scores.)
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that one gender knows more about really important
matters than the other? I think not. First of all, the majority of
this pop quiz had to do with business takeovers, the U.S.
government and foreign military conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   But, are these the only things we need to know about? No one
asked anything about genomes or the high cost of housing. If we all
knew about the same thing we'd have pretty dull parties.
</P>
<P>
   More men can tell you the president's annual salary, the study
showed, but more women could remember what President Clinton
declared his top priority for his second term. Surprise. It was
education.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime newspaper readers may remember when the newspaper was
divided by gender. There was a separate women's section. That left
the rest of the paper _ war, money, sports, politics and business _
for men. Back then, if women didn't start reading until they hit
the fudge recipes they had a excuse not to know about matters of
state.
</P>
<P>
   For a time there was a notion that men liked hard news, which
often comes with a lot of numbers in it and a government source.
And women were drawn to soft news, which is not always tied to a
current event and has a lot of people in it. Hard news was about
power and influence. Soft news was about people like your neighbor.
Hard news was about money and products. Soft news was about
families.
</P>
<P>
   Hard news and soft news got together a while back and we don't
divide up the paper by gender, so I worried that this pop quiz
study was an attempt to drag us back to our old boxes.
</P>
<P>
   No judgments, they say. Women follow disaster stories, reactions
to court rulings and controversies over health procedures like
mammograms and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Men are more likely to follow stories about military action,
international politics, business and finance and sports. Someone
pointed out that you can see how politics play to men by using
sports analogies.
</P>
<P>
   I guess we'll know they're trying to appeal to women when they
start referring to the highly-placed as ``smooth dancers'' as well
as ``team players.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that women do read about the latest corporate takeover
and that fighting has broken out again in Sierra Leone. Maybe we
just don't feel the need to retain it.
</P>
<P>
   When we need to know, we find out. Two years ago, women didn't
do as well as men on identifying Bill Gates. Now he's our new best
friend, or maybe we don't like him this week, but we know the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we don't have as many file drawers in our brain reserved
for statistics, because we need space for the pediatrician's
number, high school counselor's name and the in-laws' anniversary
date. Besides, if we want to know who's in charge of Russia we can
check out the Kremlin's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The category where men and women have equal knowledge is crime,
scandal and personality. During the height of the Clinton scandal,
an equal number of men and women could identify the name Kathleen
Willey. Equal numbers could also name four characters on
``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ellen DeGeneres, here's the deal: I'll keep track of
Ellen if he'll take Putin.

NEW JOURNAL FOCUSES ON THE ORDINARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By EMILY EAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a Martian anthropologist coming to Earth, reading the
tabloids, watching a couple of talk shows and taking in a few
movies. He might well return to his planet persuaded that humans
beings are a freak race beset by murder, rape, incest, kinky sex
and the like.
</P>
<P>
   This is the scenario proposed by Scott Schaffer, a sociologist
at California State University at Fullerton, as a rationale for his
Journal of Mundane Behavior, a new scholarly periodical devoted to
the banal aspects of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer and a co-editor started the journal in February to
counter not only the trend toward sensational news stories but also
what they call an unhealthy fixation on the deviant in the social
sciences. Rather than studying pornography stars or doomsday cults,
they say, why not examine office workers or a suburban Sunday
school?
</P>
<P>
   Sound boring? Perhaps. But if the abnormal can have its own
library shelf (The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, and
The Journal of Abnormal Psychology and Deviant Behavior, to name
two), then why not the normal?
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the journal came from an essay two years ago in
Sociological Theory by Wayne Brekhus, a sociologist at the
University of Missouri at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Though the humdrum characterizes the bulk of our social
experience, Brekhus wrote, sociologists disproportionately favor
the outlandish. The result, he argued, is group stereotyping: a
tendency to equate, say, gang life with poor urban
African-Americans, punk rockers with youth culture, or drag queens
with homosexual culture generally. ``Although there are many
deviance journals to explicitly analyze socially unusual
behavior,'' he lamented, ``there is no Journal of Mundane Behavior
to explicitly analyze conformity.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading Brekhus' essay, Schaffer and his Fullerton
colleague Myron Orleans decided there should be such a journal.
</P>
<P>
   Available only online at www.mundanebehavior.org, the journal's
inaugural issue (a second issue is planned for next month) features
articles on the social implications of male facial hair, the
function of casual conversation (``plain talk'') in Israeli culture
and Japanese elevator etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   In the last of these, Terry Caesar, a professor at Mukogawa
Women's University, ponders over why Japanese are
uncharacteristically friendly in elevators. His conclusion: The
close quarters and fleeting duration of the ride encourage
passengers to deviate from the rigid social scripts that govern
Japanese public life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us don't live Jerry Springer lives,'' Schaffer
observes in the journal's introductory essay. ``The editors here
think that this vast amount of energy, effort and in some cases
sheer drudgery deserves some attention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet even the journal's creators admit that the study of the
everyday is not, well, so abnormal after all. ``There is a
long-term foundation for studying everyday life,'' Orleans
concedes.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the ground-breaking work of Erving Goffmann, whose
``Presentation of Self in Everyday Life'' (1959) encouraged
researchers to use natural settings and observational research.
While Goffmann's own study of life inside a psychiatric hospital
did not take the ``normal'' as a subject, his naturalistic approach
ended up destigmatizing madness by portraying the institution from
the inmates' point of view.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, sociologists have applied some of Goffmann's
techniques to investigate the largely unconscious verbal and
nonverbal conventions of everyday social interactions. Even
seemingly banal exchanges _ with the grocery-store cashier, the
mail carrier or a passing stranger _ yield valuable insights into
how human social life is organized, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention to everyday life in American sociology has
surely increased over the past decade,'' says Mitchell Duneier, an
associate professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison and the University of California at Santa Barbara, who has
studied conversations between panhandlers and passers-by in New
York. ``What has emerged is a concern with looking at how large
social systems shape and are constituted by the social interactions
we engage in daily.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duneier and a colleague analyzed encounters between black
panhandlers and middle-class white female pedestrians, they learned
something about what causes mistrust in social situations. The
women were not only upset by the words the panhandlers used (``Hey
pretty'' or ``I love you, baby'') but also by the silences between
words and by speech patterns that disregarded the tacit conventions
of small talk.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this surge of interest in conversational minutiae,
however, the editors of the Journal of Mundane Behavior insist that
the sociology of everyday life remains a minor current in the
field. ``Students are drawn more to study problem areas so they can
sell their skills to the government and education,'' he says.
``We're supposed to fix social problems; we're social repairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   One objective of the Journal of Mundane Behavior is to convince
aspiring sociologists that one can study everyday life and still be
a social repairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked in prisons, and people tend to speak of the
compelling quality of drugs and crime to account for recidivism,''
Orleans says. ``But it's difficult for former prisoners to conduct
themselves in the mundane world. It's a mystery to them. You want
to help people recover the ordinary, and perhaps we can be of use
to those people.''

 &HT;    POPULIST FORMER COKE EXECUTIVE CLOSING IN ON MEXICO'S RULING
PARTY
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., May 21 And Thereafter.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an obscure slum plagued by open sewage and
rotting unclaimed garbage, Mexican presidential candidate Vicente
Fox found something to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   His arms stretched high and wide into a victory sign, the
towering, cowboy-booted politician looked out on an adoring crowd
of factory workers and housewives chanting his slogan _ ``Enough!
Enough! Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six-and-a-half-feet tall, Fox had to double over to kiss
an Indian woman who defected from Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party
so she could back the charismatic opposition leader. ``Kiss!
Kiss!'' the crowd shouted, breaking into wolf whistles fit for a
movie star.
</P>
<P>
   With six weeks to go before the most competitive presidential
election this country has ever seen, Fox is a phenomenon who could
unleash a revolution in Mexico if he wins on July 2. Judging from
most opinion polls, the rancher, and former Coca-Cola executive and
governor is the first opposition candidate who has a chance at
finally defeating the party that has controlled Mexico's presidency
since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls are showing Fox a few points behind or even
with Francisco Labastida, the candidate of Mexico's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI (pronounced, ``pree''). Fox's own polls
_ and at least one independent one _ show he has even pulled
several points ahead of Labastida. It's a claim that has
electrified this race and given Fox extra ammunition in his war to
lure voters of all political stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to extend an invitation to all the PRI supporters in
the country. They shouldn't feel left out. They're all invited to
join this great popular movement,'' Fox told residents of this poor
section of Mexico City's Alvaro Obregon borough.
</P>
<P>
   He paused and grinned. ``The only ones that will be left out are
the corrupt!''
</P>
<P>
   True to a broad-based campaign strategy he launched several
years ago, Fox is also trying to drain votes away from Mexico's
leftist opposition even though he is a conservative proponent of
free-market economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   He is promising Mexicans what the PRI can't offer after decades
in power _ a total change in government _ while extending an olive
branch and pledging to build a plural, corruption-free government
with experts and ideological input from all parties.
</P>
<P>
   Because he can be blunt and theatrical _ he is a rancher who
relaxes by racing around on his favorite horse _ Fox has sometimes
been compared to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. But the
57-year-old, who was president of Coca-Cola's Latin America Group
from 1975 to 1979, is a crafty marketing expert whose election
strategy is more like President Bill Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Clinton moved from the left to the middle of the
American political spectrum, Fox has moved to the right to position
himself as a moderate. He is urging Mexicans to make history _
comparing his possible victory to tearing down the Berlin Wall _
and trying to convince them that he's the best option for ending a
political monopoly and installing a ``transitional'' democratic
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fox belongs to Mexico's National Action Party, the PAN, which
governs six states and is generally considered the most socially
and fiscally conservative of Mexico's political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has cultivated his image as a Jesuit-educated
compassionate conservative. He left his job as governor of
Guanajuato last year on a high note after attracting record amounts
of foreign investment for industries there. A gritty rancher whose
love of the outdoors is genuine, he is fairly popular among the
poor _ although his record is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   While he was governor, his state started charging residents for
some basic medical services. But Fox also made grants and
low-interest loans available to women who wanted to start small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He is running for president under the banner of the Alliance for
Change, a coalition that includes the PAN and Mexico's smaller,
environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   As the final weeks of the campaign approach _ a televised debate
is scheduled for Tuesday _ the PRI is pummeling its chief foe with
accusations that he is too conservative and contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has indeed, for example, sent mixed messages in the past
about whether he believes Mexico's state-run oil industry should be
privatized. He has suggested that the industry is not benefiting
Mexicans because it is rife with corruption and mismanagement. But
he now says that privatization probably wouldn't be acceptable in a
transitional government.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the PRI have even questioned whether Fox is ``Mexican
enough'' to be president because his mother was born in Spain and
one of his grandfathers _ hence the Fox surname _ was an American.
In a paid pro-Labastida newspaper insert in Tabasco, a state
politician suggested Fox doesn't have the ethnic make-up to care
about Mexico's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong feelings toward country, history, tradition, culture
and nationalism are learned at home,'' the ad said. ``But they can
also be a genetic matter . . . Vicente Fox doesn't have one drop of
Mexican blood.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week with Cox Newspapers at one of his
campaign offices here, Fox said he expected an onslaught of
attacks. Despite the PRI's proclamation that it's a new party, he
said, it is also preparing its legendary political machine to make
sure that PRI governors and federal bureaucrats get out the vote
for Labastida on election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida's strategy changed after he dropped to second in
polls,'' Fox said. ``He called in the dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   After a televised debate in April, much of the news media here
proclaimed Fox the winner of the event. Afterward, Labastida's
campaign took into its fold some infamous PRI politicians
derisively known as ``dinosaurs'' because they have been accused in
the past of old-fashioned vote buying and electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're trying to trying to put Fox in a niche or put a
label on him branding him a reactionary, a right-winger, an
anti-feminist, `` Fox said. ``We expected that. It's the campaign
of a loser. There is desperation in the ranks of the PRI. It's
never been a loser before. But they're going to have to get used to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, it looked like the PRI's toughest opponent
for the presidency would be Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former PRI
member who broke from the party in the 1980s and formed the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. Despite Cardenas' noble image
as protector of the poor, he has slipped to a distant third in most
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas has refused overtures from Fox to retreat and join his
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has attracted some of Cardenas' former political advisors
who say their priority is defeating the PRI. And just days before
the Tuesday debate, Fox won the endorsement of the former personal
secretary of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a 1994 PRI presidential
candidate who was assassinated by gunman in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Fox says his own polling shows Labastida enjoys a 20-point
advantage in Mexico's countryside, where 30 percent of the
electorate lives. He says his campaign plans a blitz to get to
those voters in the final two weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's success stems in large part from Mexicans' general disgust
with PRI corruption and cycles of economic crisis. His rise also
coincides with a freer press and new campaign rules that are more
egalitarian. And he has kept his message simple, said University of
Guanajuato political expert Luis Miguel Rionda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy he uses is the same as Coca-Cola's,'' Rionda
said. ``Saturation, repetition and simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's multi-faceted personality hasn't hurt him either.
</P>
<P>
   He is a good-looking man with a Harvard business degree who in
the 1980s became a leading voice against electoral fraud after a
tainted governor's election in his state. He speaks excellent
English and has taken to traveling to the United States to meet
with Mexican immigrants there who can influence their families at
home.
</P>
<P>
   And he easily amuses working-class Mexicans by trashing the PRI
and lacing his campaign speeches with ripe language.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Mexico City's Alvaro Obregon neighborhood,
Fox modified a Mexican folk song for comic effect. ``Mexico
beautiful and dear,'' he recited into a microphone, ``if I die far
from thee, tell them I was screwed because of those in the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita Islas Trejo, a 44-year-old housewife who attended the
rally, said she's for Fox precisely because he is so plain-spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't come down here and make promises that he would give
us more houses or drainage systems,'' she said. ``He was just
willing to come down here and see those of us who live in dirty
corners like this. I look at him as a person who is like me.''

 &HT;    POPULIST FORMER COKE EXECUTIVE CLOSING IN ON MEXICO'S RULING
PARTY

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In an obscure slum plagued by open sewage and
rotting unclaimed garbage, Mexican presidential candidate Vicente
Fox found something to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   His arms stretched high and wide into a victory sign, the
towering, cowboy-booted politician looked out on an adoring crowd
of factory workers and housewives chanting his slogan _ ``Enough!
Enough! Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six-and-a-half-feet tall, Fox had to double over to kiss
an Indian woman who defected from Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party
so she could back the charismatic opposition leader. ``Kiss!
Kiss!'' the crowd shouted, breaking into wolf whistles fit for a
movie star.
</P>
<P>
   With six weeks to go before the most competitive presidential
election this country has ever seen, Fox is a phenomenon who could
unleash a revolution in Mexico if he wins on July 2. Judging from
most opinion polls, the rancher, and former Coca-Cola executive and
governor is the first opposition candidate who has a chance at
finally defeating the party that has controlled Mexico's presidency
since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Most opinion polls are showing Fox a few points behind or even
with Francisco Labastida, the candidate of Mexico's Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or PRI (pronounced, ``pree''). Fox's own polls
_ and at least one independent one _ show he has even pulled
several points ahead of Labastida. It's a claim that has
electrified this race and given Fox extra ammunition in his war to
lure voters of all political stripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to extend an invitation to all the PRI supporters in
the country. They shouldn't feel left out. They're all invited to
join this great popular movement,'' Fox told residents of this poor
section of Mexico City's Alvaro Obregon borough.
</P>

<P>
   TOBAGO CAYS, St. Vincent _ It happens on virtually every visit
to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, these sparkling gems in the
southeastern Caribbean: I lean back, close my eyes and savor
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   That moment came again on my most recent trip as I sat on a
catamaran anchored in the popular Tobago Cays, five uninhabited
islets near the tail of the Grenadines. My mouth watered as the
aromas of curry chicken, fried fish, peas and rice wafted up from
the galley.
</P>
<P>
   Around the catamaran, red, blue and yellow fish swam through
beautiful coral. On shore, tie-dyed T-shirts pinned to a line
anchored by two coconut trees flapped in the cool Atlantic breeze.
The T-shirt vendor sat in the shade of one of the trees, downing
coconut water.
</P>
<P>
   To me, this is the best of the Caribbean _ simple, sweet and
unpretentious. And that's why I have returned to St. Vincent and
the Grenadines again and again during the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   I have been in love with these islands since, as an
impressionable 7-year-old, I spent a year living on St. Vincent
with my grandmother. I still remember tagging along on her weekly
selling trips to the market or waving at her while swimming in a
crystal clear river near her farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Granny is long gone now, but I thank her often for introducing
me to some of the most charming and mesmerizing islands on earth. I
eagerly anticipate each visit _ and dread leaving. Every time I
come here, I experience something new, reinforcing my belief that
these islands are a must-see on any tour of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent is the largest of more than 30 islands that comprise
the independent nation, covering roughly 150 square miles. The
Grenadines, a few of which are uninhabited, straddle the Atlantic
Ocean and Caribbean Sea. St. Vincent is the nation's economic and
political center.
</P>
<P>
   The major islands, north to south, are Young Island, Bequia
(beck-way), Mustique (mus-teek), Canouan (can-no-wan), Mayreau
(my-row), Union Island, Palm Island and Petit St. Vincent.
Archeologists say St. Vincent was inhabited around 5000 B.C., long
before Columbus arrived. A combination of Europeans and freed
blacks occupied the islands in the 16th century. St. Vincent became
a British colony in 1871 and an independent nation in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Vincent is known for its La Soufriere volcano and
eco-tourism sites, most visitors use it as a place to switch planes
on their way to the Grenadines, where turquoise waters beckon.
</P>
<P>
   I did just that recently, saving St. Vincent for last, after my
visit ``down the islands.''
</P>
<P>
   From the airport in St. Vincent, I caught an SVG Air
island-hopper flight to Union Island, where I hooked up with
Captain Yannis tours for my all-too- brief visit to the Tobago
Cays. I could have stayed for days on that catamaran, bobbing in
the Atlantic. But after a sumptuous lunch, it was time to push off
for Petit St. Vincent, or PSV, the private island-resort listed
among the leading hotels of the world. On Union Island, a
jumping-off point for several islands in the southern Grenadines,
PSV's 42-foot launch, the Wakiva, was waiting to take me on the
35-minute ride to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, I passed Palm Island, another private island that
is home to the exclusive Palm Island Beach Club. Although many
guests at the secluded resort may just want to soak up rays on the
beach, others take advantage of offerings such as a nature trail
that slices through the mountains and a boat waiting to take guests
out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes from Palm Island is a small sand spit, or
miniature island, known as Petit St. Richardson, named for Haze
Richardson, the owner/manager of Petit St. Vincent. The sand spit,
no more than 30 feet wide, is great for swimming and boasts a
thatched-roof umbrella for shade. PSV guests are often ferried here
to spend the day in quiet relaxation, either reading or swimming.
But its importance to me is that it signals that PSV is only a few
swells away.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped off the Wakiva, welcomed with a refreshing pina
colada, memories of my last visit to PSV flooded back. My wife,
Robin, and I had honeymooned at this all-inclusive resort four
years earlier, and very little seemed to have changed since. The
island is renowned as a haven for privacy-seekers; most guests take
meals in their private cottages, even though there is a private
restaurant nearby. Those 22 stone cottages are built with seclusion
in mind. Some are located just off private white sandy beaches,
while others are tucked along the bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   I got a sense of how much solitude is valued when I trekked to
the top of lookout hill, the highest point on the island. The view
of the ocean below was spectacular, but the view of the cottages
was more revealing: Roofs were the only part of the cottages
peeking from the surrounding trees. Each of the cottage's two-room
suites is practically hidden by bougainvillea and sea-grape trees.
</P>
<P>
   PSV has become famous for its unique flag system that reinforces
the privacy theme. Two flags are pinned to a bamboo pole outside
each cottage _ one red, the other yellow. If you need room service,
just leave the order on the pole and raise the yellow flag.
Staffers driving mini-mokes, which resemble golf carts, pass by
each cottage every 15 minutes. If you don't want to be disturbed,
raise the red flag. Your privacy will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   Haze told me that he sees some guests just twice _ when they
arrive and when they depart. For those who don't want to spend
their entire vacation in their cottage, the resort offers hiking
trails, snorkeling, fishing, water-skiing and tennis. Haze and his
wife, Lynn, host a weekly cocktail party at their home for new
guests, plus a beach barbecue every Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   I headed to the party after a swim in my own _ at least for a
couple days _ piece of the Atlantic. Most guests had already
arrived, and a band from nearby Petit Martinique was playing when
the mini-moke pulled up. The food did not disappoint _ lobster,
chicken and beef on the grill. I walked back to my cottage after
the party under a beautiful moonlit sky.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I almost couldn't pull myself from PSV. But Bequia, another of
my favorites in the Grenadines, awaited. Bequia is the
second-largest island in the chain, located just nine miles south
of the larger St. Vincent. The island was a lucrative whaling
station in the mid-1800s, attracting sailors from throughout the
world, particularly Scotland and France.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   Whaling has since decreased, but the craft of boat building _
both large and miniature sizes _ continues to flourish. Bob Dylan's
boat, the Water Pearl, was built on Bequia.
</P>
<P>
   I last visited Bequia seven years ago to attend the island's
Easter Regatta, which is gaining a reputation as one of the most
exciting regattas in the Caribbean. My only regret on that visit
was turning down an invitation to join one of the crews in the
race. Maybe I feared that I would meet the same fate as the
country's prime minister, James ``Son'' Mitchell, whose dinghy
overturned during the race. While we chuckled from shore, Mitchell,
like any good sailor, just hopped back aboard and finished the
race.
</P>
<P>
   After the regatta, I had accepted Mitchell's invitation to
attend the official opening of the James F. Mitchell Airport. Some
of the island's 6,000 residents had opposed the airport, fearing
that the small planes would cause noise pollution. Some
sentimentalists preferred to see the island's seclusion retained _
previously, the only way to get to Bequia was by private yachts or
on one of two ferries from St. Vincent. I can't say that I
disagreed with them.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years later, I couldn't wait to fly into Bequia. The
airport, built on land reclaimed from the sea, was clean and going
through customs was a breeze. The prime minister and airport
employees told me that the facility has been good for the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, I hopped aboard the back of a pickup-turned-taxi for
the 20-minute ride to my hotel on Admiralty Bay. It dawned on me
along the way why it's hard to forget this island: Every vista is
incredible. The postcard view of the deep blue Caribbean Sea as the
pickup climbed one steep hill after another was intoxicating. More
than a dozen yachts and a cruise ship were anchored off Admiralty
Bay, the short strip where most activity on the island is centered.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two ferries that ply between St. Vincent and Bequia
slowly saddled up to the dock at the edge of the bay. I hopped off
the pickup at the Frangipani Hotel, located in the center of
Admiralty Bay in Port Elizabeth, Bequia's commercial center.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Frangi'' is located along the strip. Stores, restaurants
and dive shops are a short walk away. And during regatta week, the
Frangi and nearby Plantation House Hotel are ground zero for most
of the activities. Everyone was buzzing when I checked in about a
youth soccer tournament at the nearby stadium, where each village
was competing for trophies and bragging rights. On my way to the
game, I stopped by St. Mary's Anglican Church, one of the oldest
structures on the island.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's was built from local limestone and imported brick. It
was rebuilt in 1829 after the earlier building was destroyed by a
hurricane in 1798. After leaving St. Mary's, I passed vendors
selling cold drinks, ice cream, sugar cakes and other local
delicacies near the stadium. The stands were packed, but fans were
milling about outside the gates and on the side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned into a social event after the prizes were handed
out; dancing started as calypso music blared from large stereos.
The festivities were well underway when I left.
</P>
<P>
   On my last trip to Bequia, I had toured the Old Fort Country
Inn, a rustic hotel at the top of the island with a great view of
the bay. It was at the top of my sites to visit on this trip, as
much for the view as for the rum punch the hotel bar serves to
visitors and guests _ it's among the best I've tasted in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't ready to leave Bequia, but some friends had told me
about the Arawak Indian petroglyphs in St. Vincent, and I couldn't
wait to see them.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother had lived in Mesopotamia, the island's
breadbasket. She grew fruits and vegetables, from avocados to
nutmegs, and sold them every Saturday at the Kingstown market.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when I was well behaved, she would let me tag along.
As she sold the fruits and vegetables, I played with other vendors'
children or sneaked out for a peek at the large ships in the harbor
nearby. It was an unforgettable time and I wanted to recapture some
of that magic on this trip.
</P>
<P>
   I visited the market with my friend Ann Joshua, owner of
Cobblestone Inn in downtown Kingstown. We arrived about 6:30 a.m.
It didn't take long for Ann's friends to chide her for arriving
late; she usually begins her weekly shopping at 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The market has moved out of the building that supplied me with
those great memories as a youth. Vendors now set up shop on the
street, hawking plantains, dasheen (a round starchy root vegetable)
and bhaji (pronounced bage-g), a green leafy vegetable. Every few
minutes, we had to squeeze onto the side of the street to escape a
passing car or truck. Ann said a modern, larger market is being
built across from the old one.
</P>
<P>
   The market had a wonderful assortment of meats, fish and
tropical fruits and vegetables. From the vegetable stalls, we
strolled across the street to the fish section, appropriately
situated on the edge of the wharf.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite dishes is made from tiny macock fish _ about
3/4 to 6 inches in length _ called tri tri (pronounced tree-tree).
The fish is caught at the mouth of many rivers on the island. Tri
tri is best eaten when well-seasoned and fried. Ann bought several
pounds for a party she was planning.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I stopped by the elementary school in
Kingstown where my aunt teaches for a quick visit en-route to the
petroglyphs. But I should have known better: Aunt Helena is not
into speed. She wanted far more than the 10 minutes I had to spare.
``Let's go!'' she said, after I told her that I was headed to the
quaint fishing village of Layou to see the stone carvings. She
wanted to go, too, and I had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   A guide drove us northwest, up through the mountains past
children playing along the side of the street and women selling
sweets and drinks from makeshift stalls.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Layou about an hour after we left Kingstown. The
carvings were located on private property at the edge of a stream.
We paid the owners a small admission fee and walked the
quarter-mile along a dirt track to the 20-foot rock on which the
carvings were etched.
</P>
<P>
   My plain-talking aunt stopped a few feet short of the large gray
boulder, bewildered. ``We drove all this way for this?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   I smiled. I was intrigued as I carefully traced the outline of
the carvings with my fingers. It was unimaginable that someone had
stood where I was more than 1,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   We returned to Kingstown late, just in time to attend Ann's
party. The tri tri was delicious, even better than I remembered
from my childhood. I watched the rolling Caribbean from Ann's front
porch as a singing troupe serenaded guests with a dozen songs. It
was another one of those paradise moments. John Yearwood, (817)

<P>
   GETTING THERE: You can fly directly to Kingstown, the capital,
from Puerto Rico, Barbados, Grenada, Martinique, St. Lucia or
Trinidad. I flew on a direct flight from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport
to Puerto Rico, where I connected to another direct flight to
Kingstown. Airlines serving the market include American Eagle, BWIA
and LIAT.
</P>
<P>
   Several cruise ships serve Kingstown Harbour in St. Vincent, and
some, depending on size, also serve the Grenadines. If you're
traveling by yacht, there are ports of entry in St. Vincent,
Bequia, Mustique, Union Island and Canouan.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND: Rental cars are generally available, but you can
often get where you're going by walking. A word of caution: The
islands are very mountainous, so pack comfortable shoes. I prefer
to walk around Kingstown, where traffic jams have become more of a
problem over the years. Remember, if you rent a car, you must
purchase a local license at the airport or police station.
</P>
<P>
   On some islands in the Grenadines, such as Petit St. Vincent,
your choices are few _ either walk or request a ride on one of the
mini-mokes used by hotel staff. Public ferries transport passengers
between the islands, as do several small airlines, including St.
Vincent Grenadines Air and Mustique Airways.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING THERE: The islands are home to a number of hotels that
fit any traveler's budget and taste. Prices change with the
seasons, so check with the hotel or tourist office before heading
out. A few of my favorites include Cobblestone Inn in St. Vincent,
(784) 456-1937; Mariner's Hotel in St. Vincent, (784) 457-5261;
Camelot Hotel in St. Vincent (784) 456-2100; Petit St. Vincent
Resort, U.S. reservations, (800) 654-9326; The Frangipani in
Bequia, (784) 458-3255; Old Fort Country Inn in Bequia, (784)
458-3440; and Carenage Bay Beach &AMP; Golf Club in Canouan, (784)
458-8000.
</P>
<P>
   TOURING: Taking tours around the islands can be inexpensive and
fun. Captain Yannis' tour to Tobago Cays was a blast. Contact
Captain Yannis, (784) 458-8513. Other tour operators include Sam
Taxi Tours, (784) 456-4338; Sea Breeze Nature Tours, (784)
458-4949; Calypso Tours, (784) 456-1746; and HazECO tours, (784)
457-8634.
</P>
<P>
   FOR MORE INFORMATION: The islands have two major tourist offices
in the United States, including one in Dallas at 6505 Cove Creek
Place; (800) 235-3029. The other office is in New York; (800)
729-1726. On the Internet, visit www.scubasvg.com.]

TRUE BELIEVERS SAY BODY IN GRANBURY CEMETERY IS THAT OF JESSE
JAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All those true believers who insist that the
legendary train robber Jesse James is buried in a Granbury cemetery
might finally get their answer soon.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-delayed quest to exhume the body of a man known as J.
Frank Dalton _ but whose gravestone says Jesse Woodson James _ has
been scheduled for May 30 in Granbury, the Hood County seat, 40
miles southwest of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   This time, an Oklahoma used-car dealer-turned-amateur historian
who has championed the effort isn't saying who will carry out the
forensic testing, other than that the person is from outside Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell anyone,'' said Bud Hardcastle of
Purcell, Okla., who has the power of attorney for three of James'
purported grandsons. ``I'm not going to have them besieged by phone
calls and have them back out again.''
</P>
<P>
   In February when he received a court order from Hood County
Judge Linda Steen, Hardcastle said Harrell Gill-King, director of
the University of North Texas' Forensic Anthropology Laboratory in
Denton, would conduct the tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Gill-King said he had dropped out of the project two years
before.
</P>
<P>
   David Glassman, a forensic anthropologist at Southwest Texas
State University, will also participate in the exhumation,
Hardcastle said. Glassman was out of the country and couldn't be
reached to comment. In an interview last month, Glassman said that
he would probably participate in the project, but that he couldn't
conduct all tests in his own laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Most historical accounts maintain that Bob Ford shot James on
April 3, 1882, and that James is buried in Kearney, Mo. But
nonmainstream historians and some people asserting kinship have
long questioned that version.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, George Washington University professor James
Starrs said at a forensic science convention that findings from the
DNA in a tooth led his team to conclude that the body buried in
Kearney is James'.
</P>
<P>
   Like other revisionists, Hardcastle contends that James faked
his death and made his way to Texas, using the alias of Dalton.
Moreover, the tooth tested for DNA came not from the Kearney grave
but from a Missouri museum, Hardcastle said.
</P>
<P>
   When Dalton died in 1951, a casual ``autopsy'' by the Hood
County sheriff listed at least 16 bullet wounds, rope burns on a 17
1/2-inch neck, scarred and burned feet, and the tip of the left
index finger ``sawed off.'' If Dalton was James, he would have been
104 when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton went to Granbury shortly after World War II and told
people that he was Jesse James. Some longtime residents recall
being charged admission to see him in his last days.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hite of Godley, who says he is distantly related to
James, said, ``It would satisfy my curiosity if it turns out to be
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it turns out not to be him, I won't accept the fact
that he's buried in Missouri until they test the body of a man in
Falls County,'' in Central Texas, said Hite, 65. ``I think he might
be down there too.''
</P>
<P>
   Hite will host about a dozen people at his Godley cafe, the
Chisholm Restaurant, the day before the exhumation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get together and discuss what we know,'' Hite
said. ``I've got plenty of room. I expect Mr. Hardcastle and a
couple of the relatives from Arkansas as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The three purported grandsons, who live in Arkansas, Oklahoma
and Iowa, are expected to attend if their health permits,
Hardcastle said. He also expects at least one representative of
those who believe that James is buried in Missouri to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this should finally settle the question, providing
everybody stays hooked in place,'' Hardcastle said. ``They've told
me this will take about eight weeks to find out, but I'll believe
that when I see it.''

SAVING YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE FROM DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before a wildfire burned their house _ and more than 200
other Los Alamos, N.M., homes _ to the ground last week, Dick and
Judy Opsahl were told they had a last chance to rescue what they
could. Opsahl said they first grabbed ``a few treasures'' and a bit
of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next part,'' he added, ``was to be sure we got the hard
drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of their financial lives, from tax records to rental
payments, were on their computers, which were soon up and running
again in their temporary home at the Cities of Gold Casino Hotel in
nearby Pojoaque.
</P>
<P>
   Laina Katcher, in her rush to leave Los Alamos, did not think to
bring the family computer, but she did pack her bills for the
current month. ``Isn't that stupid?'' she said, looking back. ``Why
would I want those?''
</P>
<P>
   Even during a catastrophe, people seem concerned about their
financial responsibilities, though usually after paying heed to
things with more sentimental value. Now that residences are often
home offices or home-based businesses, too, many have more data to
lose. People also now tend to carry more debt, which makes dealing
with creditors and worrying about cash flow part of the daily
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more going on in the household than ever before,''
said Brent A. Neiser, director of collaborative programs at the
National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group in
Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate databases can reconstruct most financial documents,
though the bureaucracy can be overwhelming. ``We're all financially
networked with large institutions, not just community banks and
credit unions where you can go down the street and ask, ``What's
going on?''' Neiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Neiser's
group began working on a way to provide financial guidance to
disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the Red Cross, it interviewed victims of previous
floods, fires and earthquakes and found that many experienced the
same financial obstacles. Some were as basic as not having change
on hand for pay phones when residential lines were down. Others
involved an added cause of misery, like unscrupulous contractors
who show up immediately after a calamity to take advantage of
homeowners still in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines were developed, and later revised in tandem with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some seeming nightmares have a way of working out. Almost as
soon as the Los Alamos post office closed for a few days, for
example, the Postal Service began unloading mail at a Red Cross
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving, say, a Visa bill was important to the evacuees, said
Jo Anne Jones, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Los Alamos. ``When
they're in the shelter all day, they do worry about those things,
simply because there is not much else they can do,'' she said.
After the post office reopened, temporary post-office boxes were
set up for those who no longer had much of an address.
</P>
<P>
   Most large insurance companies send claims adjusters to disaster
sites, where they can write checks on the spot for people with
immediate needs. These representatives often also wind up fielding
general financial questions from their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just basically telling them not to worry,'' said Gloria
Brown, a Los Alamos claims adjuster for State Farm, who lost her
own home of 26 years in the fire. The only document she brought
with her in the evacuation was a birth certificate, but the last
thing on her mind was getting a copy of her mutual-fund statement,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is start all over again,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, coping with a communitywide disaster is easier
than going it alone. ``The Rotary Clubs in Japan sent thousands of
dollars to this area,'' said Richard Hardman, whose home and
business were damaged in Northridge, Calif., earthquakes in 1994.
``Because it was so visible throughout the world, people kind of
rallied around.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the catastrophe involves one home or 200, there are
many steps people can take to keep things from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt phone calls, for example. Utility companies will usually
stop billing a residence and switch the service to another
location, waiving initial connection charges.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies usually monitor disaster situations and
mark ZIP codes where homes have been destroyed, but a call from a
card holder can help. Steve Boyden, a spokesman for the big card
issuer MBNA America Bank, said his company offered things like
payment holidays and increased credit lines for emergency
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Filing insurance claims, and collecting the benefits, can be a
daunting task. Some victims of previous disasters have said they
took years to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Neiser recommends submitting claim forms quickly and alerting
the insurer to the fact that the list of damages might be
incomplete. If property records are destroyed, catalogs or
classified ads can help establish a fair value for damaged or
destroyed items. A real estate agent can provide escrow papers for
the value of a home, the county assessor can provide property-tax
records, and contractors can determine the value of home
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration offers loans to homeowners and
renters in declared disaster areas as well as to small businesses.
FEMA offers grants; local governments may help, too.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will provide copies of prior tax returns and will allow
certain deductions for casualty losses. The costs of documenting
losses may also be deductible. Disaster victims may want to amend
their previous year's tax returns to report current losses, to get
a refund more quickly. Filing deadlines may be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Though getting fresh copies of documents is usually possible,
extracting information from a melted computer is not. Evacuating
with a computer or backup disks that have been kept current, or
having backup copies stored in remote locations, can be vital.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies also offer ways to replicate a desktop
environment through the Internet; these services _ sometimes free _
are essentially a means of storing back-up files on a server.
Experts warn, however, that there still are privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, the items that are most worth saving are
not Quicken files or Social Security cards. For Brown, the State
Farm adjuster, they were her jewelry, her Lladro porcelain
figurines and photographs of her nine children and 18
grandchildren. ``We have a lot of photographs,'' she said, and no
regrets at hauling them all.

`THE LINDA McCARTNEY STORY': THE MYTHOLOGY OF A 20TH CENTURY(Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First we hated her for marrying Paul. She wasn't beautiful
enough; she wasn't famous; she was American, for heaven's sake.
Later we hated her for breaking up the Beatles (with Yoko's help),
then joining her husband's new band when it was clear she couldn't
sing, and wasn't she just a little too self-righteous about those
vegetarian cookbooks and her work in animal rights? Then, two years
ago last month, she died of breast cancer at the age of 56 and we
made her a saint.
</P>
<P>
   Now Linda McCartney is the heroine of the baby boomers' new
favorite love story. She and Paul McCartney were destined to be
together and incredibly happy every moment of their 29-year
marriage, you know. He couldn't have cheated because they never
spent a night apart (except for his six days in a Japanese jail in
1980 for marijuana possession). Proving that true love really does
exist and that even the wildest, cutest, most happily promiscuous
young rock star really just wants a farm in Scotland and four
children and a good woman by his side. That kind of mythology is
the use we make of famous people's lives, and then we make
television movies about them.
</P>
<P>
   The one the former Linda Eastman has gotten, ``The Linda
McCartney Story,'' which has its premiere Sunday night at 9 on CBS,
is a typical celebrity biography. It's far less than a saint
deserves, but at least Elizabeth Mitchell plays her with
intelligence and charm.
</P>
<P>
   As the film tells it, the story begins when Linda's photography
career does. She's a pretty, blond 24-year-old divorcee with a
4-year-old daughter, Heather, living in New York and working in a
very low-level job at City and Village magazine (in real life, Town
and Country, as you might guess). One day she and an equally young,
hip co-worker grab a press party invitation for a get-together with
the Rolling Stones on a yacht. Linda takes her camera, catches Mick
Jagger's eye and gets some nice pictures.
</P>
<P>
   She soon has a book contract and uses her advance to travel,
among other places, to London, where she catches the eye of Paul
McCartney (Gary Bakewell) at a club. (In between, she has also
caught Jim Morrison's eye at an American club. Linda's legend is
that this was always happening to her.)
</P>
<P>
   While in London, she's invited to a press lunch for the ``Sgt.
Pepper'' album at Brian Epstein's house and simultaneously snaps
pictures of Paul and charms the socks off him. This is not
Christine Berardo's script's finest hour. Linda asks about the new
album's title. Paul explains: ``Well, you know those little packets
you get on airplanes. Someone said to me, `Would you pass me the
salt and pepper?' I thought, `Salt and pepper _ Sergeant Pepper.
It's a bit of a pun, that's all. Playing with words.'' Linda can
only reply, ``What a mind!'' The dialogue is better at times. Later
a friend _ Danny Fields (David Lewis), on whose biography the film
is based _ reminds Linda that Paul has been living with the British
actress Jane Asher for five years. ``He'll never marry her,'' Linda
says confidently. Danny replies, ``Has he asked you?'' She smiles
again and says, ``He doesn't have my number.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily she soon finds herself at a Beatles press conference and
passes Paul a piece of paper with her telephone number on it. The
next thing you know, her answering service is reporting that Paul
McCartney of London called: ``He's on his way to Los Angeles. He'd
like you to meet him there at the Beverly Hills Hotel.'' She goes,
arrives at his bungalow and the two are undressing each other
before he has even asked if she had a nice flight.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to know that late-20th-century saints are allowed to
have slept around. Mick Jagger (Matthew Harrison) almost manages to
utter our culture's most feared four-letter word on network
television in his proposition to Linda in the yacht scene, and
although we don't see their sexual liaison she acknowledges later
that it took place. She is also seen in bed with Morrison (Aaron
Grain).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe film producers should give up the idea of look-alike
casting. At times, Bakewell, who has played McCartney before, in
the 1994 film ``Backbeat,'' looks more like Donny Osmond _ although
that improves as the character ages. On the other hand, Tim Piper
is thrilling as a dead ringer for John Lennon, but he has a lot
fewer scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Beatles fans should not expect even re-creations of the group's
music. All they'll hear is a snippet of ``I Want to Hold Your
Hand,'' played over film of the group's famous Shea Stadium
concert. ``Along Comes Mary,'' by the Association, is the theme
music for Paul and Linda's picturesque New York wanderings, and
``Never, My Love'' plays over the scenes of Paul's final,
successful marriage proposal and the couple's 1969 London wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Once Linda and Paul are married, and it's established that his
fans despise her, ``The Linda McCartney Story'' makes the
inevitable transition into disease film. The situation has already
been set up with one reverse flashback to her diagnosis, and Paul
has told her earlier that his mother died of breast cancer when he
was 14. The film now jumps back and forth in time, juxtaposing
hospital scenes with accounts of Paul's depression after the
Beatles' breakup, Linda's reluctance to be a part of Wings (``You
don't need a total amateur onstage with you''), the couple's
surprise Christmas visit to the Lennons in New York and the
horrifying news of John's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell elevates her own scenes of illness, deterioration and
death with an admirable dignity. Throughout the film, George Segal
is also good (with less than brilliant material) as Linda's father,
Lee Eastman, who becomes the lawyer for the Beatles' troubled
company Apple. In the end, though, the film is just another
tear-jerker. Any fan who really wants to pay tribute to Linda and
Paul McCartney's life together might do better to get out the
``McCartney'' album and play ``Maybe I'm Amazed'' once or twice.

 By MIKE ZELLNER, Latin Trade Editor 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    With all the hype, it's getting very hard to distinguish what is
real and what is virtual in the increasingly insane web world of
Latin America. Reared in the no-nonsense neighborhood of Dorchester
in Boston, Robert Davis, 43, knows something about cutting through
hubris. When the New England native became Lycos Inc.'s first
employee in June 1995, it was little more than a research project
at Carnegie-Mellon University.
 &HT;    Under the hard-nosed CEO, though, Lycos has become one of top 10
websites in the United States. Its market value has soared to more
than US$7 billion from some $2 million in original venture capital.
And it is expanding around the globe. Davis recently visited Miami
to announce Lycos increased operations in Latin America. In an
exclusive interview, he spoke with LATIN TRADE Editor Mike Zellner
about what's hot and what's not on the Internet. Highlights:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LATIN TRADE: You are 22 years old, you live in Mexico City and
you want to launch an Internet company, where do you begin?
 &HT;    DAVIS: You log onto Lycos.com to get an idea of what the web is
all about and then you go to the jobs page and apply for a job ...
(laughs) ... The greatest opportunity still out there are the
commerce destinations. Content sites are a lot tougher to compete
with these days. There are some established players _ the
traditional media and a handful of others _ that have built their
brands and have a lot of money to spend. They make it very, very
difficult to build up anything meaningful. That's not to say
someone couldn't do it, but it becomes very tough. The vertical
destinations typically don't have the critical mass of audience to
be earnings positive.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Wait, you lost me. What do you mean?
 &HT;    If you look at the advertising dollars and the way that they are
allocated _ spending is more concentrated on the web than
traditional media. There are so many sites that advertisers are
probably not focused on an 80/20 rule, it's probably more like
98/2, or 98 percent of all the ad dollars go to 2 percent of the
websites. So, the small special interest sites very much struggle
to get any ad revenue. What they end up doing is jumping into a
(advertising sales) network, like DoubleClick.net, Flycast.com or
24by7.com, and relying on them to sell advertising at a 40 percent
discount, not a high cost per thousand and not a high sell-through
rate. Establishing a content destination is tough to do today. I
wouldn't do that today despite the fact that it's our business and
I assure you that I'm not trying to discourage competition, it's
just a tough way to get yourself established right now. Commerce on
the other hand is very broad based. There are an abundance of
niches that are still completely available. There are niches that
are available on a global basis.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Give me an example.
 &HT;    Hospital supplies. Chemicals. Pharmaceutical drugs. Virtually
every business-to-business category that you can imagine still sits
out there as an untapped opportunity. Beyond that, if you start to
look at consumer goods online, you can almost open up the Yellow
Pages and look over the categories to see what is available. There
is still a lot out there. Major appliances _ there's an Internet
opportunity there. It's a tougher thing to do because you wind up
with a delivery mechanism (issue), which makes it trickier. But if
you are buying a washing machine or other appliance in a physical
store or over the web, you never take it home with you. It is the
nature of the product. So, it's easier to say where you wouldn't go
then where you would, because where you wouldn't go is limited to a
handful of places where there are established competitors.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OK, what businesses would you avoid?
 &HT;    You wouldn't go into books. You wouldn't go into CDs. You
probably wouldn't go into computers because the margins are low and
the competition is plentiful. You wouldn't go into software for the
same set of reasons. Electronics, there is an abundance of
competitors. Pet supplies, the same thing. You work your way
through possibly a dozen categories of sites, possibly 20 at the
outside, and then it becomes wide open. There are really no
established players.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    How do you get between the hospital and the hospital supplier,
say, or the consumer and the appliance maker to take part in the
commerce between the two?
 &HT;    What you need to come forward with is a good value proposition
that says, 'Here is how I am going to benefit you.' It's not as
difficult as it might sound. Suppliers are generally encumbered by
their ancient history, which means suppliers generally have a set
bureaucracy, an old way of doing things that makes it difficult for
them to evolve into the web. I'm speaking at a conference in
Orlando to a couple of thousand manufacturing executives. There's a
group of people as an industry that is looking at the Internet and
saying what does it mean to me and how does it impact my business.
I know there is an opportunity out there somewhere but I don't
quite understand what it is and how I play with it. As you start to
look at that, that entire room starts to become an opportunity for
partnerships for the 22-year-old in Mexico City who is looking to
start an Internet company.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    How does the 22-year-old avoid losing the soul of a start-up
when seeking money?
 &HT;    You have to be smart. If you negotiate for a few months to get
the best terms possible, you may give up a little less ownership
than if you go for the money right away. But, by the same token,
you would likely also have lost your first-mover advantage. You
would find yourself on the outside looking in. I guess what my
attitude would be is that it's always smart to eat when dinner is
served, especially for that first financing opportunity. If you
have a financing opportunity, do a smart shop of it, which means
compare what the alternatives are but don't get geedy because greed
kills. Getting a business off the ground in an expeditious fashion
is what is most important.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Is there some away to avoid losing control?
 &HT;    There's a big difference between taking money and giving up
control. You can pick up some wonderful financing partners turning
over less than 25 percent of your business. In many cases, well
less than 25 percent of the business. It does not have to be an
environment where your backers are running the operation for you,
nor should you ever allow yourself to get into that sort of
environment. In today's market, you don't need to.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Where do you go if you are looking to shake the money tree? Do
you go to Wall Street? Do you go an investment bank? Do you go to
private investment funds?
 &HT;    Assuming it's that 22-year-old and assuming it's a seed stage
environment that he or she is looking at, I'd go to venture
capitalists. Funds are plentiful right now. They would have a
greater appreciation of what is trying to get done. However, having
said that, the odds of success for that 22-year-old are infinitely
greater, in terms of financial success, working for an established
player rather than trying to start their own thing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Why?
 &HT;    Look at the reality of it. If they are lucky, five out of 100
businesses survive. Out of those five that survive, no more than 1
percent of those become anything more than living dead, and by the
living dead, I mean a business that keeps itself in business but
generates no meaningful return over time. And even that is probably
a generous number. You end up with one in 10,000 businesses or less
that prosper. It's not to discourage anyone from trying to grab
their own brass ring, but if you are a student of statistics, you
will see that the odds just say that you can't get it done. In
fact, if you were talking to a Las Vegas bookmaker no one would
back you on the odds of getting it done. It's not going to happen.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If the odds are as bad as you say, then why are the venture
capitalists backing entrepreneurs?
 &HT;    The venture capitalists don't rely on all of these business
succeeding. It's about managing the downside risk with one or two
homeruns. If you're part of that living dead where the venture
capitalist can take his or her money out to even up, then that's an
OK thing so long as the venture capitalist has one Lycos, one
Amazon, or one eBay in the portfolio of investments. Having said
that, for every venture capitalist deal, there are another 1,000
that don't get financing. I see business plans coming across my
desk by the truckload. There are several hundred business plans a
month that get forwarded to us from folks who have ideas, concepts
and businesses. These are folks who are chasing dreams and, you
know, some of them may succeed. I am not trying to say don't do it,
I'm just trying be realistic about the odds and the odds are very,
very small.

 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 21)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ For Mexico's ruling party, this northern
industrial Mecca surrounded by jagged mountains is enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   But Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the presidential candidate of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is here to
shake the hands of the elite business class and hopefully win some
influential votes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the opposition National Action Party (PAN), has
ruled the border state of Nuevo Leon, a manufacturing and banking
hub.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida knows he is stumping on the turf of his closest rival,
the PAN's tough-talking Vicente Fox Quesada, a northerner himself.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Fox is catching up to, if not overtaking,
Labastida. In one recent survey, the respected Mexico City daily
Reforma showed Labastida leading Fox 42 percent to 40 percent _ a
statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dive from the 10-point lead Labastida had consistently
held earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I want to win with a bigger margin. I'm working to
win with a lead of 10 points difference,'' Labastida said Thursday
while on a campaign bus taking him to meet with members of a
teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most competitive election in Mexico's history,''
Labastida added. ``Now, why am I confident that we will win with
more than 10 percentage points? Because Fox's proposals don't have
consistency and people are perceiving it.''
</P>
<P>
   A calm economist who has worked in public service most of his
adult life, Labastida, 57, is unruffled six weeks before the July 2
general election, rattling off numbers with the ease of someone at
home with statistics.
</P>
<P>
   On a balmy Thursday, Labastida is in good spirits prior to a
lunch with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to talk to him (Kissinger) about many subjects, the
perspectives of the relationship of our two countries,'' Labastida
told a panel of radio hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has had 37 years in public service, from governing his
native Sinaloa state, to heading the Agriculture, Energy and
Interior secretariats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his experience, some in the PRI are worried at the
closeness of the race. The party has governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   As the election nears, the Labastida campaign called in all its
old political war horses to blunt the growing appeal of Fox and get
out the PRI vote.
</P>
<P>
   This has caused consternation in the Fox camp, which fears the
PRI may resort to fraud to win the election, as some believe
happened in the 1988 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a rancher who governed northern Guanajuato state, has said
he would challenge the results if PRI wins by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a thumbs-up to motorists who spot him through the bus
window, Labastida doesn't apologize for recruiting some of his
party's aging troops, called dinosaurs by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is the former governor of Puebla state, Manuel
Bartlett, who many Mexicans believe played a role in what they
allege was computer fraud that swung the 1988 race to the PRI
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always said I would have an inclusive government,''
Labastida said. ``They are participating in more than in my
campaign. They are coordinating campaigns for senate and
congressional candidates. ... Manuel is participating in our
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about the new PRI, you have to say what the new
PRI is. It is a more democratic PRI, a party that fights for
diversity. You can't say that from now on everyone in the PRI must
leave ... that only 20-year-olds can join. ... The possibility of
fraud is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI may have lost the statehouse of Nuevo Leon, but at a
luncheon for 1,300 at the exclusive Mexico-Palestinian-Lebanese
Club of Monterrey, Labastida attracted the big industrial guns.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is the first time the PAN has governed Nuevo Leon,
many top industrialists are divided between support for the PRI and
PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the richest people in Mexico,'' said Alfonso Guzman,
a city councilman in Monterrey's exclusive San Pedro district.
``And they got rich thanks to the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others at the luncheon, Guzman thinks Labastida will win
Nuevo Leon, with the help of the heavyweight businessmen of
Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida will rise in the next month,'' Guzman predicted.
``We were asleep because Labastida was strong, but now we think
not. It's `wake up, wake up, baby!'''

ON EVE OF ELECTION, SOME HAITIANS REJECT VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ She likes to go into her husband's
office. She sits behind his desk sometimes, a green bowl of spent
bullet casings within reach. And every morning at 7, she hosts
their radio show by herself, opening the program by saying hello to
her dead husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonjour Jean,'' says Michele Montas, widow of Jean Leopold
Dominique, Haiti's preeminent journalist, who was shot four times
in the head April 3 under a fuchsia-flowered bougainvillea in Radio
Haiti's courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the prelude to Haiti's first election in three
years, set for Sunday, an enormous logistical undertaking that has
been marred by spasms of violence such as the killing of Dominique
and more than a dozen others in April.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, after a pause of peace, came another incident: a
grenade launched at the metal gates of the Provisional Electoral
Council, the election headquarters, that injured at least three
passersby.
</P>
<P>
   The killings and the grenade incident both seem ``part of a
strategy to discourage people from going to vote,'' said Evans
Paul, spokesman for the opposition coalition party, Espace de
Concertation.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, breaking a long public
silence, called on Thursday for peaceful elections and denounced
those using violence to disrupt the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You who fear defeat and who choose violence, remember, we are
brothers and sisters. Haiti is for Haitians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one here dares guess how the election will unfold because the
insecurity factor stalks the process. Since the overthrow of the
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier in 1986, Haiti's 13 years of
fitful steps toward democracy have produced a trail of blood,
including election massacres in 1987, a military coup in 1991, and
more than three years of ruthless military dictators who oversaw
the killing of 5,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The dead are mostly forgotten now, especially in these hectic
days surrounding the vote for parliament and some 7,523 local
positions. Even the leading resisters of the old military rule,
people such as Father Jean Marie Vincent, businessman Antoine
Izmery, and Justice Minister Guy Mallory, all assassinated in the
early 1990s, are rarely mentioned now, their memories swallowed up
by reports of new dead.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Montas, though, and Radio Haiti's staff aren't ready to
let go of the memory of Dominique just yet.
</P>
<P>
   So she says good morning to him every day on air, and every day
the staff inserts recordings of his voice in the morning program
and then reruns his interviews at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique was tortured during the regime of ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, and he was forced into exile during Baby Doc's time,
because he was never afraid to speak out or to report news on his
radio station, the first in Haiti to broacast in the language of
the masses, Creole.
</P>
<P>
   When he and Michele returned to Haiti days after Baby Doc's
departure in 1986, tens of thousands of people welcomed him home at
the airport. It didn't mean he lived far from danger, though. In
the years after his return, he collected several dozen spent
cartridge casings from shots fired at the radio station.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, the station shut down. A month later, on May 3,
the staff went back to work because ``his death would been absurd
if we had given up and stopped working,'' Montas said. ``It was
essential to the country. I'm convinced that the assassin of my
husband wanted to block the whole electoral process and discourage
people from going to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the solutions to end the culture of violence are not simple,
she said this week, sitting in her husband's padded chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, and Jean said so, too, that the situation here is
comparable to that in Lebanon several years ago,'' said Montas, 53.
``No one is disarmed. You have weapons all over the place, in the
hands of all political factions. The country has never been as
heavily armed as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice, even more than five years after 20,000 US troops helped
remove the military leaders and restore Aristide as the
democratically elected president, seems as fleeting as ever, say
many Haitiains.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, in the tin-roofed slums of Martisan, three families
were mourning the deaths of three young men who were killed early
Saturday while in police custody. The three _ Alise Onore, Gusmane
Pierre and Alan Pierre _ were picked up on suspicion of stealing,
an accusation that the families denounced. Their bodies were found
with bullet holes in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killings need to stop in Haiti,'' said Rodney Michel, 39,
a neighbor of the victims, standing amid a crowd of 50 onlookers in
a concrete alleyway. ``Nothing has changed here. It's the same
thing as it was during the dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel as insecure as before,'' said Jean Robert, 25, a
friend of the three. ``If police are holding someone, how can they
end up dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors have threatened to hold protests until the killings
are explained and the killers are brought to justice. They also
have a more immediate need: money to bury the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family doesn't have a cent,'' Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths of three men and the killing of Dominique are
different in one way from all the deaths during the military
regime: they happened in a time of supposed democracy, and people
are voicing outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked by peasants, `What are we going to do now without
Jean Dominique? We lost our main voice,' '' Montas said. ``You
know, we just had a season here where a lot of bands play, and
several made up songs about Jean. One of them had a verse, `Every
peasant has to become the echo of Jean's voice so as to keep him
alive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She walked out of the radio station, past the spot where her
husband was shot dead, and opened a metal gate. Two armed guards
followed. They are new hires since the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   There was something on the gate she hadn't seen before, a piece
of paper barely held up by two strands of dirty masking tape. On it
was a poem to him _ and to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is 7. Bonjour Jean. Bonjour Michele,'' the note in French
began, exactly echoing their voices once upon a time.
</P>
<P>
   Her lower lip trembling just the slightest, Montas summoned her
composure and read it aloud:
</P>
<P>
   ``They have turned off his mouth but not his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You died for us, you live on for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``What time is it? It is a somber hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good bye Jean. Be courageous Michele.''

 &HT;    GUNS' ROLE IN SUICIDES RARELY DISCUSSED IN DEBATE ON CONTROLS
 &HT;    610&AMP;add. With GUN-DATA. For release Sunday, May 21.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gun control advocates talk about ``the gun show
loophole'' and ``child safety locks.'' People who support owning
firearms talk about ``our constitutional rights'' and
``self-defense.'' But one word is rarely mentioned in the gun
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide.
</P>
<P>
   This, despite the fact that more people in the United States die
from suicides than homicides, and most suicides are committed with
a gun.
</P>
<P>
   When groups pushing for gun control quote numbers for ``violent
gun deaths,'' they include suicides, which often account for more
than half of the total. When the National League of Cities erected
a ``Wall of Gun Deaths'' at the Million Mom March last week, 658 of
the names on it were suicide victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a gun in the home, the risk of suicide is five
times higher,'' said Kimberly Mariani, a spokesperson for Handgun
Control Inc., the leading gun-control advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group says reducing the number of guns will help reduce
suicides. They cite studies showing that many suicides are the
result of impulsive behavior and that the increased rate of youth
suicide over the past four decades is largely related to the use of
guns.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the suicide rate for teenagers 15 to 19 years old increased
11 percent from 1980 to 1997, and the majority of that increase is
due to gun suicides. In 1997, 1,135 teens in that age group
committed suicide with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Over all age groups, guns were involved in 17,566 of the 30,535
suicides that year, the CDC reported.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association denies that guns are responsible
for suicides.
</P>
<P>
   In a policy statement, the NRA says that ``nearly everything
gets blamed for suicide at one time or another _ love, hate,
religion, pain, boredom, fear, shame, guilt, alcoholism, drug
addiction, family dissolution ... terminal illness, old age and
even the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The group says firearms are ``merely implements utilized to
accomplish the act, implements for which others would be
substituted if firearms were not available.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA also contends that availability of guns in a city or
country does not translate into a high rate of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A cause-and-effect relationship between guns and suicide rates
is hard to establish.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the District of Columbia, the suicide rate is
lower than in any state, while the gun homicide rate is high.
</P>
<P>
   The low suicide rate is likely a consequence of the racial
makeup of the district, which is mostly black. In 1997, white males
accounted for 72 percent of all suicides, and whites as a group
accounted for 90 percent, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   International comparisons are of little help, because reporting
methods vary among countries, as do cultural and religious
attitudes towards suicide.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report from the World Health Organization,
the suicide rate in Israel is low _ 8.2 per 100,000 in 1996
compared to a U.S. rate of 19.3 _ even though many households have
guns because of compulsory military duty for men and women.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United Kingdom, where gun control laws are strict,
the 1997 suicide rate is also lower than in the United States, 11
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many counselors and doctors strongly support gun control as a
method of reducing suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Berman, executive director of the American Association of
Suicidology, said that the probability of death in a gun suicide
attempt is 92 percent, much higher than other methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, it's lethal in a moment of despair,'' he said.
``It doesn't give the person a chance to change their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   People who fail in a suicide attempt, Berman said, rarely try an
alternative method.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way the mind works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Firearm safety is one of the goals of the Washington-based
association, a non-profit group that promotes research and public
education about suicide and training for crisis volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Berman advocates several gun control proposals, including child
trigger locks, part of a juvenile crime package that is stuck in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate last year passed a crime bill that would require the
locks, require buyers at gun shows to undergo background checks,
and ban importing large-capacity ammunition clips. The bill would
also prohibit juveniles with serious criminal records from
possessing guns for life.
</P>
<P>
   A similar House bill did not include the gun provisions, and a
compromise between the two versions has eluded negotiators, with
the gun show language being the biggest sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Congress to move on gun-related legislation was a
major theme of the Million Mom March that drew several hundred
thousand marchers to the Washington Mall last week.

 &HT;    Con todo el alboroto, es muy dificil distinguir lo que es real y
lo que es virtual en el mundo demencial de la Web en America
Latina. Robert Davis tiene 43 anos, se crio en el estricto
vecindario de Dorchester, en Boston, y sabe algo de descartar lo
superfluo. Cuando Davis se convirtio en el primer empleado de Lycos
Inc. en junio de 1995, la empresa era poco mas que un proyecto de
investigacion en la Universidad de Carnegie-Mellon.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, bajo la direccion de su tenaz presidente ejecutivo,
Lycos se ha convertido en uno de los 10 principales websites de
Estados Unidos. Su valor de mercado ha aumentado a mas de US$7.000
millones; la inversion original fue de unos US$2 millones. Y se
expande por todo el mundo. Davis visito Miami recientemente para
anunciar el crecimiento de las operaciones de Lycos en America
Latina. En una entrevista exclusiva, hablo con el director de Latin
Trade, Mike Zellner, sobre las tendencias mas novedosas de la
Internet.

[risas...Las mayores oportunidades estan todavia en los websites de
comercio. Es mas dificil competir con los websites de contenido.
Hay varias entidades bien establecidas _ los medios tradicionales y
otros _ que han fortalecido sus marcas y tienen mucho dinero.
Frente a ellos es muy dificil crear algo importante. No quiere
decir que no se pueda hacer, pero es muy dificil. Los websites
verticales (los dedicados a un sector especifico) no suelentener la
masa critica de publico necesaria para conseguir ganancias.
 &HT;    Un momento, me perdi. Que quiere decir?
 &HT;    Si se observa la manera en que se invierte en publicidad se nota
que los gastos se concentran mas en la Web que en los medios
tradicionales. Hay tantos websites que la proporcion debe ser 98/2,
es decir, que el 98 por ciento de los fondos para publicidad van al
2 por ciento de los websites. De modo que los websites pequenos de
intereses especiales tienen dificultades para conseguir ingresos
por concepto de publicidad. Y terminan acudiendo a una red [de
ventas de publicidad como DoubleClick.net, Flycast.com o 24by7.com,
y confian en ellos para vender publicidad con un 40 por ciento de
descuento. Hoy es dificil establecer un website de contenido. Yo no
lo haria a pesar de que es nuestro negocio, y le aseguro que no
estoy tratando de desanimar a la competencia. Simplemente, es una
forma dificil de establecerse en estos momentos. Por otra parte, el
comercio tiene una base muy amplia. Hay muchos nichos que estan a
disposicion de las nuevas empresas. Hay nichos sin explotar a nivel
internacional.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Deme un ejemplo.
 &HT;    Suministros para hospitales. Productos quimicos. Farmacos.
Practicamente toda categoria de compraventa entre negocios que uno
pueda imaginar ofrece grandes oportunidades. Ademas, si uno observa
los productos del consumidor en linea, casi puede abrir las Paginas
Amarillas para buscar por categoria lo que todavia no se ofrece en
linea. Y hay mucho. Los electrodomesticos, por ejemplo, representan
una gran oportunidad, aunque puede ser dificil porque existe un
problema de entrega. De modo que es mas facil decir adonde uno no
iria y despues adonde iria, porque adonde uno iria esta limitado a
un punado de lugares donde ya hay competidores establecidos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que negocios evitaria?
 &HT;    Libros. Y discos compactos. Probablemente tampoco computadoras,
porque los margenes de ganancia son bajos y la competencia es
abundante. Ni software, por las mismas razones. En productos
electronicos hay numerosos competidores. En productos para animales
domesticos, lo mismo. Pero si uno avanza mas alla de una docena de
categorias de websites, posiblemente 20, el panorama se abre. No
hay competidores establecidos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Como se coloca entre el hospital y el suministrador del
hospital, por ejemplo, o entre el consumidor y el fabricante de
electrodomesticos para participar en el comercio entre los dos?
 &HT;    Lo que necesita es una proposicion concreta que diga como va a
beneficiar a la parte interesada. No es tan dificil como parece.
Los suministradores suelen estar obstaculizados por su historia, es
decir, generalmente tienen una burocracia establecida, una forma
tradicional de hacer las cosas que les dificulta evolucionar hacia
la Web. Estoy hablando en una conferencia en Orlando a unos dos mil
ejecutivos del sector manufacturero. Hay un grupo de personas que
estudia la Internet y dice lo que significa para mi y que efecto
tiene en mi negocio. Se que hay una oportunidad en alguna parte
pero no entiendo cual es ni como la utilizo. Cuando uno se fija
mas, todo el salon de la reunion se va convirtiendo en una
oportunidad de posibles asociaciones para el joven de 22 anos de
Mexico que quiere abrir una compania de la Internet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Como ese joven logra que el alma de la compania no se pierda al
buscar dinero?
 &HT;    Hay que ser listo. Si uno negocia durante varios meses para
conseguir las mejores condiciones, es posible que haya que ceder
menos control que si uno busca el dinero inmediatamente. Pero en
ese caso se pierde la ventaja de hacer el primer movimiento y uno
puede quedar fuera de la fiesta. Supongo que mi actitud seria la de
pensar que siempre es inteligente comer cuando se sirve la cena,
sobre todo en esa primera oportunidad de financiamiento. Si uno
tiene esa oportunidad, puede compararla con las alternativas pero
sin caer en la codicia, porque la codicia mata. Lo mas importante
es levantar el negocio lo antes posible.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hay forma de evitar la perdida de control?
 &HT;    Hay una gran diferencia entre tomar el dinero y ceder control.
Uno puede conseguir socios financieros maravillosos sin ceder mas
del 25 por ciento del negocio. En muchos casos, cediendo mucho
menos del 25 por ciento. No hay que caer en un ambiente en el que
los que respaldan dirijan la operacion por uno, ni uno debe
permitirse caer en ese tipo de ambiente. En el mercado actual, no
hace falta.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Adonde uno acude cuando busca dinero? A Wall Street? A un banco
de inversion? A fondos privados de inversion?
 &HT;    Suponiendo que se trata del joven de 22 anos, yo acudiria a
inversores de capital de riesgo. En estos momentos los fondos estan
abundantes, por lo tanto apreciarian mas lo que se trata de hacer.
Sin embargo, las probabilidades de exito financiero del joven son
infinitamente mayores si trabaja para una empresa establecida que
si trata de iniciar la suya.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Por que?
 &HT;    Veamos la realidad. Si hay suerte, cinco de cada 100 negocios
sobreviven. De esos cinco sobrevivientes, no mas del 1 por ciento
llega a ser algo mas que un muerto viviente, y cuando digo muerto
viviente, me refiero a un negocio que se mantiene activo pero que
no genera un rendimiento importante a largo plazo. Y probablemente
ese porciento sea una cifra generosa. Al final solo uno de cada
10.000 negocios, o menos, prospera. No es que quiera desalentar a
nadie, pero si uno estudia las estadisticas, vera que las
probabilidades indican que no se puede. Si uno habla con un
corredor de apuestas de Las Vegas, no le va a dar ningun respaldo
porque el negocio no va a triunfar.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Si las probabilidades son tan malas como usted dice, entonces
por que los inversores de capital de riesgo respaldan a los
empresarios?
 &HT;    Los inversores de capital de riesgo no confian en que todos
estos negocios triunfen. El secreto consiste en compensar el riesgo
con uno o dos goles. Si uno forma parte de esos muertos vivientes
en los que el inversionista de capital de riesgo puede retirar su
dinero, entonces no hay problemas siempre que el inversionista
tenga un Lycos, un Amazon o un eBay en su cartera. Por otra parte,
por cada acuerdo de inversion de capital de riesgo, hay otros mil
que no consiguen financiamiento. A mi escritorio llegan muchos
planes de negocio. De personas con ideas, conceptos y negocios nos
llegan cientos de planes al mes. Son gente que persigue un sueno y,
por supuesto, algunos pueden triunfar. No quiero decir que no lo
intenten; simplemente trato de ser realista al considerar las
probabilidades, y las probabilidades son infimas.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Con todo el alboroto, es muy dificil distinguir lo que es real y
lo que es virtual en el mundo demencial de la Web en America
Latina. Robert Davis tiene 43 anos, se crio en el estricto
vecindario de Dorchester, en Boston, y sabe algo de descartar lo
superfluo. Cuando Davis se convirtio en el primer empleado de Lycos
Inc. en junio de 1995, la empresa era poco mas que un proyecto de
investigacion en la Universidad de Carnegie-Mellon.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, bajo la direccion de su tenaz presidente ejecutivo,
Lycos se ha convertido en uno de los 10 principales websites de
Estados Unidos. Su valor de mercado ha aumentado a mas de US$7.000
millones; la inversion original fue de unos US$2 millones. Y se
expande por todo el mundo. Davis visito Miami recientemente para
anunciar el crecimiento de las operaciones de Lycos en America
Latina. En una entrevista exclusiva, hablo con el director de Latin
Trade, Mike Zellner, sobre las tendencias mas novedosas de la
Internet.

KOREA'S STOCK-EXCHANGE WORKERS MAY STRIKE OVER LUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Workers in South Korea are known for their
not-infrequent strikes over issues like pay and job security. But a
coming showdown with the Korea Stock Exchange will be the first
time they have threatened to strike over the right to have a
relaxing lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-thousand members of South Korea's securities industry
union are planning to strike during their lunch hour beginning
Monday, when the stock exchange plans to continue trading during
what has historically been a midday break. The change, approved by
the South Korean government, makes this country the first in Asia
to keep its stock exchange open during the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   Government and exchange officials are hoping the extended hours
will draw more investors to the exchange, where share prices have
fallen 29 percent in value so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers at domestic brokerage firms have expressed
skepticism that the move will make a difference in this or any
other Asian market, where, for decades, trading has been halted for
an hour at midday. Dealers expressed disgust and dismay at the
prospect of having to eat fast food in front of their computers
instead of going out to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans can function fine eating just hamburgers,'' said
Jung Yong-geon, president of the Korea Securities Trade Union.
``But we come from a culture of eating hot bowls of hearty
bean-paste stew and rice. Taking away our one-hour lunch breaks is
like shoving Western practices down our throats and taking away a
tradition that has been passed down for thousands of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others agreed with Jung, saying the negatives of working
through lunch outweigh any possible benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamburger meals just don't go well with Korean workers,'' said
Choi Won-yang, a dealer at Shinhan Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   Park Jae-han, a dealer at Hanvit Securities Co., said, ``It's
going to take much more than just an added hour of trading to turn
the bearish market around, so why can't they just let us eat in
peace?''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons that trading through lunch may not work,
securities industry workers said.
</P>
<P>
   One is that more than 70 percent of all investors in the South
Korean bourse are individuals, and many have personal relationships
with their dealers. Under the new trading hours, dealers said, they
would have no time to eat, as they would be effectively chained to
their desks and phones, advising clients throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, investors won't trade unless it is through a trusted
broker,'' Choi at Shinhan Securities said, explaining why deploying
dealers in shifts to cover the lunch hour was not a feasible
option.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Korea exchange have rejected such arguments.
They say it is high time that the securities industry in South
Korea, where hard work is an ingrained part of the culture, apply
that to buying and selling shares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Dealers can eat Korean food delivered to their offices,'' said
Kim Yu-kyung, head of securities research at the Korea Stock
Exchange. ``It won't be a big problem once people get used to the
new system.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that complications arising from working through lunch
should be settled between the management and workers at individual
brokerage firms, instead of creating difficulties for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea will be a test case for other Asian nations to
observe,'' said Yon Kang-keum, professor of finance at Yonsei
University. ``We can no longer wait and see until other nations set
precedents.''

&HT;     CHINA TRADE OPPONENTS CLAIM TRADE DEFICIT WOULD WORSEN

 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two Democratic congressmen charged Friday that
granting permanent normal trade relations to China would worsen the
U.S.-China trade deficit that reached $5.1 billion in March.
</P>
<P>
   They also argued that the agreement would encourage American
businesses to take advantage of cheap labor overseas and result in
the loss of American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said a Commerce Department report
Friday shows that China is selling more technology to the United
States than in previous years, and that the U.S.-China trade deal
the House is expected to vote on next week would continue that
trend.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote would confer permanent normal trade status on
China and is tied to a U.S.-China pact that calls for China to
lower its tariffs. In turn, the United States would end its annual
review of the U.S.-China trade status. That review has provided a
forum for critics of China's policies on human rights, the
environment and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is poised to have massive losses in high technology _
our jobs for the future,'' Kucinich told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. imports of Chinese-made camcorders, laser printers
and cellular telephones have already cut into U.S. manufacturing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   The overall U.S. trade deficit with China jumped from $7 billion
in 1988 to $70 billion last year. The U.S.-China trade deficit last
March was $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the No. 2 ranked Democrat leader in
the House, said ``the China trade deal won't help us export
American products, only American jobs. After all, how many cell
phones and how many SUVs and how many microwave ovens can you sell
to a Chinese factory worker who is making and earning 13 cents an
hour?''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the agreement said that since the deal would bring
more jobs to China and would lower import tariffs, the Chinese
people would be able to purchase more U.S. goods with their greater
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the medium-to-long term the deficit will definitely be
reduced,'' Daniel Cruise, a White House spokesman on trade, said in
an interview. ``There will be more and more middle income folks who
can buy more and more American products.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Crist, spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee,
said he expected that U.S. exports to China would eventually
outpace imports. In an interview, he said the trade agreement would
cut in half the average Chinese tariff for American farm products
and would require China to end its quotas on imports, creating
opportunities for American producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're best at exporting is high technology and products
that need qualified American labor,'' Cruise said.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade agreement passes the House, it is expected to be
approved by the Senate and President Clinton, who has lobbied
strongly for it as one of his final major policy initiatives.

 &HT;    Frugal. Thrifty. Cheap. Epithets? Maybe. Maybe not. Who hasn't
been a penny pincher?
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ever make washers by slicing up a garden hose?
Clip a coupon? Cut an old rubber glove into sections to make rubber
bands? Swipe the toilet paper from a hotel room?
</P>
<P>
   (While I am at it, did you buy this newspaper or pick it up off
a coffee shop table?) Then you might just be a thrifty person.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, some hide behind the guise of recycling while others
claim that that a-penny-saved-is-a-penny-earned thing is a vital
part of their financial strategy. Common-sense saving is normal;
miserliness is not. Truth is some people are, well, cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Saving a buck could be as easy as using those free CDs in the
mail for coasters. Why merely cut paper towels in half when you can
wash and reuse them? Why not wash sheets on a clothesline (if you
have one) and water the lawn at the same time like Aunt Elsie?
</P>
<P>
   Tales of separating toilet paper sheets to conserve or removing
makeup with petroleum jelly are fairly common and harmless. I am
concerned about those who wash and reuse Q-Tips, shave their legs
with hair conditioner or anchor a golf tee with another tee and
string.
</P>
<P>
   Do you figure a waiter's tip to the penny? Fine. Steal the tip
off another table? Not so fine. Never go to a restaurant because
you have a panic attack over tipping? Therapy time.
</P>
<P>
   But where does that tendency toward thrift come from? Is it ever
harmful? Want to know more about stretching a dollar? This edition
of the Greig Files answers these queries and peeks into the world
of the cost conscious.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S TO BLAME: THE PULPIT OR THE PURITANS?
</P>
<P>
   For the national attitude toward thrift? Both.
</P>
<P>
   Freed of the restraints of class barriers and royalty, the
colonists worked like the dickens, revering production and
disdaining consumption. Through discipline and hard work (and of
course unlimited land and opportunity) the pioneers were confident
of success. When you are settling a prairie, long-term
gratification comes naturally, as does resourcefulness and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Many religions praise a pared-down lifestyle and refraining from
material desires. In Hinduism one reaches a higher state of life
through renouncing worldly possessions, for example. Then there is
Calvinism, which offered the possibility of salvation through being
diligent with resources.
</P>
<P>
   And the New Testament is chock-full of sobering reminders of the
merits of husbandry such as in Matthew: ``And again I say unto you,
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   EVER HEARD OF THE SUMPTUARY LAWS?
</P>
<P>
   These days, they are called sin taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Originally intended to define classes by regulating diet and
dress in England, the Puritans were no strangers to the concept of
better living though frugality. Ostentation was shunned; propriety,
prized.
</P>
<P>
   If you were living in 17th-century Massachusetts, legislation
forbid ``the wearing of gold or silver lace, or buttons, or points
at their knees, (walking) in great boots; or women of the same rank
to wear(ing) tiffany hoods or scarves . . .'' Many of the New World
colonists were subject to import taxes on luxury items, including
sugar, spice, wine and tobacco, reports the Acton Institute for the
Study of Religion and Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Overindulgence was a moral and legal no-no.
</P>
<P>
   WHO IS THE TIGHTEST PERSON YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he is, there is no way he could be cheaper than the
French millionaire Samuel Tapan, who committed suicide in a fit of
depression after losing $50,000. Mind you, Tapan still had $1.5
million in cash along with castles and vineyards galore. Relatively
speaking, the loss was negligible. He was a bargain-hunter to the
end _ literally _ as Tapan reportedly haggled over the price of the
rope he used to hang himself.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the waste-not-want-not, wildly wealthy Howard Hughes?
This gazillionaire lived on cans of chicken soup for weeks and
reheated the same portion several times so as not to waste a drop.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be more frugal than the reputed witch of Wall Street,
whaling ship heiress Henrietta Howland Green, who wore newspapers
for petticoats and heated her lunch (oatmeal _ yum, yum) on an
office radiator to save fuel?
</P>
<P>
   Know anyone more tightfisted than oilman Haroldson LaFayette
Hunt, who always carried his own lunch to work in a brown paper
bag, a bag he reused until it disintegrated?
</P>
<P>
   For more about the lives and stewardly ways of the wealthy,
check out Karl Shaw's ``Mammoth Book of Oddballs and Eccentrics.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS ARE CHEAP?
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   No one in my research into the world of spendthrifts matches
this gentleman. (The story can be told only because I agreed not to
use names.)
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. X's son married, the traditional rehearsal dinner was
held. Does this financially comfortable father of the groom rent a
hall? A restaurant? A hotel's private dining room? No, this bon
vivant took the entire wedding party (20-plus folks) to that
bastion of prenuptial indulgence _ Long John Silver's. (No, I did
not make this up.)
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the wedding eve festivities held at this fast food
restaurant, but the guests were instructed to sit at tables for
four since the coupons (yes, the coupons) the father of the groom
was using were only good for groups of four. Separate checks,
please. (Imagine George and Nina Banks' chagrin.)
</P>
<P>
   The good news? The fried fish send-off did not deter marital
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ARE YOU SURROUNDED BY JACK BENNY WANNABES?
</P>
<P>
   D.G. is. She takes ribbing regularly for the frugal family in
which she lives.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband tapes holes in plastic bags so they can be reused
indefinitely. Not so wacky, but he also saves the microwave popcorn
duds (unpopped kernels) until he has enough to pop a ``free''
serving. ``What do you expect from an engineer?'' she moaned to me
in her missive.
</P>
<P>
   D.G.'s father-in-law saves napkins and condiments from fast-food
restaurants and airlines (which, by the way, have a six-month shelf
life) and her grandmother used scraps for quilts or braided them
into rag rugs or pot-holders.
</P>
<P>
   And a gift that keeps on giving? D.G.'s church friend sends
greeting cards (complete with envelope) in oversized envelopes with
a signature on a Post-it note inside so the card may be reused.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IS THRIFTINESS NEXT TO ZANINESS?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it has a significant negative impact on your quality of
life and your functioning,'' notes psychologist Dianne Lindewall.
If your family does not mind that you never leave a tip, it is not
a problem; but if such behavior causes stress in the family _ look
out.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of such interruption include the inability to do routine
tasks. Can't work because you are unable to let a moment go by
without checking stock prices? Unable to walk through the living
room because it is filled with unread magazines? Then you may have
a problem and need professional help.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT HOARDING?
</P>
<P>
   That is often a sign of a past institutionalization, says
Lindewall. Once the concept of private property has been
compromised, it is difficult for anyone to trust in it again.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, many American families are still reacting to
the impact of the Great Depression as well as the home front
sacrifices necessary in World War II. So the Oreos under the bed,
the dissatisfaction with what appears to be substantial savings, a
distrust of banks and financial institutions or the need to
stockpile anything is normal behavior for some.

 &HT;    Henley says he shares concerns with listeners
 &HT;    By Chris Riemenschneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Say you're a rock star making the kind of money
that small countries do. OK, medium-sized countries. You're
reuniting with your old bandmates who, it turns out, can stand each
other's company in this particular fiscal period. You've met the
girl of your dreams and want to start a family. Everything is going
great.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quick and blindsiding as earthquakes can be, your beach
home in Malibu slides into the ocean and you've got no place to
hang your platinum albums.
</P>
<P>
   That's how 1994 went for Don Henley. That same year, not
surprisingly, the famed Eagles singer and native Texan decided to
move back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I commute to Los Angeles,'' said Henley, 52, who grew up
in Linden, Texas and today lives in Dallas with his wife, model
Sharon Summerall, and their three children.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation, the earthquake, the reunion with the Eagles and
especially the new family explain why Henley is just now getting
back into solo-career mode, 11 years after his last new album came
out. His latest CD, ``Inside Job,'' hits stores Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone last weekend in Los Angeles, where he was
rehearsing with his band, Henley said he doesn't regret leaving
L.A. for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it a little difficult for me on the business end
because I have to be away a lot more. But it's working fine on the
family front. My wife's family is near us, and of course my mother
still just lives up the road a piece. It was important to us that
our kids grow up around their grandparents, aunts and uncles and
cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Family plays a big part on ``Inside Job,'' too. Half the songs
are based around Henley's new lifestyle, including ``Taking You
Home'' and ``My Thanksgiving.'' In the opening line of ``Everything
Is Different Now,'' the singer comes right out and says it: ``I
hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley said he has been surprised by reactions thus far to those
new songs, as many believe he has turned a new leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm definitely happier than I've ever been before, but
people say that as if I weren't happy before,'' he said. ``I've
always been a happy kind of guy, I just had a few axes to grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like these songs had some universal sentiments to
express. I think people of my generation, and other generations
too, who have families, can relate to these songs.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the record, to use his own words, features the
old ax-grinding Don Henley. In songs like ``Nobody Else in the
World'' and ``Workin' It,'' he takes on burgeoning corporate
America with lines like, ``We've got a whole new class of
opiates.'' Meanwhile, ``Goodbye To a River'' shows Henley's
unflinching commitment to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Henley said moving back to Texas has made him even more
concerned about the issues of his native state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas' frontier mentality and the notion that there is still
plenty of everything is of a bygone era,'' he said. ``But our fine
Texas Legislature is, as always, pandering to business interests,
while kids in Texas are developing asthma and respiratory diseases
in epidemic numbers. We still have coal-fired factories in East
Texas spewing out toxins by the ton. . . . And then there's our
governor. There were others before him who cared even less, but the
notion that the air or the environment under Governor Bush has
improved is a myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley's environmental commitments hogged much of his time in
the spotlight throughout the '90s, particularly surrounding his
support for the Henry David Thoreau-inspired Walden Woods Project,
about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the reunion with Eagles _ two of whom, Glenn Frey and
Don Felder, perform on ``Inside Job,'' as does Jimmie Vaughan _ Don
Henley music was scarce in the '90s. In the midst of a contract
battle with Geffen Records, the label released ``Actual Miles,'' a
collection of his solo hits, including ``Dirty Laundry'' and Grammy
winners ``The Boys of Summer'' and ``The End of the Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley said he probably would have taken a break from his music
even if things hadn't gone the way they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `The End of the Innocence,' I was tired of touring,
tired of being in the limelight, tired of the business,'' he said.
``Then grunge came in in the early '90s, and I didn't particularly
see a place where I fit. I'm one of those people who believe you
don't have to dance every dance. Sometimes it's good to sit one
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the recent comeback success of Santana and, to a lesser
extent, Steely Dan, Henley believes the timing is right for his
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wheel has taken another turn,'' he said. ``I think
there are 78 million baby boomers who really don't have a lot to
listen to, who don't have any music that speaks to their lives and
concerns. I've grown up and gone through a lot, like the rest of
them, and here's what I have to show for it.''

&HT;     MICHIGAN HOUSE MEMBERS ILLUSTRATE SPLIT OVER CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the China trade bill nears a pivotal House vote
next week, Reps. Dave Camp and James A. Barcia, both of Michigan,
are firmly set in their opposite positions, reflecting Congress'
contentious split on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, a Midland Republican, is strongly for the measure. Barcia,
a Bay City Democrat, is staunchly against it.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the landmark legislation to grant China permanent
trade ties with the United States say it appears headed for
passage, but scores of House members are still undecided and the
outcome is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, a fifth-term conservative who serves on the trade
subcommittee of the House Ways and Means panel, is a self-described
free-trader who favors a permanent commercial relationship with
China because he thinks it would help farmers in the state's 4th
congressional district, which he represents.
</P>
<P>
   Barcia, a fourth-term Democrat who reliably backs organized
labor and votes against international trade agreements, opposes the
China deal because, he said, other countries, especially China,
renege on such pacts. He argued that the China pact would hurt
farmers in his area, the 5th congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Camp has voted every year after he was elected in 1990 to renew
China's trade privileges, a two-decade-old annual rite that would
end if the country's trading ties are extended permanently. Camp
also supported the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
that opened U.S. trade channels with Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Camp said in an interview that his district's farmers who grow
sugar beets, potatoes, mint and fruit have watched crop prices fall
and are anxious to find new markets for their produce in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a huge potential market for us,'' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not have enough arable land to support their people,''
he said. ``They may as well import from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1992, Barcia, who serves on the House Science
Committee and the Transportation Committee, voted in 1993, 1994 and
1996 to renew China's trade ties with the United States but says he
opposed renewal in 1995 and 1997 through last year because of the
escalating trade deficit with China. He also voted against NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Barcia's position pits him against President Clinton, who has
made the legislation a top foreign policy priority. But that's
nothing new for the conservative lawmaker. Barcia has voted only
slightly more than half the time with Clinton and the majority of
his House colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Barcia said in an interview that farmers in his district,
especially sugar beet growers, are upset over what they see as
violations of the NAFTA pact by Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great suspicion and universal disappointment over
NAFTA from our agricultural producers,'' Barcia said. ``It seems
all of our trade agreements are negotiated from a weak
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Barcia said the United States has been more interested in
importing goods than exporting them. ``We have consistently taken
it on the chin on trade agreements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barcia accused China of failing to stop knockoffs of
American-made VCR tapes. ``I am for engaging with China,'' he said.
``I am for honest trade, but based on China's track record, that
doesn't look like the direction we're going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Barcia added that correspondence from his congressional
district, which has many retired and active auto workers, has been
``overwhelmingly against'' permanent trade ties with China. He said
organized labor had lobbied him heavily to vote against the China
trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he felt ``great pain'' in opposing Midland-based
Dow Chemical Co., which would benefit from the China bill because
it would have a new market for its fertilizer and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he feels that overall China's farmers would hurt
America's with added food exports.
</P>
<P>
   Like other opponents of the China trade pact, Barcia cited the
country's poor record on human rights and said if the annual review
of Beijing's trade status ends, the United States will lose its
leverage in opposing China's human rights abuses, including forced
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Barcia, who is co-chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus, said he
finds China's one-child limit ``repugnant'' because it forces women
to have abortions. ``The government has no right to interfere in
such a personal decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp, on the other hand, said both sides ``agree that China
mistreats its people.'' But he added, ``I believe the best way to
change that is to expose them to our way of life. Ignoring them is
not the way to bring about change.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp said if more American companies do business in China, they
will pay higher wages and help create a middle class in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Camp says he has been lobbied hard by members of organized labor
who have warned him they will do anything they can to defeat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a particularly helpful tactic,'' Camp said.

Several who the mayor called said he told them he wasn't running
because of concerns over his health. Mrs. Clinton, in Brooklyn for

happens on the other side.'' she said. (Vejnoska, Atlanta

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another unseasonably cool day will prevail across parts of
eastern New England and the northern middle Atlantic seaboard, as
chilly ocean winds work in tandem with clouds. Patches of drizzle
and light rain will add to the raw feel of the day in several
coastal locations.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms, some with heavy rains, will erupt along
a cold front extending from the Middle Atlantic States to the
western Gulf states. The lack of a potent upper-air disturbance,
however, will limit severe weather to just a few spots.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent thunderstorms will develop in West Texas as
humid air from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted by a weak upper-air
disturbance. Thunderstorms are possible in Florida, but very warm
air several thousand feet aloft will keep storms isolated.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HAIL STREAKS
</P>
<P>
   Hailstones as big as baseballs strafed the Chicago suburb of
Niles on Thursday. Hail falls from severe thunderstorms in streaks,
much like white stripes painted on a newly resurfaced highway by
large machines. The diameter of a severe-thunderstorm machine spans
tens of miles, but the hail streak painted on the landscape by such
a storm has average dimensions of about one mile wide and a few
miles long. Because of their small size and infrequency, hail
streaks with large hailstones are not often observed in urban
areas, just as tornadoes do not frequent cities.

NISSAN REPORTS HUGE LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Nissan Motor Co., Japan's third-largest carmaker,
reported Friday one of the biggest losses ever recorded by a
nonfinancial company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's losses widened to 684.4 billion yen on a
consolidated basis, or $6.3 billion at current exchange rates, in
the fiscal year that ended March 31, as Nissan erased outstanding
pension liabilities, adopted new accounting practices and moved to
close plants and cut employees.
</P>
<P>
   All of those steps were part of the painful overhaul Nissan has
undertaken with the tutelage of a team of executives dispatched
from Renault SA of France, which purchased a 37 percent stake in
Nissan in March 1998 and effectively controls it.
</P>
<P>
   There were bright spots and sobering elements in Nissan's
announcement, which was largely as expected. That one of Japan's
mightiest companies has moved decisively to address its problems
squarely in hopes of rebuilding a sound and profitable business has
excited investors not only about Nissan but also about other parts
of Japan Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But few other companies here have swallowed the bitter medicine
that Nissan is quaffing, even though Nissan is not alone in its
problems. Others, like Sogo and Nagasakiya, two large retailers,
have essentially collapsed, effectively passing their problems on
to their banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many, many more are simply chipping away at their challenges,
rather than meeting them head on.
</P>
<P>
   Not Nissan. In the last fiscal year, the company took 711.1
billion yen, or $6.6 billion at current exchange rates, in
nonrecurring charges. It wrote off some $3 billion of pension
liabilities, began taking steps to close five plants, assigned more
realistic values to real estate and securities holdings, and
adopted new accounting standards aimed at increasing transparency
and bringing the company closer to international practices.
</P>
<P>
   It sold assets and reduced debt, bringing its interest expenses
down 30 percent. Some 6,500 jobs were eliminated through a
combination of asset sales and early retirement. Purchasing costs
were pruned 8 percent, as roughly 20 percent of the company's
suppliers were dropped and the rest were forced to come up with
savings of at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And late in the fiscal year, the shock therapy started to pay
off. Analysts were predicting that at best Nissan would eke out
some 40 billion yen in operating profits because the company issued
a surprise profit warning on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings aside, it managed to produce operating earnings of 82.6
billion yen, which Carlos Ghosn, the company's president and chief
operating officer, contended was a result of the acceleration of
Nissan's restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revival plan is going faster and cutting deeper than
planned,'' he said. ``It will result in strong performance both in
growth and cost reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the company has not yet staged a turnaround. While
operating profits were better than expected, they were still down
31.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most alarming was the 10.5 percent slide in sales, which fell to
5.97 trillion yen, or $55.3 billion, from 6.6 trillion yen in
fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn contended that while lower, the sales in fiscal 1999 were
more profitable than in the previous year because fewer incentives
were deployed to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the current fiscal year, the company expects sales to rise
2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It expects net profits of at least 60 billion yen, 40 billion of
which will come from Nissan's operations and the rest from asset
sales. ``We will be profitable next year,'' Ghosn said.

 &HT;    Wonder of waterfalls
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTAHOOCHEE NATIONAL FOREST, Ga. _ Eyes up, arms outstretched,
Mark Morrison takes in the glimmering cascade. It tumbles over a
sheer rock face, crashes into a bed of broken stones below and
courses past dense thickets of rhododendron and towering hemlock
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this beautiful?'' Morrison exclaims, grinning. He should
know. The 47-year-old railroad engineer is one of the Southeast's
most ardent admirers of waterfalls. In a little more than a decade,
he's visited more than 400 in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Amicalola or Anna Ruby, are heavy-traffic falls. But
many, like this sequestered splasher on Little Ridge Creek south of
Neels Gap, are virtual secrets, represented only by anonymous blue
ticks on topographical maps.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be anonymous for long. A former surveyor and
skilled photographer, Morrison has published four books on
Southeastern falls, including ``Waterfall Walks and Drives in
Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee'' in 1996 and ``Waterfall Walks and
Drives in the Great Smoky Mountains and the Western Carolinas''
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The homemade guides _ typeset on an Adobe Pagemaker computer
program at Morrison's home and transcribed, packed and shipped by
wife Deeanna _ are full of common-sense advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pretend to be a writer,'' he says modestly. ``The
books are basically directions.''
</P>
<P>
   When is the best time to visit a waterfall? ``Go when they
flow!'' Morrison tells readers. ``Many of these spectacular falls
will be disappointing in the dry months of summer and fall.''
Morrison recommends visiting in the winter or spring, or after a
good rain.
</P>
<P>
   But what directions. Armed with his surveyor's acumen and a
measuring wheel (as well as permission from various land management
officials), Morrison has plotted explicit paths to more than 250
waterfalls. Hikers accustomed to the vagueness of many park maps
will flip over their walking sticks when they read Morrison's route
to Little Ridge Falls:
</P>
<P>
   ``An old logging road . . . ascends moderately through a tunnel
of rhododendron and crosses three branches, each of which are .1 of
a mile apart. After crossing the third branch (just over .3 of a
mile into the hike), pace off 300'. There, look carefully for a
slim path leading 45 degrees to the right . . . (There may be a
coffee table-sized boulder in the road for further verification.)
This leads approximately 100' to the creek bank. . . .
</P>
<P>
   On the creek's east side, hike uphill to intersect a logging
road which parallels Little Ridge Creek upstream. In .1 of a mile
reach a point where the pathway steepens. The lower falls may be
seen from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's obsessive approach is paying off _ he has sold more
than 40,000 books through chain stores such as Borders and Barnes &AMP;
Noble, as well as the online retailer Amazon.com and his own Web
site, www.waterfallwalks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The methodical measuring sprang from an interest in nature
photography. Morrison's been an avid shutterbug since 1985, when he
bought his first 35mm camera. ``I was baffled by the thing at
first, and used all the automatic settings,'' he remembers. He
quickly grew more assured _ his books and Web site feature gorgeous
color shots taken mostly with a Nikon FM2. (His beloved Nikon N90S
ended up in a creek on one of his hikes.)
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison found that ferreting out waterfalls to shoot could
sometimes be frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up a lot of free info about locations,'' he says.
``And many times I would end up lost.''

WORLDCOM-SPRINT DEAL MAY PIVOT ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being a forgotten word for two decades, ``antitrust'' is
again a part of the U.S. government's vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   As if seeking a breakup of Microsoft wasn't enough, Justice
Department lawyers recommended last week that WorldCom's $115
billion takeover of Sprint be blocked.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could still get done; representatives from both
companies will argue their case this week before Joel Klein, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's
antitrust division. But Washington has been regulating the
telephone business for so long that there presumably is already a
strong sense at Justice of what is anticompetitive and what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Mahoney, director of telecommunications investing at
Dresdner RCM Global Investors, took time last week to discuss what
may happen if the deal blows up or is drastically restructured.
Following are excerpts from the conversation:  &QL; 
Q. The Justice Department is apparently concerned about
consequences of combining the No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance
carriers, and about dominance in Internet switching services. Are
those valid concerns? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. The Internet switching thing is not a surprise, and WorldCom has
said they will deal with that. But the issue with long distance has
been bigger than WorldCom has been willing to admit.
</P>
<P>
   They have argued that AT&AMP;T will still be the dominant force, and
that once the Baby Bells get into long distance, there will be lots
of new competitors. Both of these have been specious arguments.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that AT&AMP;T will remain the dominant player, but
this combination will constrict the long-distance business into too
few hands.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Baby Bells are concerned, WorldCom is right that
there will be more competition, but it hasn't happened yet. Only
New York has allowed a Baby Bell to offer long distance.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. What are the consequences for WorldCom if it doesn't acquire
Sprint? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There is a big minus and a small plus if the deal doesn't
happen. The small plus is they won't have paid a lot for Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But they won't have the wireless piece of the pie, and
strategically they need that. It would put them back in the market
for a wireless property, and there are not many.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Who might WorldCom go after? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There are only six names of up-and-running wireless operators:
Verizon, which is jointly owned by Bell Atlantic and Vodaphone,
which is almost certainly not for sale; AT&AMP;T Wireless, which is
also not going to get sold; SBC and BellSouth's wireless
properties; Sprint PCS; Nextel; and Voice-stream, which is in the
process of becoming a national player.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom could go after a regional player, plus bid in the
upcoming auctions for wireless spectrum later this year, but if
they can't have Sprint PCS, it would make more sense to go after
Voicestream or Nextel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Who might bid for the Internet switching business if WorldCom is
forced to sell?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. The Internet business is a very attractive business, and I
understand Sprint's is state of the art. Any of the foreign
carriers might be interested; so might Williams Companies, which is
building out its own network.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. What are the odds now that WorldCom-Sprint will go through?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. A week ago I thought it was a little better than 50-50; now I
think it is a little bit less.
</P>
<P>
   The onus is on WorldCom to do some fancy footwork to get it
done. Bernie Ebbers at WorldCom is a very resourceful man, but I
wish he had moved more aggressively sooner on long distance. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. WorldCom is likely to argue, a la Microsoft, that the
telecommunications industry is changing so rapidly that the
competitive landscape is not what Justice makes it out to be. Is
there any merit to that? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. There is a little bit of that in this industry, but not like
there is in the software business.
</P>
<P>
   Software is not regulated by the government; in very important
ways, telecommunications still is. When we talk about entrants of
new long-distance competition, we are really talking about a
political process.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, when you look at software you can make a very
good case that it will innovate rapidly over the next couple of
years. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. Which stocks in the business do you like?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. We really like Voicestream and Nextel. We like WorldCom but
would like all of this to get settled.
</P>
<P>
   We don't own Sprint right now, because the benefits of the
WorldCom deal are already built into the share price.
</P>
<P>
   And we don't own AT&AMP;T either, because we feel they have a lot of
operating problems. Hopefully they will work through them. But the
combination of having a lot to lose on their long-distance business
and the operating issues are enough to make us wait and see if they
get through them. &QL;

`FRASIER' TOPS `MILLIONAIRE' BY WIDE MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scoring one of the first noteworthy dents in the ratings armor
of the ABC game show hit ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' NBC's
``Frasier'' won a smashing victory on Thursday night with its
hourlong season finale. ``Frasier'' racked up a 22 rating, while
``Millionaire'' trailed well back with a 12.2. (Each rating point
represents just over 1 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   More painful for ABC is how badly ``Frasier'' beat
``Millionaire'' among young adult viewers, by 16.8 rating points to
5.4.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also tried to thwart the season finale of ``E.R.'' with a
documentary about how ``Millionaire'' is made, and it, too, was
thoroughly beaten. ``E.R.'' had a 22.3 rating to just 9.4 for the
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' has proved to be the strongest competitor for
``Millionaire,'' beating it several times in the last month. But
``Frasier'' is now off for the summer, and ``Millionaire'' will
continue with original shows all summer long.

 &HT;    Going with the flow: Here are some of the best
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``A waterfall is the surprise at the end of a hike,''
says falls watcher Mark Morrison. And each is startling in its own
way. We asked the 47-year-old Douglasville resident, author of four
guidebooks on Southeastern waterfalls, to describe, in his words,
the most distinctive cascades in Georgia . . . and slightly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most scenic: Falls on Big Creek, Chattahoochee National
Forest, east of Clayton. ``The falls tumble in three small leaps
through about a 4- to 5-foot channel in the rock. The rock to the
right is especially pretty _ it's multicolored with moss and
lichens. The falls end in a beautiful, deep, blue-green pool. Then
you have the surrounding hemlocks and white pines, which give the
area almost an alpine look.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most peaceful: Crow Creek Falls, Chattahoochee National
Forest, near Lake Rabun. ``The falls aren't hard to get to _ you
can drive to within 300 feet of them _ but hardly anybody goes
there. They are on the back side of Lake Rabun, and it seems that
people don't venture to that side very often. The waterfall spills
over four small ledges and flows into a shallow, shady-bottomed
pool surrounded by dense rhododendron. A steep mountain slope with
hemlock trees and chestnut stumps flanks the left side.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most unusual. Virgin Falls, Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee.
``The falls are located on a creek that flows out of a cave, then
drops 110 feet into a sinkhole. The water disappears into the earth
_ it does not run on from there. I think it eventually ends up in
the Caney Fork River.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia's best-kept secret. The Falls on Horse Branch,
Chattahoochee National Forest, west of Clayton. ``Nobody knows
about this one. I haven't found it represented on maps _ I heard
about it from a fellow in Rabun County. An old logging road that
descends to Horse Branch Creek. You have to hike up the creek
three-tenths .3 of a mile, through a jungle of rhododendron. The
waterfall runs over stratified rock. It's unlike the granites that
you normally see _ there are hundreds of layers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most difficult to reach (included in book): Lee Falls, Sumter
National Forest, South Carolina. ``The last time I was up there,
about a year ago, they had a lot of storm damage. You have to hike
the last half-mile to the falls wading through Tamassee Creek, and
I had to go over and under a lot of fallen trees. But it's
beautiful there _ the whole rock wall is green with mosses and
water plants. It's about the greenest place I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Most difficult to reach (not included in book): Flat Creek
Falls, east of Clermont. ``I didn't even publish directions to this
one because I felt it was too difficult. The trail is virtually
straight up the side of a mountain. Once you get to the waterfall,
it's all barren rock, like Stone Mountain. There's nothing to stand
on or hold on to. I hiked up through rhododendron as thick as it
could be. It's very pretty but very dangerous.''

A POWERFUL BANKER'S OTHER HAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By DEAN SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Hugh McColl Jr., chairman and chief executive
of Bank of America, was on the warpath again. ``I'll be damned if
anyone calls me `gutless,''' he said as he stalked the newsroom of
the local paper, looking for the writer who used that word to
describe business leaders like him in a column on downtown
revitalization. ``Pretty damn funny,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   With the same determination he has brought to building the
nation's largest bank, McColl, in the home state of Sen. Jesse
Helms, has braved the opposition of local politicians and some of
his shareholders to pursue civic goals that he frankly describes as
liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is a power broker both feared and admired, known to
allies as Uncle Hugh and to foes as Little Caesar. His thumbs up or
down on a big-ticket civic project reveals his philosophy while
going a long way to determining its fate.
</P>
<P>
   A children's library and theater complex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very important to us,'' he said, and $27 million in county
bonds he supported will set it in motion this year.
</P>
<P>
   A publicly funded sports arena? ``A $220 million giveaway,'' he
said, and demanded that the Charlotte Hornets NBA team put up
``serious money'' before the project goes forward.
</P>
<P>
   His willingness to pursue his civil rights and urban renewal
goals nationally has helped earn him recognition as Bill Clinton's
favorite banker. One minute, McColl is thundering about Wall Street
undervaluing his bank's stock _ stalled at around $50 from a high
above $74 as investors wait for the 1998 merger of McColl's
NationsBank and BankAmerica to pay off. The next, he is cooing
about his company's widely admired record of seeking diversity.
</P>
<P>
   McColl has had Clinton's ear since they met in 1992. The
businessman was happy to find a politician who could discuss the
minutiae of interstate banking rules. In ``McColl: The Man with
America's Money'' (Longstreet Press, 1999), Ross Yockey says McColl
helped persuade Clinton of the wisdom of loosening these rules,
helping McColl to build a 21-state empire with assets of $656
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The future president was happy to find a banker committed to
financing inner-city and minority-owned businesses. Bank of America
announced this month that it made $39 billion in such community
reinvestment loans last year.
</P>
<P>
   In no way, though, does McColl wear his politics more obviously
than in his support of the arts. When a local production of Tony
Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Angels in America: A Gay
Fantasia,'' prompted conservative politicians to eliminate $2.5
million in county arts funding in 1997, McColl, a champion of gay
rights whose bank extends health coverage to partners of the same
gender, raised money in 1998 to defeat them and elect Democrats who
restored the funding last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, by today's definition, I'm a liberal,'' he says,
looking back on an ugly political fight that he felt blackened the
city's eye. ``The reason I am is, I believe that a chief guarantee
of our country, of citizenship, is the right of freedom of speech,
the right to be who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But who elected McColl, his local adversaries ask. ``I was
aghast,'' Hoyle Martin, one of the defeated county commissioners,
said of hearing that McColl was working against him. ``We can't let
big business run everything.''
</P>
<P>
   McColl's social crusading might seem at odds with his image as a
hard-charging ex-Marine known for the hand grenade he kept on his
desk. But McColl, who grew up in the small town of Bennettsville,
S.C., was offended when he returned home after training with blacks
in boot camp to hear friends using racial epithets. As a student at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he witnessed a
cross-burning.
</P>
<P>
   Watching his mother draw in charcoal and sculpt in clay
stimulated his interest in the arts. McColl's 25-year friendship
with the fresco painter Ben Long has inspired him to make Bank of
America one of the top arts donors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who do not share his enthusiasms grumble about the
tacitly required donations to the United Way and the local arts
council. But McColl is unapologetic: ``I think of it as community
development money and marketing money, but mainly community
development.''
</P>
<P>
   From shareholders, McColl has run into resistance over both the
company's political donations and his own pay, valued by experts at
more than $70 million last year. At the bank's annual meeting last
month, shareholders presented resolutions to end political
contributions and restrict the board's executive pay committee to
outside directors. Both proposals failed, but the pay resolution
received 14.5 percent _ high for any measure opposed by a corporate
board.
</P>
<P>
   But those who do not like McColl or his politics had better not
take too much comfort from his turning 65 next month. While some
shareholders expected him to announce his retirement plans at the
meeting last month, McColl said nothing about leaving. &QL;

 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional
Newspapers) SOUTHERNERS STRUGGLE WITH CHINA TRADE VOTE  
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ It is the biggest
vote of the short congressional career of South Carolina Rep. Jim
Demint and the freshman Republican is feeling the heat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative groups are running ads in his district, assailing
the lack of human rights in China. He faces pressure from local
textile executives worried about more competition from Asia.
Colleagues opposed to normalized trade with China are warning that
it will be the political mistake of his life should he approve the
trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet DeMint, after a listening tour of his Upstate district, is
leaning toward supporting permanent normal trade relations with
China, figuring the agreement will provide new openings for
American firms that already have to contend with competition from
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't see how this is going to hurt,'' said a DeMint
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   DeMint's struggle is typical of the plight of congressional
Southerners who remain undecided on the issue. They are torn
between human rights and free enterprise, business and labor,
textiles and high-tech, their own communities and the overall state
and national economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complex issue,'' Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., wrote
recently. ``There can be benefits for America, but are their
benefits for Eastern North Carolina?''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Democratic Rep. Bill Jefferson agreed the subject is
complicated but that he finally decided the bottom-line answer is
simple: ``Our market is virtually open to Chinese goods and it's
imperative that our exports receive reciprocal treatment,'' said
Jefferson. ``This is the only way we can maintain U.S. jobs in this
dynamic global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   SWEET DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   Foes of the federal sugar program believe the Agriculture
Department's recent announcement that it will have to spend $60
million to buy surplus sweetener gives them new ammunition to fight
the politically protected price supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outraged that a corporate welfare program which already
costs consumers $2.2 billion per year in hidden costs will now cost
taxpayers $60 million up-front,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla.,
referring to some estimates of the impact the price supports have
on food manufactured with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., promised to
introduce legislation blocking the purchase and Miller is also
looking for ways to get the issue before the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the sugar program, while it has been modified in recent
years, has so far proven impervious to challenge and may be able to
survive this new assault.
</P>
<P>
   MISSING IN ACTION
</P>
<P>
   Following the Million Mom March in Washington, Democrats on
Capitol Hill are renewing their call for new gun-control measures _
but there's no Southern accent in this latest rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Democrats have been noticeably absent from the debate
on gun control, consistent with their long history of generally
opposing any measures that could infringe on Second Amendment
rights. While some Southern Democrats have indeed supported
measures such as instant background checks, they rarely step
forward on the issue, and this year is no different even as many of
their party brethren push for stricter controls on sales at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, President Clinton and Democratic leaders prefer to ignore
the dissension within their own ranks, directing their partisan
barbs at Republicans who control Congress. Democrats are pressing
GOP leaders to adopt a gun-control package that has been stalled in
Congress for 11 months.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   Southern schools are still failing to make the grade when it
comes to educating their students.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the Southern Regional Education Board in Atlanta
found that several Southern states reached or exceeded the national
averages for at least one barometer of student achievement, ``but
none has reached that goal for most measures of student
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, most fourth and eighth-graders in Alabama, Florida,
Louisiana, and South Carolina all fell below the national
proficient standard for reading and writing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, however, exceeded that standard for its
eighth-grade students. Still, for all states there remains a
significant achievement gap between white students and minorities,
with black and Hispanic students lagging.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of progress. The report found that since 1988,
Southern states have led the nation in increasing the number of
students who take Advanced Placement examinations while in high
school, along with the number of public schools that participate in
the program.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for ``strong accountability systems'' within
schools to encourage ``high expectations'' for students, teachers
and school leaders.

   PEACEKEEPING-U.S. (Washington) _ Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has
singlehandedly blocked the United States from paying $368 million
that it owes the United Nations for four of its most difficult
peacekeeping operations, infuriating the Clinton Administration and
some of its allies. The dispute is the latest flareup in a running
battle between the administration, which has tried to use American
power and money abroad in operations other than war, and a
Republican-led Congress that increasingly disdains those missions.
This is a little-known and entirely informal process in which
appropriated money can be put on hold, like a nomination, by
strong-arming and jawboning. By Tim Weiner.

against it, and the Democrats are using it as a perpetual punching
bag. But on the floor of the Charlotte Coliseum, where the gun
owner's group is gathering for its annual convention, the attitude
is one of defiance. By James Dao.

CRITICS SPEAK OUT AGAINST MERGER OF LONDON AN FRANKFURT STOCK
MARKETS  
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The pioneering merger of the London and
Frankfurt stock exchanges is running into heavy resistance in both
cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, regulators and the nation's state-owned banks fear
that Frankfurt will lose control over the market for small growth
companies, which has been a huge success here in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the fear is that Frankfurt will grab all the good
business and that London traders will be left with little except
the costs of switching over to Frankfurt's system for electronic
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some British executives also complain that the merger has been
engineered by big U.S. investment banks that want lower trading
costs even if London is diminished as a financial center.
</P>
<P>
   But even some of Europe's biggest trading institutions, which
badly want a more efficient pan-European stock market, are
complaining that the deal announced two weeks ago has serious
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely everyone is in favor of getting a single trading
system, but this isn't the way to do it,'' said a senior executive
at a big trading institution in London. ``This is two exchanges
that are trying to carve up everything for themselves and
monopolize the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the market for smaller growth stocks is to be
based in Frankfurt while London assumes responsibility for
blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the two exchanges also plan to form a joint venture with
Nasdaq, which is focused on the same kinds of small technology
stocks in the United States. The joint venture will be incorporated
in London.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at both exchanges say their merger plans are still on
track. The supervisory board of Deutsche Boerse, parent of the
Frankfurt exchange, will vote next Tuesday on the plan, which needs
support from three-quarters of the members.
</P>
<P>
   But at least two of the 21 board members have publicly
criticized the plan. More ominously, the economics minister for the
state of Hesse, who regulates the Frankfurt exchange, is raising
pointed questions as well.
</P>
<P>
   And Donald Cruickshank, chairman of the London Stock Exchange,
acknowledged on Wednesday that members of the London exchange will
not approve the merger until they receive more detailed
information. That won't be coming until July, because many details
must still be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dieter Posch, the economics minister of Hesse, the
state that includes Frankfurt, demanded that the Deutsche Boerse
answer a list of 14 detailed questions.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Werner G. Seifert, chairman of Deutsche Boerse, Posch
questioned whether it was even realistic to create a system that
would operate under two different regulatory regimes _ a British
one for blue-chip stocks, and the German one for small growth
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Posch also demanded to know whether the Nasdaq venture would be
managed from London; why the parent company of the new exchange,
called iX, will be based in London, and whether German investors
might end up paying higher transaction fees if they have to buy
German blue-chip stocks in London.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's powerful Bundesbank, whose board members heard a
closed-door presentation by Seifert on Thursday, seems cautiously
supportive of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, a Bundesbank board member, Hans
Reckers, warned that Frankfurt had to keep control of trading in
small growth stocks but said that the merger was fundamentally
``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition in Germany appears to be coming from
publicly owned savings banks and cooperative banks. Manfred Zass,
head of the DGZ Dekabank in Frankfurt and a member of the German
stock exchange's supervisory board, said on Wednesday that he would
not agree to a merger that amounted to a ``takeover'' of the
Frankfurt market.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Hilgert, a managing director at SGZ Bank, a cooperative
bank in Frankfurt, said Friday that the overriding fear of smaller
banks was losing control of the market for growth stocks _ the
``neue markt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the domain of cooperative and public-sector
savings banks, in both IPOs and in trading,'' Hilgert said. ``The
growth of this growth market has been in German, not Spanish, not
French and certainly not British,'' he added, referring to
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hilgert predicted that Nasdaq's U.S. executives would inevitably
view London rather than Frankfurt as their European center.
</P>
<P>
   But some British executives are worried that London will lose
its primacy, noting that Seifert is to become chief executive of
the combined entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed takeover of the London Stock Exchange _ for that
is effectively what it is _ by the Deutsche Boerse has serious
implications for London's continued role,'' wrote George Cox,
director general of a British business association called the
Institute of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Financial Times, Cox said that Seifert ``is
hardly likely to have London's interests as his main concern'' and
that the merger was being promoted by a small group of ``powerful
stock exchange members, all of whom appear to be American.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs was the lead investment bank advising Deutsche
Boerse, while Merrill Lynch was among the banks advising the London
Stock Exchange.

LATEST COMPUTER VIRUS OUTBITES `LOVE BUG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer virus discovered Thursday afternoon could have made
the recent international ``Love Bug'' attack seem like child's
play. But the new virus, which destroys all the data stored on a
computer, failed to infect millions of machines around the world,
as the previous virus did.
</P>
<P>
   For this, the Love Bug itself gets part of the credit, because
it prompted many e-mail users to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   That virus forced the shutdown of electronic mail systems at
government agencies and major corporations two weeks ago. But virus
experts say the Love Bug also spurred companies and individuals to
adopt new security precautions that screened out the new, deadlier
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being on the tail end of (the Love Bug) love letter,
people were very conscious of this kind of thing,'' said Ben
Venzke, manager of intelligence production at iDefense, a Virginia
computer security firm.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, called ``NewLove,'' spreads the same way as the
Love Bug did _ by automatically sending copies of itself to every
e-mail address in a victim's electronic address book. In theory, it
could have swept the globe in a day, just as the Love Bug did.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NewLove disguises itself. Instead of sending itself
as an e-mail message with the subject heading ``I Love You,'' the
new virus gives itself the name of a file it found on a previously
infected machine. As a result, the name of the virus message
changes constantly.
</P>
<P>
   But NewLove contains another trick that seriously undermines its
effectiveness. NewLove automatically ``mutates'' so that each
version of the virus looks different to virus-checking programs.
The mutation, though, adds extra lines of meaningless code to the
virus each time it's spread to a different machine.
</P>
<P>
   This changes the appearance of the virus, but it also makes it
much bigger. Graham Cluley, spokesman for Sophos Anti-Virus Inc. in
Oxford, England, said that after making its way through just three
computers, NewLove grows to about 800 kilobytes in size. A file
that big takes several minutes to download using a standard modem.
Many e-mail systems won't accept messages that large, and users who
get one would be immediately on the alert for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So the very feature that was supposed to sneak NewLove past
virus scanners has made it too inefficient to spread rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think this thing got so fat and heavy, it just fell
over its own feet,'' Cluley said. His firm received only one report
of a user infected by the bug, from an American company.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, a survey released Friday found that the Love Bug may
have had less impact than earlier thought. The Pew Internet and
American Life project found that only about 15 percent of American
e-mail users received messages containing the Love Bug.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, frequent e-mail users, which would include
many office workers, were much more likely to be affected. The
survey found that a quarter of all frequent e-mail users got Love
Bug messages.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses such as NewLove and Love Bug can be rendered ineffective
if users of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating systems alter their
software settings to prevent certain kinds of ``script'' programs
from running automatically. For instructions, go to

</P>
<P>
   LOSALAMOS-CHAOS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Theorists at the Los Alamos
lab who study complex systems ranging from financial markets to
thunderstorms _ not everyone there designs bombs _ often refer to a
phenomenon called ``sensitive dependence on initial conditions.''
Chaos, for short. Tiny actions can have enormous, unforeseeable
outcomes. The idea has entered the culture of popular science as
``the butterfly effect'': A butterfly flapping its wings in Rio de
Janeiro causes a hurricane off the coast of Louisiana. A small fire
routinely lit to clear a few hundred acres of tinder erupts into a
firestorm that closes down a nuclear facility and sends a plume of
smoke billowing into Texas and Colorado. By George Johnson. (Moving
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Abu Dis, West Bank) _ It took
Yasir Arafat many years to arrive at the gate of Jerusalem. But
last week, when Israel conceded to him full control of Abu Dis and
two other villages, the PLO chairman moved one step nearer to his
dream. The villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem but one with
a bird's eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock. By Deborah
Sontag. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LISTON-CONSPIRACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans love a conspiracy
theory, whether it concerns the murder of a president or the defeat
of a boxer. And so it is that, Muhammad Ali, who easily dispatched
Sonny Liston in the ring, may never beat him in popular mythology
and public opinion. There, Liston may forever be held up by the
famous ``phantom punch'' that floored him in their heavyweight
championship fight in 1965. The myth of that unseen punch is making
a comeback just in time for the 35th anniversary of the bout. A new
book, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston,'' and an upcoming biographical
movie are giving new life to old theories that the Mob or the Black
Muslims or someone besides Ali sent Liston to the canvas. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN-SECRETS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When the Vatican revealed that
the long-suppressed 1917 prophecy called the Third Secret of Fatima
was something that has already happened _ the 1981 assassination
attempt on Pope John Paul II _ many conspiracy theories and
doomsday scenarios were deflated. Fatima junkies had believed the
Third Secret was so terrifying that no pope dared reveal it. But
somehow the Fatima mystery lives on; the Vatican's effort to end to
tabloid sensationalism and cultish obsession has instead spawned a
new breed of conspiracy theories. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ABU-JAMAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For whatever symbolic figures may
be worth, Mumia Abu-Jamal, whose appeal to the federal courts for a
new trial could receive a response any day now, has become the most
recognizable death row inmate. And while the United States is the
industrialized world's leader in executions, doubts are now raised
by mainstream politicians about how this accelerating aspect of
criminal justice can ever be run fairly enough for accused
murderers who can not afford a competent defense. But is Mumia the
right poster boy for the anti-death-penalty movement? By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ To many interest groups on
both the left and the right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not
so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the
White House. It's about who Gore or Bush would put on the Supreme
Court, where vacancies are a good possibility during the next
presidential term. Three of the nine justices are age 70 or older.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HEIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A study conducted by St. Louis
University researchers indicates that many Americans routinely lie
about their height. Perhaps it is because height is often equated
with power, wealth and even intelligence. But for health experts
are concerned that if the study's conclusions are true, Americans,
who are already among the most obese people in the world, could be
in worse shape than previously thought. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ When racing commentators discussed
Adam Petty's death at the New Hampshire International Speedway last
week, few pointed out that he died far from Daytona, and in the
heart of Yankee country. NASCAR, once identified with the
Southeast, has traveled a long way since the first racers came
roaring down from the mountains in their bootlegging cars. By
Susanna Rodell.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SEASON-REVIEW (New York) _ After last week's annual four-day
rite in which network executives nervously announce their new
programs to advertisers, the question on the minds of media buyers,
talent agents and managers and TV executives at the elaborate
parties around the city was: Is this really the best that network
television can offer? By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   WILLS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excepts from some memorable and
bizarre wills.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   WARLORDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The capture of Foday Sankoh, the
notorious Sierra Leone warlord, highlights a longtime question:
Just how much business can good guys afford to do with bad guys?
The presumption in democratic societies these days is that
strongmen who inflict terrible crimes, whether on their neighbors
or on their own people, should pay for their wrongdoing. But the
reality has not been so simple. As the 1990s spawned warlords from
Yugoslavia to Haiti, from Cambodia to Africa, the basic principle
was often sacrificed to the pragmatic interests of striking peace
deals, no matter how dubious or shaky. By Jane Perlez.

GUNDY IN A CIVIC IS A BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were wondering whether the sad sack, schlumpy
public persona of New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy was a true
indicator that he's not what you would call a major conspicuous
consumer, the answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard about the bizzare incident at Westchester
County Airport when the Knicks' charter plane landed at 3 a.m.
following their frustrating loss Wednesday night in Miami. During
the taxi to the ramp, the pilot observed a large quantity of gravel
on the runway. Fearing the gravel might be sucked into the right
engine, he shut it down. In order to make a turn, he then boosted
power to the left engine. The thrust exhaust blew in the direction
of several nearby parked cars. Van Gundy's car was blown into the
air, landing on automobiles belonging to Allan Houston (1997
Mercedes), assistant coach Brendan Malone (1999 Lincoln), and media
relations director Lori Hamamoto (make and model unrecorded). Van
Gundy's vehicle was totaled.
</P>
<P>
   And what kind of car was a coach making well over a million
dollars a year driving? A 1995 Honda Civic. No offense, Civic
owners, but how many of you would be driving one if you were
pulling down seven figures?
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that Van Gundy wasn't concerned about his car.
``That's what insurance is for,'' he said. Anyway, the mode of his
personal transportation is of little concern to the single-minded
mentor. ``I couldn't give a (mildly naughty word) at that point,''
he said. ``I only cared about the win. That was my first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtic fans with long memories may recall a similar incident
involving a plane that had a bearing on the 1969 playoff run. Jim
``Bad News'' Barnes was knocked down in Phoenix late in the season
by an ill-timed engine thrust. He sustained an injury to his neck.
Player-coach Bill Russell later decided Barnes was not getting
himself ready to play quickly enough, so he essentially banished
his only legitimate pivot backup to non-playing status for the
playoffs. On the few occasions coach Russell decided player Russell
was in need of a blow (foul trouble hardly ever being a Russell
concern), he stuck the 6-foot-6-inch Satch Sanders in the pivot.

   New York being New York, and the New York newspapers being the
New York newspapers, the Knicks lose one game (OK, three games) and
suddenly everyone takes turns being Chicken Little.
``BICKERBOCKERS'' screamed a headline in the New York Post, which
has never seen a trivial issue it couldn't turn into the Cuban
Missile Crisis. Even the stately New York Times used the word
``Unravelled'' in a headline. So what happened? Well, Patrick Ewing
and Chris Childs exchanged words in the second period of Game 5
when Childs ignored Ewing's signal for the ball. And Van Gundy
spoke bluntly about his team's rebounding deficiencies. All hardly
major stuff, but this is New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there weren't some real issues for the Knicks. The
team was poised to issue an APB for Marcus Camby. The 1999 playoff
darling has pitched a no-show performance in this series, capped by
Wednesday's effort in which he had as many fouls (six) as points
and rebounds combined in 27 dismal minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another target is Houston, who only took two shots in the second
half of Game 5. Making matters worse for him was that Dan Majerle
picked this cruical game to add 16 points (including two late
threes and a killer 3-point transition layup plus foul) to his
usual aggressive defense. When Majerle wins the matchup outright,
the Knicks are in trouble.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley on the playoffs: ``I walk into the locker room and
I've got a hole in my gut. You can't say that in the regular
season.'' . . . There was a significant New York crowd presence in
Miami. There was not going to be a reciprocal Miami presence in
Madison Square Garden Friday evening.

CANNES AND ASIA: IT'S LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ The evidence after a week and a half of the
Cannes Film Festival is that the usual excess, the hype, the
anxiety, the strenuous star-studdedness of this annual event can
coexist rather comfortably with what the French would call a
serious cinematic sensibility. Serious is a serious word in this
country, a word that suggests a willingness to do the hard job, to
take pains, to be not just flashy but also good. So far it's been a
serious festival, a festival where, contrary to custom, no
big-budget Hollywood film was included in the official competition,
even though the festival directors are said to have tried
unsuccessfully to open this year's event with the ``Mission
Impossible'' sequel starring Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every television network in Europe is here, so Tom Cruise
going up the red carpet would have been great from their point of
view,'' said the critic Roger Ebert, who has been coming to Cannes
for 25 years. ``The biggest moments this festival has ever had were
when Jimmy Stewart, Clint Eastwood and Madonna were here. I
remember Eastwood especially, with everybody in their French
accents shouting `Cleent! Cleent!'''
</P>
<P>
   So the festival has produced little in the way of surprise or
shock or disgust or rebellion. But if it has not been the year of
Tom Cruise, it is being proclaimed the year of Asia. And with films
in the competition from Iran, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and
Japan, it is indeed the year of Asia. This is serious, for it
represents the real possibility of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling that the festival still recognizes the
value of auteur cinema,'' said Edward Yang, an American-educated
director from Taiwan whose film ``Yi Yi'' is one of the Asian
entries in the official competition. Yang is not the only grateful
person here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a real breakthrough for Korean films,'' said
Hong-Joon Kim, a member of the Korean Film Commission. Kim was
referring to the appearance in the competition of ``Chunhyang,'' Im
Kwon Taek's postcard-pretty story of official malfeasance, based on
an 18th-century Korean legend. It is the first film from Korea ever
to make it to such an exalted status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best effect will be in Korea itself,'' Im said. ``Even in
Korea, Korean films are not taken seriously. This will serve notice
to our own people that Korean films may be a little bit better than
they think.''
</P>
<P>
   All this doesn't mean that there hasn't been plenty of glitter.
Cannes at this time of year has more chartered yachts, more
Mercedes convertibles, more cell phones than are usually found in
any one city on the planet. But the political overtones that
characterize this festival have been more interesting than the
garden-variety narcissistic parades.
</P>
<P>
   One political question has to do with the relative scarcity of
American films. Even though there are six of them in the
competition, that number is relatively low compared to those of
other years, which raises the issue of whether this represents an
expression of French cultural protectionism. The French have made
no secret of their fear that European culture, which they deem to
be ``serious,'' is being crushed by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   On another political front, reports have circulated that the
festival's organizers rejected a formal request by the Chinese
government that the Chinese entry be withdrawn, giving the festival
a touch of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Did the festival's directors, who decide in secret which films
will be invited to compete, discriminate against American films
this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but it's more complicated than that,'' said one studio
executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The studios don't
make available the films the festival wants; the festival doesn't
want the films that the studios make available. The French have
mixed feelings about the Americans, who bring glamour but can be
too dominant. But the studios are afraid to have their films in
competition, knowing that they might not win.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, after a week of viewing the Asian entries, one
might be inclined to agree with Yang that the festival is doing its
job, recognizing work with a strong individual character. The Asian
films have been a rich and varied cinematic panorama of the sort
that could be created only at a festival, never in the commercial
arena. Among the other strong entries so far was ``Gohatto,'' or
``Taboo,'' a drama about homosexuality among samurai in late
Tokugawa Japan by the Japanese master Nagisa Oshima. The film
concentrates on one Sozaburo Kano, played by Ryuhei Matsuda, a
boyish, coquettish recruit in a local militia who attracts the
sexual attentions of several members of the force. The members of
the militia and its leaders do not take an intolerant attitude
toward homosexuality; indeed, they accept it as a normal tendency.
Still, tragedy ensues when Kano's presence stirs up murderous
jealousies and rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese entry, directed by the 37-year-old Jiang Wen, was a
densely affecting, emotionally violent story called ``Devils on the
Doorstep,'' set during the Japanese occupation of China. The
Iranian film, ``Takhte Siah,'' directed by Samira Makhmalbaf, takes
place in Iranian Kurdistan and depicts a group of teachers made
homeless by a bombing and wandering from city to city in search of
students.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most cerebral of the Asian entries was Yang's ``Yi
Yi,'' which is about three generations of modern-day Taiwanese.
Yang's film suggests a kind of precariousness to ordinary life, a
sense that barbarism is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Im's ``Chunhyang,'' lushly scenic, full of spacious vistas and
decorous ceremony, is a cinematic version of a popular Korean
ballad commonly told in a musical form called Pansori, a one-man
opera accompanied by a single drum. It is the story of a nobleman's
son, Mongryong, who falls in love with a beautiful and cultivated
girl, Chunhyang, the illegitimate daughter of a high-class
courtesan and a deceased provincial governor. When she refuses the
demands of a newly arrived provincial governor that she serve him
as a courtesan, he tortures her and orders her to be executed
during his birthday celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's ``Devils on the Doorstep'' begins when a Chinese
guerrilla fighter bursts in on a villager named Ma Dasan and orders
him to watch over two Japanese prisoners until he can come back to
take them away. The villagers are afraid not to follow his order,
but they are also terrified of a nearby Japanese detachment that
will exact terrible retribution if they discover the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's work, filmed in black and white, has a grainy intensity
to it and is steeped in the idioms and accents of peasant life in
northern China. It captures the shrewd simplicity of people who
hate the foreign occupier before whom they ingratiate themselves,
since the immediate cause is not to fight a patriotic war but to
survive as best they can. Perhaps it is the absence of overt
patriotism that led the Chinese authorities to ban it in China and
to ask that it be withdrawn at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have not officially stated their reasons. But for
Jiang, the politics of his film are both confusing and
paradoxically bothersome. He referred to an article in a French
newspaper that raised a cynical possibility. The banning of the
film was announced, the newspaper suggested, as a promotional
gesture, the idea being that for a Chinese film to be seen as
worthy of attention internationally, it has to arouse the ire of
the Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about this, not because I'm afraid of
what might happen to me but because it seems that Chinese films all
need this sort of packaging.'' Jiang said. ``To be banned makes it
important. But whether a film is banned or not has nothing to do
with its importance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't understand.'' Jiang continued. ``Because even
if you go through all of the approvals, you might still not be
allowed to show your film. You might submit a script idea based on
a novel only to be informed that the novel, though approved for
publication, can't be made into a movie. Sometimes a novel can be
made into a television program but not a movie. I don't know why.
Even after your script has been approved, when you shoot it, the
Film Bureau comes to see if you've made any changes. And even if
you pass this stage, your film might still not be distributed, and
it might not be approved for festivals. I myself really don't
understand.''

FED MOVE DEPRESSES NASDAQ INDEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock index fell more than 4 percent Friday, in a
third day of fallout from the Federal Reserve Board's vote this
week to intensify its campaign to raise interest rates and engineer
a soft landing for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index slid 148.31 to
3390.40, and dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down with it
on a light trading day when there were few buyers to shore up stock
prices. The Dow lost 150.43, or 1.4 percent, closing at 10,626.85.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was unusual in that no dramatic event could be pinpointed
for driving the market down. The Nasdaq is now a third below its
March 10 high of 5048.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a general gloom has settled over investors, who
are beginning to absorb the implications of Tuesday's half-point
hike in the federal funds rate, to 6.5 percent. Since then, the
still-high Nasdaq has fallen every day, with each day worse than
the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the gloom, the US Department of Commerce
reported Friday that the US trade deficit hit yet another record,
growing to $30.2 billion in March, as prices for imported oil rose
to Gulf War levels.
</P>
<P>
   For investors the report meant one thing: Consumers are still in
a buying frenzy and may give the the Fed reason to raise rates for
a seventh time at its June meeting, said Kathleen Camilli, a market
analyst in New York for Tucker Anthony Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While inflation has been edging up slowly, the Fed is
increasingly concerned about the relentless pace of growth in the
economy, which shows few signs of slowing down. Claims for
unemployment benefits fell again last week, another indication of a
small and growing pool of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when an economic boom matures, ``consumption
snowballs and that draws trade in,'' Camilli explained. ``The
market should care'' about a growing trade deficit because it is
``another sign of stronger-than-expected economic growth, added to
all the pieces we've gotten since January, further giving reason
for the Fed to continue on the path of tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow fell Friday, analysts said the
technology-dominated Nasdaq is more vulnerable. The Dow held up
amid Nasdaq's slide on Thursday, but gave way Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line companies are, in theory, more sensitive to interest
rates than are technology companies. The Nasdaq is vulnerable,
though, analysts said, because it is still high and because
technology company stocks suffer if their ``old economy'' clients
trim capital spending in response to rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have been justifying paying extraordinary prices for
tech stocks because of the expectation for continued revenue
growth,'' said Charles Crane, market strategist at Spears, Benzak,
Salomon &AMP; Farrell Inc., which manages $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech companies themselves aren't heavy borrowers, but their
customers are going to be hurt by higher interest rates'' and
reduce their spending on technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Intel Corp., the world's biggest chip maker,
reported that it would reduce its first-quarter profits by a penny,
to 77 cents a share, after some sales were reversed. Intel plunged
$6.0625 a share, to $117.875.
</P>
<P>
   Another technology leader, Cisco Systems Inc., which rose 50
percent in the first three months of the year, has almost wiped out
all of that gain. The number one computer networking company
dropped $1.9375 Friday, to $53.4375 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold the last of my Cisco Friday,'' said Johan Vystavel, a
fund manager at HWB Capital Management, in Surrey, England. ``It's
a good company, but at 100 times earnings it's just too
expensive.'' The shares trade for 110 times profit.

A WEEKEND'S LARK FOR STUDEBAKER CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By CHARLES McEWEN  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Studebaker owners are a stubborn, iconoclastic group.
John Cohoe, a founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club, said: ``One
of the early mottoes was, `We'd rather fix than switch.' And some
cigarette smokers in the club would only smoke Lark. I guess
they've grown up to Avanti cigars now.''
</P>
<P>
   Studebaker was one of the great independents in American
automaking. The company started out as a wagon maker in 1852 and
built its first car, an electric, in 1902. The last Studebaker
rolled off the line in 1966. Notable Studebakers over the years
include the big eight-cylinder Presidents of the 1920s and 1930s,
the economical 1939 Champion, the 1950 ``bullet nose'' (named for
its unusual round grille), the 1953 Starlight coupe and Starliner
hardtop, the compact 1959 Lark and the wedge-shaped Avanti of 1963.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, from about 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the 35-member Manhattan
Studebaker club will show off cars like these on the north side of
Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. The emphasis of the show,
which is free, will be on Studebakers and other ``orphan'' makes
whose manufacturers are no longer in business, but any car built in
1974 or earlier can enter for a fee of $15, Cohoe said. Thirty to
50 cars are expected, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Old-car shows are a rarity in Manhattan, not the friendliest of
places for any car, especially one that's 40 or 50 years old.
``Owning an old car is the dream of childhood come true, and
Manhattanites don't tend to be that type of person,'' said Gary
Hallgren, another founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club. ``They
dream of old cars, but the price of realizing that dream is too
high. If they are native New Yorkers, it's not in their blood as
much as us hick country people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallgren's tongue was firmly in cheek. Although he now lives in
Mastic Beach on Long Island, and grew up in Ferndale, Wash., he
lived in Manhattan for nine years and kept a Studebaker in the city
the whole time. In fact, he parked his 1949 pickup on the street
and never even locked it. And nothing ever happened to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bum slept in it once,'' he said, ``but I didn't care.''

 &HT;    Goodbye grouch, hello Mr. Mellow: Announcer promises to be good
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 21
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The two-two pitch...''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Caray is perched, Buddha-like, in a radio booth high above
home plate at Turner Field. He's warming up: 45 minutes before the
Braves' next-to-last exhibition game, Caray is pronouncing into a
dead microphone a phrase that, as Atlanta baseball's radio and TV
announcer the past 24 seasons, he has repeated ... tens of
thousands of times? Hundreds of thousands? He leans again into the
dead mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-two pitch...''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be here in the booth to know it's Caray. That
voice. One of the most distinctive styles in sports broadcasting,
it doesn't require that you even be a baseball fan to recognize it.
Caray's delivery _ a nasally, sweet-sax honk at the high end, with
the low notes kept nice and warm in the back of his throat _ has
crackled over the airwaves so many years it's now part of the
region's ambient summer soundtrack, like crickets and lawn mowers
and kids squealing under a garden hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been there so long he's become an icon,'' says Allen
Ginsberg, director of special projects for BBDO South ad agency.
``When people hear his voice, they just identify it with baseball
games.''
</P>
<P>
   More memorable than the sound, however, is the tone. When not
ramped up to describe the Braves '95 World Series victory (``Yes!
Yes! Yes!''), or Sid Bream's slowpoke, pennant-clinching expedition
from second base to home plate in the '92 playoffs (``Braves win!
Braves win! Braves win!''), Caray puts the dead into deadpan _ a
dry, wry, wily inflection that courts crankiness, sarcasm and the
kind of summer's-night, old-friend knowingness that comes from
having seen most of what he's seeing many times before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip is like balsamic vinegar on a fine salad,'' says Jeff
Hullinger, WAGA sportscaster and the radio voice of Falcons
football. ``He has a little vinegar in him, and that's such an
important part of a good meal. So many places around the country
have these vanilla-voiced guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll say things that drive me and John (Schuerholz, Braves
general manager) up the wall,'' adds Braves president Stan Kasten.
``He's always testing the boundaries. He lives for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's never malicious,'' he says. ``That's why he's
freakin' lasted so long.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 15 minutes before the game. Caray leans into that dead mike
one last time. Nobody else in the booth has paid any attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-two pitch...'' Caray says again, the same way he said
it the two other times: deliberate, detached, self-mocking. It's
Skip Caray doing Skip Caray.
</P>
<P>
   He then pushes away from the mike and heads toward the press box
food court. He has a wide man's rolling, canoe-rocking walk, and on
his way out says to no one in particular, ```The two-two pitch...As
long as I can say that, I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   `I got grandchildren I'd like to see grow up'
</P>
<P>
   At 60, the middle rung on a broadcasting dynasty that started
with his father, Harry, and continues with his son Chip, Caray is
attempting these days to be something more than all right. He has
announced this year (during Braves games, on Neal Boortz's radio
show) that he intends to be a ``new, mellow Skip.''
</P>
<P>
   The makeover is prompted by two concerns that reached critical
mass last season. The first: Caray's grouchy, even Grinchy persona
on WSB radio's pregame show, where he flashed little patience for
callers wanting to know, for instance, how to compute a player's
slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The second: his health, on which decades of road-trip-style
drinking took a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at (WSB) thought I was being too hard on callers,''
Caray acknowledges. ``I don't think so, but I decided I'd be Mr.
Mellow. Ever since I quit drinking, I look at things differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray says he hasn't had any alcohol since New Year's Day; he
drinks water during games and treats himself to a diet soda
afterward. He's lost 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had enough,'' he says, sipping water inside his soaring
house in unincorporated Fulton County, where he lives with Paula,
his wife of 24 years, and 18-year-old Josh, the youngest of four
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older, it (alcohol) gets tougher to handle,''
Caray adds. ``I was told that cirrhosis of the liver was a
longshot. I got grandchildren I'd like to see grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   His new mellowness caught a lot of people by surprise. While WSB
radio group general manager Dave Meszaros said Caray was
cooperative and ``not defensive'' when they met following last
season to discuss his call-in show demeanor, other employers have
had a different experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most difficult employee I've ever had in my life,''
says Bob Wussler, former executive vice president of Turner
Broadcasting who now runs a media consulting business in
Washington. ``He wanted to show up late and go home early. He never
wanted to read the promos. We had epic battles over contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to deal with him, including Ted (Turner),''
Wussler adds. ``But at the end of the day, he did whatever you
wanted him to do. It was just getting him to the point of agreeing
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray's handling of pregame callers came to a head last season
when sports talk-show hosts at rival 790 The Zone regularly blasted
what they viewed as Caray's abrupt, rude manner with fans phoning
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were very irritated by his treatment of callers,'' says
790 afternoon host ``Steak'' Shapiro, who admits fanning the flames
to gig the competition. ``It sounds like the last place he wants to
be is in front of a mike talking to listeners. When I started to
trumpet that, the response was huge. People said, `Finally,
somebody is calling this guy out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others recall an off-the-air Caray who could be gregarious and
generous one minute (``I know him as a guy who'd give you the shirt
off his back _ just don't try to take it,'' says on-air sidekick
Joe Simpson), then bitingly short-tempered the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to get crazy about any little thing. He'd get
furious,'' says his brother Chris Caray, retired from a St. Louis
travel business. ``He was a piece of work.''
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's a new man _ it's really spooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with age,'' Chris adds. ``There's a part of all of us
that continues to grow, even in our 50s and 60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inside his home on a late Thursday afternoon, Caray is
... mellow. He looks over at a visitor and asks, ``You want a
drink?''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor blinks back. A few minutes earlier, Caray had gone
on about how he doesn't miss the booze one bit.
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``Just because I don't drink 'em doesn't
mean I can't still pour 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He then goes to the kitchen and puts together a whiskey and
water. Just a splash. Pours it with a fine, schooled hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a really good drink.
</P>
<P>
   A beloved role model
</P>
<P>
   Caray learned to pour 'em from the best: his father, the late
Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray. It was his father who taught
Caray to love baseball, pushed him into broadcasting, showed him
what a good time the profession could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my dad in his underwear many times, coming out of the
bathroom, stubble on his face after a hangover, going to work,''
Caray recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Harry was an institution in St. Louis through four decades, then
a national institution as the Cubs announcer on WGN in Chicago. He
cried ``Holy cow!'' after every homer, led Wrigley Field fans in
``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' during the seventh-inning stretch,
was known as ``the mayor of Rush Street,'' the bar-lined avenue he
virtually called home. In his later years, his bombastic style and
thick, black-rimmed glasses became a campy imitation on ``Saturday
Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   He died two years ago, at age 77. His funeral was televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked broads and booze and never tried to fool you,'' Caray
says. ``Dad was a fun guy, and I miss him every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray grew up in St. Louis the son of that institution. A tricky
spot: Sometimes good, sometimes not.
</P>
<P>
   Caray's parents divorced when he was barely a teen, a
high-profile, highly affecting circumstance. The day after the
divorce, Caray saw it headlined in a St. Louis newspaper. Something
like: Caray's Wife Throws Him Out at Home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day was the longest walk to school of my life,'' he
remembers.
</P>
<P>
   It also might be the moment that the no-excuses,
quit-your-whining template that underpins Caray's character _ from
his caustic humor to his frank impatience _ was born. His mother,
Dorothy, now 84 and living with Caray's sister in Marietta,
remembers him never complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a girl in my class who came from divorced parents,
and we talked about how people use divorce as an excuse for what
they do,'' Caray recalls. ``We were like a support system for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   With a younger sister and brother, Caray lived mostly with his
mother, a shy woman with a dry humor. For Caray's siblings, their
father's visits were often off-the-wall stopovers of the
hard-drinking life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were difficult times _ I couldn't really describe it,''
says his sister Patricia Caray, retired from Coca-Cola. ``It could
be tough, but the love was still there. Sometimes you had to remind
yourself of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Skip is not the kind of person who'd think about (the
divorce) one way or the other. He'd look at it as the hand he was
dealt and play it. He really loved his father _ to be his father's
son was all he could ever want.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry took his oldest son to spring training each year, and on
road trips with the Cardinals each summer. Skip loved it. He still
remembers the train rides, listening to coaches tell stories for
hours in hotel lobbies, mingling with players like they were
neighborhood dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any heroes in baseball _ I knew the players on a
first-name basis,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Caray was a good high school athlete, but a knee injury turned
him into what he calls the first requirement of a sports announcer:
a frustrated athlete. He was in the booth by junior high school,
doing his own radio sports report on powerhouse KMOX. His
relationship with broadcasting was as natural as it was with
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never afraid of the mike,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His father wanted him to become a broadcaster and Caray, who
earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, never
considered anything else. Why would he? His father's life was a
rolling party, and he made more money than a lot of players.

   UNDATED: more money than a lot of players.
</P>
<P>
   Partying hard after divorce
</P>
<P>
   After announcing minor-league baseball in Oklahoma and Georgia _
he was the voice of the old Atlanta Crackers in '64 and '65 _ Caray
arrived in Atlanta for good in 1969, to do Hawks basketball. He was
30, married and had two children. But the marriage broke up (``I
was too young''), the kids moved back to St. Louis with their
mother, and Caray followed in his father's hard-living footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got divorced just when birth control came into being, and
before AIDS became a problem _ every night was New Year's Eve,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights were spent at the now-defunct Brave Falcon Lounge,
near the Tara movie theater off Cheshire Bridge Road. It attracted
that era's men on the make _ sportsmen, lawyers, salesmen _ and
plenty of women wanting to make it with them. For a while, Caray
had his mail delivered there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dewar's and water and let's see what happens,'' he
says. ``God, I loved that place. For the most part I was with good
friends. The laughs _ the laughs were so much better than the
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he adds, ``A lot of the happiness was superficial. A little
booze and a young lady and you sorta forget about missing your
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray eventually met his second wife there. Paula Prather owned
the hairstyling salon Caray went to next door, and she'd stop by
the Brave Falcon after work. She turned down a bunch of Caray's
advances; born in Georgia, she didn't know anything about baseball
or Harry Caray. ``I just sorta stumbled into it,'' she remembers.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1976. Caray adopted Paula's young daughter, and
a few years later they had Josh. When he wasn't on the road, Caray
became a homebody.
</P>
<P>
   Says oldest son Chip, now a Cubs announcer, ``That's where
there's a difference with my grandfather (Harry): My dad had a
greater appreciation for the importance of family at a younger age.
While he loves his job, he doesn't live for his job like my
grandfather did.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather loved meeting and talking with people all the
time _ that was his personality. My dad can't do that. Nobody's
like Harry Caray. And nobody can be.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned his way
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now, with the Braves' decade-long success,
the degree of utter lousiness Caray described for fans of those
early Hawks and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad with the Hawks that Kasten, then the team's
assistant general manager, challenged Caray nightly by finding an
obscure word for him to work into the broadcast: syzygy, homunculus
_ like that.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bob Costas recalls in the middle of one Hawks blowout
Caray giving viewers permission to turn off their sets, as long as
they patronized the station's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the greatest thing I heard an announcer
say,'' Costas says. ``It breaks that wall, where the announcer is
telling the fan, `I'm thinking what you're thinking.' It was, like,
subversive.''
</P>
<P>
   Caray kept it up when he joined the Braves. ``Ted (Turner) told
me, `I don't know anything about this (stuff). Say whatever you
want.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did: He'd page through a TV Guide during a game to see what
else was on; give scathing reviews of the sci-fi B-movies that then
filled TBS' schedule; instituted a ``punch line of the day,'' with
viewers sending in dirty jokes that couldn't be told on the air, to
which Caray would read only the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Skip's humor really came in. His imagination would
run amok,'' says broadcasting partner Pete Van Wieren, who joined
the Braves the same year as Caray. ``We were out of some races so
early that there were no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lean years are what carved Caray's unhyped,
it's-just-a-game style that, because of TBS' cable reach, became
familiar around the country. ESPN anchor Eisen remembers imitating
Caray while growing up in New York, and now regularly imitates him
during ``Sports Center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the voice. They come up to me in airports and ask
me to do it,'' Eisen says. ``I'm a New Yorker, and I never thought
I'd be known for doing an imitation of a guy who does baseball in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Skip, you get a kind of good-natured world weariness,''
adds Costas. ``I'm sure he's too low-key for some people, in the
same way Harry could be too over the top. But those of us who have
an interest in broadcasting and baseball have an appreciation for
what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry was broad enough that everybody got him. Only the
intelligentsia get this.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't be pushed
</P>
<P>
   An hour before another game. Caray is hunched over a live mike
inside a cramped WSB radio hut in Turner Field's centerfield
pavilion _ ``Skip-in-a-box,'' some at WSB call the setup _ hosting
the pregame show. He's fielded a half-dozen calls so far and been
nice as pie.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone's enamored of the new, mellow Skip. For some, his
doesn't-suffer-fools-gladly approach was a cult find. Chipper Jones
compares him to ``not Rush Limbaugh, exactly ... He's the Neal
Boortz of play-by-play.'' Boortz says he should have a forum on
``60 Minutes'': ``He'd make Andy Rooney look like a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate baseball but I never turn off the pregame show,'' says
Marcia Killingsworth, Georgia native and public relations manager
at Georgia Public TV. ``The people who call are so passionate about
the Braves, and the tone Skip uses when he responds to some of
their minutiae _ it's so dry, honestly, I almost drive off the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People either love him or ... dislike him,'' adds Braves
pitcher John Smoltz. ``I've grown to really like him. The first
time I listened to the pregame show, I couldn't stop laughing.
People say he's a rude son-of-a-gun, but I know how many calls he
has to deal with, and it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz grins. ``I'm thinking of getting somebody to call him up
and ask a really stupid question. Just to see how he responds.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that person be Rob in Stone Mountain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where and how,'' begins a caller identified on a computer
screen inside the WSB hut only as Rob in Stone Mountain, ``should I
consolidate my student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray's confused. He asks Rob to repeat the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' says Rob. ``Where and how should I consolidate my
student loans?''
</P>
<P>
   Caray is trying to decide if this is the kind of call he'd so
famously boot in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a job and then pay 'em off ...'' Caray begins.
</P>
<P>
   Rob interrupts. ``Is Clark Howard around?''
</P>
<P>
   Rob's got the wrong show. Caray tells him to try back another
time and breaks for a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to make me mad,'' he says off the air. ``A
simple'' _ he uses an expletive phrase _ ``would have been an
appropriate answer. But I'm going to be this way all year. Until I
lose it. If I lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Caray smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Smiles!
</P>
<P>
   THE SKIP CARAY FILE
</P>
<P>
   Harry Christopher ``Skip'' Caray Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Occupation: In his 25th season as Atlanta Braves announcer, on
TBS, Turner South and WSB radio.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Family: Married to Paula for 24 years. Four children: Harry
``Chip'' Caray III, 35; Cindy Hines, 33 (both from a previous
marriage); Shayelyn Woodbery, 31 (from Paula's previous marriage);
Josh Caray, 18.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Education: Journalism degree with honors, University of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On calling a baseball game: ``I'm always thinking of the guy
driving a tractor-trailer rig, driving across the South, busting
his (rear end). He wants to stop, but he can't, he has to keep
going. I try to keep him awake and entertain him as he's driving
from Birmingham to Montgomery.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On imitating Caray calling a baseball game: ESPN's Rich Eisen,
who often imitates Caray on ``Sports Center,'' says, ``I channel
Dudley Do-Right, a little Charles Kuralt and some Marvin the
Martian, of Bugs Bunny fame _ you know, the little guy in the funny
helmet who goes, `Where's the ka-boom? There was an
earth-shattering ka-boom!'''

 &HT;    Douglasville, Ga., writer is sharing his secrets of the region's
best sites
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTAHOOCHEE NATIONAL FOREST, Ga. _ Eyes up, arms outstretched,
Mark Morrison takes in the glimmering cascade. It tumbles over a
sheer rock face, crashes into a bed of broken stones below and
courses past dense thickets of rhododendron and towering hemlock
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this beautiful?'' Morrison exclaims, grinning. He should
know. The 47-year-old railroad engineer is one of the Southeast's
most ardent admirers of waterfalls. In a little more than a decade,
he's visited more than 400 in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Amicalola or Anna Ruby, are heavy-traffic falls. But
many, like this sequestered splasher on Little Ridge Creek south of
Neels Gap, are virtual secrets, represented only by anonymous blue
ticks on topographical maps.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be anonymous for long. A former surveyor and
skilled photographer, Morrison has published four books on
Southeastern falls, including ``Waterfall Walks and Drives in
Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee'' in 1996 and ``Waterfall Walks and
Drives in the Great Smoky Mountains and the Western Carolinas''
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The homemade guides _ typeset on an Adobe Pagemaker computer
program at Morrison's Douglasville, Ga., home and transcribed,
packed and shipped by wife Deeanna _ are full of common-sense
advice.
</P>
<P>
   When is the best time to visit a waterfall? ``Go when they
flow!'' Morrison tells readers. ``Many of these spectacular falls
will be disappointing in the dry months of summer and fall.''
Morrison recommends visiting in the winter or spring, or after a
good rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pretend to be a writer,'' he says modestly. ``The
books are basically directions.''
</P>
<P>
   But what directions. Armed with his surveyor's acumen and a
measuring wheel (as well as permission from various land management
officials), Morrison has plotted explicit paths to more than 250
waterfalls. Hikers accustomed to the vagueness of many park maps
will flip over their walking sticks when they read Morrison's route
to Little Ridge Falls:
</P>
<P>
   ``An old logging road . . . ascends moderately through a tunnel
of rhododendron and crosses three branches, each of which are .1 of
a mile apart. After crossing the third branch (just over .3 of a
mile into the hike), pace off 300'. There, look carefully for a
slim path leading 45 degrees to the right . . . (There may be a
coffee table-sized boulder in the road for further verification.)
This leads approximately 100' to the creek bank. . . .
</P>
<P>
   On the creek's east side, hike uphill to intersect a logging
road which parallels Little Ridge Creek upstream. In .1 of a mile
reach a point where the pathway steepens. The lower falls may be
seen from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's obsessive approach is paying off _ he has sold more
than 40,000 books through chain stores such as Borders and Barnes &AMP;
Noble, as well as the online retailer Amazon.com and his own Web
site, www.waterfallwalks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The methodical measuring sprang from an interest in nature
photography. Morrison's been an avid shutterbug since 1985, when he
bought his first 35mm camera. ``I was baffled by the thing at
first, and used all the automatic settings,'' he remembers. He
quickly grew more assured _ his books and Web site feature gorgeous
color shots taken mostly with a Nikon FM2. (His beloved Nikon N90S
ended up in a creek on one of his hikes.)
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison found that ferreting out waterfalls to shoot could
sometimes be frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked up a lot of free info about locations,'' he says.
``And many times I would end up lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalls one waterfall guide, to Ball Play Falls in Tennessee,
that offered little in the way of instruction beyond ``drive about
1.5 miles (down the park road), turn left and hike about two
miles.''
</P>
<P>
   He set out to document more precise directions, using vacation
breaks from his job coupling piggyback rail cars at Inman Yard in
Atlanta to make day trips and overnighters to nearby cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Little Ridge Falls, he found through trial and
error. ``I stumbled upon it in 1992, when I was looking for another
waterfall,'' Morrison says. ``It was just my poor map reading.''
</P>
<P>
   All the wandering in the woods has not been without hazard.
Morrison has encountered washed-out footbridges, creeks swollen
with bone-chilling runoff, icy cliffside paths and not a few
slithery surprises. ``I just give them a wide berth,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 book, Morrison tells of a particularly close
encounter. He had just crossed Holly Creek in Murray County and was
patting himself on the back for staying dry. ``Looking down at my
feet, I saw a copperhead no more than two feet in front of me in
the undergrowth,'' he writes. ``With downed pine tops hemming me in
both left and right, I quickly walked on water back across the
creek and chose a different route.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeanna, known as Dee to her friends, confesses to worrying
sometimes. ``But I know he's very careful,'' says the 44-year-old
homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Dee will even tag along, though she admits the two
aren't the most compatible hikers. ``Mark will be in a hurry to get
where he wants to go, and I'll have to stop and see every little
thing,'' she says, laughing. More often, she'll just drive him to
the start of a trail and pick him up at the end.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Morrison sees no end to his waterfall quest.
Though he's kicking around an idea for a book on local railroad
history, he says he'll continue to update his waterfall books _ a
new edition of the Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee guide should be
out next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, waterfalls are the epitome of Southern scenery,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   As he gazes reverently at Little Ridge Falls, the sluicing of
the water the only sound in the hot, hushed wilderness, it's as
clear as a mountain stream that these splashy scenes still give him
a rush.

 &HT;    Going with the flow: Here are some of the best
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 20
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A waterfall is the surprise at the end of a hike,'' says Mark
Morrison. And each is startling in its own way. We asked the
47-year-old Douglasville resident, author of four guidebooks on
Southeastern waterfalls, to describe, in his words, the most
distinctive cascades in Georgia . . . and slightly beyond.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most scenic: Falls on Big Creek, Chattahoochee National
Forest, east of Clayton. ``The falls tumble in three small leaps
through about a 4- to 5-foot channel in the rock. The rock to the
right is especially pretty _ it's multicolored with moss and
lichens. The falls end in a beautiful, deep, blue-green pool. Then
you have the surrounding hemlocks and white pines, which give the
area almost an alpine look.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most peaceful: Crow Creek Falls, Chattahoochee National
Forest, near Lake Rabun. ``The falls aren't hard to get to _ you
can drive to within 300 feet of them _ but hardly anybody goes
there. They are on the back side of Lake Rabun, and it seems that
people don't venture to that side very often. The waterfall spills
over four small ledges and flows into a shallow, shady-bottomed
pool surrounded by dense rhododendron. A steep mountain slope with
hemlock trees and chestnut stumps flanks the left side.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most unusual. Virgin Falls, Cumberland Plateau, Tennessee.
``The falls are located on a creek that flows out of a cave, then
drops 110 feet into a sinkhole. The water disappears into the earth
_ it does not run on from there. I think it eventually ends up in
the Caney Fork River.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Georgia's best-kept secret. The Falls on Horse Branch,
Chattahoochee National Forest, west of Clayton. ``Nobody knows
about this one. I haven't found it represented on maps _ I heard
about it from a fellow in Rabun County. An old logging road
descends to Horse Branch Creek. You have to hike up the creek
three-tenths of a mile, through a jungle of rhododendron. The
waterfall runs over stratified rock. It's unlike the granites that
you normally see _ there are hundreds of layers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most difficult to reach (included in book): Lee Falls, Sumter
National Forest, South Carolina. ``The last time I was up there,
about a year ago, they had a lot of storm damage. You have to hike
the last half-mile to the falls wading through Tamassee Creek, and
I had to go over and under a lot of fallen trees. But it's
beautiful there _ the whole rock wall is green with mosses and
water plants. It's about the greenest place I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most difficult to reach (not included in book): Flat Creek
Falls, east of Clermont. ``I didn't even publish directions to this
one because I felt it was too difficult. The trail is virtually
straight up the side of a mountain. Once you get to the waterfall,
it's all barren rock, like Stone Mountain. There's nothing to stand
on or hold on to. I hiked up through rhododendron as thick as it
could be. It's very pretty but very dangerous.''

INDEXES OF WELL-BEING SPRING UP ALL OVER

 (ATTN: Conn., Mich., Fla., Ariz.)  (Ideas)

<TEXT>
<P>
   After eight years of record-breaking growth in the U.S. economy,
many people assume that the presidential election will be
determined by the stock market. But social scientists and
communities from Jacksonville, Fla., to Honolulu are beginning to
say, ``It's not just the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   They are looking beyond purely economic numbers _ at health and
crime statistics, clear-air days and commuting time _ to gain a
fuller measure of people's elusive sense of collective well-being,
to create what is essentially a happiness index. In the process
they are making some surprising discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, William J. Bennett, the conservative writer
and political adviser, has begun producing an index of leading
cultural indicators, while the environmentally oriented group
Redefining Progress has created something called the genuine
progress indicator, in which social costs like legal fees, medical
bills, divorce and crime are subtracted from the Gross National
Product to measure the state of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a recent proliferation of local monitoring
groups like Sustainable Seattle, Livable Tucson, Minnesota
Milestones and Oregon Benchmarks shows a growing interest in
measuring the quality of life and values like friendliness and
vitality in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think this shows is that there is something out there
that all of us are trying to capture that is extremely important,''
Marc Miringoff, a professor of social sciences at Fordham
University, said in an interview. His own social health index is
one of the most systematic nationwide surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff and others are pushing hard to promote the idea of a
regular national social report card similar to the index of leading
economic indicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the country knows that interest rates are up by one-quarter
of a percent, people need to know that the we have a child-poverty
indicator that is the worst in the industrial world,'' Miringoff
said. ``When that hits a new low, bells ought to go off the way it
does when Alan Greenspan decides to slam the breaks on inflation.
That should be reported on CNN and be part of the political
discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years every other major industrialized country
from Britain and Norway to Turkey and Japan has begun to publish an
annual social report, even though the idea originated in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929 President Herbert Hoover sponsored a comprehensive
social report that was published five years later. And in 1967,
Sen. Walter Mondale, the future vice president, proposed creating a
permanent Council of Social Advisers, like the Council of Economic
Advisers, to produce regular reports on social issues. The idea was
shelved after the Democrats lost the presidential election of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   It's back, the sociologist Ron Inglehart speculates, because now
that many people's immediate material needs have been met, some
Americans are developing postmaterialist values.
</P>
<P>
   And what these latest indexes show is that whoever is doing the
measuring _ left-of-center groups concerned with social justice or
conservatives worried about moral values _ the overall trend has
been downward over the last 30 years, despite the growing
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff's social-health index _ which combines 16 social
indicators, including child poverty, infant mortality, crime,
access to health care and affordable housing _ plummeted from a
rating of 77 out of a possible 100 in 1973 to 38 in 1993. And
although Bennett placed a greater emphasis on cultural issues like
out-of-wedlock births, divorce, community participation and levels
of trust or distrust in government, he arrived at similar results.
</P>
<P>
   True, in the last few years Miringoff's index showed that the
country has made a small but appreciable jump, from 38 to 46 from
1993 to 1997. It is a trend that Bennett has reported as well:
``The decade of the '90s has seen progress in some key social
indicators: reductions in welfare, violent crime, abortion, AIDS,
divorce and suicide; upswings in SAT scores and charitable
giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, according to the various measurements of social
well-being, Americans are, on the whole, richer but unhappier than
they were three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are wondering whether these findings might help
explain the mysterious X-factor in American political life: why
there are so many disenchanted voters in a period of unprecedented
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline in the index coincides with the decline of trust
in government,'' according to surveys, Miringoff said. Could it
also account for such diverse phenomena as the popularity of Ross
Perot, Jesse Ventura and the Reform Party; Pat Buchanan's and Ralph
Nader's presidential bids; and the recent protests in Seattle and
Washington against globalization?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying this is a perfect science,'' Miringoff said.
``But the fact that Bennett, who is looking at moral and cultural
things, and I, who take a more social and economic approach, come
to similar conclusions says something interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has confidence in these measures, however. ``The
problem I have with some of these indices is that they start to
take on a political connotation,'' Benjamin M. Friedman, a
political economist at Harvard University, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He criticizes Bennett's attempt to quantify moral values by
looking at rates of divorce and participation in church groups as
well as Miringoff's decision to include income inequality in his
social-health index. ``I happen to think income inequality is very
important, but some people don't consider it a problem,'' Friedman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman favors simple bare-bones indexes like the U.N.
human-development index, which has three sets of statistics: per
capita income, life expectancy and educational enrollment. By this
measure, the United States ranks No. 3 in the world, after Canada
and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone agrees that life expectancy is a good thing,''
Friedman says. At the same time the U.N. international poverty
index ranks the United States No. 17, at the bottom among
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Miringoff argues that while there is a subjective and
political element to any survey, many of the categories he includes
in his social index _ alcohol-related traffic deaths, youth
suicide, teen-age drug use, infant mortality, low-weight birth,
unemployment, real wages and child poverty _ involve hard data on
matters of obvious importance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for exploring the messier world of social health, he
explains, is that in the postindustrial economy, per capita income
and gross national product don't reveal as much as they once did.
Until about 30 years ago social indicators like crime, infant
mortality, drug and alcohol abuse moved up and down with the GNP.
Now they no longer do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a rising tide lifted all boats, but at a
certain point during the 1970s, social health and per capita income
split apart,'' Miringoff said. ``And this may be a result of the
new economy: the loss of steady, well-paid jobs with benefits for
less skilled, blue-collar workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The very element Friedman suggests eliminating _ income
inequality _ may be the key indicator for understanding the
phenomenon, Miringoff says. While per capita income rose on
aggregate, average weekly wages went down from a high of $315 in
1973 down to $256 in 1996, measured in constant dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The income of the top fifth of the population went from $86,000
to $125,000, while that of the bottom fifth dropped from $11,640 to
$11,388. The percentage of children living in poverty went from
14.2 percent in 1973 to 22 percent in the early 1990s and has only
recently dipped below 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These economic factors, which affect access to affordable
housing and health care and are reflected in both Miringoff's
social index and the genuine progress indicator, may help account
for some of the symptoms of moral decline noted by Bennett:
increases in crime, alcohol-related fatalities, drug use and
out-of-wedlock births.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a measure like the genuine progress indicator put out
by Redefining Progress is an attempt to include things like time
spent taking care of children and doing household work, which are
not counted in the GNP, and subtracts other items like legal and
medical bills, commuting time and money spent on locks and house
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be difficult to reach a national consensus on what
to measure, many states, cities and counties are creating their own
scales. In Connecticut, Gov. John Rowland, a Republican, has
adopted Miringoff's social-health index without controversy to
measure social problems and formulate policies.
</P>
<P>
   In Traverse City, Mich., which is at the center of five rural
counties, a local group instituted a quality-of-life index by
surveying 2,000 residents about what they considered important.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put three things right at the top: environment, education
and public health,'' said Mary Swaney, research coordinator for the
project. ``Out here we don't have too much money but a great
environment _ we have an expression, `A view of the bay is worth
half the pay.''' The city's bay opens into northern Lake Michigan.
Among the measures adopted to track the state of the environment is
a count of the bird and frog species.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan group also measures things like shoplifting and
litigation as signs of social trouble, and the number of septic
tanks as a way of tracking sprawl, something residents say they
would like to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the city is gearing up to count pedestrians in
different neighborhoods because many residents said they felt safer
and happier seeing other people on the streets. John Laswick, the
manager of Tucson's Sustainable Communities Program, says the
sudden concern for quality-of-life issues, even in affluent places
like Tucson, is a symptom of rapid economic growth and sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprawl has become a big issue in the last couple of years,''
he said. ``I think that with the last five minutes of commuting
time, something snapped. I think that intuitively people sense that
there is something wrong there. They are missing relationships,
community, urban form and a connection with the environment _
things that are not measured in the GNP.''
</P>
<P>
   In many states and cities, like Jacksonville, Fla., the indexes
are used by local government to assess the performance of city
agencies. Jacksonville, Tucson and other cities have not yet
combined their numbers into a single index but are looking for ways
to study the links between their various measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a set of connected relationships that define
community health,'' said Laswick of Tucson. ``People's perception
of the safety of the schools affects whether parents let kids walk
to school or drive them. If they insist on driving them, that means
more oil dripping on the roads and into the streams. We are trying
to show that there are these connections. People are looking for a
more subtle and more meaningful way of measuring what's important
to them.''

&HT;     LAZIO TO CHALLENGE CLINTON IN N.Y. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN and STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Little-known Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., jumped into
the race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for a Senate
seat from New York on Friday, quickly filling a political vacuum
created by the withdrawal of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from
the showcase contest.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a conservative four-term congressman from Long Island who
once had close ties to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
declared his candidacy minutes after Giuliani's withdrawal from the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I am the strongest Republican candidate, and the
Republican who is best able to unite our party and defeat Hillary
Clinton in November,'' Lazio declared.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is expected to get the backing of New York Gov. George
Pataki and state GOP Chairman William Powers to capture the
Republican nomination for the Senate at the party's convention in
Buffalo, N.Y., on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, diagnosed with a treatable form of prostate cancer in
late April, told a New York City Hall news conference that he was
withdrawing ``to put my health first.'' The announcement came days
after Giuliani announced that he is seeking a legal separation from
his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover, to spend time with Judith
Nathan, a ``very good friend'' who lives in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani promised to support any Republican nominated by the
state GOP to battle Clinton for the Senate seat held by retiring
five-term Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is a lesser known politician than Giuliani, a combative
former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official who has
applied tough remedies to many of New York City's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who held a narrow 44 percent to 43 percent edge over
Giuliani in the latest statewide survey, swamped Lazio 50 percent
to 31 percent in the same Quinnipiac College Poll completed on May
15.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a lawyer and a former member of the Suffolk County
Legislature on Long Island, faces the immediate task of introducing
himself to the state's 10.7 million registered voters, particularly
voters outside his district in the New York metropolitan area and
upstate New York who have barely heard of him.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of four voters questioned in a statewide CBS News-New
York Times survey completed April 5 said they had not heard enough
about Lazio to even form an opinion about the 42-year-old
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who held a news conference in New York City moments
after Giuliani's withdrawal, declined to assess the political
impact of her rival's withdrawal or Lazio's entrance into the race,
saying she would ``just wait and see what develops.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had steadily gained on Giuliani to overtake his edge in
statewide surveys since she launched the first Senate campaign by a
first lady in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were quick to offer Lazio public support. Giuliani
said Lazio ``can count on my help and my support'' if he wins the
GOP Senate nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee that is working to expand the GOP's 10-seat
edge over Democrats in the Senate, all but anointed Lazio as the
GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is ``a top notch campaigner and fundraiser'' with a
``running start'' in the race, McConnell said, adding: ``Lazio is
probably in the best position to make a seamless transition as a
vigorous candidate with the single goal of representing New York's
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the prospective GOP presidential
nominee, said he was ``confident that the New York Republican Party
will nominate a New Yorker who will be able to win'' in the race
against Clinton, a dig at Clinton who is fighting to overcome
``carpetbagger'' criticism because she only recently moved into the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who had explored challenging Giuliani for the GOP Senate
nomination last fall, first won his seat in 1992 by upsetting a
better-financed Democratic 18-year incumbent, Rep. Thomas Downey.
Lazio has built a reputation in Congress as a moderate Republican
who is well-liked by conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Lazio described himself as someone
who ``can unify the party, who can draw soft Democrats and
independents, (and) who can bring the Conservative Party on
board.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's small-but-influential Conservative Party often is a
make-or-break force among Republican candidates, adding 300,000
votes or more to any GOP candidate who earns the party endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has a pro-abortion rights voting record but opposes
federal spending on abortions through federal programs such as
Medicaid. He favors banning certain forms of late-term abortions.
He has bucked Republican leaders by supporting the five-day waiting
period for handgun purchases and the ban on certain kinds of
semi-automatic assault weapons. The Sierra Club and the League of
Conservation Voters endorsed him in his House races because of his
pro-environment position.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio voted to impeach President Clinton in the wake of the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made his mark in Congress by shepherding compromise
legislation on public housing in 1998 that overhauled the federally
supported system that shelters 1.3 million families and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting his Senate campaign, Lazio may be able to look to
Giuliani for assistance. The two-term mayor of New York City raised
$19.3 million for his Senate campaign from 200,000 donors
nationwide and still had $9.2 million on hand as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Snyder, spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission,
said Giuliani faces a number of options for dealing with his Senate
campaign war chest. He could:
</P>
<P>
   _ save the money for a subsequent campaign, such as seeking the
New York governorship . His second four-year term ends Dec. 31,
2001, and he cannot seek a third term under state law.
</P>
<P>
   _ return the donations to his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   _ make two $1,000 campaign donations to Lazio's Senate bid, one
donation for the primary contest and one for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   _ donate his Senate campaign treasury to the New York state GOP
or the Republican National Committee ``without limitation'' to
finance party efforts on behalf of Lazio or any other Republican.
</P>
<P>
   _ transform his Senate campaign committee into a political
action committee that could support selected candidates, including
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Were Giuliani to return individual campaign donations to
supporters with a letter suggesting that they donate the money to
Lazio, the FEC might regard the mailing as an in-kind campaign
contribution by Giuliani. The Lazio campaign might finance such a
mailing, however, to avoid any problems.

   Lazio had long coveted the Republican Senate nomination and has
contrasted his record of legislative compromise with Giuliani's
combative style and role in defending New York police in a series

   Lazio had courted New York's Conservative Party, winning

   Long made no commitment to support Lazio in a telephone

HUGGING THE GROUND IN A LOW-RIDING SHOWBOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By DAN NEIL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The crowd parts in front of Lonnie Lopez's golf
cart, faces beaming with hope that the editor of Lowrider magazine
_ the bible of the Latino-centered customizing movement _ will stop
to take a picture. Lopez, 39, is looking for new blood in the
parking lot of the Florida State Fairgrounds, a weekend stop last
month on the 15-city Lowrider Boulevard Tour 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, yo, Lowrider man!'' a young man in baggy shorts and
basketball jersey calls after him. ``What about my ride?'' The
youth has a buzz cut and a beard that looks as if it were penciled
onto his jaw. He and Lopez exchange a complicated handshake and a
few words in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The car is a late '80s Cadillac Sedan de Ville, painted in an
ice-blue metallic _ ``metal flake'' _ with snowy tuck-and-roll
upholstery, golden-spoke wheels and a sound system with the power
of a public-address system. Outfitted with a hydraulics system in
its suspension, the car holds its right front wheel a foot off the
ground, like a dog favoring a wounded paw.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac does not quite make the cut. ``Keep working on it,
bro,'' Lopez says. ``I'll be back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowriding emerged in the 1950s in California, as
Mexican-American youths _ in what may have been a reaction to the
hot-rod culture dominated by whites _ transformed their cars into
fantastical, ground-hugging showboats. ``Go low and go slow'' were
the watchwords. From the beginning, lowriding was as much about
ethnic identity as about machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way for the Chicano people to feel pride in who they
were, in their way of life,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, lowriding began to break out of its traditionally
Latino stronghold, a trend fueled by Lopez's magazine itself.
Lowrider's provocative covers, featuring buxom models in the
scantiest of bikinis, had undeniable shelf appeal to young men of
all ethnic backgrounds. Lowrider magazine became a multicultural
crossover hit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Latinos account for only 58 percent of Lowrider's
audience, Lopez said. Fully a quarter of the magazine's readers are
white, he said, and the balance are African-American and Asian.
While its circulation of 216,000 is low compared with mainstream
auto magazines that rely heavily on mail subscriptions, like Motor
Trend and Road &AMP; Track, it perennially leads the car enthusiast
segment in rack sales. Once confined to the West Coast, lowriding,
like ``slamming'' _ the high-performance modification of small
cars, usually Japanese imports _ has spread east.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of mainstream acceptance, when the Petersen
Automotive Museum in Los Angeles recently staged a lowriders
exhibit, museum attendance doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever gang-life origins the hobby once had have long since
disappeared, said Lopez, leaving only a mildly menacing patina,
including the occasional flaming skull or smoking gun motif on the
elaborate murals that adorn many of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad-boy image, but it's not a bad-boy sport,'' he said.
``A guy spends $30,000 on a lowrider, the last thing he's going to
do is a drive-by.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Cortinaz, a member of the Low Lyfe Car Club in Plant City,
Fla., said that lowriding was actually an alternative to gang life,
a common refrain. ``It keeps kids off the streets, gives them
something to do,'' said Cortinaz, 26, festooned with gold chains to
match his gold-plated Chevy pickup. His attention strays when two
teen-agers in miniskirts and halter tops walk by. ``Mostly we do it
for the females.''
</P>
<P>
   While the prototypical lowrider remains a Chevrolet from the
early '60's, hobbyists have surprisingly ecumenical tastes. There
are ``oldies'' and ``bombs,'' cars and trucks built before 1955;
``traditionals,'' American cars built from the 1960s through the
1980s; trucks and mini-trucks; and ``euros'' _ which, despite that
label, are typically compact Japanese cars with oversize wheels and
elaborate plastic body cladding that mimics the look of European
sports coupes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people get into it with newer cars,'' Lopez
said. ``It's a lot more affordable to do a used Honda than a
classic car.''
</P>
<P>
   What is striking _ and poignant _ about the lowriding movement
is the tender devotion lavished on what would be otherwise the
throwaways of consumer car culture. The clunky detritus of the
1970s and 1980s _ these Monte Carlos, Regals, LeBarons and
Bonnevilles _ seem to have won some sort of karmic lottery. Instead
of being crushed and forgotten, these cars will live forever in a
glitzy state of perpetual recycling.
</P>
<P>
   The luckiest lowriders become show cars, dramatically ornate and
customized vehicles that are all but undrivable. In Tampa, the show
cars _ whose owners are often paid to appear at lowrider events _
took up residence inside the fairgrounds arena, where each was
mounted in its own tableau of crushed velvet, mirrors, lights, fog
machines and other Vegas-style stagecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing was Manuel and Carla Corbala's 1979 Cutlass Supreme
``Strictly Business,'' three-time winner of the ``Lowrider of the
Year'' award and a project that cost Corbala about $80,000. A
fantasy in deep purple and fuchsia, the car has had what is known
as a frame-off customizing job. All the suspension and
undercarriage components have been gold plated, from the control
arms to the wheel hubs. All of this work is visible since
``Strictly Business,'' like most of the show cars, sits on
gold-plated jack stands over a mirrored floor, its wire wheels
removed and arrayed around the car.
</P>
<P>
   The car's body has been transformed. The center section has been
cut out like a targa-top Porsche, known in the hobby as the
``Hollywood'' treatment. The hinges on the doors have been reversed
so that they open ``suicide'' style. Both the hood and trunk lid
now open to the side, though the hood is removed during shows to
give visitors a better view of the engine.The engine block and
exhaust headers have been painted in lavender; the valve covers
have been gold-plated and engraved with spectacular filigree.
</P>
<P>
   The original interior of the car is only a memory, replaced by
purple velour upholstery and matching swivel chairs, accented with
hundreds of mirror tiles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the exotic hydraulic setup nested in the fully
upholstered trunk, Corbala's lowrider also has the requisite sound
system, a 5,000-watt Rockford Fosgate stereo to supply that
notorious boulevard ``bump.''
</P>
<P>
   For many cars in Corbala's class _ radical custom _ the piece de
resistance is mural art. This is an intriguing style of painting:
Aztec priests carrying swooning maidens toward a sacrificial altar;
dreamscapes with Indian shamans, succubi and coiling serpents;
Cortez and Quetzalcoatl.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the murals are very intimate and plainly sincere,
such as the artwork on Romero Bautista's ``Just a Dream.'' Once an
ordinary 1982 Pontiac Grand Prix, the car has metamorphosed into a
shrine devoted to the memory of both Selena, the Mexican pop star
who was murdered in 1995, and Our Lady of Guadalupe.

   The featured event of lowrider gatherings is the car-hopping
contest, where hydraulic-equipped cars compete to see how high they
can bounce their wheels off the ground. The contestants stand
beside the vehicles, operating the hydraulics with a switch box
connected to the car through a cable. Jorge Guzman's 1987 Toyota
pickup truck set a world record in the truck hop, with a wheelie 62
inches high, before the truck's gas tank ruptured and the vehicle
burst into flame, sending judges and contestants scampering for the
fire extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
   Without exception, each of the cars suffer heavy damage in the
course of the competition. Because the hydraulics overheat, fire is
a common occurrence. Wheels fall off, hubs shatter and suspensions
collapse. As each car disassembles itself in noise and fire, the
crowd gets to its feet and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reinforce them a lot,'' says Armando Nunez, the leader of
the hopping team sponsored by Hilow Hydraulics. ``But they don't
last too long.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, a freak accident: During the truck dance competition,
a tire explodes, firing a portion of the fractured wheel rim like
an artillery shell. It hits the truck's owner, Glen Strickland of
Jacksonville, Fla., in the face, dropping him to the concrete
floor. His jaw is shattered and he loses some teeth. It takes 15
minutes to summon an ambulance to the arena floor. The festive mood
sobers quickly and further competition is canceled.
</P>
<P>
   An R-rated rap concert ends the show. But the kids themselves
don't seem to notice the performers. Many are interested instead in
the lowrider bikes and trikes, Schwinns and Huffys given the full
lowrider treatment, including custom frames, elaborate gold-plated
scrollwork, even hydraulics, TVs, stereos and Playstations. In
time, the kids who own these bikes will trade them in for something
faster, and lower.

SECURITY COUNCIL INCREASES PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council on Friday increased the
number of troops allowed in the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra
Leone by 2,000 and is likely to expand the force by several
thousand more in the next week or two.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Leone mission, originally limited to 11,000 troops by
the council, is already the largest U.N. peacekeeping operation
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's increase was required after reinforcements from
Bangladesh, Jordan and India arrived this week. Those troops were
expected to push the force above the limit set in February, just
before the United Nations took over peacekeeping in Sierra Leone
from a regional contingent led by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But another increase to as many as 16,500 troops, which
Secretary- General Kofi Annan is expected to recommend to the
council in the next few days, will represent a substantial
commitment to bringing peace to Sierra Leone, even while rebels
there are still holding more than 300 peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Some hostages have been freed, but with alarming delays, U.N.
officials said. Releases have been promised, then have not taken
place, causing the United Nations to increase the number of troops
listed as missing. More than 500 soldiers and monitors, most of
them African, were seized by rebels at the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Any increases in the size of the peacekeeping force in Sierra
Leone pose a problem for U.S. diplomats here because they are
expected to give Congress, where there is considerable opposition
to these operations, 15 days' notice of any new or augmented
mission. The administration can waive this notification, as it
apparently did for Friday's vote, but the procedure could seriously
delay the next move in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials are concerned about how a weak elected
government in the capital, Freetown, will deal with Foday Sankoh,
the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, whose forces took the
hostages. Sankoh is now in custody after nine days in hiding. But
the fact that the government has not decided what to do with Sankoh
appears to be emboldening some of his followers to demand that he
be freed if the war is to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Friday that it was investigating Sankoh's
case. His troops have been responsible for savage brutality in a
civil war that has lasted nearly nine years. In 1997, Sankoh was
sentenced to death for treason. In an agreement signed in Lome,
Togo, last July, Sankoh was nevertheless given amnesty _ not
recognized by the United Nations _ in return for a promise to
disarm. But when his soldiers began turning in weapons to
peacekeepers, rebels in the group responded by taking the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative at the
United Nations, who introduced the resolution to enlarge the
peacekeeping force, said that Sankoh had violated the Lome
agreement, implying that all promises made to him in the peace
accord were off. Sankoh had also been promised a role in a
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   Greenstock also warned that there could be no negotiating for
the release of hostages or attempts to link the fate of the U.N.
soldiers to any other issue.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has about 800 troops in Sierra Leone who were sent to
evacuate foreigners. But now those troops are playing a major role
in keeping Freetown reasonably calm, said U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   With an increase in U.N. troop strength for Sierra Leone,
Nigerian troops are likely to return to the country, along with
other West African peacekeepers representing a regional
organization, the Economic Community of West African States and its
cease-fire monitoring group, known as Ecomog. It is still not clear
whether they will be under direct U.N. command or deployed in some
other way.
</P>
<P>
   In Monrovia, Liberia, on Friday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a
special envoy sent to the region by President Clinton to work for
the release of the hostages, said that there was no room for
negotiation. ``Peacekeepers cannot be target practice for the
RUF,'' he said. Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, another former
rebel leader with ties to Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, has
been credited with a role in the freeing of about 150 hostages
before the releases stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told reporters in Monrovia that during an earlier stop
in Lagos, he had urged Nigeria to send more troops to Sierra Leone
to help settle the political crisis. ``They have the power to
remove the RUF as a military consideration in negotiations,'' he
said at a news conference at Monrovia's airport.

 CHAPLAINS HELP FAMILY, FANS COPE WITH PETTY DEATH
</HEADLINE>
  By BETHANY BRADSHER   
 Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday, May 12th, started out as a routine day for the staff of
Motor Racing Outreach. Some chaplains were at various racetracks
throughout the nation, watching practice runs or talking to crew
members. Others were in the ministry's Charlotte, N.C., office.
</P>
<P>
   And then a crash killed Adam Petty, 19, the rising star in
NASCAR's most famous family. Five chaplains quickly mobilized in
five different directions. They dropped everything to comfort the
grieving members of the Petty family and the extended stock-car
community.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Series chaplain Eddie Robison was on hand as cars
practiced that day for last Saturday's Busch 200 at the New
Hampshire International Speedway. When he heard about the crash, he
reported to the track's medical center, where he usually stays with
the injured driver as he is treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-nine times out of 100, it's nothing serious,'' Robison
said. ``I'll just be around, just like your pastor would visit the
hospital when you're sick.''
</P>
<P>
   But medical personnel were on the track with Adam Petty's car
for an unusually long time. It took 20 minutes, Robison said, to
cut Petty out of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Robison learned that Petty was in critical condition, and
he put in a call to the Charlotte office at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
As Robison headed to the hospital to be with Adam Petty and his
crew, Motor Racing Outreach founder and Winston Cup chaplain Max
Helton was calling Kyle Petty in London, where he was vacationing
with his daughter, to tell him the news.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gary Rutherford, the chaplain for the Petty
Enterprises racing shop, was en route to the Petty shop in
Thomasville, N.C. He gave word of the crash to Richard Petty, who
was in the shop that day, and the other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Beaver, another Winston Cup chaplain, had already left for
Kyle Petty's home to tell Kyle's wife, Patti.
</P>
<P>
   This network even reached overseas. After Helton finished his
phone conversation with Kyle Petty, he contacted Phil Aiken, a
London resident who leads chapel services for some Formula One
teams in England. Aiken went to visit Petty and to help him make
arrangements to fly back home.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR embraces Motor Racing Outreach's ministry because of
times like these, Robison said. The chaplains spend years leading
Bible studies and chapel services, praying with drivers and crew,
and when tragedy strikes they are spiritual comforters as well as
friends to those left behind.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Aiken in London, all of the chaplains knew
the Petty family. When they came to the front door to bring the
news every mother dreads, when they walked into the office with the
news that would eventually leave a gaping hole in the life of a
grandfather, they stepped in on a carpet of trust.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more group that will need a wise and listening ear
during the aftermath of Adam Petty's death, the largest branch in
this fiercely loyal family. They are the fans, the tens of
thousands who travel to tracks each weekend and camp in tents for
the chance to watch the exhilaration of controlled speed and,
occasionally, the heartbreak of collision.
</P>
<P>
   The fans have chaplains, too _ Dennis McGowan and his staff at
Racing Fans Outreach, which is part of Motor Racing Outreach.
McGowan will be in the camping areas around the Charlotte speedway
this weekend for The Winston. He said he expects to have
significant conversations with those who never knew Adam Petty, but
are devastated by the loss just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see fans seeing the need for spiritual growth through
deaths like this,'' McGowan said. ``There's a real sense of
mortality that strikes them once they see their hero, and he's
dead.''

RALLYING ROUND THE NEW CHINA TRADE BILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the House of Representatives this week tackles the issue of
liberalizing trade ties with China, the voice of American business
will be heard loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Newt Gingrich tried unsuccessfully in 1995 and 1996 to
make liability laws more favorable to corporations have so many
types of American companies banded together to lobby for a single
issue, according to Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. From agricultural processors to Internet
businesses, and from automakers to movie studios, corporate America
sees profits in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobbying effort, the bigger fish are leaning hard on the
smaller ones. Companies that sell everything from cleaning supplies
to titanium to Boeing _ even hot dogs to its employees _ may not
seem like exporters. But with Boeing increasingly reliant on
overseas aircraft sales, and convinced that China will become the
world's fastest-growing aircraft market, the company has enlisted
its parts makers to badger members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could be potent, for there is a supplier in nearly
every pot. Boeing's 10,000 suppliers are spread across 420 of the
nation's 435 congressional districts _ a distribution that rivals
that of even the most politically durable military program _ and
Boeing has contacted them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those suppliers is an exporter and should
understand the importance of China, and we think they do,'' said
Philip Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, who has made
10 trips to Washington from his Seattle office this year. ``You're
just running an all-out campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to counter the corporate effort, unions and environmental
and other advocacy groups have organized demonstrations, started
letter-writing campaigns and sent supporters to Washington by the
busload. But American business has responded with its own
mobilization, using connections to lawmakers forged over years of
nickel-and-dime lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The pact has wide corporate support because it would require
China to lower tariffs, end restrictive business rules and
dismantle many other trade barriers. The United States, in turn,
would halt its annual congressional reviews of China's access to
the American market. Those reviews have often focused on human
rights and have made some American companies leery of long-term
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers and equipment makers want lower tariffs on American
grain. Insurers, banks and brokerage houses want to eliminate
licensing requirements that turn any hope of entry into China into
a multiyear marathon of wining and dining government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers want an end to China's requirement that 80 percent of
the parts in any car built there be made in China. Retailers are
eager to import far more low-priced clothing from China. Hollywood,
drug makers and high-technology businesses want improved
protections against the illegal copying of movies, medicines and
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of government regulation and intervention, we'd like
it to be the minimum necessary,'' said Robert Kimmitt, vice
chairman and president of Commerce One in Pleasanton, Calif., which
has already set up business-to-business Internet exchanges in the
United States and is trying to do so in China, too.
</P>
<P>
   The normalization of trade would bring all this and more as
China seeks to integrate its economy more closely with the global
market by joining the World Trade Organization. Membership in the
WTO would require Beijing to comply with extraordinarily detailed
free-trade rules, which extend far beyond tariffs and duties to
cover most everything from intellectual property rights to the
freedom granted to companies to set up their own distribution
networks. Proponents say full entry into the world market will make
China more prosperous, more open and less prone to abusing human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to favor free trade and we also think that if we
really do want to progress in human rights within China, one of the
ways to do that is to actually open up trade,'' said Jacques
Nasser, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   American labor leaders and their allies reject the executives'
reasoning. The United States, they say, would lose its ability to
influence human rights in China, particularly because the bill
would eliminate the annual votes in Congress on trade ties _ votes
that have sometimes prompted China to ease policies.
</P>
<P>
   Still fuming over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which
they blame for a loss of jobs to Mexico, union presidents are even
more fearful of free trade with the world's largest low-wage
country. Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile
Workers, said congressional approval would ``give American
corporations an incentive again to ship jobs, this time to China,
which is even cheaper.''
</P>

   But while unions worry about losing jobs, American companies
fret about losing markets. ``We have the potential of a 100-fold
increase in travel per person in a country of 1.2 billion people,
and that's a huge market,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deal, he contended, poses a question from China to
America: ``Is the U.S. a reliable trade partner and can we buy
airplanes from Boeing, or is it not a reliable trade partner and do
we look to Europe?''

   Following are closer looks by reporters for The New York Times
at how various industries would be affected by a new China trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Autos: Huge Investments, And Seeking More
</P>
<P>
   When the Transportation Department won approval from Beijing
four years ago for the first nonstop air route between the United
States and China, the American city chosen was not Los Angeles, San
Francisco or Seattle, but Detroit. The selection reflected the
enormous role that automakers have played in American investment in
China.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is building Buicks at a $1.5 billion factory in
Shanghai and is about to assemble Chevrolet S-10 pickups and Blazer
sport utility vehicles in Shenyang. Ford makes delivery vans, car
seats and radiators in China, while DaimlerChrysler assembles Jeep
Cherokees and Mercedes sedans. Delphi Automotive Systems, the
world's largest auto parts company, produces most everything from
batteries to door latches there.
</P>
<P>
   Normalized trade ties would transform the way automakers do
business in China, said Theodor Cunningham, executive vice
president for global sales and marketing at DaimlerChrysler.
China's requirement of 80 percent local content would disappear,
allowing DaimlerChrysler to ship higher-quality parts from
elsewhere. Chinese restrictions on private networks of car
dealerships would end, as would requirements that extensive
research and development be done in China, allowing DaimlerChrysler
to design cars in Michigan for Chinese production. Perhaps most
important, the country could no longer demand that the company hand
over the blueprints for its minivans before allowing them to be
built in China. For years, that rule has kept the company from
starting production there, for fear that knockoffs would be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire package is very meaningful to us,'' Cunningham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders dismiss the Chinese concessions, questioning
whether they will be honored. ``Who's going to enforce it? We can't
even enforce deals with Japan,'' said Yokich of the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   The union also expressed concern that permanent trade ties with
China would make companies more comfortable about establishing
factories there that might otherwise be built in the United States.
Auto parts companies have already moved considerable production _
and jobs _ to Mexico, Yokich said.
</P>
<P>
   But J.T. Battenberg 3rd, Delphi's chairman and chief executive,
said that concerns about American job losses were unwarranted and
that most auto parts production in China would be for cars sold
there. ``The point they miss,'' he said of critics, ``is that the
logistics costs of moving parts around the world are expensive.''

   Pharmaceuticals: Approving Factories, But Not the Drugs
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer will sell billions of dollars worth of Lipitor, its
popular cholesterol-fighting drug, this year, but none of those
sales will be in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist government agreed last year that Pfizer would have
the exclusive right to sell Lipitor in China. But days later, the
government said a generic-drug company, which may have obtained the
drug's patented formula on the black market, could also sell the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer still hopes to sell Lipitor in China, but it could lose
many sales to the generic-drug company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a level playing field,'' said C. Louis Clemente, a
Pfizer executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer owns a large factory in Dalian, in northern China, and
sold $60 million of other drugs in China last year. It says it
could sell much more if China would do more to protect intellectual
property rights and to lower other barriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has such high hurdles for foreign
companies that several have built factories in China, only to find
that they could not obtain government approval for some drugs they
had planned to make there.
</P>
<P>
   In its trade deal with Washington last November, China agreed to
change many practices that hurt American companies. Most important
for American drug companies, it agreed to strengthen its protection
of patents and other intellectual property rights. It has also
agreed to lower tariffs on drugs, end pricing practices that favor
Chinese companies and allow foreign companies to distribute their
own products.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
industry's trade group, estimates that American drug companies,
which already sell about $700 million worth of drugs to China,
could increase sales by more than $100 million in the first year if
China, as promised, cut tariffs by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is explosive,'' said Mark Grayson, a spokesman
for the trade group. ``As people become middle class, they want
Western medicine.''

   Entertainment: Hollywood Wants A Bigger Box Office
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry _ especially Hollywood _ has been
enthusiastic about easing trade barriers with China and has been
pushing hard for the trade bill. There are two reasons: China is a
huge potential market, even if few American movies are now released
there. And studios worry that rejection of the bill would prompt
Beijing to spitefully cancel the fledgling trade agreements already
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our trade with China is minuscule,'' said Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, which
represents studios. ``The reason we are passionately in favor of
the trade bill has far more to do with the long-range future.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last summer, China limited United States companies to
exporting 10 movies a year there, with the studios keeping half the
revenue and China the remainder. On the other hand, there was no
limit to how many films the studios could simply sell to Chinese
distributors. In recent years, 40 to 50 films made outside China,
mostly small independent ones, have been sold for flat fees there.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood studios, however, are not interested in flat fees.
They want a continuous share of the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, President Clinton's trade negotiators reached a new
deal that doubled, to 20, the number of American movies that could
be imported, with promises of further increases in future years.
That is still small potatoes by Hollywood standards, but a step in
what the studios consider the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   The studios now do about $25 million of business a year in
China. That is a tiny fraction of what would start flowing in if
most movies were given a Chinese release and if lower trade
barriers continued to expand a Chinese middle class hungry for such
diversions.
</P>
<P>
   Some entertainment conglomerates have negotiated separate
commercial deals with China. Disney is planning a new theme park in
Hong Kong, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has an extensive
telecommunications agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is theaters. Most in China are in sad shape. The
nation has been eager to attract foreign investment in new cinemas,
but foreigners are limited to a minority share of any operation.
</P>
<P>
   Again, not good enough for Hollywood. ``We're not going to buy
any theaters until we own them,'' Valenti said. ``And we're not
going to put more money into theaters if they're not letting in
more American pictures.'' Under a new agreement, foreigners could
own a controlling interest in new Chinese multiplexes within three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Video piracy is also a source of irritation. Even Hollywood
films not released in China are often quickly available through
bootleg sources. Then, of course, not a penny of revenue flows back
to the studios.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, American trade officials say, the Chinese have
clamped down more vigorously on bootleggers. Bringing more
Hollywood movies into China, along with more multiplexes, would
give the Chinese authorities reason to crack down harder,
entertainment executives contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress votes no, my judgment is that all the agreements
we have made will be null and void,'' Valenti said. ``I mean, would
you keep an agreement with someone who just exiled you and kicked
you on the backside?''

   Textiles: Cheaper Clothing, But at What Price?
</P>
<P>
   Americans love to get fashion on the cheap. Even with the
economy booming, they are snapping up more $4.99 cotton T-shirts
and Indian print sundresses than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And shoppers are not being tricked into getting less. They have
actually been winning the war on costs. Over all, apparel prices
have fallen about 1 percent a year throughout most of the 1990s.
Last year, prices fell even more.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason that Americans pay so little for products from
blue jeans to sneakers is that manufacturing jobs have been shipped
wholesale to countries with cheap labor _ countries like China.
Long before the trade agreement was negotiated, employment in the
American apparel and textile industries was already plunging.
Together, the two industries employed 1.2 million people in this
country as of January of this year, according to the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. That is down from
2.5 million in 1973, the peak employment year for apparel workers.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the trend toward exporting sewing
jobs has been helped by earlier trade agreements that lowered
tariffs and quotas. Union data shows that in the 36 months before
Nafta took effect, the United States lost 2,000 apparel jobs.
During the following 36 months, the loss was 134,000.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many jobs have already disappeared, the effect on
manufacturing still based in the United States may not be as severe
in the future _ even the union predicts a loss of 15,000 jobs a
year at most. The real impact of the China agreement _ which allows
it to participate in the phasing out of nation-by-nation quotas on
clothing imports to the United States by 2005 _ is likely to fall
mostly on other Asian countries that will not be able to compete
with China's even lower-cost labor.
</P>
<P>
   When judging China's importance, consider that Wal-Mart Stores,
the nation's largest importer, already gets 53 percent of its
clothing imports from China, according to a study of U.S. Customs
Department documents by the Citizens Trade Campaign, which is
critical of the company and opposed to the China trade agreement.
Wal-Mart refuses to give specifics on its imports, but a spokesman,
Jay Allen, acknowledged that the company contracts directly with
``several thousand factories.''
</P>
<P>
   Once China joins the World Trade Organization, the retail
industry says, there will be gains at home to offset the job losses
abroad. Most important, executives argue, are the tariff cuts will
allow them to sell more to China. ``We see a great market
opportunity,'' said Candyce Cummings, general counsel of the VF
Corp., maker of Lee and Wrangler clothing.

   Financial Services: Investment Capital And Car Loans, Too?
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find legislation that has been embraced so
unconditionally by America's financial institutions as the China
trade bill. Whether they think they have more to gain from its
passage or to lose from its failure, they have been lobbying hard.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with commercial banking operations, like Citigroup,
salivate over the prospect of providing auto loans and other
services. Investment banks are more concerned that rejection could
chill relations with Chinese officials who have begun to tap
foreign capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   New York companies have played leading roles in raising capital
for several state-run enterprises, including the initial public
offering this month for PetroChina.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from political skirmishes over that underwriting, Henry
Paulson, chairman of Goldman Sachs, said rejection of the bill
could hurt his firm's chances of advising on future privatizations.
But he is more worried that client companies would not play as big
a part in China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any changes in the rules to work on
privatizations and other assignments,'' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs advises the Chinese government and sells foreign
securities in China. But the firm does not have an investment bank
there, as it does in Japan, because the American company would be
limited to a minority stake.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks are much more eager to expand their physical
operations in China. Citibank has only four branches there and
cannot do business in local currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There essentially is no consumer banking system in China,''
said Lionel Johnson, Citigroup's director of international
government relations. ``People have very limited relationships with
banks, limited opportunities to invest their savings.''
</P>
<P>
   While China is expected to remain wary of anything that
threatens the stability of its state-run banks, all that is
supposed to start changing within five years under the trade pact,
potentially giving Citibank and other foreign banks an even chance
to compete with domestic banks for tens of millions of consumers.
The banks see an opportunity to lend money to Chinese customers for
big-ticket purchases, especially cars. They also anticipate being
able to decide where to put branches, instead of having the
government assign the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' Johnson said, ``market forces will make
those decisions.''

   Insurance: A Foot in the Door To Selling Policies
</P>
<P>
   For American insurance companies, China is a virtually untapped
market. Most Chinese do not have coverage, and though they lack
great wealth, they save a larger share of their earnings than
Americans do. American insurers hope to sell them life insurance
with savings features, as well as health insurance and pension
plans.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, nearly a dozen insurers from the United
States and about 90 others from Japan, Europe and elsewhere have
been romancing the Chinese _ meeting with government officials and
potential business partners, offering free classes in underwriting
and making gifts to universities.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, a few insurers have been invited to apply for
licenses. Then, after a couple of years of stepping through
government hurdles, they have been allowed to open.
</P>
<P>
   Nine foreign insurers, mostly life insurers, now sell policies
in China, including two from the United States _ the American
International Group and Aetna. Passage of the trade bill would mean
that any company could apply for a license. But American insurers
do not expect China to suddenly issue licenses to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to wake up and all of a sudden find the flood
gates open,'' one American executive said. ``They are very
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, perhaps a half-dozen foreign insurers would be
allowed in each year, and all would operate on a short tether.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the exception of AIG _ which was founded in Shanghai
in 1919 and, in 1980, was the first American financial services
company to open an office in modern China _ they are restricted to
Shanghai. Under the pact, they would be allowed to expand gradually
to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   American insurers say they would prefer fewer restrictions, but
like other foreign businesses, they are overwhelmed by China's
potential. ``Things don't have to be perfect,'' said Brad Smith of
the American Council on Life Insurance. ``This is a good first
step.''

   High Technology: Intellectual Property And Other Issues
</P>
<P>
   To the high-technology industry, China is a vast emerging market
that is virtually out of reach. Analysts estimate that China will
soon be one of the three largest markets for computers, software
and Internet products. While companies like Motorola, Advanced
Micro Devices and Intel have some operations there, they say
Chinese regulations and lax intellectual property protections
significantly interfere with their ability to do business.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade bill does not pass, the industry says, China will
become a World Trade Organization member but will not be treated as
such by the United States and thus will not have to follow the
group's rules when dealing with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we negotiated will go to our non-American competitors,''
said James Whittaker, chairman of the U.S. High Tech Coalition on
China, a lobbying group based in Washington. ``We will be at a
severe disadvantage in one of the most important markets in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including labor organizations, are concerned that
high-technology companies will exploit China's large pool of
skilled engineers and weak labor protections and move jobs
overseas. Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, noted, however, that
while 60 percent of Intel's revenues came from abroad, 70 percent
of its work force was in the United States. ``Success in China,''
he said, ``can help create jobs in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications is also seen as a potential bonanza for
American companies. Arthur Kobler, president of the China operation
for AT&AMP;T, expects China's roughly $50 billion communications market
to double by 2004, fueled largely by an explosion in wireless
telephone use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime this year or next year, China will become the
second-largest wireless market, behind the United States but ahead
of Japan,'' Kobler said. ``China is a market that you cannot not be
in.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, China's extensive restrictions on foreign
business operations severely limit American high-technology and
telecommunications companies. Foreign-made products are subject to
high tariffs. Yet foreign companies that want to produce in China
face restrictions on what parts they can buy from abroad and are
permitted to distribute their products within China only through
local distributors. State-owned enterprises control a significant
share of the trade in electronics goods, and American companies
complain that they give preference to higher-cost Chinese
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   That could change soon. In the bilateral pact reached in
November, China agreed to phase out tariffs and other restrictions
and to immediately become subject to the WTO's patent and copyright
rules. That provides tremendous opportunities not only to the
United States but also to China, said David Levine, a professor at
the Walter A. Haas School of Business at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``High tech,'' he said, ``is one instance of the general theory
that if you want to learn from the rest of the world, you trade
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Communications services are likely to be an important part of
that trade. Moreover, the opportunity to sell services to Chinese
businesses and consumers may well be surpassed by the chance to win
over big foreign corporations that want to link their Chinese
operations with their other units. _SARA ROBINSON and SETH SCHIESEL

<P>
   Agriculture: Poised to Become A Big Winner
</P>
<P>
   American agriculture could be one of the biggest beneficiaries
of the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering through nearly three years of depressed
commodity prices, American farmers hope that improved trade
relations will let them sell millions of bushels of surplus corn,
soybeans and other crops to China over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the United States had more than $50 billion in
agricultural exports; only about $1 billion of that went to China.
Agriculture officials say that if relations are normalized, exports
could double in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Farm equipment makers like Caterpillar, Deere and CNH project
strong exports of farm tractors and combines. Cargill and Archer
Daniels Midland expect to sell more processed goods, like soybean
meal and vegetable oil. And the prices that farmers get for beef,
poultry and pork could also get a lift.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all agriculture officials see a win-win situation that
could only increase exports and raise commodity prices. ``Everybody
except for a few splinter groups wants this to happen,'' said Bob
Callanan, a spokesman at the American Soybean Association. ``China
needs so much. Their people want to eat better.''
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans are the leading American farm export to China. Although
little corn reaches the country, China has already made concessions
that would including importing 4.5 million metric tons of corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy to get China to implement this
agreement,'' said Susan Keith, an official at the National Corn
Growers Association in St. Louis. ``But if they're denied access,
they will do nothing to accommodate the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   China has already said that if it receives trading privileges,
it would lower its tariffs on most American agricultural goods.
Most everything from apples to wine would have a better chance of
getting in. Tariffs could fall from 31 percent today, on average,
to 14 percent in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   If China, as promised, also cuts subsidies to its own farmers,
American corn growers could have a better chance of selling their
crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is the largest consumer market in the world,'' said
Tamara White, director of commodities at the Illinois Farm Bureau.
``To get in on the ground level would be great. You want American
beef and American corn there, so you can get your flavor on their
taste buds.''

   wasteland?Networks bring voyeurism homeBy David Kronke &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Television Writer &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we've lost our sense of shame. ``Every day on 'Jerry
Springer,' secrets are confessed to that, in the past, people would
have gone to their graves with without telling a single soul,''
observes Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television and a professor at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're revealing these dark secrets to the general public
through most sophisticated mass-communications system in history.
That's a major, major cultural shift one of the biggest stories of
the last quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also spawned the phenomenon known as ``Reality TV.'' When
television promises you ``reality,'' what it means of course is
heightened reality, the spectacular emotional terrain that most of
us travel only occasionally (tragedy, ecstasy, fury, intense
romance) and not the humdrum facts of day-to-day living (doing the
dishes, paying the bills, walking the dog). The ``reality'' part
occurs because viewers are seeing not actors spouting lines and
emoting grandiosely, but non-professionals honestly agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has been ratcheting up in recent years to today's
white-hot level. ``MTV's The Real World'' threw together dissimilar
young, attractive people in trendy environs and let them grope and
gripe with one another; afternoon talk shows like ``Springer''
upped the ante with frequent virulent clashes between guests. ``The
Blair Witch Project'' was a huge hit last summer because moviegoers
felt they were watching real people undergoing psychological
torture. And ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is an unprecedented
TV phenomenon, in no small part because the show accentuates the
contestant's squirming in ``The Hot Seat'' to melodramatic music.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, CBS brings to America a couple of European imports
that are massive sensations overseas. In ``Survivor,'' debuting May
31, 16 contestants are plopped on an exotic island and must
scramble to attain food and shelter. Early clips show participants
bickering over who wasn't contributing to the group effort;
contestants hold regular sessions in which they vote members off
the island and, obviously, off the show. The final ``Survivor''
wins $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' coming in July, is even more claustrophobic: 10
contestants are locked into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house
equipped with dozens of cameras and microphones and not allowed to
leave the grounds for 100 days. A combination of participant and
viewer votes ousts cast members; the last remaining houseguest wins
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show like this would have been unthinkable 10 years ago,''
suggests ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul Romer, who created
the series in the Netherlands. ``It's kind of the next step. We
have a different attitude to our personal privacy. We're used to
webcams, to surveillance cameras in the streets and shopping malls.
Real soap operas are boring: This is a marriage between real life
and a soap opera. It's about human interaction relationships. There
are no scripted lines and no actors, and that's why it's very
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer also cites the films ``ED-tv'' and ``The Truman Show'' as
proof of the audience's interest in the subject, neglecting to
mention that by the end of those films, the characters have grown
to hate those intrusive cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was argued that merely placing a camera at a
location altered the reality, but now, with the ubiquity of
camcorders, that may no longer be true. Larry Fleece, executive
producer of the syndicated series ``Real TV,'' which compiles
footage of unstaged feats and traumas, notes, ``If you put camera
in someone's face, it changes things. But if you build a blind for
a nature show, the animal becomes used to its presence after days,
weeks and months. The camera's presence becomes second nature.
After the novelty wears off, the camera becomes part of the family
and people become desensitized to it, and not so self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle is that this didn't happen long ago that TV and
voyeurism, two of America's favorite pastimes, became bedfellows,''
says Thompson. ``They were made for each other. Humans have had
voyeuristic tendencies since the moment we crawled out of the
primordial ooze. TV allows incredible opportunities for peeping-tom
experiences and you don't have to find a window. The window comes
to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social mores have relaxed significantly over the past
generations,'' Thompson continues. ``There used to be rules about
what you show and don't show on TV. But with the increased
competition from cable and the Internet, all bets are off. Networks
say, 'We've got to bring people into our tent.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Wild, TV critic for Rolling Stone and author of ``The
Showrunners,'' a book examining a tumultuous year in network
television, jokes, ``The only thing more painful than reality is
reality TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``The bankruptcy of fiction TV is a large part of
the reason for reality TV's success.'' He confesses to being a
closet fan of ``Blind Date,'' a relationship game show, and ``The
Real World:'' ``I like seeing people even stupider than myself as
much as the next guy. But I don't know what it says about the
future of TV as a medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of genres in television is cyclical
</P>
<P>
   this is cyclical, but it's also sick. Darva (Conger) and Rick
(Rockwell) are part of our lives (thanks to the intense coverage of
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'') but I don't know what
any of us gain from it,'' Wild says. ``It's not like 'Network' (the
1976 film anticipating and excoriating cheap TV publicity stunts)
it !ital!is!off! 'Network.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those whose livelihood depends on creating fictional TV see
reality TV's explosion as a threat. Peter Mehlman, whose sitcom
``It's like, you know'' was canceled for ``Millionaire,'' recently
told Wild, ``Being canceled for ``Millionaire'' is like having a
girlfriend leave you for a rapist and she knows it. The networks
aren't catering to the lowest common denominator they
!ital!are!off! the lowest common denominator.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wild applauds the networks for trying new things.
``There's a sense that they're going down, but they're going down
guerilla style,'' he says. ``Say what you will about these shows,
but they're very spunky, and little else is working. So why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson agrees: ``The bottom line is, if done correctly, these
shows could be absolutely huge. I think 'Big Brother' will be
bigger only because of the illusions to similarity to our real
life. It's 'The Real World' and just as contrived, but still
earthbound. There's a sense that we can relate to the arguments
they'll be having. With 'Survivor' and the island, there's a sense
of costume drama about the whole thing it's 'The Blue Lagoon'
plugged in. These shows will live and die on how well they're
executed, which means, how much the contestants don't get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer admits that each time ``Big Brother'' debuted in the
Netherlands, Germany and Spain ``there was a lot of passion in the
media response. ... I really understand (the complaints), but they
were making judgments without enough information. People do not go
unprepared into the house we'd prepare them extensively and tell
them of all the potential pitfalls ahead of time. We were
responsible and ethical. If you prepare them well, you do no
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, here are a few examples that suggest not all makers
of reality TV have the best interest of their participants in mind.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Jesse Emmons of West Hills says he was approached by the
producers of the game show ``Crush'' in which a person confesses to
having a crush on someone else, and if the object of those
affections reciprocates, they win a trip together and, seduced by
the idea of a free $6,000 cruise, he contacted a female friend he
knew liked him, helped the show wrangle a couple of ringers to
appear alongside him and went to the taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me lie about things, they made me say I was a
Playgirl model,'' Emmons says. ``Crush'' executive producer Barry
Poznick says that the woman offered that information in a story she
told about seeing revealing photos at his home.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the show, Emmons says, the show's producers
convinced her to reject him. ``She told them, 'Yeah, I want to go
with Jesse,' and they were all, 'Well, no. You can still have the
trip, but we want you to say you don't want to go with him.' And
she put up a fight ... And they said, 'No, no, no, it's OK, we do
this all the time. For TV purposes, it'll be better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So she comes out and holds up the card reading, 'Just be
friends.' And I'm like, 'What?' I can't believe it. The host pats
me on the shoulder, like a concerned guy, and says, 'Maybe it's
better this way.' And I said, 'Dude, (expletive) you!' I knew it
was utter bulls---. She comes up to me afterwards: 'Jesse, they
made me say that.' The main producer was my best friend all day,
and the second the show was done, she knew I was pissed; she
split.''
</P>
<P>
   Poznick allows, ``We do tell everyone, don't make a rash
decision just because it's on TV. She specifically said, 'I don't
know if I want to become lovers.' We said, 'If your answer is not
yes, don't say yes.' He insists, however, that the show was not
manipulated in any way.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Robert Young Pelton, who travels to war zones, films the
people living there and places the stories in their political
context his work was shown on the Travel Channel on ``The World's
Most Dangerous Places'' once pitched his show to the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had footage from Liberia of a street fight where a guy
actually takes a machete and cuts this guy's head off,'' Pelton
recalls. ``It's very disgusting, and there was footage of people
playing football with heads. I played this stuff for him. Most
people's reactions are, 'I can't watch this stuff'; you can see
their face tighten. His was, 'That's nice, that's nice, you go
places, but what I need is this.' The thing I felt disgusted about
was we were discussing the merchandising of death, and he was
telling me what he wanted. He wanted tourist snuff movies.''
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!The Associated Press reported that in a Swedish version of
``Survivor'' three years ago, a contestant voted off the island
committed suicide a month after returning home. Series executives
denied any responsibility, but the man's widow claimed that after
getting ousted from the island, her husband returned home ``deeply
depressed and agonized.''
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Of course, the most famous instance of reality chicanery
was Fox's lambasted ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' A
thorough background check of Rick Rockwell was done not by Fox, but
by an Internet site that discovered Rockwell had had a restraining
order filed against him. The marriage was annulled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   !bbox!Even prim and proper PBS juiced the ball, reality-wise,
with its series ``Antiques Roadshow,'' when it admitted that some
of the alleged ``attic discoveries'' worth small fortunes were, in
fact, staged.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Thompson points out, ``This sleazy genre, this ultimate
fall of the medium began with PBS in the 1970s with `An American
Family' (a documentary assiduously following the life of one family
through trials and triumphs). It was salacious and voyeuristic, but
we got the sense that it was a classy sociological experience. It
was less bogus than 'Real World' and 'Big Brother' and these other
things, which are just chemistry experiments. Soon, we're gonna
look back at 'Real World' as the classy, early period.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS has another reality series coming in June, ``The 1900
House,'' in which a family agrees to live using only
turn-of-the-century amenities. It became difficult at times, but in
surprising ways Joyce Bowler, the mother and wife of the family,
was upset that the soaps of the era ruined her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little different from those other shows this is 'The
Real World' meets real history,'' Hoppe says. ``What you get is new
understanding of technology, how far we've come. This series
debunks the myth of a simpler life. People have come to believe
that before technology made us speed around everywhere, life was
simpler. What happens is, the Bowlers realize it was simpler, but
it was dirty, and it was unbelievably hard work, especially for
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoppe says that the Bowler family was chosen in part due to
their reticence to be on TV, but with most of these shows, the fame
that comes with television is the overriding motivation, regardless
of how difficult the experience may become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real sense that you aren't fully manifest until you
have been turned into 575 lines of dots sent throughout the
universe,'' Thompson observes. ``Our culture is obsessed with
celebrity. For most of these people, being on TV, in and of itself,
is reward enough, even if no residual rewards or fame come from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson points out that despite intense media attention,
``it's a small percentage of the population who are willing to do
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it is catering to a base part of the human spirit,
this is not even in the top-500 things threatening America today,''
Thompson concludes. ``We watch 'Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire' because we enjoying the pleasure of watching our
jaw drop further than it has before. It's a freak show, there's a
surrealistic bizarreness about it, but we had fun with it. It's
harmless in its current manifestation. People know better than to
take this stuff seriously. The people most threatened by this are
those who go on these things. Them, and the networks that are sued
when the morning-after story of the day comes out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A week that began in violence ended violently here,
with bloody clashes in the West Bank and Gaza and intensified
fighting in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the one-year anniversary of his election by a sweeping
majority, Prime Minister Ehud Barak was trying to put out fires on
many fronts at once.
</P>
<P>
   Because of trouble in the north, the south and within his
political coalition, he was weighing a cancellation of his
scheduled departure this weekend to the United States to confer
with President Clinton and meet with American Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, back-channel peace talks continued in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials have characterized them
as a serious and constructive dialogue on the process itself and on
the final status issues.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts here say that Israel is offering as much as 90
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, although it is
difficult to assess what is really happening by the bargaining
moves that are leaked.
</P>
<P>
   Near a heavily fortified Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, an
Israeli soldier and a Palestinian policeman were wounded as
Palestinian protests for the release of 1,650 prisoners degenerated
into confrontations. Israeli military officials said they were
investigating the source of fire that wounded the soldier, but that
there was no gun battle between troops like the one that took place
Monday near Ramallah in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister views the events severely and has ordered
the Israeli Defense Forces to act accordingly to restore calm,''
Barak's office said in a statement Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's protests, which began as prayer services ended, were
organized before Monday's demonstrations erupted into severe
rioting that ended with three Palestinians dead. Palestinian
authorities said they were trying to keep tensions low, although in
Ramallah their effort did not appear to be of sustained high
intensity. Many officers stepped to the side as a march, organized
by the militant Islamic group Hamas, headed toward confrontation
with the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Qalqilya, in contrast, Palestinian police officers held back
demonstrators with nightsticks. At least 20 Palestinians were
injured by rubber-coated bullets. Another ``day of rage'' was
scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the violence would delay the transfer of
Abu Dis and two other villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian
Authority. Barak's advisers said he would turn over the towns
within days, provided that Palestinian officials calmed the streets
and cooperated with their investigation of how things got out of
hand on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla
positions in southern Lebanon on Friday. This followed fighting
Thursday, the heaviest in two weeks, in which 14 people were
wounded, including four 4 Lebanese civilians and a U.N.
peacekeeper.

VOYEURISM COMES HOME TO ROOST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe we've lost our sense of shame. ``Every day on `Jerry
Springer,' secrets are confessed to that, in the past, people would
have gone to their graves with without telling a single soul,''
observes Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television and a professor at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're revealing these dark secrets to the general public
through most sophisticated mass-communications system in history.
That's a major, major cultural shift _ one of the biggest stories
of the last quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also spawned the phenomenon known as ``Reality TV.'' When
television promises you ``reality,'' what it means of course is
heightened reality, the spectacular emotional terrain that most of
us travel only occasionally (tragedy, ecstasy, fury, intense
romance) and not the humdrum facts of day-to-day living (doing the
dishes, paying the bills, walking the dog). The ``reality'' part
occurs because viewers are seeing not actors spouting lines and
emoting grandiosely, but non-professionals honestly agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has been ratcheting up in recent years to today's
white-hot level. ``MTV's The Real World'' threw together dissimilar
young, attractive people in trendy environs and let them grope and
gripe with one another; afternoon talk shows like ``Springer''
upped the ante with frequent virulent clashes between guests. ``The
Blair Witch Project'' was a huge hit last summer because moviegoers
felt they were watching real people undergoing psychological
torture. And ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' is an unprecedented
TV phenomenon, in no small part because the show accentuates the
contestant's squirming in ``The Hot Seat'' to melodramatic music.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, CBS brings to America a couple of European imports
that are massive sensations overseas. In ``Survivor,'' debuting May
31, 16 contestants are plopped on an exotic island and must
scramble to attain food and shelter. Early clips show participants
bickering over who wasn't contributing to the group effort;
contestants hold regular sessions in which they vote members off
the island and, obviously, off the show. The final ``Survivor''
wins $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' coming in July, is even more claustrophobic: 10
contestants are locked into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom house
equipped with dozens of cameras and microphones and not allowed to
leave the grounds for 100 days. A combination of participant and
viewer votes ousts cast members; the last remaining houseguest wins
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``A show like this would have been unthinkable 10 years ago,''
suggests ``Big Brother'' executive producer Paul Romer, who created
the series in the Netherlands. ``It's kind of the next step. We
have a different attitude to our personal privacy. We're used to
webcams, to surveillance cameras in the streets and shopping malls.
Real soap operas are boring: This is a marriage between real life
and a soap opera. It's about human interaction _ relationships.
There are no scripted lines and no actors, and that's why it's very
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer also cites the films ``ED-tv'' and ``The Truman Show'' as
proof of the audience's interest in the subject, neglecting to
mention that by the end of those films, the characters have grown
to hate those intrusive cameras.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, it was argued that merely placing a camera at a
location altered the reality, but now, with the ubiquity of
camcorders, that may no longer be true. Larry Fleece, executive
producer of the syndicated series ``Real TV,'' which compiles
footage of unstaged feats and traumas, notes, ``If you put camera
in someone's face, it changes things. But if you build a blind for
a nature show, the animal becomes used to its presence after days,
weeks and months. The camera's presence becomes second nature.
After the novelty wears off, the camera becomes part of the family
and people become desensitized to it, and not so self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The miracle is that this didn't happen long ago _ that TV and
voyeurism, two of America's favorite pastimes, became bedfellows,''
says Thompson. ``They were made for each other. Humans have had
voyeuristic tendencies since the moment we crawled out of the
primordial ooze. TV allows incredible opportunities for peeping-tom
experiences _ and you don't have to find a window. The window comes
to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social mores have relaxed significantly over the past
generations,'' Thompson continues. ``There used to be rules about
what you show and don't show on TV. But with the increased
competition from cable and the Internet, all bets are off. Networks
say, 'We've got to bring people into our tent.'''
</P>
<P>
   David Wild, TV critic for Rolling Stone and author of ``The
Showrunners,'' a book examining a tumultuous year in network
television, jokes, ``The only thing more painful than reality is
reality TV.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``The bankruptcy of fiction TV is a large part of
the reason for reality TV's success.'' He confesses to being a
closet fan of ``Blind Date,'' a relationship game show, and ``The
Real World:'' ``I like seeing people even stupider than myself as
much as the next guy. But I don't know what it says about the
future of TV as a medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of genres in television is cyclical _ this is
cyclical, but it's also sick. Darva (Conger) and Rick (Rockwell)
are part of our lives (thanks to the intense coverage of ``Who
Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'') but I don't know what any of
us gain from it,'' Wild says. ``It's not like 'Network' (the 1976
film anticipating and excoriating cheap TV publicity stunts) _ it
!ital!is 'Network.'''
</P>
<P>
   Those whose livelihood depends on creating fictional TV see
reality TV's explosion as a threat. Peter Mehlman, whose sitcom
``It's like, you know'' was canceled for ``Millionaire,'' recently
told Wild, ``Being canceled for ``Millionaire'' is like having a
girlfriend leave you for a rapist _ and she knows it. The networks
aren't catering to the lowest common denominator _ they !ital!are
the lowest common denominator.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Wild applauds the networks for trying new things.
``There's a sense that they're going down, but they're going down
guerilla style,'' he says. ``Say what you will about these shows,
but they're very spunky, and little else is working. So why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson agrees: ``The bottom line is, if done correctly, these
shows could be absolutely huge. I think 'Big Brother' will be
bigger only because of the illusions to similarity to our real
life. It's 'The Real World' and just as contrived, but still
earthbound. There's a sense that we can relate to the arguments

DR. ALEXANDER S. NADAS, PIONEER IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY; AT 86 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander S. Nadas, a ``founding father of pediatric
cardiology,'' died in his sleep Tuesday in his home in Needham,
Mass. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nadas was the author of ``Pediatric Cardiology,'' which was
the first text on the subject when it was published in 1957. He was
chairman of the department of cardiology at Children's Hospital in
Boston from 1949 until his retirement in 1982 and trained hundreds
of doctors as a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School
from 1969 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when a professorship was named in his honor at
Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, he was described in
the Children's Hospital newsletter as a man who ``created a legacy
of patient care, research and teaching that established him as a
founding father and innovative practitioner of pediatric
cardiology.''
</P>
<P>
   David S. Weiner, the president of Children's Hospital, described
him as a man who ``combined intellect, clinical skill and humor to
benefit the entire hospital family and the hundreds of children in
his care.''
</P>

   MARKET (New York) _ U.S. stock markets suffered another down
trading session Friday as investors became increasingly afraid that
the Federal Reserve plans to raise short-term interest rates
through the summer. Technology stocks led the way down, with the
Nasdaq composite index falling 148.31 points, or 4.2 percent, to
3,390.40. But other indexes were not spared. By Alex Berenson.

   EURO-TOURISM (Undated) _ When Mark Lesser got married in 1985,
he priced a honeymoon in Paris. Even though the dollar was then
stronger than at any time since the early 1970s, the trip was out
of the question. But in August, Lesser, 37, will celebrate his 15th
anniversary with his wife, Stacy, in Paris and Nice. Like other
American travelers, the Lessers are reveling not only in their
increased income, but also in their incredible buying power abroad.

over the market for small growth companies, which has been a huge
success here in the last three years. In Britain, the fear is that

JUGGLING TOO MUCH MEANS DROPPING THE BALL, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desperate to squeeze a 25th hour out of each day, busy Americans
clamor for new ways to save time. In a society where talking on the
cell phone while driving is so common, can minivans with washers
and driers in the backseat be far behind? How about dinner
placemats that display e-mail messages?
</P>
<P>
   As slaves to tyrannical to-do lists, people juggle many things
at once in the hope that they'll do them all fast and do them all
equally well. But scientists who study the brain increasingly they
can't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, studies show that trying to do two or more mentally
demanding tasks, such as carrying on two conversations at once, may
actually be self-defeating, burning up more total brain power than
if they did them one at a time. And studies show people are
becoming less happy and more error-prone in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, say neuroscientists, ``Chill out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are absolute limits to what we can do simultaneously,''
said Marcel Just, co-director of the Center for Cognitive Brain
Imaging at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. ``It's a
question of sheer biological resources.''
</P>
<P>
   From university centers to federal aviation labs, recent studies
show that people can juggle a fair number of tasks _ and even get
better at this by picking what balls they toss in the air. But
often, dividing their attention makes them exhausted, stressed and
more forgetful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, pilots who juggle excessive amounts of information
have faster heart rates, higher blood pressure and slower reaction
times to new events, according to research at the Air Force and
Federal Aviation Administration labs.
</P>
<P>
   There's no magic number on how many tasks humans can juggle.
Scientists say it varies widely depending on the intensity of the
tasks, how experienced people are at doing them, age (the brain's
juggling ability peaks around 30) and whether they are particularly
gifted at handling many things at once.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many researchers say tackling two difficult tasks at
once, such as balancing the checkbook while taking part in a work
conference call, can put many people into cerebral overload.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling becomes even more difficult if one of the tasks is new
or complex, like driving in a rental car in a foreign land. Brain
scans show that certain parts of the brain require more blood when
tackling a hard task or two jobs at once. No wonder it's all so
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brain gets fried,'' said Ann Fitzgerald, 37, a mother and
part-time medical accountant who juggles working at home, watching
a baby, doing laundry and starting dinner. ``I'm frazzled. I don't
know which end is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to keep track of different tasks _ often referred to as
multi-tasking, a term that began when computers did more than one
thing at a time _ also affects the ability to remember in the
long-run what we've just read or said, according to Harvard
psychology professor Daniel Schacter.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some people can read a book while keeping track of
a TV program. But there's a good chance what's read will be deleted
from long-term memory, which means people may forget it a few days
later, or even the next day. Reading the book only once actually
makes for more sticking power.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reports of task-jugglers blowing neurological
fuses, but there is such a thing as using up so much mental
resources, it affects the ability to react to a surprise, such as
noticing a toddler opening the medicine cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can push yourself to the limit and get away with it,''
said Glenn Wilson, a US Air Force senior research psychologist.
``But the problem comes when you introduce something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are using special magnetic resonance imaging to
locate what brain cells light up when humans split their attention
between two tasks. The lit-up areas appear to focus in the
prefrontal cortex, the area directly behind the forehead and the
part responsible for high intellectual thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Within the prefrontal cortex, scientists have fine-tuned the
neurological map even more. They can point to the areas that are
responsible for keeping track of competing tasks rather than simply
prioritizing them. This detailed map will help researchers better
understand the effects of brain damage and aging. It may even help
in creating novel treatments for attention-deficit disorder, a
condition in which the victim has difficulty focusing on any one
task, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   A recent federal study found that people use very different
parts of their brain when switching between simple tasks, such as
deleting a series of e-mails while placing stamps on envelopes,
compared to demanding tasks, such as talking on the telephone while
also following a recipe to bake a cake.
</P>
<P>
   The more intense kind of juggling act forces people to use their
``working memory,'' a sort of mental bin in their prefrontal cortex
that enables people to keep track of where they left off while
attending to something else. This ``working memory'' is a more
energy-intensive use of the brain, making it more draining than
juggling simple chores, said Jordan Grafman, chief of the cognitive
neuroscience section at the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Research also shows that it may be easier to juggle tasks that
are very different from each other, rather than similar ones that
draw on brain power from the same region. For instance, reading
while walking on a treadmill is less demanding than reading while
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University researchers, Silvia A. Bunge and John
Gabrieli, found that when people juggled two verbal skills (one was
a set of true-false questions, the other was a word memory game),
their prefrontal cortex worked just as hard, if not harder, than
the combined effort of doing each task separately.
</P>
<P>
   This ``dual-tasking,'' as researchers call it, also caused them
to recall their learned information more slowly, and sometimes less
accurately, suggesting an overtaxing in one region of the brain,
according to this study in the March issue of the National Academy
of Sciences publication.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, University of Oklahoma researcher Mark Edward found
that people got more confused trying to remember a shopping list if
they were interrupted with questions about the list. If the
interruption was unrelated, however _ such as asking the person to
repeat some numbers _ people went back to their memorized list with
little problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``When interrupted with something similar, it killed their
concentration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to help people handle more information is to appeal to
more of their senses. Federal Aviation Administration officials
said cockpit warning signals, for instance, don't have to be
strictly visual. Researchers are constantly experimenting with new
methods, such as warning bells (perhaps one that even relays in
digitized voice what the problem is) or vibrations on a stick-shift
device.

SARA FISHER HAS A DRIVING AMBITION, AT 19 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Sarah Fisher is a self-reliant woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus, Ohio, native lives in her own apartment here with
her dog, Alby, and pays her own rent, bills, and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   She loves to work out, watch ``Friends'' and hockey games on TV,
listen to country and rock music, and drive her Mitsubishi Eclipse.
She lists her mother's fettuccini alfredo and Froot Loops as her
favorite foods.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher insists she is just like any other red-blooded,
19-year-old, American girl.
</P>
<P>
   But when you ask her what she does for a living, you realize she
isn't. After all, how many girls strap themselves into the cockpit
of an open-wheel Indy car and mix it up with male competitors twice
their age?
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, a rookie driver in the Indy Racing League, elicits
skeptical reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaction? Well, a lot of people are surprised and they
laugh,'' said Fisher, a 1999 honors graduate of Teays High in
Commercial Point, Ohio, who plans to study mechanical engineering
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if they believe me at first because when
they look at me, they see two things _ I look like I just got my
driver's license and I'm a girl. So, it's a bit of laughter, but I
think once people get to know me and once they read about me, they
know that I'm taking this seriously, and it's definitely not just a
media stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher will no doubt grab a few headlines _ and turn a few heads
_ if she qualifies for the 84th running of the Indianapolis 500
when time trials are held this weekend at the Brickyard. If she
makes the 33-car field, Fisher would become the youngest woman _
and third-youngest driver, male or female _ to compete in the
Greatest Spectacle in Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sarah has a lot of potential,'' said car owner Derrick
Walker, who is fielding cars for Fisher in the IRL series and
Japanese rookie driver Shinji Nakano on the CART circuit. ``She's
at the right age and she's got a good opportunity in being in the
IRL to learn her craft. She'd made a good step into open-wheel
racing in the IRL series, so there's a perfect opportunity to get
into the series and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge, in part, is hers and ours because no race
driver is a race driver by themselves,'' he added. ``They have to
have the right mechanism around them to be able to do what they
need to do, and when you've got somebody Sarah's age, then there's
a lot of experience that they need to experience to actually build
their confidence and knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lyn St. James, 53, makes the race, then the oldest and
youngest drivers in this field will be women, marking yet another
Indy 500 first.
</P>
<P>
   St. James and Janet Guthrie paved the way for women to compete
at Indy. ``Well, as far as Lyn goes, I think, yes, she helped kick
the door open, but I want to blow it open,'' Fisher said. ``I want
to win and I think that's maybe a little bit different attitude
going about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win the Indy 500. That's my goal and, like I said, I
don't know if I can do it this year, but I'm certainly going to try
my hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is the daughter of kart racer Dave Fisher, who competed
against IRL drivers Scott Goodyear and Mark Dismore. He brought his
daughter and his wife, Reba, to many of his races. Sarah just
happened to be a byproduct of her parents' love of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my childhood goes . . . I've always been in an
open-wheel car and I just thought it demanded a lot of respect out
of the drivers,'' said Fisher, who started her career in
quarter-midget cars at age 5. ``You can't just take them in there
and knock someone out of the way, or you're going to go flipping
down the front stretch, and we don't do that here. I've always
admired that amount of respect in open-wheel racing.''
</P>
<P>
   While she won respect and admiration on the karting circuit,
where she was a three-time World Karting Association champion
(1991-92, '94), and on the sprint car circuit, where she came to
idolize World of Outlaws champion Steve Kinser, Fisher hasn't been
as warmly received on the IRL circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the last IRL race at Las Vegas, Fisher was running second
when she spun out and hit the wall, collecting Eliseo Salazar's
car. He harshly criticized Fisher afterward, saying, ``She's way in
over her head, and she should go back to racing against little
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salazar's comments landed only a glancing blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take criticism real well,'' she said. ``You know, they just
brought him out of the infield care center and he was a little
upset. He just crashed his car and I certainly didn't mean to spin
out in front of him, because it was going to tear up my equipment
as well. I was running second at the time and we were doing a
really good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it in a little deep (in the corner); I had cold tires
and I was in the marbles passing cars, so it all pointed to a spin
and it was a rookie mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, the other drivers that I've talked to are accepting of
what I'm doing here. They seem to be really happy that I'm here and
I'm happy that they think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   And what of the inherent risks? The day before Fisher took the
track for the first time at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Adam
Petty, her 19-year-old contemporary, was killed while practicing
for a Busch Series race at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of accidents that have happened this year,''
said Fisher. ``I think (Geoffrey) Bodine in the truck looked 10
times worse than that. I just think that when it's time for you to
go, it's time for you to go and, as a race driver, you can't think
about that. It is certainly sad that happened to him at such a
young age because I think, like myself, he had a lot of potential,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year-old, Fisher said she dreamed of racing at Indy.
Now, all that stands between her and that goal is a four-lap,
10-mile sprint around the 2.5-mile oval. She knows it will take all
the guile, savvy, and resourcefulness she can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given a very unique opportunity, especially for my
age,'' Fisher said. ``It's something that you really can't put into
words, the opportunity that someone gives you to run the
Indianapolis 500. It's very unique and it's very rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this is something that I've always wanted to
accomplish in my life and I'm finally here.''

LUKAS BETTING ON ANOTHER ALSO-RAN IN THE PREAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Last year, trainer D. Wayne Lukas came to Pimlico
with the Kentucky Derby winner. He had revived Charismatic _ who
twice ran for a $62,500 claiming tag _ and the bighearted horse won
the Preakness, before breaking down in the Belmont Stakes during
his attempt to win the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Lukas, who has won the Preakness five times, has just
another Derby also-ran for the 125th running of the second leg of
the Famed Triad. High Yield, who had won the Blue Grass at
Keeneland, finished 15th in the Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has been remarkably candid in discussing his charge's
surprising Derby flop. He doesn't usually admit failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought High Yield was good right before the Derby,'' said
Lukas. ``I don't have the answer. I wish I could tell you he had a
foot bruise, or a head cold. Anything. But I can't. I hate to beat
on the track surface; we beat that to death. He trained so well
over it. It serves no purpose for me to be a cheerleader for him.
He's working well here, but he was working well at Churchill, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say that I'm confident he'll run his race, but he
fooled me so badly in Kentucky. He had no tenderness at all after
the race, and we scoped him and found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield's energy is good, and he's sound and clean, Lukas
said. ``If you don't want to bet on the other horse (prohibitive
favorite Fusaichi Pegasus), you could do worse than to bet on mine.
If you watch him go around the barn, he's an absolute standout. No
horse in this race will look nearly as good, that I'm positive
of.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of High Yield, who is owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis
(who also owned Charismatic), Lukas said horses who run poorly at
Churchill Downs often reverse form at Pimlico. Three of the five
Preakness winners from 25 starters saddled by Lukas did not run
especially well in the Derby. Tank's Prospect, the 1985 Preakness
winner, was seventh in the Derby; Tabasco Cat, the 1994 winner, was
sixth; and Timber Country, who scored in 1995, ran third. Lukas's
first Preakness winner, Codex in 1980, did not run in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take solace from the way my own horses ran,'' said Lukas.
``Three of them had less than sterling credentials to win this
thing, but they came through. Pat (Day, who rides High Yield) took
a hold of him when he wasn't competitive in the Derby. He knew we
were going to the Preakness. He dropped six or seven spots in the
finish to save me some horse. Pat and Willie Shoemaker are the best
ever at giving a trainer something back.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three Derby winners, which include Silver Charm in 1997
and Real Quiet in '98, have also won the Preakness. Surprisingly,
none was favored at Pimlico. Silver Charm was 3-1, while Captain
Bodget (finished third) was 2-1; Real Quiet was 5-2, while Victory
Gallop (second) was 2-1; and Charismatic was 8-1, while Menifee
(second) was 2-1. That won't happen Saturday, as Fusaichi Pegasus,
touted as the next superhorse, is odds-on in the morning line, at
3-5, for the eight-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more than one horse in this race,'' said Lukas. ``I
respect Captain Steve and Red Bullet. And, I'm wondering a little
about Impeachment _ he may be just coming around. You don't beat
that one horse and be successful; you have to beat all seven of
them. If you try to beat that one horse, you'll beat yourself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, the Derby winner enjoyed the perfect scenario. He
was a target at Churchill, too, because you guys made him such a
favorite. They had him trapped on the fence, then they let him off.
If they keep him in there, (trainer Bobby) Frankel's horse
(Aptitude, who finished second) might have won. I know Frankel was
ranting and raving about it after the race.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield was beaten by 24 lengths in the Derby, and when asked
if three tough races in a row (High Yield won the Fountain of
Youth, then ran second to Hal's Hope in the Florida Derby, both at
Gulfstream, prior to the Blue Grass) might have knocked High Yield
out for the Derby, Lukas jumped at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be,'' he said with a laugh. ``I'll take all the excuses
I can, and that's as good as any.''

THE FINE ART OF GIVING PARTIES TO SELL ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MASON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On half a dozen nights in the last two weeks,
tuxedoed men have whispered discreetly into telephones, and gavels
have rapped down in brightly lighted rooms where the earnest
business of the big spring art auctions was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was wildly different, however, on Monday evening at
Christie's. Foam spewed from bubble machines suspended above the
building's canopy at Rockefeller Plaza, as 900 guests arrived for a
party called the Bubble Bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a reference to any bubbles bursting on Wall
Street,'' said Jill Spalding, as she sidestepped a volley of
descending bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, to the astonishment of many longtime auctiongoers,
lights were dimmed and disco music was booming. Tom Finn, the DJ,
described his playlist as ``sexy, modern, with a combo of R&AMP;B,
ambient groove and acid jazz.'' In the crepuscular light, it was
virtually impossible to see the high-priced artworks, which were to
be sold the following evening, including the inspiration for the
bubble theme, ``Woman in a Tub,'' a 1988 sculpture by Jeff Koons.
(It went for $1.71 million.)
</P>
<P>
   In a second room, the only discernible source of light was the
spectral glow emanating from another Koons sculpture, consisting of
two vacuum cleaners mounted in a plexiglass box, garishly
illuminated by white fluorescent bulbs. While many seemed amused by
the nightclub atmosphere, others were aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horror,'' said Holly Solomon, the art dealer. ``It's so
dark, you can't even get picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   With Christie's, Sotheby's and now Phillips battling for
supremacy in the auction world, the crucial May sales of
Impressionist, modern and contemporary art produced weeks of record
prices. At Sotheby's, new highs were recorded for Mark Rothko,
Clyfford Still and Bruce Nauman, and at Christie's records were set
for 15 contemporary artists. Phillips, whose new owner, Bernard
Arnault, spent lavishly to get into the big-time-auctions game, was
embarrassed by the house's lackluster Impressionist and modern
sale, but it saved face with a successful contemporary sale,
including a record $552,500 for the cows-in-formaldehyde school of
Damien Hirst.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was not only in the sales rooms. It was equally
frenzied during the grueling round of brunches, cocktail parties
and dinners given by all three houses to promote the sales, which
this season left many art lovers reeling from social exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's alone held 16 promotional events between May 4 and May
16, including a populist Sunday brunch and an intimate boardroom
dinner to cultivate major donors to the Dia Center for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when it's just crazy,'' Solomon said. Her
Monday night peregrinations included, besides the Bubble Bash, a
cocktail reception at Phillips' temporary headquarters in the
American Crafts Museum and a dinner for 250 guests afterward at
Asia de Cuba, where stalks of green bamboo sprouted roofward from a
buffet table, and waiters urged cosmopolitans upon arriving guests.
</P>
<P>
   The lavish socializing may seem a sideshow, but it is actually
crucial to how auction houses market themselves, by providing an
overlay of glamour and social standing to what is essentially a
highfalutin swap meet. Especially in New York, the
multimillion-dollar auction world dominated by Sotheby's and
Christie's has long offered the chance to join in the social swim
at a rarefied level. This is not serendipitous, but part of their
business missions. New-money buyers get to rub shoulders with
old-money sellers. The slightly tawdry business of liquidating
estates after death and divorce is given the cultural and social
gloss of the museum or art-gallery world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Client entertaining is a huge, important focus of our
business,'' said Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's.
She's not fooling. Christie's has held approximately 450 social
events during the past year, Carroon said. During the same period,
Sotheby's held 528 parties at its newly expanded York Avenue
headquarters, including breakfasts, dinners, boardroom lunches and
teas, according to Mallory Andrews, senior vice president for event
marketing at Sotheby's. Neither house would reveal the cost of such
prodigious entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, long an also-ran behind the two other houses, declared
its desire to compete this season by paying handsomely for major
works to sell and by renovating the craft museum at a cost of $1.3
million. But no less did the once fusty British firm venture into
the world of heavyweight party-giving.
</P>
<P>
   To promote its Impressionist and modern sale, Phillips gave a
dinner for 120 on May 7 in association with the Society of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the charity committee with perhaps
the swellest social standing in town. In the two-story Magic Room
of the LVMH Tower, Sloan-Kettering supporters such as Pat Buckley,
Nan Kempner, Carroll Petrie and Julia and David Koch were served
roast lamb and plentiful Moet Chandon in a room decorated with 20
mandarin and oleander trees, to evoke ``Environs de Gardanne,'' a
Cezanne painting that brought $5.62 million in Phillips'
Impressionist sale.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Thompson, the chairman of Phillips, had lured his
dinner committee out of their townhouses and triplexes by donating
$200,000 to the cancer center.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, I never leave this place on weekends, and certainly
not on a Sunday night,'' Buckley said, referring to her Connecticut
house. ``But for $200,000? Certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' dinner at Asia de Cuba eight nights later to promote
its contemporary sale was an entirely different affair. The guest
list was a downtown, haute bohemian crowd, including Marlon
Richards, a son of Keith Richards; the models Karen Elson and
Michelle Behennah; the Schnabel sisters, Jacqueline and Stella; and
the artist Damian Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   The host for the evening was Jade Jagger, the formidably
beautiful 28-year-old daughter of Bianca and Mick. Phillips had
taken the remarkable step of flying Jagger and her boyfriend, Dan
Macmillan, a grandson of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan,
from London on the Concorde for the evening. It also treated Jagger
to the sleeveless Christian Dior gown she wore, another of the
luxury brands in the portfolio of Arnault's LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   A demicelebrity in England, where she designs jewelry and is an
occasional fashion model, Jagger's connection to the high stakes
world of contemporary art auctions was somewhat tenuous. Among the
youthful revelers at her party, potential bidders for serious art
seemed few and far between. An exception was the fashion designer
Narciso Rodriguez, who bid successfully on Friday for a black and
white painting by Udomsak Krisanamis.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the parties, hardly anyone mentioned the ongoing
Justice Department investigation of price-fixing at Christie's and
Sotheby's. The scandal may have led to the resignation of Sotheby's
chairman and its chief executive, but you would never have known so
from the banter of party-goers. In fact, the taint now muddying
both houses' images may have added new impetus to their
party-giving departments to pour on the revelry. While the events
at Christie's _ traditionally the more conservative firm _ are
fewer in number than those of its chief rival, there are
considerably more than are held at the London-based company's King
Street headquarters.When Ed Dolman, the company's chief executive,
arrived from England a few years ago, he expressed bewilderment at
the number of parties at Christie's in New York, recalled one
Christie's executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what people expect, so we can't cut back, exactly,'' the
executive said, noting that officials at Christie's are keenly
aware of the gangbusters entertaining going on at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, if you're Bergdorf's, you always want to know what
Barney's is doing,'' said Andrews, who held event planning jobs at
both stores before bringing her skills to the terrain of auction
house entertaining. ``There's always a sense of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing that Christie's and Phillips had both hired DJs to
enliven their Monday night parties, several eyebrows were raised at
Sotheby's. ``We are not a discotheque,'' said Tobias Meyer,
Sotheby's worldwide head of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know how to dance,'' added Lisa Paulson, his deputy in
the contemporary department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's froth,'' Tobias continued, rolling his eyes, ``and we try
to be serious. At the end of the day, art is a serious business.''

NEW YORK: serious business.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an eye to serious future business, Sotheby's was giving a
dinner that evening for 130 young guests invited by Serena Boardman
and Jane Lauder at its vast new museum-like 10th floor galleries,
where artworks including a Mark Rothko painting (later sold for
$14.3 million) were on display. Boardman and Lauder, young women
from socially powerful New York families, had compiled a guest list
that comprised a veritable Who's Who of young, affluent New York,
including a royal flush of Miller sisters, de Kwiatkowski siblings,
Eliza Reed, Rena Sindi and the ubiquitous contemporary art
consultant Kim Heirston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the substantial heft of the combined bank accounts of
those in the room, however, few seemed likely candidates for major
bids at Sotheby's auction the following night, when Meyer brought
down the hammer on $46.1 million of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ross, a senior vice president at Sotheby's for museum
services who also is chairman of the Young Collectors Council _ a
group of 12 socially active employees at the firm whose mission is
to cultivate future Sotheby's clients _ said that immediate sales
gratification was not a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Sotheby's expected its young guests to be major
bidders at the auction house's Wednesday night and Thursday morning
sales, Ross shook her head. ``It's about long-term cultivation,''
she said. ``We don't expect to see the results immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sotheby's, she noted, ``I don't have to prove purchasing
activity after every event. It's really about the future.''

 PEEPING TOM IS ORDERED NOT TO WATCH `DAWSON'S CREEK'

   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ As part of his punishment for peeping on
``Dawson's Creek'' actress Katie Holmes, a Charlotte man has been
ordered not to watch the popular television show or anything else
starring the actress.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Drury Medearis, 36, was reported to police by one of
Holmes' neighbors, who in February saw him standing outside her
Wilmington apartment, watching the actress through binoculars.
Holmes plays the role of Joey Potter on ``Dawson's Creek,'' a WB
network show filmed in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Medearis, who works for a Charlotte printing company, was
released on $2,000 bond on charges of secret peeping and
misdemeanor stalking. The stalking charge arose from a series of
letters Medearis sent to Holmes in which he detailed his daily
activities. The letters were not threatening, but more like
diaries, said Assistant District Attorney Mike DeSilva.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the court, psychologist and sex therapist John
Wheeler of Charlotte, who treated Medearis twice, wrote, ``It is my
impression that the incident in question was not motivated on his
part by a desire to do any physical harm or any harm at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The stalking charge was dropped. Medearis appeared Thursday in
New Hanover County District Court and pleaded guilty to peeping.
</P>
<P>
   Chief District Court Judge John Smith suspended a 45-day
sentence for Medearis, put him on supervised probation for two
years, assigned him 24 hours of community service and ordered him
to stay away from the actress no matter where she is.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also ordered that Medearis ``not attend or watch any
films/programs or movies'' featuring Holmes, unless his
psychologist determines that prohibition would be detrimental. The
judge's order also requires Medearis to continue receiving
psychological treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, the daughter of an Ohio lawyer, was not present for the
plea. A call to her publicist went unreturned.

IT'S TOUGH `GROWING UP BRADY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever watched a rerun of the late-'60s, early-'70s
sitcom ``The Brady Bunch'' _ and let's face it, if you've done any
channel-surfing at all, you've no doubt landed upon it; it's that
ubiquitous _ and if you've thought, ``What went on behind the
scenes must be more interesting than what's on the screen,'' Barry
Williams wants you to know you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who portrayed Greg, the ``hip,'' oldest brother, on
the series, wrote a bestselling 1992 memoir on his life as a Brady
_ including all the sundry spin-off TV films and series _ that has
been adapted into a TV movie, ``Growing Up Brady.'' It's an
affectionate look at a show that's been both roundly celebrated and
mocked for its innocence and its goofiness, but it's likewise a
show that has endured and even risen in stature over the
intervening decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing Up Brady'' reveals some of the endless disputes over
scripts creator Sherwood Schwartz _ who was also responsible for
the other sitcom in the twin towers of '60s silliness, ``Gilligan's
Island'' _ had with ``Bunch'' head Robert Reed, who portrayed
sensible dad Mike Brady. It also essays the numerous romantic
trysts the series produced, particularly between Williams and
Maureen McCormick, who played Marcia, the ``perfect'' Brady sister.
But it airs its laundry in a manner befitting the series _ sweetly
and fairly, with all sides' perspectives represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about score settling, it's not mean-spirited; it's
respectful, it's true to spirit of what really happened,'' Williams
says. ``That is the way I remember things, the way I see and feel
about it, and I'm glad that this is the story. It's not about me
getting beat up by father (as ``Come On, Get Happy,'' Danny
Bonaduce's ``Partridge Family'' biopic, was). Or,'' Williams adds,
deadpan, ``by Ann B. Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brady'' creator Schwartz and his son Lloyd, who served as a
writer and director on the series, also spoke to set the record
straight. Though both Schwartzes in separate interviews used the
same phrase to describe Williams' book _ ``A lot of it took place
in his head'' _ they confirm the generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood Schwartz _ who conceived of the series after reading a
newspaper item about blended families, and quickly pounded out a
script out of fear that someone else would come up with the idea of
a comedy about two families merging into one (only to watch the
development process take a whopping four years before the show made
it to the air) _ still shakes his head over some of Reed's
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a stickler, he used to read with the script in one
hand and the other he had in the Encyclopedia Britannica,''
Schwartz remembers. ``Every day of every week, he was pain in the
neck, and you can go a little further south of that. If something
didn't ring the truth bell with him, he'd walk off the set and not
tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would visit him in his dressing room and say, 'What's
wrong?' and he'd say, 'If you don't know, I can't explain to you.'
He would say, 'Did you see the last script?' Well, that was a
direct insult _ it was my script. He'd say, 'Do you know what scene
we're doing now?' Again, a direct insult, I was the executive
producer, I should sure as hell know what scene we're shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   One time, Reed took offense to Mike entering the kitchen, seeing
his wife and maid cooking up some strawberries for a baking
contest, and uttering the line ``This smells like strawberry
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a joke, but it's a cute way to get into the scene,''
Schwartz says. ``And Robert says, 'It just so happens that
strawberries, while cooking, have no odor.' Minutes and dollars are
flying away while we're sitting there discussing this. I said, 'Can
you say, ``This looks like Strawberry Heaven?'' Fifty thousand
dollars later, I changed one word.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed also balked when the script called for him to slip on some
eggs that fell out of the refrigerator. ``Robert said, 'The truth
of the matter is, contrary to popular belief, when your shoes hit
eggs, they're sticky. You don't slide at all.' This one cost
$150,000. I told him, let's rehearse the scene and get to your
point later. So he opens the refrigerator, the eggs fall out, and
he just by accident steps on them and falls on his a--. So I'm
standing there, looking down at him, and he's wagging his finger in
my face, saying, 'That doesn't prove a thing!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz soon learned to do his homework before handing Reed a
script. He contacted the Federal Communications Commission over an
episode in which the Bradys install a pay phone in their house for
the kids, knowing that Reed would declare such an act was illegal.
Schwartz found his loophole _ they were legal in Santa Monica _ and
toyed with Reed when the actor demanded to know where the Bradys
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz recalls, ``I told him, 'California.' He said, ``I know
that _ where in California?'' 'Oh, Southern California.' He said,
``I know that, too, given that we see all these palm trees. But
where in Southern California?'' Schwartz hemmed and hawed for a
while longer before telling Reed the Bradys lived in Santa Monica.
``I heard him yell 'S---!' and slam the phone down. That was one of
the best phone calls of my life. It wasn't very nice of me, but
since he had caused me enough sleepless nights and caused Paramount
enough money, I thought he deserved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed stormed off the set of the last episode of the series and
was summarily written out of it. Nonetheless, he returned for all
the sundry Brady spinoffs, from variety shows to dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years later, when we were doing 'The Brady Girls Get Married,'
he was in a play in New York at that time and had another week to
go, but he bought himself out of the show, flew himself out here
and showed up saying, 'No one is going to marry off my two oldest
daughters but me,''' Schwartz remembers.
</P>
<P>
   For the subject of Brady nookie, we turn to Lloyd Schwartz, who
says, ``I was on the set and assumed the position on ensuring that
there weren't any next editions of Bradys running around.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time when we started on the show, I was 22 and Barry
was 15, so I was like his uncle or big brother,'' Lloyd says. ``We
had a lot of talks. He was very interested in Maureen, and I had to
keep that from happening on the set, so I told him, 'When you start
to get interested in her, take a look at her hands. She has very
small hands, they're like little girl hands _ so look at them and
stop thinking about her that way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz says he was largely successful at keeping
extracurricular romance to a minimum on the set, but a scene in
``Growing Up Brady'' in which Williams and McCormick flirt wildly
while shooting a scene, though exaggerated, is based on fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 23 years old and this was the first scene of anything I
had ever directed,'' he remembers. ``I had gone to UCLA film
school, and no where in any book does it say what to do when a
brother and a sister are hot for one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept doing the scene, and there didn't seem to be any
mistakes in their line readings, but I could just see the steam
coming out of them. I made them do 13 takes to try to lose that,
when usually we'd just do three. The crew wasn't really paying
attention, and Barry and Maureen weren't aware of it, so everyone
was wondering what I was doing, if I had lost my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Williams' ``date'' with his TV mom, Florence Henderson,
``That's totally in Barry's head,'' Lloyd and Sherwood agree. Lloyd
explains: ``Florence was married at time and had 4 kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And to hear Lloyd tell it, the luckiest guy on the set was none
other than _ Lloyd Schwartz. ``Whenever we cast for Barry's
girlfriends, we always cast older _ that way, they didn't need an
on-set teacher. So a lot of the girls we cast were 19 playing 16.
And I was about 23. So they were never right for him, but they were
always right for me. When we watch reruns sometimes, my son will
say, `That's a good episode.' And I'll look at Greg's girlfriend
and think, `That was a great episode!''' &QL;

FIRES CREATE NEW CONCERN ABOUT NUCLEAR WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The fires that consumed nearly 50,000 acres of
northern New Mexico, including parts of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, have raised new concerns over the buildup of nuclear
and hazardous waste stored at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials have insisted that the fires, which
were 70 percent under control by late Friday, did not get close
enough to threaten thousands of containers filled with used gloves,
rags, booties and other combustible items contaminated by low-level
radioactive waste, like plutonium. By some estimates, the nearest
flames remained half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists and environmentalists said Friday that dry
conditions in forests adjacent to the storage site make them ripe
for another fire _ and a potentially more dangerous situation
because of the increasing quantity of stored waste.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the laboratory generates 150 cubic meters of waste a
year that is stored above ground in 55-gallon steel drums and in
smaller wood boxes that sit under a fabric dome. The current level
is 4,808 cubic meters _ the equivalent of 14,000 drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is just sitting there, just waiting for another
incident to happen,'' said a Los Alamos scientist familiar with the
storage area who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``And there
are a lot of people at the lab who share that concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mello, director of the Los Alamos Study Group, a nuclear
watchdog organization, said: ``It's a dangerous situation. If they
could get that stuff out of there, everyone would be better
served.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Energy Department and the laboratory have
disputed the contention that anything at the storage site, a mesa
surrounded by canyons known as Technical Area 54, is vulnerable to
fire.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an environmental-impact study of the laboratory
conducted four years ago in which officials created a theoretical
worst-case fire and found that the waste would survive unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   But even if conditions became so grave that the drums overheated
and exploded, sending toxic plumes skyward, the study concluded
that no one living within a 50-mile radius would suffer ill
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists, however, contend that the department's
worst-case test was not worst-case at all. While the department
model assumed a breach of 62 drums, Edwin Lyman, scientific
director of the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit research
organization in Washington, said an intense fire would more likely
breach ``closer to hundreds'' of drums, causing a much greater
potential for illness than the study provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department,'' Lyman said, ``has refused to look at the
real worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to remove the waste at Los Alamos to the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside Carlsbad, which opened last
year after a decade of delays. For now, the rate of removal is but
a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   With cleanup at the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant outside
Denver, which is scheduled to close by 2006, and three other
facilities producing nuclear waste for disposal, the competition
for removal has grown intense.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Alamos, the pace has been further slowed by lawsuits
challenging environmental impact and a dispute between the state
government, which requires that the contents of every container be
itemized, and the Energy Department, which does not agree that
detailed inventories are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said Friday that Los Alamos shipped
714 drums of waste last year, with 252 scheduled to go this year,
1,176 next year, 2,940 in 2002 and increasing numbers in the
following years.
</P>
<P>
   While that leaves the majority of the drums on site for the
foreseeable future, officials from the laboratory and the
department insisted that the containers were well protected,
largely because the recommendations of the environmental impact
study were followed. To add layers of protection, wood was removed
from the perimeter of the laboratory, the tree line was moved back
and dirt pathways were built as a buffer against fires from the
canyons below.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics are not convinced that enough safeguards are in
place, especially with the unpredictable updrafts from the canyons,
which the current fires demonstrated, and the ever-present

   Rep. Mark Udall, a Democrat whose district includes the
laboratory, said Friday that a recent tour of the laboratory
convinced him that the fire ``was too close for comfort,'' and that
rebuilding efforts _ some older buildings were destroyed _ should
emphasize greater protection against fire and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Udall also said that the waste removal from Los Alamos was part
of a larger national problem for which Congress has traditionally
authorized only limited spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a national scale,'' he said, ``this is not regarded as a
high risk. But we need to get to the job of cleaning up all over
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos scientist who did not want to be identified added
one further regret. He said he and his colleagues were eager to
return to work next week when the laboratory reopens. But they were
anxious, as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lab is tucked away in what was some of the most beautiful
scenery you've ever seen,'' he said. ``Since the fire, it looks
terrible, and you can't just go out there with a bucket of paint
and fix it. That was slow-growth forest that burned. It will take a
long time to come back to what it was.''

SYMBOLISM HOLDS BACK PEACE EFFORTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Just as a breakthrough in the long deadlock over
guerrilla disarmament is at hand, the Northern Ireland peace
process is falling back into the grip of politically charged
symbols, which have often been as divisive as firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, has postponed a
crucial meeting Saturday of his ruling council for a week. That is
to give him time to persuade the party to endorse an Irish
Republican Army offer to permit international inspections of its
secret arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, told the
BBC Friday that the importance of the vote could not be overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choice that the Ulster Unionists are going to make next
Saturday is going to determine the course of Northern Ireland
politics, its political stability and also its economic prosperity
for a generation to come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fight for the heart and soul of the Ulster Unionists,
but the debate is now turning as much on issues like what flag
flies atop government buildings, what name the new police force
bears and what symbols end up on the officers' uniforms as much as
it is on weapons and secret armies.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble spent the past week trying to exact clarifications and
concessions on these points before announcing Thursday night that
he was postponing the ruling council vote. Prime Minister Tony
Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: ``We have come to the
end of that process this week. We have set out the position in
terms of flags. We have, we believe, gone some way to meeting
concerns in terms of policing and names.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of IRA offer would speed the return of the
power-sharing home rule government in Belfast that was suspended in
February when the IRA failed to make expected moves on arms. But on
May 5, the IRA said it would permit the inspections of its arsenals
of weapons by international figures, would re-engage with an
international commission on disarmament and would ``completely and
verifiably put IRA arms beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days to come, Trimble will be lobbying his own party to
treat the IRA pledge as the long-sought promise of disarmament, and
to support him in his desire to return to government with the
party's Catholic rival, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Refusal would deliver the two-year-old peace accord its most
serious setback and would likely end the leadership of Trimble, a
Nobel Peace Prize winner who is viewed as the only Protestant
politician able to turn the party from its rejectionist past.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are reforms dropping the name Royal Ulster Constabulary
for the province's police force and calling it instead the Police
Service of Northern Ireland, abandoning national insignias from the
caps and badges of officers and permitting officials of the
power-sharing administration to decide whether to fly the British
flag, the Irish flag or no flag at all above government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of emblems are freighted in Ulster where Protestant
communities mark their boundaries with red-white-and-blue painted
curbstones and Union Jacks, and Catholic neighborhoods hoist the
Irish tricolor and promote the wearing of the green.
</P>
<P>
   The most contested declarations of differences are the summer
parades of members of the militant Protestant Orange Order, who
march through resentful Catholic neighborhoods, sporting their
black bowler hats, white gloves and bright orange regalia. Seen as
acts of triumphalist defiance by Catholics, the marches commemorate
battles three centuries ago in which the Protestant King William
defeated the Catholic King James.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists, who are generally Protestant, are so called because
they believe in keeping Northern Ireland part of the United
Kingdom. Republicans, almost all of whom are Roman Catholics, want
to see Northern Ireland become closer to and eventually part of the
Irish republic to the south.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The conflict between the two ``traditions'' has grown over the
past three decades, causing more than 3,600 deaths and prompting
periodic and ultimately failed efforts at a settlement apportioning
power more fairly among the Protestant majority and Catholic
minority. The current accord, struck in April 1998, has raised the
greatest hope of a real resolution but putting it into effect has
encountered continual setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has long faced opposition from a significant hard-line
minority in his party who, in a stance known as ``no guns, no
government,'' insist on IRA disarmament as a condition for sharing
government with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the IRA announcement, Trimble's persuasive
deputy, John Taylor, predicted the party would overwhelmingly
accept it. But last week he said the British government's
insistence on going through with the police name and badge changes
and its position on flags had cast the matter into doubt.
Unhappiness over the changes in symbols has for the moment turned
that minority into a majority, causing Trimble to delay the
reckoning. It is not known now whether Taylor himself will back his
leader next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble received support Friday from an unlikely source, Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president. In unusually conciliatory language
Adams said, ``I fully understand why the unionist people are
suspicious and distrustful of republicans,'' and he added that he
would ``vehemently oppose any political arrangement that
discriminated against the unionist people.'' He appealed to ``the
rank and file of the UUP.'' to would work together with republicans
``as equals'' to achieve a better future for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The comment prompted Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher who is
the peace agreement's most vocal opponent, to say that Trimble had
now become ``the chief salesman of the IRA.''

CHINESE AND EUROPEANS AGREE ON TERMS FOR BEIJING'S ENTRY TO WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Chinese and European trade negotiators agreed
Friday on the terms of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, toasted
China's foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, over the deal at
the ministry's imposing headquarters in Beijing just hours after
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji had stepped in to help conclude the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Shi told reporters that the deal embodied ``the principle of
equality, friendship and mutual benefit'' between China and the
European Union. It clears the way for China's entry to the global
organization this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides scrambled to reach the agreement before the vote in
Washington next week on whether the United States will grant China
permanent normal trading status, abolishing what Beijing considers
a humiliating annual review of its worthiness as a trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   China's agreement with the Europeans is the last major step
before it can join the global body, which regulates trade between
most countries. Many people think that the deal will add momentum
to the Clinton administration's last-ditch effort to get the trade
legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   The United States vowed to make China's trade status permanent
as part of its deal last year on the terms of China's entry into
the World Trade Organization. If Congress votes against the
permanent status, China is still expected to join but can then
exclude the United States from benefits it extends other countries
in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the European Union over China's membership
terms had broken down three times this year as the Europeans sought
to push the Chinese beyond the concessions they had granted the
United States in a deal signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   WTO candidates must complete separate agreements with any member
country that asks, outlining the market-opening measures they will
make to join.
</P>
<P>
   After five fruitless days, the talks between China and the
Europeans seemed to be in danger of failing again as the Europeans
held out for control of some telecommunications networks. The union
had been seeking 51 percent ownership of cellular networks, while
China, under its deal with the United States, had agreed to allow
49 percent foreign investment in most telecommunication services
and 50 percent foreign ownership of value-added services, including
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Lamy and Shi continued late Thursday evening, and
the two men met again Friday morning before Zhu summoned Lamy to
China's walled leadership compound. In the end, the Europeans
abandoned their demands and accepted some expansion in the kinds of
telecommunications services covered by the agreement and some
acceleration in carrying out the new ownership rules, although
details were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Terms agreed to with any one trade organization member must be
extended to all members, and Chinese negotiators were under
pressure not to go beyond the wide-ranging concessions granted to
the United States at the end of two years of difficult negotiations
last year. Those concessions are already vilified by many Chinese
government officials, who say they will put China's struggling
industries at too great a disadvantage to powerful multinationals
eager to expand business here.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu and other Chinese reformers want the trade organization
rules as a tool to force change in areas protected by domestic
political interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union believes that WTO can provide a boost for
the reform process, hence the extra special importance of this
successful conclusion of our agreement,'' Lamy said at the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member European Union had been the largest of six
remaining trade organization members that had not yet concluded the
separate market-access agreements necessary for Beijing's
membership. Agreements with the remaining countries is expected to
be a formality, though Switzerland or Mexico could yet slow the
process with additional demands, diplomats warned.
</P>
<P>
   China has been trying to join the WTO or its predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, since July 1986. And
despite Friday's agreement, it will take months more for China to
actually join the group. A trade organization working party must
first consolidate the agreements Beijing has signed with various
countries into a single document outlining the terms of its
membership, for instance. And China must provide the organization
with a clear accounting of its current trade rules together with a
schedule of when specific rules will change to comply with the
terms of membership.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the trade organization at its headquarters in
Geneva said it would probably take until October before the process
was completed.

 By DANIEL J. WAKIN and ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beset by cancer and marital strife, a
contrite-sounding Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday he would drop
out of the race for U.S. Senate, clearing an obstacle for Hillary
Rodham Clinton and setting off a scramble by the Republican Party
for a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided what I should do is to put my health first, and
that I should devote the focus and attention that I should to being
able to figure out the best treatment, and not running for
office,'' Giuliani said. ``This is not the right time to run for
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that because of the cancer, he did not have the
confidence that he could be the kind of candidate he would want to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concentration isn't going to be there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, including Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki,
united quickly behind Rep. Rick A. Lazio, a four-term Republican
from Long Island, as a replacement for the mayor. And within two
hours of Giuliani's announcement, Lazio said that he would seek the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Another Long Island Republican, Rep. Peter T. King, said he also
would like to run, but acknowledged that Lazio had the support of
the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Senate seat, said that
she had called Giuliani after his remarks to wish him well, and
that he had thanked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray, as all New Yorkers do, that we all wish him a
full and speedy recovery,'' Clinton said. She turned aside
questions about how his withdrawal would affect her campaign,
saying, ``Today we all ought to just wish the mayor the very
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing reporters in reflective tones, Giuliani spoke of
wrestling acutely with the ``most difficult decision'' of his life,
spending a sleepless night and then calling friends and Republican
leaders Friday morning to tell them of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most remarkable turns for a supremely
self-confident politician who rarely backed down and routinely
dismissed his critics, Giuliani said his illness had taught him a
sense of compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with continuing to devote himself to his job as mayor,
Giuliani said he would strive ``to overcome maybe some of the
barriers that maybe I placed there, and figure out how to overcome
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani did not specify what he would do to overcome those
barriers or even what they were, but said, ``It means I'm going to
try to reach out to more people, to try to help more people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many in the city had felt a sense of optimism during his
administration, but for those who haven't, ``I'm going to dedicate
myself to try to figure out how to get them to feel that too,
including maybe changes I have to make.'' His cancer, he added
later, had helped him feel more compassion for those who must face
health problems, and that he ought to try to improve health care
for New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean there's going to be a new Rudy,'' the
notoriously combative mayor said. ``I think that's silly. ... I
think there's going to be a different _ maybe somebody who grows
from the fact that you confront your limits, you confront your
mortality, you realize you're not a superman and just a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to make sure that I'm a better mayor,''
Giuliani continued, ``and this is a better administration, and it
accomplishes the goal of reaching every person that we can reach,
and making sure that every New Yorker feels that I'm dedicated to
them, that I want to protect them, that I want to help them, and
that I want my time as mayor to count for everybody.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Word of Giuliani's decision spread swiftly in advance of his
news conference, and by midafternoon reporters had filled the old
Board of Estimates meeting room at City Hall to await the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party will meet May 30 in Buffalo to
nominate its Senate candidate. But Pataki, as the state's leading
Republican, will have the strongest voice in making the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we will unite behind a strong candidate who will beat
Hillary Clinton and her belief in big government,'' Pataki said in
a written statement Friday afternoon. ``Rest assured, the
Republican Party will not need to import a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision to drop out of his contest came after a
tumultuous three-week period. Giuliani first announced that he had
been diagnosed with the early stages of prostate cancer, and then
said he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover,
after 16 years of marriage. At the same time, Giuliani has
increasingly been seen in public with an Upper East Side woman he
described as a ``very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement jolted a political career that began with
Giuliani's stint as a sharply aggressive and high-profile federal
prosecutor in New York in the 1980s and brought him to the
mayoralty of the nation's largest city. He will continue in that
job, while facing treatment for prostate cancer and dealing with
his separation from Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's rejection of a Senate run set off a blizzard of
speculation on his future and on how his departure will affect
Clinton's chances.
</P>
<P>
   His current second term as mayor ends on Dec. 31, 2001, and term
limit laws prevent him from seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has often said how much he has enjoyed his job running
the city, where he has been credited with bringing a drop in crime,
cleaner streets and other improvements in the quality of life. And
he has frequently made it clear that his major political interest
is to be an executive leader.
</P>
<P>
   The only statewide job that would seem to appeal to Giuliani,
who never formally announced his Senate candidacy but was clearly
the front-runner, is the governorship. But that job is currently
held by Pataki, whose second term does not expire until 2002.
Pataki, who has ruled out a run for the Senate seat as a
replacement to Giuliani, has told reporters that in all likelihood
he would run for a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has shown his openness to an eventual gubernatorial
run, telling a radio show caller who made the suggestion, ``What
you say is certainly a reasonable, rational analysis and people
have privately offered me the same analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have a ready-made war chest _ the $9.2 million that he
had raised for his anticipated Senate run, which federal campaign
financing laws would allow him to keep for any future political
race. But holding on to the money could alienate donors and
Republican leaders, who will surely pressure Giuliani to shift all
or much of the money he has raised to the party. Federal law bars
him from transferring the dollars directly to a replacement
candidate. Giuliani, however, could pass on the money to a state or
national Republican Party committee, which in turn could spend it
on behalf of another candidate. Other options are to return the
money to donors, or give it to charity.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at the news conference if his political career was
over, Giuliani said, ``Right now, I'm thinking No. 1, let me have a
little room to think about medical treatment.''

INVESTING WITH: NEIL BARSKY AND SCOTT SIPPRELLE OF MRG NUCLEUS
FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 21) 
 By ALEX BERENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would have been easy for Neil Barsky and Scott
Sipprelle to just join the crowd three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two men run a $120 million hedge fund, the MRG Nucleus fund,
from a modest office suite in Midtown Manhattan. They opened MRG
Nucleus in July 1998, a few months after striking out from Morgan
Stanley, where Barsky was a well-regarded casino industry analyst
and Sipprelle a top investment banker. By February, 19 months into
the fund's life, they found themselves stuck in the middle of the
pack in the hotly competitive hedge fund business.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds try to produce above-average investment returns
using tactics ranging from traditional stock-picking to complex
derivative and arbitrage plays. High minimum investments,
redemption restrictions and aggressive strategies make them
suitable mainly for more sophisticated and well-heeled investors.
</P>
<P>
   MRG concentrates on overlooked and undervalued newly public
companies, chosen eclectically without a particular sector bias. By
ordinary standards, its returns have been solid _ 63.5 percent from
inception through February, a 19-month stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But over the same period, the Nasdaq composite index rose 151
percent. And many hedge funds posted even stronger returns with the
help of aggressive leverage and heavy bets on technology _
techniques that Barsky and Sipprelle avoided. MRG fell further
behind the index in February, when the Nasdaq rose a scorching 19.2
percent, triple MRG's gain.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, with a return of 42 percent in 1999, MRG was not
exactly facing a wave of redemptions from investors angry at
missing the technology runup. Still, ``it's always difficult in the
investment business to underperform,'' Sipprelle said.
</P>
<P>
   So when the two managers sat down to draft their monthly letter
to investors after the February results came in, they felt
compelled to explain: ``We are not Luddites. We are huge believers
in the power of technology to accelerate the efficiency of
commerce, the productivity of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did not believe in, they warned, was the market for
technology stocks, which they concluded had gone seriously haywire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drunk from the Kool-Aid that has mesmerized the
market into thinking that `growth at any price' is a sound
investment strategy,'' they wrote. ``We are underweight technology
today, and expect to remain so as long as valuations stay at
current levels. We think the stock market is in the midst of a
dangerous game of `chicken' with tech stocks. We suspect it will
end badly; we don't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   They also spelled out a series of specific concerns, including
accelerating price declines in software and hardware, and the
explosion in initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one verity of the IPO market that has proved
itself over the years,'' they wrote, ``it is that when capital
becomes too available, a hot sector ends up gorging itself,
overinvesting, and ultimately lowering returns for the entire
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven weeks later, they look smart. The Nasdaq has fallen
almost a third from its early March high, but MRG is up 15 percent
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Barsky and Sipprelle say they try not to gloat, but they
acknowledge feeling pretty good. ``If you're building a long-term
business, you have to weigh the easy money against the
responsibility you have not to take outsize risk,'' Barsky said.
</P>
<P>
   What is MRG bullish on now? The fund is still staying away from
high-growth technology stocks, which mostly remain expensive by
traditional valuation measures even after their tumble over the
last two months. Instead, the managers prefer small-capitalization
companies that offer relatively strong growth on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Argosy Gaming, which runs midsize riverboat casinos and
hotels across the Midwest and South. Drawing on his years as an
analyst, Barsky keeps a close eye on the casino industry, which
fell into a painful slump from 1996 to late 1998 before turning
around last year. He expects the gains to continue, at least for
smaller operators like Argosy.
</P>
<P>
   Several macroeconomic trends are combining to invigorate the
industry, Barsky said. The long economic boom has given adults more
disposable income for gambling. It has also put local government
finances into surplus, making states where gambling remains illegal
less inclined to legalize it. With capacity constrained and demand
rising, companies that do have licenses are seeing profits rise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many states where Argosy has boats have recently
relaxed regulations on their operation, allowing the company to cut
costs and increase profits. Illinois, for example, dropped a rule
that boats must actually cruise the rivers on which they float,
rather than remain permanently docked.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring out a one-time charge related to a debt financing,
Argosy's net income soared from $5.7 million, or 23 cents a share,
in 1998 to $41.7 million, or $1.44 a share, in 1999. Revenues grew
from $507 million to $595 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect continued growth this year and are forecasting
earnings of $1.73 a share, an estimate that has risen recently. Yet
Argosy closed on Friday at $16.50, less than 10 times expected 2000
earnings and barely five times the company's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Argosy ``is so cheap it's not even funny,'' said Barsky, who
called the multiples ``inexplicably low.''
</P>
<P>
   At these prices, Argosy could be takeover bait for larger casino
operators like MGM Grand or the Mandalay Resort Group, which now
focus mainly on the Las Vegas Strip. The spread of Native
American-owned casinos in California threatens companies with big
investments in Las Vegas, making them ``feel some need to
diversify,'' Barsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Argosy, which has accumulated a large database of
gambler-customers and is among the strongest of the midsize
riverboat operators, makes an inviting target.

COMMENTARY: COURT AND CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's conservative critics often condemn as undemocratic the
Supreme Court's power to hold legislative actions unconstitutional.
Former Judge Robert Bork has gone so far as to propose, in the name
of democracy, that all Supreme Court decisions be subject to
reversal by majority votes in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Supreme Court decision striking down part of the
Violence Against Women Act as beyond Congress' power over
interstate commerce puts those critics in something of an ironic
bind. Most of them probably disliked the act. But the court's 5-4
majority overrode a signal example of the democratic process: Years
of hearings and mountains of evidence showing that violence against
women is so pervasive in this country that it affects interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was a close case. The provision struck down by the
court, allowing abused women to bring civil damage suits in federal
courts, was indeed at the edge of congressional power. On the other
hand, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's opinion for the majority
was troubling in the way it substituted its appraisal for Congress'
careful effort to show the effect on national commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The really troubling part of the decision is the larger context.
In a series of cases in recent years the five-member majority of
this court has undertaken to cut back the power of Congress
vis-a-vis the states.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in half a century the majority has
second-guessed Congress' exercise of its commerce power. The same
majority, in its most extreme decisions, has held that Congress
cannot authorize damage suits against state institutions to enforce
federal wage-hour and other laws.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases the majority seemed to believe that it was
returning to a historic role of the Supreme Court in protecting the
states from federal power. But a masterly recent article in the
Columbia Law Review, by professor Larry D. Kramer of the New York
University Law School, shows that view of history to be a myth.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, Kramer points out, the Supreme Court
repeatedly upheld such expansive federal legislation as the
establishment of the Bank of the United States. It took a broad
view of the federal power over commerce. Before the Civil War, the
court stepped in only once to protect state sovereignty. That was
in the ill-fated Dred Scott case.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Kramer says, ``States do most of the governing in
this country.'' Their law covers most contracts, property, torts,
domestic relations, crime and so on. So despite the vast growth of
federal law, the states have held their own. They have done that,
mostly, not because of protection by the Supreme Court, but because
our political traditions and institutions work in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system may not be perfect,'' Kramer concludes, ``but its
costs are probably less than those likely to follow from aggressive
judicial intervention in politics. ... More than two centuries of
successful federalism without the aid of an aggressive judiciary
suggests that no such intercession is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical difficulties of trying to draw judicial lines on
what is ``interstate commerce'' are also great. The Supreme Court
tried that early in the 20th century, for example deciding that
mining was not ``commerce.'' That effort collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   If the violence against women case and other recent decisions
are part of a judicial effort to define categories of activity that
are beyond federal power, my guess is that it will not work. Our
economy and society are too dynamic to be confined in such abstract
terms.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not seem to me unwise to have the Supreme Court as
an ultimate protector of federalism. Politics, for example, has not
proved to be effective in keeping federal criminal law out of
traditional state areas. Paranoia about drugs and crime has led to
much unwise federalization of criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   For such reasons, professor Gerald Gunther of the Stanford Law
School took a benign view of the violence against women decision.
The court should have paid more heed, he said, to the record made
by Congress. But ``it was not a catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be a catastrophe is a headstrong majority pressing a
dubious historic vision to a serious clash with Congress, and with
reality.

MISSILE GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With President Clinton's self-imposed deadline for a decision on
deployment of a national missile defense system fast approaching,
there were fresh indications this week of a radical disjunction
between the political calendar, which dictates a decision this
summer or early fall, and a timetable determined by scientific and
technological realities.
</P>
<P>
   A glitch in the tests that are to precede Clinton's decision was
announced this week by the Pentagon. The final test flight of a
missile interceptor had to be postponed because of a wiring problem
with a transmitter used to monitor the test.
</P>
<P>
   This glitch could complicate Clinton's decision if it postpones
the planned test beyond mid-July. Because of test site commitments,
such a delay might push the decision past election day.
</P>
<P>
   A far more serious question about the fundamental workability of
the system was raised in a letter to the White House from Theodore
Postol, a professor of science, technology and national security
policy at MIT. Postol said his analysis of published data from the
first integrated flight test of the antimissile system ``shows that
the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) will be defeated by the
simplest of balloon decoys.''
</P>
<P>
   That conclusion, if verified by other scientists, should deflect
Clinton from hurrying into a decision that would cost about $60
billion, might compromise the nation's security, and would almost
certainly start the unraveling of international nuclear
nonproliferation and arms limitation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Postol not only warned of a flaw in the system that cannot be
corrected but also said he has documentation that shows that the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ``attempted to
hide this fact by tampering with both the data and analysis'' from
the test flight he analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should appoint a commission of eminent scientists
without ties to the Pentagon to evaluate the test flights and
Postol's tampering charges. History will not judge the president
kindly if he ignores such a warning and plunges ahead with an
unworkable antimissile system for political reasons.

FENWAY FINANCING GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Sox executives have finally come out with a plan to pay for
a new ballpark. While the team makes a strong case that they need a
new park, the financing plan remains unpersuasive.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox promise to spend $352 million of their own money to
build the stadium, but they do not yet have specific sources of
financing for $128 million of that amount. The team has decided _
regrettably but probably inevitably _ to sell naming rights to the
park. The rest of the gap will have to be filled by unspecified
private investment or surcharges on ticketholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox ought to be able to find this extra money, but it will
leave them hard pressed to reduce their requests for public
subsidies. They want $135 million from the state for parking
garages and street improvements, a reasonable figure. The state
would get back much of the money from parking fees and would
benefit from increased tax revenue generated by ballpark customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the team expects the city to put up more than the state _
$140 million to buy the land and prepare it for construction. This
would be an unprecedentedly high level of support for a private
project in Boston. And it is far from clear where the city would
get the $13 million to $14 million needed each year to pay off the
bonds that would buy the land.
</P>
<P>
   The best the Sox can suggest is that the city would realize $6
million a year from property taxes on new development that replaces
the old Fenway Park. As it is, the Fenway area is ripe for
development. If the city does nothing, it will probably experience
a tax windfall from new construction there.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also suggest $6 million in unspecified revenue
sources, analogous to the extra hotel taxes and surcharges on
tourist activity that financed acquisition of land for the
convention center. These sources of income can only be tapped once,
and there is a stronger case for the city aiding the convention
center, a public facility, than the privately owned Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The team hopes to have a finance plan approved by the state
before the Legislature ends its session in July. The team needs to
find other sources of private money and specify how the city will
get a return on its investment before it seeks legislative support.

SAVING THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Englanders who want better protection of federal forest
lands should raise their voices at two rounds of public hearings on
the minimal improvements offered by the US Forest Service. It may
be the only chance to stiffen regulations that would leave up to 60
million acres vulnerable to logging and other activities, robbing
these natural assets of their unique character while adding little
to the overall supply of timber and forest products.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the Forest Service draft plan seems to provide
protection, but the realities of modern logging techniques rob it
of much of its force. The Forest Service proposes to ban roads in
60 million acres, about a third of the 190 million acres under its
control. But determined loggers can economically drag timber as
much as three miles on skids that need no roads.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy is to supplement the road ban with other restrictions
on logging itself and on the use of off-road vehicles, mining, and
other activities that threaten unique forested areas. In New
England much forest land is in private hands, but the 800,000 acres
of the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire and Maine
contain some of the most impressive old forest growth in the
Northeast, which is in need of additional protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service proposal is also flawed for failing to
include the Tongass Forest in southern Alaska, the last major
northern rain forest in the world and home to magnificent stands of
trees so far untouched by loggers but in danger of destructive
harvesting. While the Forest Service leaves open the possibility of
action in 2004, much damage can take place in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Interested parties can register their opinions at hearings to be
held May 23 in Concord, N.H., and the next day in Shelburne, N.H.
The limited Forest Service proposals have already spawned
objections from logging and other interests who argue they are too
repressive. The possibility that Forest Service leadership could
change following the November elections argues for firm action now.

KODAK IN TRANSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be the quintessential company in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, Eastman Kodak has jettisoned the
legacies of failed diversification efforts, cut $1.2 billion in
overhead and embarked on a series of digital photography
initiatives intended to catapult the company into the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts laud Kodak's efforts to reshape itself. The
company, they say, has little choice but to wean itself off its
reliance on the silver halide print photography business, with its
high margins but flat long-term growth prospects, and embrace the
less profitable, though potentially larger, digital-imaging market.
</P>
<P>
   But given the lackluster results shareholders have endured, many
wonder if Kodak is really on the verge of such a transformation.
``They're doing a lot of things right,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an
analyst with Prudential Securities. ``But the company's digital
growth prospects are hardly spectacular, relative to other
companies'' engaged in other areas of the digital universe.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Kodak will not resemble a highflying dot-com anytime
soon. At $57.0625 a share, the stock trades at around 10 times the
$5.64 a share that analysts expect Kodak to earn this year. By
contrast, the multiple for the Internet hardware maker Cisco
Systems is about 100.
</P>
<P>
   The modest valuation suggests that investors still associate
Kodak stock with old-economy torpor. The shares are about where
they were in December 1997, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index has climbed nearly 50 percent since then. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, some tepid bulls say Kodak deserves some credit for the
substantial progress it has made. ``Kodak's problem has not been
execution,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney. The company, he said, has met or exceeded Wall
Street's earnings expectations for the last five quarters. He
expects the shares to reach $87.50 over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Rosenzweig said, ``the domestic film business won't
deteriorate as fast as most expect,'' and demand in emerging
markets, which accounts for about 25 percent of the company's film
sales, is expanding. Still, he acknowledged, ``Long term, the
overall film business looks flat.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Kodak's digital businesses to drive top-line growth,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Jack L. Kelly of Goldman, Sachs, thinks that the company's
investment is about to pay off. Though Kodak has not yet earned a
nickel on the $2.8 billion digital portfolio, which accounts for
about 20 percent of its $14.1 billion in 1999 revenue, digital
losses shrank to 24 cents a share in 1999, from 53 cents a year
earlier, and the business should turn a modest profit this year,
Kelly said. His 12-month price target is $80-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts say Kodak must move beyond low-margin,
nonproprietary offerings like digital cameras and digitization
services to earn real money in this arena.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson of Prudential thinks the company's commercial ventures
_ particularly its online repository of scenes used as backdrops
for films and videos _ are promising. ``Kodak is uniquely qualified
to provide this kind of database engineering,'' he said. Despite
his bearish long-term outlook, he rates the stock ``accumulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also liked Kodak's recently announced plans to purge $1
billion from its $6 billion procurement budget by 2002, in part by
eliminating vendors who cannot achieve double-digit productivity
gains that can be passed along the supply chain and in part by
using the Internet as the primary procurement channel.
</P>
<P>
   Management is likely to expound on its digital strategy at a
June 14 meeting with analysts in New York. Most expect the new
chief executive, Daniel A. Carp, who replaced George M.C. Fischer
in January, to be more aggressive in raising the market's awareness
of the breadth of the company's e-commerce initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton M. Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor
who coined the term ``disruptive technology,'' for emerging
technology that threatens the status quo, said it applied to the
digital imaging arena. As for Kodak's understanding of the stakes,
he said, ``I think management gets it.''  &QL;

INVESTING IN CHILD CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back when the military used the draft and did not depend so much
on volunteers, day care for children on bases was poor. Quality was
low, waiting lists were long, fees were beyond many parents' reach,
and staff turnover was endemic.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions improved markedly, however, after the draft ended and
the services became fully dependent on volunteers who are more
likely to be married with children than draftees and can leave the
military after their enlistments if they don't like conditions. In
fact, improvements were so noteworthy that the National Women's Law
Center last week published a report on military child care and held
it up as a model for civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes many excellent suggestions on standards,
frequent and unannounced inspections, employer subsidies, and staff
training that civilian officials would do well to follow. But the
most significant lesson is more basic: Real progress in child care
comes when a community _ whether it is the US military or a state
or a city _ simply decides to give day care the importance it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns that made investing in child care for the
military a high priority _ a desire for a stable work force and a
healthy child environment _ apply equally outside the military,''
said Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the women's law center.
</P>
<P>
   After the draft ended in 1973, day care in the volunteer
military became such a drag on morale and a deterrent to
reenlistment that Congress finally passed a law in 1989 to address
the problem. Fortunately, the law worked in creating a system of
both base child development centers and private, family-based
centers.
</P>
<P>
   One secret of the military's success is that its program draws
families of all income levels. The program director has said that
it is critical that all families, at all income levels, receive
some subsidy, so that child care is seen as a universal program and
not just for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Make high-quality child care a priority and make it universal _
these are principles the country as a whole should adopt. Parents
should not have to join the military to get good, affordable day
care.

WATCHDOGS FOR CHILD SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Memorial Day last year, organizers of a safety campaign
enlisted thousands of police agencies to spot people who were not
wearing seat belts or had not buckled up small children. This year,
the campaign is enlisting millions of drivers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign has established a
toll-free line (1-800-764-5755) that people can call from May 22 to
May 29 if they see a child who is not properly buckled. If the
caller can give the license plate number and describe the vehicle,
the campaign will send a letter to the vehicle owner that says, in
part: ``There are laws in all 50 states that require children to be
buckled up. While the laws vary from state to state by what age and
size child they cover, the laws of physics are the same everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to remind you that it is extremely dangerous for
children to ride unbuckled in motor vehicles. You could have been
stopped by authorities and ticketed, resulting in a fine or points
on your license. If a crash had occurred, the child could have been
seriously injured or killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has access to the motor vehicle registration
records in 40 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey. (Laws
in New York and nine other states do not allow access.) The program
is to be announced Monday by the Transportation Department, but
letters later sent to motorists will specify that they are not from
a government agency, and that no government agency will be
notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect a certain segment of the population that will not
like this,'' said Janet Goss, a spokeswoman for the campaign. But
many people will be eager to call: The campaign has surveyed adults
on their attitudes toward unbuckled babies and small children, and
``four-fifths of them think it's tantamount to child
endangerment.''
</P>
<P>
   People who complain about others who do not follow the law are
not butting in, she said. ``I can say, `I mind very much if you
smoke,''' Goss said. ``I should be able to say, `I mind very much
if you drive with kids unbuckled.''' &QL;

<P>
   New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen surprised no one when she
revealed last week she will run for a third term. The question mark
is whether she will renew the pledge she made four years ago to
oppose any broad-based state taxes. That pledge has limited her
response to the biggest challenge her state has faced _ the 1997
state Supreme Court decision declaring unconstitutional its system
of financing schools through local property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after her announcement, there was another watershed
event in the state's politics: The Senate joined the House in
voting to repeal the state's death penalty. Shaheen, a supporter of
capital punishment, vetoed the bill Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, one initiated by the court and the other by the
Legislature, Shaheen has missed opportunities to step out front and
help move public opinion toward new approaches. Her reluctance to
break her tax pledge is understandable, but the promise _ first
made before the court ruling _ deserves rethinking. She should at
least make clear whether she will support a broad-based tax if an
analysis of tax alternatives by a blue-ribbon commission she
assembled points in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaheen was first elected in 1996, she seemed a good match
for a changing state and won the endorsement of this page. A
pragmatic Democrat, her winning issues were bread and butter ones _
reducing electricity rates and increasing the number of towns
offering kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, however, the court decision on school financing
changed the dynamics of New Hampshire politics. In a state that has
never had a sales or income tax, the ruling cried out for
leadership from the governor to devise a way to meet the schools'
needs. A fair, broad-based tax should at least be considered.
</P>
<P>
   But no such banner was raised by Shaheen, who stuck by her
antitax pledge and repeated it when she ran for reelection two
years ago. The state jury-rigged a statewide property tax that duns
rich towns for poor ones but still doesn't raise enough money.
Shaheen has chosen not to let her state be a leader on death
penalty repeal, but it is not too late for her to lead on the tax
issue. Dropping the pledge would be a start.

A FUND TO FIGHT AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 21, 2000)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has taken much too long, but the world is finally beginning
to help Africa deal with its AIDS catastrophe. A week ago, major
drug companies announced an agreement to sell AIDS drugs at a steep
discount in poverty-stricken areas, including Africa. This week,
the US House of Representatives passed a bill calling on the World
Bank to establish a trust fund for combating the spread of AIDS in
Africa and committing to a $100 million annual contribution for
five years. An identical bill sponsored by Senator John Kerry is
expected to be voted on by the Senate next week. The measure
deserves the Senate's support and President Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999, of the 33 million people in the world
infected with the HIV virus that causes AIDS, 23 million lived in
sub-Saharan Africa. So far, the World Bank estimates that more than
10 million African children have been infected or orphaned by the
disease. US Representative Barbara Lee of California, a co-sponsor
of the House bill, says that by 2010 the number of AIDS orphans in
Africa will equal the total of schoolchildren in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing down drug prices, either through company discounts or a
Third World plan for purchases of cheaper generic equivalents, will
be of limited help in a disaster of this magnitude. Much of Africa
lacks the professional staff or infrastructure to make use of them,
and their cost _ even discounted _ will limit their use. This is
where the World Bank trust fund can be beneficial, by helping
countries strengthen their public-health systems.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is the role that the fund would play in
education and prevention. Real progress against the disease will
come only when there is a reduction in the behavior that transmits
it _ from high-risk sex to unsafe use of contaminated devices,
including such mundane ones as manicurists' scissors that have not
been disinfected.
</P>
<P>
   The planned US donation is designed to spur other countries,
foundations, and private donors to ensure the bank's fund totals $1
billion a year. Even this is less than bank officials believe is
necessary, but it is a start. Lee was hardly exaggerating when she
said, ``The survival of a continent is at stake.''

COMMENTARY: WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many moralists can dance on the head of a pin? The more the
merrier.
</P>
<P>
   On its way to Friday's touching climax, in which New York's
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, was reborn as Jimmy Stewart's George
Bailey in ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' the Rudy-Judi-Donna-Cristyne
soap opera has offered many memorable sideshows: an aggrieved
wife's press conference outside a cardinal's wake, a rollicking new
Abe Hirschfeld campaign for senator, an eBay auction of a mayoral
galpal's high school yearbook. But none topped the spirited
tap-dancing of Clinton-bashers as they labored to draw fine
distinctions between White House and Gracie Mansion infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least his affair is the traditional Other Woman kind, as
would suit a conservative,'' wrote Danielle Crittenden in Slate.
According to Andrea Peyser of The New York Post, ``He didn't lie,
he didn't fudge, he didn't equivocate. . . . He spoke the truth, no
more, no less.'' According to a reader's message on lucianne.com,
``A separation shows dignity in light of a mistake. Hillary looks
like a whore for not leaving Bill.'' Peggy Noonan told National
Review Online that ``Rudy is normal compared to Clinton,'' and
praised the mayor in The Wall Street Journal for being ``ragged and
human'' and refraining from ``finger wagging.'' For Ann Coulter,
there's the Talmudic difference ``between a dirtbag, and a dirtbag
and a felon.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Hillary Trap,'' her new entry into the crowded
anti-Hillary book sweepstakes, Laura Ingraham faults the Clintons
for holding ``the modern view that moral values are relative.'' But
her tome had the misfortune to be published just as the Giuliani
marital meltdown confirmed that moral relativity is in the eye of
the beholder and is becoming an epidemic among conservatives, who
only last month put aside family-values absolutes to oppose the
reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did many of the scolds who bemoaned the dreadful example
set by Monicagate for the American people's children make no
mention whatsoever of children in Judigate _ neither the American
people's nor the Giulianis' own. Those who accused Bill Clinton of
sliming the discarded women in his life gleefully trashed Donna
Hanover, either for her taste in off-Broadway stage roles or for
defying her husband. (``New Yorkers never really liked Donna
Hanover to begin with,'' opined Dick Morris, accusing her of
exploiting her marriage to advance her career.) Those who berated
Clinton for allegedly using Arkansas state troopers to further his
extracurricular sex life were mum about the NYPD honor guard at the
Rudy-Judi trysts in the Hamptons. Those who decried Vernon Jordan's
thwarted effort to secure Monica Lewinsky an entry-level job at
Revlon ignored the mayor's successful installation of Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas in a $150,000 taxpayer-subsidized job at the
city's tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And some of those who ridiculed Mrs. Clinton for her theory that
a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' had targeted her husband dropped
hints that a left-wing conspiracy set up Giuliani. Both Morris and
Robert Novak have gone on TV to float the notion that, as Novak
ominously intoned, Giuliani's marital problems ``may not'' be ``all
of his own doing,'' since ``bad things happen'' to ``people who go
up against the Clintons.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few conservatives resisted this moral-relativism
epidemic. Hours before the mayor's withdrawal, William Bennett
called him ``loutish'' and urged him not to run. Earlier and
gutsier was Maggie Gallagher in The New York Post, who took on the
``repulsive'' spin doctors in her own political camp: ``Suddenly,
adultery is nothing, and telling the truth about adultery makes you
a stand-up guy.'' Gallagher went so far as to say that Giuliani
``made Bill Clinton look good as a husband and father.''
</P>
<P>
   But I don't buy the argument that Giuliani is a total hypocrite.
Yes, his serial infidelities (according to Hanover's allegation)
would seem to contradict his endorsement of public-school displays
of the Ten Commandments, his zero tolerance of sex shops and his
policing of museums for salacious art. But is he really being
inconsistent when he humiliates his wife and his two school-age
children by informing them of his divorce plans by press conference
or by parading down Second Avenue with his ``very good friend'' for
the paparazzi? He has treated his own family with the exact same
compassion and sensitivity that he lavished upon the family of
Patrick Dorismond _ no hypocrisy there!
</P>
<P>
   I'd also posit that this whole soap opera is in some ways a
public service, for Giuliani, intentionally or not, helped uncloset
one of the most common traumas of modern America _ divorce. For it
is divorce, not adultery, that made this ``scandal'' novel. We have
become inured to infidelities in officialdom, especially among
Gingrich Republicans, but this is the first time most of us have
watched a political leader's adultery morph before our eyes into a
high-profile divorce, complete with male midlife crisis and
hovering lawyers, that played out in full view on television in
real time. For those of us who've been through divorce, there is
cathartic value in seeing that the high, mighty and normally
self-possessed can behave as childishly and be hurt as badly as the
rest of us at that tragic moment when a marriage dies.

UNDATED: marriage dies.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good political news for Giuliani, should he run for governor
in '02, is the burgeoning size of this constituency. According to a
Rutgers study last year, divorce rates have risen 30 percent since
1970, the marriage rate has fallen faster, and only some 38 percent
of Americans who are married pronounce themselves very happy in
that state. (The figure was 53 percent 25 years ago.) Nearly 50
percent of all American marriages end in divorce. Yet divorce and
unhappy marriages are underrepresented as a phenomenon in
mainstream mass culture; it's easier to find homosexuality on
prime-time TV than it is to find divorce. This may be one reason
national audiences proved far more hungry than Hollywood expected
for a movie like ``American Beauty'' and a TV series like ``Once
and Again,'' a rare network drama centered on divorce. The
phenomenon of ``The Sopranos'' may be less fueled by its Mafioso
operatics than by its realistic presentation of the chilled
marriage of Tony and Carmela Soprano and its fallout on their
children. Not for nothing has the mayor declared it a personal
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But political punditry, especially on TV and in Washington,
seems completely clueless about the state of American marriage.
``New York is France,'' quipped George Stephanopoulos of ABC,
explaining why 81 percent of New Yorkers told pollsters that the
Giulianis' separation wasn't going to change their votes. But in
fact New York has the lowest divorce rate in the United States,
whereas in the Bible Belt divorce rates are so high that Oklahoma
has some counties where divorces outnumber marriages.
Stephanopoulos was one of many commentators who, in the immediate
aftermath of the Giulianis' dueling press conferences, fell victim
to the Sam Donaldson syndrome _ instantly asserting that domestic
mayhem effectively ``ended'' Giuliani's campaign, much as Donaldson
pronounced Clinton's presidency ``numbered in days'' after
Monicagate broke. These prognosticators, so fast to assume
widespread public condemnation of marital sinners, don't seem to
realize that, sadly, it's happy marriages, not broken ones, that
are increasingly the aberration where their viewers live.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, as Giuliani indicated Friday, it was solely the battle
against cancer, not that against his wife, that knocked him out of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Of course some anti-Clinton moralists are now holding the
president accountable for the resiliency of Giuliani's post-Judi
poll numbers; under this theory, Monicagate lowered acceptable
standards for politicians' behavior. But the record shows that when
the mayor was reported by Vanity Fair to be involved with Lategano
in the summer of '97 _ a year before Monicagate _ the same polls
showed that 85 percent of voters didn't care then either.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the public has been corrupted, or is latently
Gallic, but that it has too often experienced marital heartbreak
firsthand. Anyone who has done so knows that only fools can presume
to judge what goes on in someone else's marriage. And they know as
well that it is difficult but possible to perform in a job, whether
in the public or private sector, even as a family breaks apart. For
millions of Americans, that's not a scandal _ it's just another
normal day at the office.

GIULIANI DROPS OUT OF SENATORIAL RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ citing concerns about
treatment for his prostate cancer and beleaguered by personal
scandal _ dropped out of the US Senate race Friday, ending what was
shaping up as the year's most dramatic political battle.
</P>
<P>
   His departure leaves the Democratic candidate, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, in an uncertain position. She looked tense, if not gloomy,
when she appeared at a union headquarters shortly after the mayor's
announcement, to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Giuliani was the feistiest, best-known, and
most media-savvy opponent she could have faced. On the other hand,
he was, in many quarters, the most fiercely disliked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now will have to re-tool her campaign strategy, which
had placed great premium on attacking Giuliani for his abrasive
personality and an un-senatorial inability to get along with other
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll have to sell herself on who she is, not on who she
isn't,'' Democratic consultant George Arzt said. ``So far, she
hasn't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican leaders are scurrying to come up with a
new candidate in time for their party convention on May 30. The
most likely choice seems to be Rick Lazio, a four-term congressman
from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a boyish 43, had threatened to run against Giuliani in a
primary last summer _ and raised $3.5 million for the contest _
until Governor George Pataki urged him to move out of Giuliani's
way.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has also been mentioned as a possible replacement, and
would likely be the strongest candidate; he is the only Republican
who leads Clinton in the polls. However, he has insisted the past
few weeks that he has no interest in leaving his job for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show Clinton with a wide lead over Lazio, but pollster
John Zogby said Friday, ``By next week, I think it will be tied. A
lot of Rudy's support was in fact more anti-Hillary than
pro-Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani leaves the race with a gracefulness that was
surprising, given the unpleasant circumstances of his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, he stunned the city by announcing that he had
prostate cancer. A few days later, he stunned everyone again by
confirming reports that he has been seeing a woman not his wife _
and, a few days after that, turned the shock-knob higher by
announcing he would seek a separation from his wife of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after that declaration, his wife, actress and TV
anchorwoman Donna Hanover, fought back, appearing outside Gracie
Mansion and blaming the decline of their marriage on an affair that
she said the mayor had three years ago with yet another woman, his
former press secretary, Cristyne Lategano _ a charge that she and
the mayor have denied.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's newspapers reported that Hanover has retained one of
the city's most high-powered law firms to represent her in drawing
up a separation agreement from Giuliani. Many observers took this
as a clear signal that Hanover may have more shocks to deliver in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   However, Giuliani said Friday that his decision to leave the
race was based entirely on concerns about his health, not about the
other aspects of his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that what I should do is put my health first,'' he
told a packed room of reporters, aides, and political supporters in
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the right time for me to run for office,'' he went
on.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been saying for weeks that he would decide what
kind of treatment to undergo _ surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation
pellets _ and then determine, from that, whether he would have the
stamina to go ahead with a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he said he still had not decided on the treatment, but
had concluded he could not run an effective campaign, no matter
what his choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ran, I don't think that I'd concentrate the way I
should,'' he said. He also realized he could not predict how he
would feel in August or September, when the political race would
heat up. ``Nobody can tell you on a percentage-basis what the
side-effects are going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani seemed shakened when he started to make his
announcement, but grew more comfortable, even buoyant, as the
half-hour news conference went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is not as important as I thought it was,'' the
once-singlemindedly political mayor declared. ``I've made a lot of
decisions the last 10 years around politics. From now on, I'm going
to make them around other things.''
</P>
<P>
   He even called the decision to withdraw ``probably the most
useful thing that happened to me, to get me reoriented to what's
important in life _ I think something good's going to come out of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he started talking in a way that nobody has heard, at least
publicly, for years.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that leaving the Senate race gives him an additional 18
months to be mayor _ his term runs out at the end of 2001 _ and
that he realizes certain people feel they have been left out of the
city's good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to devote the extra time I've been given,'' he said,
``to overcome some of the barriers that maybe I've placed.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark was clearly a reference to the deep distrust and
alienation that many black and Hispanic New Yorkers feel toward the
mayor, especially since the police shootings of black immigrants
Amadou Diallo and Patrick Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a rare thing for Giuliani to admit that he might be
responsible for the divide.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had expressed nearly identical sentiments in his
victory-night speech when he was reelected to a second term in
November 1997. However, Friday, he explicitly recalled that speech,
and said he regretted that he had not followed through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be changes I have to make,'' he said. ``I want my
time as mayor to count for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, in a nationally televised town-hall meeting,
Giuliani had made similar overtures. For the first time ever, he
said he had ``made a mistake'' when he publicly attacked Dorismond,
a private security guard who was killed by police in a botched drug
sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have also conveyed the human feeling that I had _ of
compassion and loss for a mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This led newscaster Andrea Mitchell _ who interviewed him at the
meeting _ to speculate that there might be a ``new Giuliani''
emerging from his confrontation with his death. He laughed off the
phrase, and Friday called it ``silly,'' but he seemed to explore
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's something when you confront your limits, your
mortality,'' he said at the City Hall news conference. ``You
realize you're not Superman, you're just a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had been leaning against running on Thursday,
but then leaned the other way during that night's wildly
well-received televised town-hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Gee, I don't know how I can walk away from this _
this is so exhilarating,' '' he recalled. ``Then I got home,
thought about it some more, talked with people some more, couldn't
get to sleep till the early hours of the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he woke up, he said, ``I thought, `There are more
important things in life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He made his final decision around noon, just after his weekly
radio call-in show, then called Gov. Pataki, Rep. Lazio, and other
Republicans and friends to notify them.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani leaves the race with $9 million remaining in his
campaign warchest. Federal laws prohibit him from turning it over
to another candidate, but he could give it to the party, which
could then distribute it. He said Friday he had not decided what to
do with the money, but he said he would do all he can to help his
replacement in the race.

U.S. WANTS TO IMPORT GRIZZLIES FROM CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Beginning next year, grizzly bears from
British Columbia could be following in the paw prints of wolves and
lynx as the latest Canadian import aimed at restoring predator
populations in the American West.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to restore the
solitary, ferocious ursus horribilis to the vast Selway-Bitterroot
Wilderness Area of Idaho and Montana, where Lewis and Clark shot
grizzlies on their epic journey nearly 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian conservationists are divided over whether it is
wise to remove grizzlies from the Kootenay region of southeast
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne McCrory, a grizzly bear biologist who serves on a
scientific advisory panel to the British Columbia government, likes
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, any grizzlies going to the United States would
have a lot more value put on their lives than bears do in British
Columbia right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCrory points out that Canada does not have an endangered
species act and cites widespread shooting of bears that have
allegedly menaced humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow away 90 to 100 `problem' bears a year, I have no
problem with sending 13 of them to the Bitterroots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kevin Scott, director of Canadian programs for Defenders of
Wildlife, said it would be a bad idea. Scott noted that bear
populations in the Kootenays are already under pressure from
road-building, clearcut logging, mining, pipelines and powerlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent of habitat loss in that area is extreme. We are
talking about some of the most endangered bears in all of North
America,'' Scott said. ``It's critical that we first have a
population count, a direct head count.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to release five grizzlies annually into remoter
parts of the Selway-Bitterroot country between next year and 2006.
An initial ``seeding'' stock of 25 bears _ half taken from British
Columbia, half from elsewhere in the United States _ should grow to
maximum of 280 grizzlies. The slow-breeding species could take a
half-century or more to reach this population level.
</P>
<P>
   The transplanting of species from Canada to the United States
has racked up at least one spectacular success.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 70 years after hunters and trappers exterminated canis
lupus from Yellowstone National Park, 14 wolves from Alberta were
released in 1995 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National
Park Service. An additional 17 wolves were let loose the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have multiplied to an estimated 160 wolves _
including one pack frequently seen by visitors to the Lamar Valley
in the northeast corner of the park.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 30 Canadian lynx from northern British Columbia and
the Yukon were set loose in the Colorado Rockies, another effort to
bring back a species that has become endangered in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious conservation activists in both the United States and
Canada have dreamed of going much further. They want to create an
unbroken wildlife corridor stretching 1,700 miles from the Yukon to
Yellowstone.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Y-to-Y'' corridor would require limiting such human
incursions as oil and gas exploration, and closing hundreds of
miles of logging roads.
</P>
<P>
   Two centuries ago, grizzly bears needed no corridors. An
estimated 50,000 grizzlies roamed the American West from the Great
Plains to the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, only about 1,000 survive in the United
States, outside of Alaska. Most are found in two pockets, one
centered on Yellowstone National Park and adjoining wilderness
areas, the other Montana's Glacier National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Selway-Bitterroot wilderness, stretching over more than 2
million acres in north-central Idaho and crossing the Continental
Divide into Montana, is historic grizzly habitat, but the last of
its grizzlies was shot by a hunter in the mid-1940s. Uninhabited by
people, with no major highways, it has been proclaimed by bear
biologists as ideal habitat for an animal that ranges over 30 to 50
square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Some Idaho politicians and ranchers in surrounding counties
aren't happy about the prospect of reintroducing grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Custer County, Idaho, commissioners have passed a resolution
``authorizing'' the shooting of any grizzlies restored to the
region. The bears, however, are protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   One voice of opposition comes from a politician who has long
campaigned to save critical wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus has pointed out that the
grizzlies will need a food supply. Historically, the bears ate
salmon from tributary streams of the Snake River. Since
construction of four downstream dams, however, salmon have
virtually disappeared from even the wildest tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   With no more salmon, Andrus fears, grizzles will chase away
other predators like cougars and black bears, and then come out of
the wilderness to take cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans bent on restoration of species will be making a mistake
if they act with the same heavy hand as the exterminators did early
in this century,'' Andrus, who served as Interior Secretary in the
Carter administration, wrote in his 1998 memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   That view is disputed by Bruce McLellan, a bear biologist with
the British Columbia ministry of forests in Revelstoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Selway-Bitterroot isn't unique,'' McLellan said. ``Where I
live on the Columbia River, we used to have salmon. We have no more
salmon but we have many grizzly bears.''
</P>
<P>
   (The construction of Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930s shut off more
than 1,100 miles of salmon spawning habitat in the upper reaches of
the Columbia river system.)
</P>
<P>
   A Fish and Wildlife Service plan estimates that a fully
recovered bear population would kill about six cattle and 25 sheep
each year. Under the plan, ranchers in areas near the wilderness
could obtain a special permit to kill grizzlies that have attacked
their livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Even with hostile ranchers nearbly, grizzlies transplanted to
the Selway-Bitterroot likely would find a better chance of survival
than in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters shoot 25 to 35 grizzlies a year in southeast British
Columbia, far fewer than in the rest of the province.
Guide-outfitters have longstanding permits and quotas on the number
of bears their clients can shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect bears taken to the U.S. would be taken off that
kill,'' said McLellan. ``There would be some kind of a deal with
the hunting guides.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bergenske of the East Kootenay Environmental Society
confesses to ``a lot of reticence'' about removing grizzlies from
the mountains flanking his home in Skookumchuck.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``It is preferable to have an exchange like
that than have them shot.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials worked out a deal to compensate trappers in the
Yukon when lynx were relocated to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are worries north of the border. By official
estimates, Canada has about 22,000 grizzlies, with 10,000 of the
bears living in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But the official estimates are mainly just guesses. ``There's
been no direct population count,'' said Scott, of Defenders of
Wildlife. ``It's all anecdotal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears are becoming an economic asset, not just for guides who
hunt them. Visitors armed with cameras flock to the Khutzeymateen
River north of Price Rupert, British Columbia's first grizzly
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Habitat Adventures, which takes people to view wildlife
around the world, recently began bear watching trips in the Dean
Channel near Bella Coola. ``It has really taken off. It is
unbelievable how many grizzlies there are in this area,'' said Ben
Bressler, the company's director.
</P>
<P>
   But British Columbia has done little to protect its bears.
Between 300 and 400 grizzlies are shot legally each year throughout
the province, by hunters and by wildlife agents dispatching
``problem'' bears. According to McCrory, studies have shown that at
least an equal number of bears are killed illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Under such circumstances, McCrory is quite willing to see a few
grizzlies taken to the Selway-Bitterroot. ``You'll take care of
them down there,'' he said.

<P>
   SERTAOZINHO, Brazil _ If there is any place that captures the
quiet desperation of Brazil's sugar industry, it is probably the
Bar do Gaucho, an open-air drinking establishment in this gritty
town surrounded by seemingly endless fields of green sugar cane.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Antonio Carlos Castilho, the owner, serves up
shots of cachaca, the potent yet dirt-cheap rum derived from sugar;
the drink is favored by the cane cutters who wander in to idle away
the day or shoot billiards on a raggedy table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar cane teaches you to love anything else that is not sugar
cane,'' Castilho, 43, himself a former cane cutter, mused one
afternoon. ``Run from cutting cane any way you can, because it is
the surest way of being a slave without even knowing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a century since Brazil, the world's
largest sugar producer, prohibited slavery, although sugar has
played an important role in Brazil's economy for nearly five
centuries, since shortly after the Portuguese established a
foothold in the New World. The harvest can still be brutal,
depending to considerable measure on a sinewy arm swinging a big
knife at the base of a cane stalk.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the sugar industry has witnessed unprecedented
change during the last few years. Indeed, the country's
modernization _ the shift in power from an entrenched provincial
oligarchy to a sophisticated urban elite, the swap of
low-technology economic practices for high-technology tools and the
discarding of isolationism for greater integration with a global
economy _ has been played out with fervor in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar workers like Miguel de Oliveira, who is 59 but has the
leathery skin of a man a decade older, know this well. ``It has
been good fortune to have lived this long doing such work,''
Oliveira said outside his home near the Bar do Gaucho as he showed
visitors his facao, the arm-sized knife used to harvest sugar cane.
``The smell of burning cane that makes your body sweat before the
heat reaches you, that is the smell of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is likely that Oliveira's grandchildren will never know
what cutting sugar cane is like. In the sugar plantations
surrounding Sertaozinho in this fertile region of southeastern
Brazil, harvesting machines are fast replacing people.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, as the share of the crop harvested
mechanically rose to more than 50 percent on many sugar cane
plantations, the number of people working in Brazil's sugar
industry has declined to 700,000, from 1.2 million, according to
the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers in Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   The trend shows few signs of letting up as mechanization moves
forward. Understandably, growing joblessness in the sugar industry
is heightening social tension in Brazil's countryside and in the
small cities that serve as hubs for the agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what these people will do, if they are desperate and
out of work?,'' asked Ceres Oliveira Bueno Abe, a retired
schoolteacher who lives in Piracicaba, a city surrounded by sugar
cane plantations in the interior of the state of Sao Paulo. ``Who
can blame them if they resort to crime to feed their families?''
</P>
<P>
   While many out-of-work cane cutters are expected to migrate to
the gritty peripheries of large cities like Sao Paulo or Recife, in
the country's northeast, just as other hard-pressed farmhands and
their families have done during the last several decades, others do
not see that as a viable choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My existence is here and I'm doing everything I can to make
sure I am not dependent on sugar cane,'' said Julio Faria, 24, a
regular at the Bar do Gaucho who has secured work as a painter at a
nearby metals factory to supplement his income as a part-time cane
cutter.
</P>
<P>
   These grim long-term prospects stand in contrast to the
improvement in the lot of large numbers of cane cutters and
millions of other low-skilled laborers in Brazil in recent years.
Indeed, some argue that rural workers' economic gains have fueled
the drive to mechanize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   According to union statistics, the base salary for sugar workers
in the southern region of the country has risen in recent years,
above the monthly minimum wage of $85, to about $122 a month, while
in the poorer northeast the base salary is about $100 a month. Much
of the advance resulted from the growing clout of rural unions.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of sugar workers are hired under labor
legislation giving them benefits like limited unemployment
insurance and the chance to retire with a small government pension.
The number is up from less than 50 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Working conditions have also improved. In Sao Paulo state, for
example, authorities moved to prohibit the burning of sugar cane.
Although burning makes it easier to harvest cane by hand, because
much of the stalk is removed, it is also dangerous because of
potential harm to the lungs of cane cutters and the chance that
winds could cause field fires to go out of control, burning cutters
to death. ``It is inhuman and absurd to think that a modern
democracy could permit such a practice,'' said Alceu Arruda Veiga
Filho, the director of Sao Paulo's Institute of Agricultural
Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Such victories for the sugar workers have inspired other
low-income workers, like maids and other agricultural laborers, who
have sued to get their employers to grant them some benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the sugar workers' case, though, the advances are deceptive,
because the growing expense of hiring laborers has led many growers
to replace people with machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the dilemma of Brazil,'' said Guilherme Pedro Neto, a
director of the National Confederation of Agricultural Workers.
``The poor win concessions but are no better off than before, and
probably worse. It is like we're winning battle after battle, but
losing the war.''

NRA PLANS SHOOTING-SPORTS STORE IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Even for New Yorkers, it's an in-your-face
move: the National Rifle Association has chosen Times Square, the
center of a city with one of the nation's strictest gun-control
laws, as the site of a new gun sports store, complete with a
virtual shooting range.
</P>
<P>
   The megastore, to be called the NRASports Blast, will offer
``family'' entertainment in the form of simulated target shooting,
along with the sale of sport-shooting paraphernalia, NRA executive
vice president Wayne LaPierre announced at the opening ceremonies
of the groups' national convention Friday. Guns will not be sold at
the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want NRASports to be a world-class shooting sports venue,
right in the Big Apple,'' LaPierre said. ``Sport shooting is an
Olympic sport. What better place (than New York) to enable more
people to get involved in shooting?''
</P>
<P>
   The gesture demonstrates that in the wake of the Million Mom
March, Smith &AMP; Wesson's recent agreement to push for safer guns,
and the Clinton administration's aggressive campaign for tighter
gun laws, the NRA isn't retreating.
</P>
<P>
   The group's membership is increasing, with LaPierre estimating
it will reach 4 million by election day. And the NRA also is trying
to expand its appeal to women and youngsters _ a target audience of
the sport-shooting store planned for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates were dumbstruck by the plan. Although the
crime and murder rates have declined sharply in recent years, New
York City still had 667 murders last year, and the city severely
restricts gun ownership and carrying privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, we thought it was a joke,'' Kim Mariani, spokeswoman
for Washington, D.C.-based Handgun Control Inc., said the NRA
store. ``The last thing that the people of New York want is the
glorification of the gun culture, after they worked so hard to cut
crime through strict gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Josh Sugarman, executive director of the Violence Policy
Center: ``What will their sign say, `Over a Million Killed?' It
will quickly become a protest Mecca in the wake of the high-profile
shootings that now define our nation, each of which will be laid at
the NRA's doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also chagrined by the announcement. ``It's a
strange message to be sending in a city that's done its best to get
violent crime and gun crime under control,'' said White House
spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA store, modeled after the ESPN Sports Zone in Times
Square, will not offer live-ammunition target shooting, instead
featuring ``virtual'' sport shooting games, said NRA spokesman Bill
Powers. The designs of the store and the games are still being
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The store will be operated by a new division called NRA Sports,
and may involve ``co-branding'' of products with manufacturers of
sports shooting materials, LaPierre said. Neither he nor Powers
would put a price tag on the project.
</P>
<P>
   The group is ``still in negotiations'' over a lease for the
store, LaPierre said. Assuming the theme shop is successful, the
NRA intends to open similar stores in cities around the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA also released a video spot promoting the new store, in
which LaPierre is seen standing on a busy Manhattan street
extolling the pleasures of shooting. ``It's fun for the whole
family,'' the NRA chief says in the video.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, famous for targeting political candidates unfriendly to
its pro-gun rights agenda, has itself become the target of a heavy
gun control campaign by the White House and other supporters of gun
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In travels across the country, President Clinton has pounded the
NRA for its refusal to accept limits on gun ownership, and demands
for mandatory safety latches on weapons. More than 200,000 people
participated in last Sunday's Million Mom March for stronger gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development last month
wrought an agreement from Springfield, Mass.-based Smith &AMP; Wesson
company, which said it would put safety latches on all new guns it
produced, and develop ``smart gun'' technology to ensure only
authorized people can fire a particular gun.
</P>
<P>
   Under threat of a potentially costly lawsuit, the company also
agreed not to sell guns at gun shows unless a backgroud check is
done on the would-be purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   But Powers insisted the decision to promote the NRA as a sports
organization was not part of an image-burnishing strategy. ``We are
mainstream,'' he said. ``And I think they're mainstream in New York
City more than elected politicians would like to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Chosing New York City was a marketing decision, not a political
move, LaPierre said. ``If you look at Times Square, it realy is the
mega-marketing center of the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NRA members wandering among the booths at the first day of the
groups' three-day convention greeted the idea with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we'd go there,'' said New Jersey State Trooper Nelson
Prus, Jr., 37, after he finished playing a video duck-shooting
game, complete with animated blood splatters to mark a downed duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people in New York, and the more people we
get our message out to, the better,'' he said. Prus said he shoots
targets and hunts, and is teaching his 4-year-old and 6-year-old
sons to shoot targets in their backyard. All are life members of
the NRA, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York ``is the best place to have it,'' added Michael
Shrewsbury, 38, as he, his wife and two children browsed among the
guns displayed at the massive Charlotte Convention Center hall.
``The ones who are most strongly against it are the ones who need
to learn more about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sport shooting draws 30 million enthusiasts annually, LaPierre
said, making it among the most popular sports. The
Connecticut-based National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates
that 15 million to 21 million Americans hunt every year. Hunting
and sport shooting spark $30 billion in economic activity every
year, according to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Sport shooting ``is probably about the safest activity Americans
can participate in as a hobby,'' LaPierre said.

 SERTAOZINHO, Brazil: the war.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of course, sharp inequalities have defined Brazil and its sugar
industry for 500 years. In the 16th century Brazil became the
world's leading sugar producer, with much of the colonial
slave-owning society built around the workings of the sugar
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, historians say sugar's dominant role helps explain why
slavery in Brazil was said to be more harsh than in many other New
World colonies, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar was a killing activity,'' said Stuart Schwartz, a
professor at Yale University who has written about the history of
Brazil's sugar industry. ``The mortality rate in sugar was higher
than in any other agricultural activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-17th century, when the Caribbean colonies of European
powers began emerging as leading sugar producers, sugar began to
decline in importance in Brazil. Only in the 20th century did the
country re-emerge as the world's leading sugar producer.
</P>
<P>
   A program designed by the country's military dictatorship in the
1970s to drive development was responsible for an immense increase
in sugar output. Wary of high petroleum prices, the generals asked,
why not use sugar, so abundant in Brazil, to produce alcohol for
use as an automobile fuel?
</P>
<P>
   The program was a huge lift for the sugar industry. As recently
as a decade ago, 90 percent of Brazil's automobiles were powered by
fuel made from alcohol, when generous subsidies buoyed its
production. Sugar developed into an advanced industry, with
cultivation and processing integrated at various sites.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby Santa Elisa, for instance, a sugar plantation that
employs many residents of Sertaozinho, there are processing and
production facilities that resemble a futuristic petrochemical
complex. A stone's throw away are vast fields where sugar cane is
harvested by machines and by hand.
</P>
<P>
   But just as sugar grew in importance after the military
government encouraged alcohol production, the crop fell out of
favor when democratically elected leaders in the 1990s went about
dismantling the privileges enjoyed by the ``usineiros,'' as
Brazil's sugar barons are called.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and subtly, the government of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, drawn from urban bankers, academics and foreign-educated
economists, went about slashing the subsidies enjoyed by the sugar
industry. In stages, elaborate financing programs and price support
systems were phased out, and producers were forced to cope with
free-market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only 1 percent of Brazil's cars run on sugar-based fuel _
a change welcomed by many motorists. Alcohol was cheaper and said
to be cleaner-burning than regular gasoline, but it could be a
problem during the moderately cool winters in southern Brazil:
Alcohol-fueled cars often took a long time to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most cars now run on gasoline, much of it from domestic
sources, a result of efforts to bolster production, mainly at
offshore drilling platforms. The country now produces nearly
three-fourths of its petroleum needs, up from less than half a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government has moved to liberalize parts of the
oil industry through the sale of concessions to foreign companies
seeking to drill at offshore sites. As market forces come to
dominate the country's fuel sector, the usineiros' prestige has
declined.
</P>
<P>
   To many Brazilians, the wealthy usineiros, who sent their
children to be educated at finishing schools in Europe while
migrants from the countryside swelled the slums surrounding the
large cities, have long been a symbol of the nation's social
inequality.
</P>
<P>
   In Pernambuco, a state in Brazil's northeast, a literary
movement originated by the novelist Jose Lins do Rego used the
contrast between the usineiros' wealth and the poverty of their
workers as a platform to discuss Brazil's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Today, leaders of the Landless Workers Movement contend that
stubbornness of the usineiros is a main reason that Brazil, unlike
other large Latin American countries such as Mexico, did not have
an effective land reform program until the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar industry was really despised for many years because
of the favoritism it enjoyed on the part of the state,'' said Tamas
Smrecsanyi, a professor at the University of Campinas. ``So it's
really no big deal for society to see them suffering a little in
having to adapt to new times.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that many usineiros are unhappy with the
changes of recent years. Maurilio Biagi Filho, the owner of Santa
Elisa, one of the country's largest sugar plantations, is among the
most vociferous critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the most fantastic soil in the world, the best
climate, everything really, and yet we're suffering,'' Biagi said
as he barreled over a dirt road on his plantation at 80 miles an
hour in his alcohol-powered Volkwagen sedan, one hand on the wheel,
the other motioning in the air. ``What do they want us to do, flood
the world market with sugar?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that is exactly what is happening. As the usineiros
wade their way through the free market, many of the 120
sugar-producing countries around the world that cannot effectively
subsidize or shield their sugar industries from foreign shocks are
increasingly concerned about the changes in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In what analysts have called the ``alcohol bomb,'' Brazil has
transferred sugar to export markets that was previously used to
produce alcohol. The price of raw sugar has plunged by 40 percent
during the last year, to about 6.3 cents a pound from 10 cents, as
international markets have struggled to absorb Brazil's rising
exports.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few years, the country's annual sugar production
has risen to 20 million tons, from 13 million, as wider use of
mechanization has both increased efficiency and cut costs. By
contrast, Cuba, another country with a large sugar industry,
produces 4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation last year of the Brazilian currency, the real,
made the price of the country's sugar more competitive in foreign
markets. But the downward pressure on prices continues to mount,
with dampened demand in countries like Indonesia and Russia. so
Brazil's producers are enticed to export even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching a Greek tragedy unfold, witnessing today's
situation,'' said Tony Hannah, an analyst at the London-based
International Sugar Organization and co-author of ``The
International Sugar Trade.'' ``The bomb just keeps on exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Laws here that still require small amounts of alcohol to be
added to gasoline have eased the situation a bit. But it is
difficult to discern whether the legal protections that produced
the alcohol industry will survive much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to fire my cutters,'' Biagi, the usineiro, said.
But he added that such layoffs are a growing trend ``and the
government needs to be prepared to help them find other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a thinly veiled warning to the authorities, he said that
if growers were to use all of their cane to make sugar, they could
produce 40 million, doubling Brazil's production, an increase that
would have dire consequences for the world market. The government
must come to realize that possibility, Biagi said. ``I don't think
it does.''

 &HT;    NRA plans to merchandise products
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As it seeks to blunt rising outrage over guns
and youth violence, the National Rifle Association said Friday it
intends to appeal to the American mainstream by selling
NRA-emblazoned merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase for NRASports, a firearms-themed brand of clothing,
camping gear and electronic shooting games, will be a store and
theme restaurant in New York City's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA hopes the store, to be called NRASportsBlast, will draw
as big a following as such popular New York City outlets as the
World Wrestling Federation store or the ESPNZone.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the opening day of the NRA's annual
convention in Charlotte, where gun-control organizations rallied to
counter the NRA's patriotic show defending Americans'
constitutional right to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns can turn children and emotionally disturbed people into
criminals,'' said Lisa Price, executive director of North
Carolinians Against Gun Violence Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Washington, D.C.
-based Violence Policy Center, said the NRA's merchandising plans
``will go down in history as the worst marketing decision since New
Coke. What will their sign say: 'Over a Million Killed'?'' The
store, he said, would become a protest mecca.
</P>
<P>
   But the NRA, boasting of surging contributions and a record 3.6
million members, is spending this weekend mobilizing supporters for
the Nov. 7 presidential, congressional and local elections.
</P>
<P>
   NRA President Charlton Heston called this weekend's meeting the
most important in the organization's 129-year history because of
the crucial fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our gun rights of the 2nd Amendment are truly in peril,''
Heston said in a video message to Friday's opening session.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old actor plans to arrive for today's session as he
seeks a third terms as NRA president.
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials presided over a grassroots organizing session
Friday during which members applauded one another's political
victories and booed whenever the names of ''anti-gunner''
congressmen were mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a need for God-fearing Americans to stand up, those
who believe in their constitutional freedoms . . . to be involved
directly with the political process,'' said Richard Jordan,
president of Christian Sportsmen's Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 45, pointed to the recent largest police manhunt in
Georgia's history as a practical reason he owns a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gave me a level of confidence, a level of comfort, that my
family would be out of harm's way,'' said Jordan, a father of seven
children.
</P>
<P>
   NRA Second Vice President Sandra Froman, who chairs the group's
grassroots committee, said women are especially effective at
lobbying politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figure that a woman is good for about three men'' when
visiting legislators, said Froman, applauding the dozen or so women
in the audience of several hundred attending the grassroots
workshop.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's efforts to align itself with more women and encourage
them to become politically active face hurdles demonstrated by
national polling. Research shows women favor gun regulation more
than men do, a finding experts attribute to youth violence such as
last year's massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get out and do your job, we will win,'' said Froman,
urging NRA members to recruit their friends and neighbors to ''keep
America on the right track.''

   Tempting, tempting . . .
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since the prospect of putting cash in
the bank held any attraction for most people. Interest rates were
paltry, and the eager money forsook income investments to chase
capital gains in the stock market. That drove prices so high that
the average dividend paid by companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
is now barely 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Reserve's drive to head off any surge in
inflation is returning the luster to the word ``yield'' _ on bonds,
of course, but also on such prosaic and convenient products as
certificates of deposit and money market funds, especially for
consumers willing to shop a little.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, a bit of negotiating _ even a ploy as simple as
inquiring whether your bank might be willing to improve on the rate
posted in the window _ can also pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got more than $50,000 or so, you can always get 25
to 50 basis points more, often by just asking,'' said Warren
Heller, research director at Veribanc, which analyzes banking
trends. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, banks do not advertise or even acknowledge
that this goes on, but some customers of major banks have found
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the most succulent rates, the place to look is the
Internet _ both the electronic offshoots of traditional banks and
the stand-alone cyberbanks like Wingspan bank.com, ETrade Group's
Telebank, X.Com and USAccess Internet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of online banking published last Wednesday by Consumer
Action, an advocacy group in California, found ``much better
interest rates, not only on savings accounts but on checking and
money market accounts and certificates of deposit,'' than were
found elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their examination of 19 virtual banks, all federally insured,
and 10 traditional ones showed, for example, that online operations
paid about a half-point more interest on six-month CDs, and that 4
of the 19 required smaller minimum deposits than any of the
ordinary banks.
</P>
<P>
   As promotion-minded as many a dot-com, Wingspanbank is
temporarily offering an eye-popping 10 percent interest rate on
checking accounts that Kevin Watters, its senior vice president for
marketing, called ``probably the highest in the country.'' The rate
applies to amounts from $100 to $10,000 and runs until Sept. 1;
after that. the accounts will pay 3.10 percent for deposits of at
least $2,500 and 4.50 percent for $10,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can pay such high rates because we don't have the physical
infrastructure that brick-and-mortar banks have,'' Watters said,
adding that Wingspanbank's computer system, built from scratch,
avoided the technical incompatibility problems that traditional
competitors face after numerous mergers.
</P>
<P>
   In 12-month certificates of deposit, Wingspanbank immediately
echoed last week's half-point increase by the Federal Reserve for
overnight money, bringing its rate to 7 percent. The average bank
in the country offered 5.47 percent on 12-month CDs after the Fed
move, up from 5.42 percent from the previous week, according to
Bank Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Wingspanbank, owned by Bank One, is based in Wilmington, Del.,
but you may not have to look beyond your hometown institutions for
newly enticing deposit rates.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank in New York, for example, has a cyberspace facility
that it calls Citi f/i (for financial interactive). A visit to
citifi.com, its Web site, found its insured money market account
paying a 5.50 percent rate, for an annual yield of 5.65 percent,
with a $1,000 minimum. As is common with Internet banks, Citi f/i
reimburses any ATM fees charged to its depositors by other
institutions for withdrawals from its accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Citi's online rates are well above the 4.59 percent rate (4.70
percent annual yield) offered at Citibank branches on ``preferred''
money market accounts, which require deposits or loans totaling at
least $50,000 in a customer's accounts. Customers with $25,000 to
$49,999 in their accounts get a 3 percent rate, yielding 3.05
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The difference reflects ``lower infrastructure costs,'' said
Maria Mendler, a Citibank spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Textbook economics, however, holds that prices are made by
supply and demand, not costs, leading analysts to suggest that
Internet banks' rates are high because they are little known and
because consumers hesitate over the idea of a bank they cannot
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong with a transaction, it's not like just
driving down to the branch and taking it up with the manager,''
said Heller of Veribanc, noting that credit unions often combine
very close proximity with high rates.
</P>
<P>
   Local banks sometimes bid so aggressively for money that there
is no need to send it away to get a higher rate, he said.
``Sometimes there's a pleasant surprise.'' &QL;

NEW PRESIDENT SYMBOLIZES GAP BETWEEN TAIWAN, CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ It is fashionable and politically correct here to
speak of the inexorable reunion of the tragically divided ``Chinese
motherland'' _ with the conviction that it will culminate
gloriously in the not-too-distant future with the return to the
fold of the renegade province of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view widely shared among mainland Chinese of all ages,
levels of education, and income. But for most people in Taiwan's
capital Taipei, that scenario for now couldn't be scarier.
</P>
<P>
   As Taiwan inaugurates Chen Shui-bian as its president, a man who
long advocated independence from China, there is a yawning gap
between two peoples who share a common language and long history
but remain divided by 100 miles of sea and 50 years of contrasting
political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
   Both peoples have made stunning economic advances in the last
two decades, but while Taiwan's government has transformed itself
in just 13 years from an oppressive military regime to a vibrant,
free-for-all democracy, China has remained frozen under one-party
communist rule that tolerates little dissent.
</P>
<P>
   People in China and Taiwan agree that reunification _ whether
done peacefully or forceably _ seems increasingly inevitable. But
like the two Koreas or the former East and West Germanys, many
people in China and Taiwan regard their governments and each other
suspicion, contempt, and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Chinese government or state-controlled press
threatens war if Taiwan doesn't fall into line _ a sabre that has
been rattled almost daily since February _ most Taiwanese feel ever
more alienated from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not brothers _ we're more like enemies,'' Eric Lin, 25,
a Taiwanese graduate student, said recently outside a Taipei mall.
``There's no big brother who would beat up his younger brother
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   For many mainlanders, the very idea of Taiwan as an independent
state is at best laughable, at worst a poisonous notion that must
be stamped out by force. Chinese media published a survey Friday
asserting that 95 percent of mainlanders support going to war if
Chen declares independence.
</P>
<P>
   That hard-line attitude is not commonly heard in informal
interviews here, however, a discrepancy that may reflect a legacy
of decades of authoritarian rule; the habit here is to toe the
party line when questioned by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   China has demonized Taiwan's incoming vice president,
Harvard-educated lawyer Annette Lu, ever since she referred to the
two sides last month as ``distant cousins and close neighbors,'' a
not-uncommon attitude among Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last week by a Taiwanese public relations firm found 70
percent of Taipei residents say the island should be independent,
and 57 percent said they could not accept the ``one country, two
systems'' model that now governs Hong Kong and Macao _ and which
Beijing has offered Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But like Chan Yeini, 38, a software consultant, many Taiwanese
businessmen admire China for its rapid economic reforms and they
say political change will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will ask for more rights,'' he said. ``Taiwan took 20
years to get where we are, and they'll take maybe 10 years,'' he
said. Even so, ``it is impossible to reunite. . . . It is like when
a kid grows up and leaves the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking disconnect between the two sides is at
heart not so much political as a question of identity _ how they
perceive themselves, and each other. While most Chinese genuinely
believe that Taiwanese are for better or worse their ``brothers,''
it is hard to find a Taiwanese, especially of the younger
generation, who will echo that view.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published by the government three months ago found that
45 percent of Taiwan's people identify themselves as ``Taiwanese,''
far more than the 14 percent who consider themselves ``Chinese'' or
the 39 percent who say they are both.
</P>
<P>
   Although people-to-people contact has become possible since 1987
with growing commercial links and tourism _ Taiwan is the number
two investor on the mainland, and 60,000 Taiwanese companies do
business there _ distrust on both sides persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been there and I wouldn't want to go,'' Claire
Yang, 25, a Taiwanese website designer, said emphatically. ``Since
childhood, I was educated that it's a bad place and that they are
bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin Huei-mei, 58, a teacher in Taipei, visited the mainland, and
didn't like it. ``I didn't like the way people related to each
other. They don't respect human rights, and they treat people as
objects. I think it's the way they're educated from childhood _
they're cold and selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a harsh sentiment that is mirrored by some on the mainland.
Taiwanese businessmen have a reputation here as disdainful bosses
who overwork and underpay their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwanese think they're superior to us in every way _
business, fashion, music, political system,'' said a 35-year-old
Shanghai businessman who said he was afraid to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call Chen the `president,' he said, ``but according to
international law, he cannot be a president because Taiwan is not a
real country. They think that little place can fight with a country
of 1.3 billion people. . . . How can they think they are higher
than us?''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People themselves are no different,'' said Fan Zigen, 58, a
ship factory worker. ``The problem is between the governments.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it looks unlikely that either government will bow to
the other on reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all think there will eventually be reunion, but most people
want the status quo for now, and leave the solution for the next
generation,'' said Charlie Chou, 50, a Taiwanese computer executive
visiting Shanghai. ``It will take new leaders to solve this.''

NETWORKS NEED A LESSON IN COURTESY TO CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Mrs. Wiseman? Say it ain't so, Jeremy.
</P>
<P>
   The annual exercise in self-congratulation over the fabulous
fall schedules the networks have assembled inevitably leaves behind
a pile of detritus they don't even bother to sweep up.
</P>
<P>
   This heap of canceled shows doesn't warrant so much as a
hasta-la-bye-bye from the networks as they trip over one another in
the rush to trumpet what's new. And so fans of CBS's charming ``Now
and Again'' will have to get along without the sweet strength of a
character like Lisa Wiseman. Hope springs eternal for fans of
``Sports Night,'' which reportedly will be picked up by HBO. But as
we await rescue by the cable cabal, which probably wouldn't resume
production until January or February, our memory of the boyish and
brilliant Jeremy Goodwin starts to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Colin, who made me wish Mrs. Wiseman lived next door,
and Joshua Malina, who made me wish I worked with Jeremy, are
terrific actors who will survive the brutality of network whimsy.
But it doesn't excuse the awful manners the networks display each
spring.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when TV writers get phone calls from
incredulous readers who don't believe it when they read that their
favorite show has been canceled. ``How could this happen?'' they
demand to know. ``How will they resolve last week's cliffhanger?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is that they won't, because network
executives have a disdain for viewers that makes the Soup Nazi look
like the customer's best friend. The only people they like less are
maitre d's who don't have their favorite tables ready. (Speaking of
service providers, in this age of satisfying the customer _ of
Nordstrom and amazon.com and L.L. Bean _ ever wonder why the
networks never tell us how to get in touch with them? Even their
Web sites don't make it easy.)
</P>
<P>
   When the Post-Intelligencer ran a ``Winners &AMP; Losers'' box with
each story about the fall prime-time lineups, readers would
invariably call to say we must have been mistaken, that ``The
Pretender'' or ``Early Edition'' or ``Wasteland'' couldn't possibly
have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they were, but the networks never mention it. If a person
isn't reading this column or TV Guide or some other source when the
cancellation occurs, whether it's at the end of the season or three
weeks into it, he has no clue that a show has been dispatched to
the Dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it considered foolish to ask that a network tell us when
a show is no longer in stock? When we call to order something from
a catalog, we're told immediately if the item is available. If it's
not, we might be peeved, we might even say we'll never buy from
that catalog again, but at least we have information that allows us
to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when we tune in on a certain night at a certain hour to see
a familiar show, something else comes on in its place and there
isn't a clue from the network. Why can't they put a note at the
bottom of the screen? It could be terse: ```Sports Night' is no
longer on ABC's schedule.'' Or it could be warm and fuzzy: ``If you
tuned in to watch `Now and Again,' we're sorry to say it is no
longer on our schedule. We hope you enjoy what we've put in its
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it's serving the customer. Such a radical concept!
Sure, it's going to get some people bent out of shape, but that's
going to happen no matter how we find out about the cancellation.
Wouldn't it build credibility and good will if the networks were up
front about it?
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the events at which the networks unveil their new
fall lineups to the advertising community are called ``up-fronts.''
They are a springtime ritual that allows the networks to obtain
up-front commitments from advertisers, who in turn get lower rates
by signing on early.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars per network, and
the response of the advertisers is used to gauge how the fall
lineup will play in homes across America.
</P>
<P>
   If only our frustration spoke as eloquently as hard currency.

 &HT;    Gloves coming off in Lakers-Blazers
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, it's personal.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference finals, viewed by many as the ``real''
NBA championship series, has taken on a heated flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers have not
reached New York-Miami proportions yet, but they don't like each
other. That much is clear from the words and actions on the court
from both sides, starting with today's Game 1 in the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The teams split four regular-season games, but Portland's wins
did not impress league MVP Shaquille O'Neal. ``They beat us, but
they didn't beat us,'' O'Neal said. ``They won the games, but they
didn't beat us. We just have to be ready. The whole team is going
to be pumped up, the city is going to be pumped up, everybody is
going to be pumped up, and we will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy seems ready. He complained all
week about O'Neal's physical style, trying to plant seeds in the
minds of the referees. And he didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy said he was ``shocked at how (the Lakers) were able to
get (illegal defense) calls on Sacramento by talking about it in
the newspaper. On a couple of them, I don't even think Sacramento
was illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers ``had a lot of nerve even complaining about it, the
way Shaq just stands in the middle all the time,'' Dunleavy said.
</P>
<P>
   And the talk was just beginning. Los Angeles coach Phil Jackson
did a Lenny Wilkens, saying Portland is a team that is struggling
with leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think that if Scottie (Pippen) doesn't lead this
team and take them by the horns, they're not going to get by us,''
said Jackson, who teamed with Pippen and Michael Jordan to win six
NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. ``I don't know who else can lead
them. I don't see another leader on that basketball club, someone
who can get things done at critical times and make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson was not done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Portland underachieved this year,'' he said. ``I
thought we would have to win 65 games to beat them. But after we
beat them (90-87 in Portland on Feb. 29), they fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, the Blazers fizzled after the Lakers' significant
win, finishing the regular season 14-12. But they have played some
of their best ball in the playoffs. ``We have our confidence
back,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like it.

   TV-NETWORKS (Undated) _ The annual exercise in

trip over one another in the rush to trumpet what's new.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Preakness is only the second leg, but a lot of
people whose livelihood depends on thoroughbred racing already have
visions of a Triple Crown dancing in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will be the savior that racing executives and
fans have been awaiting for 22 years if he can get out of this town
unscathed in the Preakness Saturday and then win the Belmont Stakes
on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of a Triple Crown is very good for business,''
said Chip Tuttle, a vice president with the National Thoroughbred
Racing Association, a coalition that promotes the sport. ``Just the
possibility means three or four (television) ratings points for the
Belmont Stakes, additional column inches of newspaper and magazine
coverage, greater TV exposure. It's three weeks of additional
mainstream coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility existed in each of the past three years, when
colts won the first two legs of the crown, only to be sideswiped by
the grim reaper of racing, the Belmont Stakes. The difference is
that Fusaichi Pegasus has a much greater aura than any of the
previous three.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally different than in the case of Real Quiet,
Silver Charm and Charismatic,'' said New York Racing Association
executive Bill Nader. ``This time I think people will come to see a
coronation as opposed to hoping to see a Triple Crown winner. This
time they come expecting to see it, and maybe seeing one of the
all-time great horses, a horse they may be comparing to Affirmed,
Seattle Slew or Secretariat.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's the small matter of beating seven other
horses Saturday afternoon going 1 3/16 miles in the 10th race at
Pimlico before one can even consider such a leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're dying to have a media horse, we're dying to have
a Triple Crown horse,'' said trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who trained
Charismatic, last year's Derby and Preakness winner. ``It's out
there possibly, but right now it's still a Derby horse going for
the second leg. Nothing more, nothing less at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the presence of a first-class colt like Fusaichi Pegasus,
who sold for $4 million and could be worth 10 times that with a
Triple Crown on his resume, makes this quest seem more realistic
than the other bids of recent vintage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has been waiting for an outstanding racehorse
with a regal pedigree,'' author Andrew Beyer said in the Daily
Racing Form. ``The best American champions in recent years _ Cigar,
Holy Bull, Skip Away and Silver Charm _ have all been the products
of moderate pedigrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, conversely, is a son of the great cornerstone
sire Mr. Prospector, and has the look and bearing of a potential
superstar stallion himself.
</P>
<P>
   Should he become the first horse since Affirmed (1978) to sweep
the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes, the residual effects on
what is perceived to be a struggling industry could be monumental.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good for the sport right now,'' said trainer Bob Baffert,
who had two healthy whiffs of Triple Crown perfume with Silver
Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in '98. ``When they were coming down
the stretch and I thought I was going to win the Triple Crown, man,
it was a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Three horses won Triple Crown winners in the 1970s, but the
magic has been missing since. Spectacular Bid, Pleasant Colony,
Alysheba and Sunday Silence also won the first two legs before
failing in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would help the sport like a Michael Jordan helped
basketball,'' said the NTRA's Tuttle, who remains bullish on
racing. ``Handle was up in North America last year for the fifth
straight year. Sales at public auctions topped $1 billion for the
first time ever. Purses exceeded $1 billion for the first time. All
this crap about a dying industry should be gone whether he wins it
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the immediate impact on the Belmont Stakes can't be
denied, and the folks at NYRA will have fingers crossed on both
hands on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that in the last three years, when we went from
70,000 to 82,000 to 85,000 (fans), the people have left with a
positive experience,'' Nader said. ``But if it is a non-Triple
Crown Belmont, the expectations are much lower. We're looking at a
crowd more in the neighborhood of 50,000. It's a big swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects are even more far-reaching in terms of Belmont
Stakes wagering if Fusaichi Pegasus has the betting public's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we handled nearly $75 million on Belmont Stakes
Day,'' Nader said. ``Without a Triple Crown on the line, we can't
even come close to that. The whole day of racing is great, so if we
have a Triple Crown opportunity and it gets everybody to focus on
Belmont Stakes Day, it carries over to our supporting races.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said the NTRA already is feeling the effects of Pegasus
mania, having been contacted by prestigious magazines for stories
about the game's rising star.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility of a Triple Crown would mean additional
national and regional promotion for racing,'' he said. ``It means
people spending national advertising revenue. The media impact is
worth millions of dollars, and that's only if the possibility
exists.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Pegasus should actually win all three races? It's an
appealing thought for horse racing boosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that if there is a Triple Crown winner, that
racing gets the cover of Sports Illustrated,'' Nader said. ``Racing
gets the front page of some major newspapers, not the front page of
sports or the back page of sports, but the front page of the
newspaper. We need to get over that hurdle and see how much we can
capitalize on that opportunity.''

   The New York Times News Service has move the following
entertainment/arts, Financial, Travel and Style articles this week
for release Sunday, May 21, 2000. Articles from the Week in Review
section will move Saturday morning:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COVER STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TONYS-THEATER (Undated) _ On the eve of the annual awards, Robin
Pogrebin assesses what's wrong (and right) with the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROSIE-O'DONNELL-THEATER (Undated) _ If Broadway were a religion,
Rosie O'Donnell would most certainly make the short list for
beatification. Her daytime talk show on ABC is a virtual worship
service for the theater. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   TONYS-OPINIONS (Undated) _ The annual ritual of asking what is
right and wrong with the Tony Awards has arrived. Last year, some
of the wrongs concerned the show: Radio City Music Hall was not
available for the ceremonies; Rosie O'Donnell pulled out as the
host, and the ratings and general telecast quality plummeted. This
year, O'Donnell will be at her post _ at Radio City Music Hall _on
June 4. But concerns remain about the awards in general. Jesse
McKinley gets some opinions from people working in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN-STROMAN-THEATER (Undated) _ They are images as American,
and crusty, as apple pie _ cowboys on the prairie, lovers in a
small town, dancers in a smoky club _ scenes endlessly romanticized
in everything from the detective chic of Dashiell Hammett to the
purple prose of ``The Bridges of Madison County.'' For Susan
Stroman, whose notable talent seems to involve creating lively
steps against quintessential American backdrops, it seems only
natural that theater might be the medium to shake some dust off
those stereotypes. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THANDIE-NEWTON-MOVIES (Beverly Hills) _ An interview with
Thandie Newton, the British actress who will be seen on screen
under John Woo's direction inflaming the passions of a trio of
chiseled-jawed men (including Tom Cruise) when ``M: I-2'' opens May
24. By Ariel Swartley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BEATNIK-ROCK-MUSIC (Undated) _ When Allen Ginsberg, the last
surviving member of the Beat trinity that included Jack Kerouac and
William Burroughs, died three years ago, it was entirely
appropriate that Lou Reed and Patti Smith be prominent among those
participating in the ceremonies honoring Walt Whitman's greatest
poetic descendant. The shock waves of Ginsberg's ``Howl,''
Kerouac's ``On the Road,'' and Burroughs' ``Naked Lunch'' radiated
far beyond the academy. It's clear today that as much as the Beats
helped loosen the academic strait jacket constricting American
literature, they had a far more profound impact on rock culture. By
Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   VIENNA-ORCHESTRA-MUSIC (Vienna) _ When the Vienna Philharmonic
performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony recently in a former Nazi
concentration camp in Mauthausen, Austria, it was knowingly wading
into deep waters of memory and repression, meaning and association,
hope and delusion. And all of that is to reckon without the
late-breaking international fracas over Joerg Haider and the
Freedom Party, as the orchestra did through most of its four years
of planning. The event was intended as a Janus-headed look
backward, with remorse and a hope for healing, and forward, with
resolve and a hope for renewal. By James R. Oestreich.
</P>
<P>
   ARTIE-SHAW-MUSIC (Undated) _ H.L. Mencken once suggested that in
a well-run universe, everybody would have two lives: ``one for
observing and studying the world, and the other for formulating and
setting down his conclusions about it.'' This is more or less the
way that the clarinetist Artie Shaw, who turns 90 on May 23, has
contrived to arrange things. By Terry Teachout.
</P>
<P>
   TURAY-TUCKER-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``I was basically a product of
the pop generation,'' says the lyric tenor Gregory Turay, 27,
latest winner of the Richard Tucker Award, the fanciest American
prize a American classical singer can win. Back in his days as a
teen rocker with his father's band Time Trax, he would bring the
house down with Billy Idol's ``Mony Mony.'' An interview. By
Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   METALLICA-NAPSTER (Undated) _ Metallica is suing Napster with
the stated intention of shutting down piracy, not harassing the
music lovers who legitimately trade music through it. But by
gathering the names of users and asking that they be banned from
the service, the band arguably resorted to privacy invasion. The
band's approach has so angered fans that they are organizing
boycotts and merchandise burnings, and establishing anti-Metallica
Web sites and bulletin boards. By Ann Powers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HARLEM-DANCE (New York) _ Dance Theater of Harlem celebrates its
30th anniversary this year. The classical-ballet company was
founded by Arthur Mitchell, a leading dancer with the New York City
Ballet, in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.
George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, the founders of City
Ballet, encouraged Mitchell to start the troupe. City Ballet will
pay tribute to the company in three shared programs on May 25, 26
and 28 at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Jennifer
Dunning talks with the directors.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ANASTACIA-DANCE (New York) _ Until now, the only ballets titled
``Anastasia'' have been about the Russian Grand Duchess who
legendarily survived the murder of the entire Imperial family by
Bolshevik forces in 1918. On Tuesday, however, an Afro-Brazilian
Anastacia will arrive at the Joyce Theater in New York as the
heroine of a new ballet by DanceBrazil. Nobody knows who Anastacia
actually was, but one thing is sure: she was no Grand Duchess. By
Shayna Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART/PHOTOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MARDER-PHOTOGRAPHY (New York) _ Twenty years ago, Malerie Marder
was snooping in her father's dresser drawers and found a snapshot
of a naked woman. It was no big deal, her mother assured her, but
warned her never to pose like the woman in the picture. She didn't
listen. To put it mildly. For the last year, Marder, 28, has
photographed family members and friends nude, including her mother
and ex-boyfriend posing together, in either upscale California
homes or pay-by-the-hour motels. At a time when sexually explicit
display rarely elicits more than a yawn, Marder has managed to
raise eyebrows with her voyeuristic images that challenge the taboo
against incest. By Elizabeth Hayt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLOONEY-TV (Undated) _ What hath George Clooney wrought? Six
weeks after Clooney used his star clout to get the drama ``Fail
Safe'' broadcast live _ in black and white on national television _
entertainment-industry trade publications have already reported
plans for two other live dramas. One is on CBS with Julie Andrews
as the star; the other is on HBO with Glenn Close as co-executive
producer. Optimists see this as the glimmer of a possible second
golden age of television. More likely it's just the latest in
reality programming. By Anita Gates.

</P>
<P>
   MARKET-WATCH (Undated) _ The Market Watch column: Some experts
believe that volatility is a function of stock price gains. But
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan believes it may be a
consequence of the waves of new information buffeting the market.

   JORDAN-ECONOMY (Amman, Jordan) _ Jordan, poor but ambitious, has
opened its doors wide to trade and investment under a new king. By
William A. Orme Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-RATES RATE (Undated) _ While it often seems that nobody
invests for income these days - mania for capital gains has driven
stock prices so high that the average dividend of companies in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is barely 1 percent - the Federal Reserve's
drive to prevent an inflation surge is causing increased
interest-rate temptation. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-KODAK (Undated) _ It may be the quintessential
company-in-transition. Over the last several years, Eastman Kodak
has jettisoned the legacies of failed diversification efforts, cut
$1.2 billion in overhead and embarked on a series of digital
photography initiatives intended to catapult the company into the
New Economy. But given the lackluster results shareholders have
endured, many wonder if Kodak really is on the verge of such a
transformation. By Joanne Legomsky.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-GRASSROOTS (Undated) _ Andrew Segal, the king of `B' office
space, is in the catbird seat now that everybody wants funky
business-casual space, not fancy-schmancy lobbies and amenities. By

</P>
<P>
   PERSONAL-FINANCE-DISASTERS (Undated) _ With the Los Alamos fire
as a peg, a look at ways to carry on your personal business when
disaster strikes. It's tough, even if you were diligent: your files
have burned, your backup floppies have melted, you have no mailbox
in which to receive your visa bill, no home phone number to leave
for return calls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INVESTING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-DISCLOSURE (Undated) _ Who gets a heads-up from his or
her mutual fund company about its portfolio moves? Until recently,
nobody. But in the last year or two, such detailed disclosure has
become, if not yet the norm, then a growing trend in the fund
industry as it adapts to the Internet age. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-STRATEGIES (Las Vegas) _ The kernel of truth embedded in
contrarian analysis is that the market rarely follows forecasts
that are very widely held. Bull markets typically end once everyone
becomes convinced that the market has nowhere to go but up. That is
the origin of the old saw about bull markets liking to climb a wall
of worry, and it explains why having a bootblack tell you about the
latest stock tips is considered the quintessential sign of a top.
Similarly, bear markets generally come to an end when everyone has
thrown in the towel and turned bearish. By Mark Hulbert.

   ETHICS-COLUMN (Undated) _ When to tell the truth is to deceive.
By Jeffrey L. Seglin.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY-COLUMN (Undated) _ Say what you will about capitalism;
you must admit it has a marvelous way of turning even the most
violent and earthshaking upheavals into safe, salable kitsch. By

everybody wants to be your long-lost friend. By Abby Ellin.

<P>
   ABOUT-CARS-LOWRIDERS (Tampa) _ Lowriding emerged in the '50s in
the barrios of California, as Chicano youths _ in what may have
been a reaction to the hot-rod culture dominated by whites _
transformed their cars into shiny, fantastical, ground-hugging
showboats. ``Go low and go slow'' were the watchwords. From the
beginning, lowriding was as much about ethnic identity as about
machinery. In the 1980s, lowriding began to break out of its
traditionally Latino stronghold. By Dan Neil.

<P>
   AUCTION-PARTIES (New York) _ With Sotheby's, Christie's and now
Phillips battling for supremacy in the auction world, the grueling
round of brunches, cocktails parties and dinners given over the
past two weeks to promote the firms' crucial multimillion dollar
May sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary artworks in New
York has left many art lovers reeling from social exhaustion. For
seasoned warriors in the cutthroat art world, attendance at such
events is often less a matter of making whoopee than determinedly
pursuing contacts, deals and artworks that are likely to slip out
of reach in one's absence. By Christopher Mason.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL-HANDBAGS-FASHION (New York) _ Designers have pounced on a
new trend. Tod's, Lambertson Truex and Burberry are among a number
of companies that have recently introduced or plan to introduce
matched sets of handbags, meant for the woman who must have two.
``Women tend to use a larger bag for practicality, a smaller one
for fashion and social reasons,'' noted Richard Lambertson of
Lambertson Truex. ``We believe in merging the pair.'' By Ruth
LaFerla.

<P>
   SCANDINAVIAN-CHIC (New York) _ For some time now we've been in
the midst of some sort of Nordic intermezzo, stylewise. The
appetite for mid-century modern American furniture led, inevitably,
to a taste for the clean-lined Scandinavian designs of the same
era. Manhattan is full of 25-year-olds who burble passionately
about the Finnish master Alvar Aalto and his Danish contemporary
Hans Wegner, and there are entire stores and magazines devoted to
this new/old esthetic. It seems there's now an appetite for the
entire Scandinavian lifestyle. By Penelope Green.

<P>
   ASIAN-CELEBS (Undated) _ Just as Asian culture has penetrated

(prayer-bead bracelet, anyone?), Asian-American women have emerged

</P>

   NITEOUT-BOURDAIN (New York) _ Anthony Bourdain, who for eight

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Plant vigor, Anne Raver says, depends

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 21, will move Saturday.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   LOSALAMOS-CHAOS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Theorists at the Los Alamos
lab who study complex systems ranging from financial markets to
thunderstorms _ not everyone there designs bombs _ often refer to a
phenomenon called ``sensitive dependence on initial conditions.''
Chaos, for short. Tiny actions can have enormous, unforeseeable
outcomes. The idea has entered the culture of popular science as
``the butterfly effect'': A butterfly flapping its wings in Rio de
Janeiro causes a hurricane off the coast of Louisiana. A small fire
routinely lit to clear a few hundred acres of tinder erupts into a
firestorm that closes down a nuclear facility and sends a plume of
smoke billowing into Texas and Colorado. By George Johnson. (Moving
in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   PALESTINIANS-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Abu Dis, West Bank) _ It took
Yasir Arafat many years to arrive at the gate of Jerusalem. But
last week, when Israel conceded to him full control of Abu Dis and
two other villages, the PLO chairman moved one step nearer to his
dream. The villages are a morsel of greater Jerusalem but one with
a bird's eye view of the gold-leafed Dome of the Rock. By Deborah
Sontag. (Moving in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   LISTON-CONSPIRACY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans love a conspiracy
theory, whether it concerns the murder of a president or the defeat
of a boxer. And so it is that, Muhammad Ali, who easily dispatched
Sonny Liston in the ring, may never beat him in popular mythology
and public opinion. There, Liston may forever be held up by the
famous ``phantom punch'' that floored him in their heavyweight
championship fight in 1965. The myth of that unseen punch is making
a comeback just in time for the 35th anniversary of the bout. A new
book, ``The Devil and Sonny Liston,'' and an upcoming biographical
movie are giving new life to old theories that the Mob or the Black
Muslims or someone besides Ali sent Liston to the canvas. By Allen
Barra.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN-SECRETS-REVIEW (Rome) _ When the Vatican revealed that
the long-suppressed 1917 prophecy called the Third Secret of Fatima
was something that has already happened _ the 1981 assassination
attempt on Pope John Paul II _ many conspiracy theories and
doomsday scenarios were deflated. Fatima junkies had believed the
Third Secret was so terrifying that no pope dared reveal it. But
somehow the Fatima mystery lives on; the Vatican's effort to end to
tabloid sensationalism and cultish obsession has instead spawned a
new breed of conspiracy theories. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ABU-JAMAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For whatever symbolic figures may
be worth, Mumia Abu-Jamal, whose appeal to the federal courts for a
new trial could receive a response any day now, has become the most
recognizable death row inmate. And while the United States is the
industrialized world's leader in executions, doubts are now raised
by mainstream politicians about how this accelerating aspect of
criminal justice can ever be run fairly enough for accused
murderers who can not afford a competent defense. But is Mumia the
right poster boy for the anti-death-penalty movement? By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-SCOTUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ To many interest groups on
both the left and the right, the 2000 presidential campaign is not
so much about whether Al Gore or George W. Bush makes it to the
White House. It's about who Gore or Bush would put on the Supreme
Court, where vacancies are a good possibility during the next
presidential term. Three of the nine justices are age 70 or older.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   HEIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ A study conducted by St. Louis
University researchers indicates that many Americans routinely lie
about their height. Perhaps it is because height is often equated
with power, wealth and even intelligence. But for health experts
are concerned that if the study's conclusions are true, Americans,
who are already among the most obese people in the world, could be
in worse shape than previously thought. By Eric Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR-REVIEW (Undated) _ When racing commentators discussed
Adam Petty's death at the New Hampshire International Speedway last
week, few pointed out that he died far from Daytona, and in the
heart of Yankee country. NASCAR, once identified with the
Southeast, has traveled a long way since the first racers came
roaring down from the mountains in their bootlegging cars. By
Susanna Rodell.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SEASON-REVIEW (New York) _ After last week's annual four-day
rite in which network executives nervously announce their new
programs to advertisers, the question on the minds of media buyers,
talent agents and managers and TV executives at the elaborate
parties around the city was: Is this really the best that network
television can offer? By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   WILLS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excepts from some memorable and
bizarre wills.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   WARLORDS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The capture of Foday Sankoh, the
notorious Sierra Leone warlord, highlights a longtime question:
Just how much business can good guys afford to do with bad guys?
The presumption in democratic societies these days is that
strongmen who inflict terrible crimes, whether on their neighbors
or on their own people, should pay for their wrongdoing. But the
reality has not been so simple. As the 1990s spawned warlords from
Yugoslavia to Haiti, from Cambodia to Africa, the basic principle
was often sacrificed to the pragmatic interests of striking peace
deals, no matter how dubious or shaky. By Jane Perlez.

   PEACEKEEPING-U.S. (Washington) _ Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has
singlehandedly blocked the United States from paying $368 million
that it owes the United Nations for four of its most difficult
peacekeeping operations, infuriating the Clinton Administration and
some of its allies. The dispute is the latest flareup in a running
battle between the administration, which has tried to use American
power and money abroad in operations other than war, and a
Republican-led Congress that increasingly disdains those missions.
This is a little-known and entirely informal process in which

STOCKS DECLINE BROADLY AMID ONGOING RATE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. stock markets suffered another down trading
session Friday as investors became increasingly afraid that the
Federal Reserve plans to raise short-term interest rates through
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the way down, with the Nasdaq composite
index falling 148.31 points, or 4.2 percent, to 3,390.40. But other
indexes were not spared, with the S&AMP;P 500-stock index down 30.26
points, or 2.1 percent, at 1,406.95. The Dow Jones industrial
average finished at 10,626.85, down 150.43 points, or 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for most of May, trading volume Friday, was
light, with investors in no hurry to buy the new economy companies
they craved so ardently earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had shaken off their pessimism earlier with rallies on
Monday and Tuesday in advance of the Federal Reserve's decision to
raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. Bulls
had hoped that Tuesday's increase might mark the Fed's last,
because rate increases slow the economy and can hurt corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But now investors think that the Fed is not done. ``After the
rate hike, there was temporary euphoria. ``People said, `They did
50 basis points; Phew, that's going to be it,''' said Michelle
Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which
manages more than $1 billion. ``Now people are saying that there's
going to be more.''
</P>
<P>
   (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barton Biggs, the global strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and a longtime bear, said he expects more rate increases.
``The cyclical news on inflation is not good. Wage costs are
increasing, and wage costs are sticky, so once they get embedded in
the system, it's not so easy to get them out,'' he said. With
energy prices also increasing, the Fed has no choice but to raise
rates to slow the economy, Biggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are going up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many money managers believe that the biggest
technology companies will have to drop further before they are
reasonably valued compared with both nontechnology companies and
smaller Internet-focused technology names like Ariba and Phone.com.
Last month's selloff brutalized the money-losing companies that
soared to huge valuations in 1999 and early 2000 as investors threw
aside traditional valuation measures. Some of those stocks are down
as much as 80 percent from their highs of March.
</P>
<P>
   But their bigger cousins, like Cisco, Oracle and JDS Uniphase,
have come through the last two months relatively unscathed. At 53
7/16, Cisco is down roughly one-third from its March 27 high of 82.
Oracle has dropped to 70 1/16 from 90, a 22 percent slide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tech leaders are hardly cheap. Both Cisco and Oracle
trade at more than 100 times trailing earnings, almost four times
the valuation of the average S&AMP;P 500 company and a level rarely
seen before the last two years. Now, many professionals think the
rout in the technology sector will not end until even the megacaps
feel significant pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bear market is incomplete in technology stocks and the
Nasdaq,'' Biggs said. ``In this next stage, the big-cap tech
companies that are wonderful companies but very overpriced stocks
are going to get hit.'' He expects the Nasdaq to fall below 3,000,
a drop of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter
and a longtime technology bull, expects the Nasdaq to remain at its
current levels until the fourth quarter of this year, when earnings
at leading technology companies finally begin to catch up with
their stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the smaller ones are getting reasonable, but you look
at a Microsoft or Cisco, and they've come down by half, and they're
still expensive,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murphy does not think the Nasdaq will fall below
3,321.29, its April 14 low, and he advised investors to remain
patient. Demand for technology stocks is stronger than ever, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's supporting the market is earnings. Earnings are just
great,'' Murphy said. ``Internet traffic is still doubling every
100 days. That's a huge driver. Computing is strong, communications
is very strong, and consequently, semiconductors look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Manns, senior portfolio manager at American Express
Asset Management in Minneapolis, said he did not expect to see a
``commitment of capital'' to technology stocks until the Fed
finishes raising short-term rates. ``Investors are nervous,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Manns plans to keep buying technology and
telecommunications. He recently attended a conference of automotive
and industrial companies and found they were spending heavily on
Internet equipment as a way to cut their operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industrial companies are looking at the Internet as a really
concrete way to lower their procurement costs and rationalize
SG&AMP;A,'' Manns said, using a common term for selling, general, and
administrative expenses, or corporate overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the area of growth in the marketplace,'' he said.
``I'm willing to go ahead and buy on the dips.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, individual investors seem to concur. AMG Research,
which tracks purchases and sales of mutual funds, said $7.9 billion
flowed into stock funds for the week ended May 17, including almost
$600 million into technology funds. &QL;

   FUNDS WATCH: Industry Is Cool to Frequent Disclosure
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Co. Institute, the main trade group for the
mutual fund industry, reacted coolly last week to a call for it to
back more frequent mandatory disclosure of fund portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Investment companies are now required to disclose their holdings
twice a year under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations _
a rule that has not changed in more than 60 years. A few funds
voluntarily report more often.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to Matthew Fink, president of the institute, calling
for a committee to study the issue and advocate new rules was
signed by John Rekenthaler, research director of Morningstar Inc.,
the fund data company; Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National
Association of Investment Clubs; and Donald Luskin and H. Davis
Nadig, co-founders of MetaMarkets.com, whose OpenFund reports its
portfolio and trades live over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has generated discussion for many years, and the
institute has considered it with many members on several
occasions,'' Fink told Dow Jones News. ``The current requirement to
disclose portfolio information semiannually remains appropriate.''
Even so, Fink said he would put the issue on the agenda for a
meeting of the institute's rules committee on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement on Kemper Ads
</P>
<P>
   Kemper Distributors was censured and assessed a penalty of
$100,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers last
week because of what the NASD described as inaccuracies in mutual
fund advertisements that continued to appear even after the company
had been asked to stop them. In settling the case, Kemper
Distributors, the sales arm of Kemper Funds, neither admitted nor
denied the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Eight advertisements that appeared The Wall Street Journal,
Barron's and other publications between April and September 1997
overstated the return on a hypothetical $10,000 investment made at
the 1988 inception of the firm's Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity
fund, according to an NASD report. A graph in one of the ads
suggested that such an investment would have been worth $23,000 at
the end of 1991 and $29,000 by the end of 1994; the correct figures
would have been $17,000 in 1991 and $22,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kemper called the errors ``technical
infractions'' and said it had implemented new policies to ensure
that they did not recur.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper was also accused of violating NASD rules in a March 1997
ad that showed a straight line sloping up, with the low end labeled
``you are here'' and the high end marked ``your future is here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The straight upwardly sloping line did not convey the risks of
fluctuating prices inherent in investing,'' the NASD statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months, Kemper has agreed to submit all graphs,
bar charts or pie charts in its advertising to the NASD for review
before use.
</P>
<P>
   DIARY: Britain's Dot-Com Cash Crunch
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the collapse last week of Boo.com, a high-profile
European Internet retailer, a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers
warned that seven of Britain's 28 publicly traded Internet
companies could run out of cash in the next six months, while fewer
than half had enough cash to last through the next 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The study calculated the companies' ``burn rate'' based on their
latest reported balance-sheet cash, gross profits and cash
expenses, and factored in 130 percent annual growth, described as
typical for Internet commerce. No link was found between a
company's burn rate and the performance of its stock.

BELIEFS: NEW REPORT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS

<P>
   The death of distinct Protestant denominations has been, it
appears, greatly exaggerated. For some while, the very notion of
denomination _ Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
Lutherans and so on _ has been viewed as theologically fuzzy and
sociologically doomed.
</P>
<P>
   A denomination, with its own distinctive doctrinal emphases,
modes of worship and forms of organization, does not claim to be
the only legitimate expression of Christianity, although it may
claim to be the best.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the United States, the denominational society par
excellence, Christian denominations have lived side by side without
aspiring to encompass all believers in a territory, as Roman
Catholic, Orthodox or many established national churches have
historically done. And unlike small, intense sectarian movements,
denominations do not consider friendly cooperation with one another
a betrayal of doctrinal purity.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds cozy, maybe too cozy. The boundaries separating
denominations have long grown blurry for many Protestants, who say
that being Methodist or Presbyterian or Baptist does not really
matter to them or, indeed, that they are not sure what it means.
</P>
<P>
   This decline of denominationalism is not really surprising.
Denominations were based, after all, on distinctions of social
class, region, ethnicity and race, along with _ and perhaps more
than _ distinctions of doctrine, practice and polity.
</P>
<P>
   There were unmistakable denominational cultures. Think of
Garrison Keillor's endless reminders of the Lake Wobegon Lutheran
proclivity for the tuna-and-noodle hot dish. Or the stock
portrayals of East Coast Episcopalians, Midwest Methodists or
Southern Baptists in any number of short stories and novels.
</P>
<P>
   Mobility, education, intermarriage and the common, media-borne
culture of entertainment and advertising have all taken their toll
on these differences. From one point of view, this is a good thing.
Denominations were often crucial rungs on the ladder of class and
status. Going from the Baptist Church to the Presbyterian or
Episcopal Church was a sign of upward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1929, a young theologian, H. Richard Niebuhr, made
his reputation with ``The Social Sources of Denominationalism,'' a
landmark study in American religion. For Niebuhr, denominational
divisions represented nothing less than a ``moral failure of
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   So should the disappearance of denominations be counted a moral
success? While no one regrets the fading of denominational
snobbishness, the eclipse of differences that were deeply rooted in
history and theology has often appeared to be less a triumph of
Christian unity than a general ``dumbing down'' of belief and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   That is why a report by Nancy T. Ammerman, a distinguished
sociologist of religion who teaches at Hartford Seminary in
Connecticut, will be considered good news. The glass of
denominationalism is at least half full, she wrote two months ago
in the liberal Protestant weekly The Christian Century.
</P>
<P>
   A study of a wide range of Protestant congregations, she
reported, found that 55 percent of them, ``slightly more among
conservatives, slightly less among liberals,'' considered
themselves ``strong standard-bearers of their denominational
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a striking finding. Denominational identity is generally
related, as one might expect, to the proportion of a congregation's
members who grew up in its tradition, compared with the proportion
who, in the language of sociology of religion, are ``switchers.''
Yet ``Nearly three-quarters of the white Protestant congregations
we studied,'' Ammerman wrote, ``reported that half or more of their
members grew up in another denomination.''
</P>
<P>
   But not even high percentages of switchers have discouraged
congregations that really want to maintain their denominational
identity, Ammerman said. They seemed to be going about it very
consciously, deliberately emphasizing denominational doctrines in
their preaching and religious education, especially for new
members.
</P>
<P>
   A Lutheran pastor near Seattle spoke of an ``unabashedly
Lutheran'' stress on God's grace in his congregation's preaching
and teaching. A Presbyterian pastor did play down ``John Calvin's
doctrine of special providence and _ horror of horrors _ his
doctrine of predestination.'' To stop exploring predestination and
other specifically Calvinist teachings, he said, would amount to no
longer ``understanding what it means to be Presbyterian.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it was not so much specific doctrines as specific
traditions of worship that were the vehicles for carrying
denominational identity. This was particularly true of
Episcopalians and their attachment to the ritual found in the Book
of Common Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It was also true of the evangelical congregations associated
with the recent Vineyard movement, whose pastors display a nearly
de rigueur informality in attire and whose worship is permeated
with its distinctive ``praise music.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual congregations feel free to reconfigure their
denominational identities in ways that might not have been accepted
formerly, Ammerman and her fellow researchers found, but ``for
about half the Protestant congregations, an intentional retrieval
and construction of tradition'' was alive and well, with
denominational identity ``no longer taken for granted, but now
chosen; no longer a matter of enclave and birth, but now a matter
of faith and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those congregations in which distinct denominational
identities are being chosen and nurtured do not seem to be the
worse for it,'' Ammerman wrote. ``Most are vital and growing, and
few, if any, are isolated or hostile to the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the denominationalism Niebuhr feared, they are building
distinctions based more on ritual and doctrine than on social
divisions,'' she concluded. ``Theirs is an experiment in blending
tradition and openness that bears watching.''

<P>
   Just before his wedding in 1985, Mark Lesser priced a honeymoon
in Paris. Even though the dollar was stronger than at any time
since the early 1970s, the trip was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, Lesser, 37, will celebrate his 15th anniversary
with his wife, Stacy, in Paris and Nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how much further the dollar would go,'' said Lesser, now
the sales director of an Internet software company and a resident
of Manalapan, N.J. Fifteen years ago, he said, ``Our income was a
quarter of what it is now, so now is just a good time for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now seems to be a good time for other U.S. travelers, too. Many
are reveling not only in their increased income, but also in their
incredible buying power abroad. The value of the dollar has surged
recently against most of the world's currencies, but especially
against the euro, which 11 European nations introduced as their
common currency in 1999. As the dollar rises, the costs of hotel
rooms, restaurants and related items generally decline for
Americans, making foreign trips enticing.
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission, based in Brussels, expects 12
million Americans to visit Europe this year, a 3.5 percent increase
from last year and the seventh consecutive annual increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen it quite as heavy as this year,'' said Iris
Citron, the president of Creative Travel in Springfield, N.J., and
Lesser's travel agent. There is an ``enormous amount of travel to
Europe by people who in the past would go on inexpensive cruises or
cheaper trips to the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, low air fares and individual feelings of wealth are
driving summer travel plans more than the currency's strength, some
travel agents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very big year for Italy, and Paris is packed,''
said Jackie Rush, vice president at Waters Travel in Washington.
``It's only because we are so affluent here; we are so rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Though travel agents say many of their clients do not realize
what a bargain Europe is, some tourists go on spending sprees when
they see how far their dollars will go. Savvy travelers wait to pay
for hotels until they arrive when they can more easily take
advantage of rates quoted in the local currency instead of buying
travel packages in dollars, said Ralph Ferrara, president of
Schneider Travel, a small agency in Butler, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar generally peaked in 1985, but it has surpassed or
reached the same levels against a few of the 11 currencies that the
euro is replacing. So far this year, the dollar has gained 12.2
percent against the euro. And it is up 16.5 percent since last
summer, making a significant dent in prices in Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   (Until January 2002, when euro bills and coins will begin to
circulate, the individual European currencies are being used for
most purchases, although credit card charges and electronic
payments are calculated in euros.)
</P>
<P>
   Against the Portuguese escudo, the dollar has eclipsed its 1985
level. It is virtually at its 1985 level against the Italian lira
and just below its 1985 peak against the Spanish peseta. And it has
climbed to levels not seen since the summer of 1986 against the
German mark, the French franc and the Dutch guilder.
</P>
<P>
   The euro ended Friday at 89.71 cents, just a bit above its
record low, making the dollar worth 2,158 lire, 185.45 pesetas,
223.45 escudos, 2.18 marks, 7.31 francs and 2.46 guilders.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar is moving higher against other major currencies, too,
though the rally has been smaller. It has risen 11.2 percent
against the British pound since January and is now the strongest
there since the spring of 1994. Against the Canadian dollar, the
U.S. dollar is moving back toward its record high of the summer of
1998. Even against the Japanese yen, it has eked out a small gain
recently, though it remains 27 percent below its most recent high
in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rise of the dollar against the pound has been enough
to cut vacation costs in Britain by 7 percent since last summer, a
trip to Canada will still cost about 1 percent more than last
summer. And a trip to Japan will be a lot more expensive, with the
dollar down more than 9 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of a stronger dollar, of course, is that it
becomes more expensive for others to travel to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Europeans have not cut back significantly on
U.S. travel. According to the latest available data from the U.S.
Commerce Department, tourism from Western Europe grew 5.6 percent
in 1999. It was up 11.9 percent from Spain, 7.5 percent from the
Netherlands, 4.5 percent from France, 4.4 percent from Germany and
2.5 percent from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   And the Commerce Department predicted this week that the growth
would continue as the economic revival in Europe helps offset the
decline in purchasing power from weaker currencies. For this year,
the government forecasts that the number of visitors from the
Netherlands will increase 6.8 percent from a year ago; Spain, 6.6
percent; France, 5.6 percent; Germany, 4.4 percent; and Italy, 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though final figures on U.S. travel for last year are not yet
available, the Commerce Department says the number of Americans
traveling by air to Western Europe jumped 7.4 percent in the first
three months of 1999 from the comparable period a year earlier.
Travel by Americans to all other countries rose 7.7 percent over
that period. Preliminary data for the entire year show that 24.6
million Americans traveled overseas by air, excluding trips to
Mexico and Canada, for a 6.5 percent increase over 1998.
</P>
<P>
   People simply have more money in their pockets, said G. Anna
Schoeman, an agent with Polk Travel in Denver. Only about 20
percent of her clients mention the dollar's power as a factor in
their travel decisions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly inexpensive air fares are more of a motivation than
the strength of the dollar,'' she said. ``When you can go from
Denver to London for $450 or Denver to Paris for $500, the strength
of the dollar might come up after they purchase their ticket, and
maybe even after they arrive in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Laird G. Newman, an analyst with Andersen Consulting, said he
was pleasantly surprised after he arranged an April trip to Italy
through Schoeman. ``We did find that the dollar was at the exchange
rate of 2-1, and we thought, `That's great,''' he said. ``We ended
up doing a lot and spending a lot and thinking how great the dollar
was.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   As Americans spot bargains in foreign goods, U.S.-made products
are becoming more costly to Europeans and others. And some analysts
suspect that the strength of the dollar may be cutting into U.S.
exports. In 1999, total U.S. goods sold to countries in the
European Union rose 1.9 percent, down from gains of 5.9 percent in
1998 and 10.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Given that much of the world is still rebounding from financial
crises in 1997 and 1998, ``The most plausible reason for the
decline is the appreciation of the dollar,'' said Gordon
Richardson, an economist at the National Association of
Manufacturers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But it is too early to see a clear pattern, in part because the
pickup in economies around the world may be hiding the dollar's
effect. Trade data released Friday showed that U.S. exports rose to
record levels in March.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in short-term interest rates this week by the
Federal Reserve has given the dollar yet more support. And the
strength of the U.S. economy is attracting foreign investment,
which also helps bolster the value of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Reserve is intent on slowing the torrid pace of
growth of the U.S. economy. Once signs of slowing appear, the
dollar should begin slipping. That will cut into the buying power
of U.S. travelers. But it may take a real economic slowdown and not
just a slip in the currency to stem the tide abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, the travel agent in Washington, said, ``I don't believe
for one second that the euro going up will slow the flow of
Americans going to Europe.''

WEB SITES OFFER CHEAPER GAS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELINE MAYNARD  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet has changed the ways that people order new cars and
bid on old ones. Now Web entrepreneurs are out to change the way
you fill your gas tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several Web sites are offering services aimed at trimming the
cost of a fill-up _ and just in time, too, since motorists face the
prospect of entering the peak summer travel season with prices 35
cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet broker Priceline.com, known for offering discount
airline tickets and hotel rooms, is opening a gasoline-buying
service that will try to help consumers cut deals for cheaper fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Carclub.com, a Web site operated by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, the
automotive and consumer-product marketing company, is giving
members a 10 percent discount on gasoline through the rest of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies offer discounts to frequent purchasers or
operate Web sites that help consumers find stations in their area
that are selling the cheapest gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline last week
stood at $1.492 a gallon, up 7.2 cents in just the last two weeks.
(In metropolitan New York, the price of a gallon of self-service
unleaded gasoline was $1.60, according to the most recent survey
conducted April 19 by the Automobile Club of New York.) Last year
at this time, the national average was $1.14 a gallon.
Historically, gasoline prices rise in spring and early summer, as
millions of motorists make vacation trips.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Priceline.com will begin mailing blue Gas Cards to
the 1 million people who have already registered on its Web site.
The program is modeled after Priceline.com's WebHouse Club
grocery-buying service, started in November, which lets consumers
name their price for food and dry goods, prepay for the order, then
purchase their selections at a participating supermarket using a
green WebHouse Club card.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline sales will start June 20, said Robert Padgett, a
spokesman for Priceline.com. Gas Card participants will go to
Priceline.com's site and enter a per-gallon bid for unleaded
gasoline in one of three grades: regular, midgrade or premium.
Priceline.com tells consumers to expect discounts of 10 to 20 cents
a gallon off local prices, though an occasional dealer may agree to
a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bid is accepted, customers can prepay for up to 50
gallons of gasoline. They will purchase the fuel with their Gas
Card, either directly at the pump or inside the service station.
The card can be used only at self-service bays. If pump prices fall
below the prepaid level, Priceline.com will give club members a
credit for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Padgett said merchants would be paid the full pump price.
Price-line.com is making up the difference by selling advertising
space on its gas site, the first time it has done so on one of its
sites. The service will be offered free for the first 90 days.
After that, Gas Card members will pay a $3 monthly handling charge.
Padgett could not estimate how many gas stations were participating
in the nationwide service.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power's Carclub.com is also using stored-value cards. Its
Gas MasterCard is sent to each customer who pays a $5.99 monthly
fee. This covers the gas discount and other services, including a
payment of up to $500 for a member's insurance deductible in case
of an accident, advice from a mechanics' hot line and free
directions from its ``Help, I'm Lost'' 24-hour customer assistance
center.
</P>
<P>
   Carclub.com expects 250,000 members by year's end.

A TEST BY WATER FOR THE FLYING HORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The horse of the moment, Fusaichi Pegasus, was
snugged down in his barn at Pimlico Race Course on Friday on the
eve of the Preakness, but one unexpected complication fell on him
and his seven rivals: rain.
</P>
<P>
   The rain was heavy at times, and it was supposed to linger, with
showers predicted on Saturday morning followed by clouds all day
and the temperature on the cool side, in the mid to upper 60s. But
rain or shine, the ``flying horse'' remained the 3-5 favorite to
win the Preakness and to advance to the Belmont Stakes in New York
on June 10 with a chance to win the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness will be run at 5:27 p.m. on Saturday with a purse
of $1 million at a distance of a mile and three-sixteenths.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus, remembered that his
star won the Wood Memorial in New York last month on a rainy track
that was listed as ``wet-fast.'' But his five other races were all
run on fast tracks, and the Pimlico track was fast early Friday
morning when the colt went galloping for Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workout went faster,'' Drysdale said, ``because his
stablemate and workmate went off a little quick. But it was all
right. He came out of it fine.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the eight horses in the Preakness have had much exposure
to rain, although Captain Steve won the Breeders' Futurity at
Keeneland last October on a sloppy track. In the Kentucky Derby,
Captain Steve poked his head in front as the 19 horses headed for
home, but he was bumped by Wheelaway and finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want to see,'' said Bob Baffert, his trainer,
``is for the real Captain Steve to show up and run like I know he
can. I think he moves up on a wet track. He's had only the one race
in the slop, and he won that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Rose, the 88-year-old owner and trainer of Hal's Hope,
who ran 16th in the Kentucky Derby after winning the Florida Derby,
said that his horse was fit and that rain would be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cut he suffered on his right front leg when he stumbled
coming out of the starting gate in the Kentucky Derby is completely
healed,'' Rose said. ``I wouldn't mind if we had rain. He's never
run on an off-track. But he's worked fine in the slop, and his
pedigree says he can handle a wet track.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert visualized four speed horses leading the field around
the track, with four closers stalking them for the critical run
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the horses will run in two tiers,'' he said, ``with
Hugh Hefner, Hal's Hope, High Yield and Snuck In all up close to
the lead. We'll be in the second tier. A lot depends on the track
condition. But I want my rider, Robby Albarado, to put Captain
Steve where he's comfortable. I'd like him to sit and relax, and
make one run.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said that he wants Fusaichi Pegasus to show more speed
in the Preakness than he did in the Derby, when he went from 15th
place on the first turn to take the lead in the homestretch. Once
the speed horses begin to fade, the closers should be moving up,
led by Fusaichi Pegasus, Red Bullet and Impeachment, who are widely
expected to be involved in a late showdown with High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of High Yield, has won the Kentucky
Derby four times, the Preakness five times and the Belmont Stakes
three times. ``I don't think horsemen and some of the public are as
ready to concede the Preakness to Fusaichi Pegasus,'' he said.
``You've got to remember that he has to run in these races. That's
why the Triple Crown is here, and it's so tough. You win one or two
and you think, or hope, that you can go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, and added from long experience, ``But that's why they
run these races.''

CESARE VALLETTI, 77, ITALIAN LYRIC TENOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cesare Valletti, a lyric tenor whose performances were praised
for their refinement and expressivity but who left opera in 1968 to
run a family business that made him wealthy, died on Saturday in
Genoa, Italy. He was 77 and lived in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Price, a friend of the singer, said that Valletti died of
a heart attack in his hotel room during a visit to Genoa, where he
was being treated for liver cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Valletti, who was born in Rome in 1922, studied privately with
Tito Schipa and was widely regarded as one of the last exponents of
the true Italian lyrical style at a time when recordings and
international travel blurred the distinctions between national
styles.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his career, Valletti was renowned for the
coloration and elegance he brought to his portrayals of Alfredo in
Verdi's ``Traviata,'' Pinkerton in Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,''
Ernesto in Donizetti's ``Don Pasquale'' and Almaviva in Rossini's
``Barbiere di Siviglia.'' He also had successes in operas by
Mozart, including Don Ottavio in ``Don Giovanni'' and Idamante in
``Idomeneo,'' as well as in the title role of Massenet's
``Werther.'' Valletti's recordings of most of these roles, as well
as a few recital discs he recorded for RCA, have long been prized
by collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Valletti made his professional debut as Alfredo in Bari, Italy,
in 1947, and within three seasons he had sung in most of the major
Italian houses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Valletti sang in a performance of Rossini's ``Turco in
Italia'' with Maria Callas at the Teatro Eliseo in Rome. He also
made his debut with La Scala during a company visit to Covent
Garden in London the same year. Valletti made his American debut as
Werther at the San Francisco Opera in 1953, followed the same
season by his Metropolitan Opera debut as Don Ottavio.
</P>
<P>
   During his seven seasons at the Met, Valletti sang 80
performances. He was still considered to be in his prime when his
Met career ended after an altercation _ the details of which have
never been disclosed _ with Sir Rudolf Bing, the Met's general
manager, during preparations for a production of Donizetti's
``Elisir d'Amore'' in which he was to sing Nemorino.
</P>
<P>
   Valletti continued to sing primarily in Europe, although one of
his final performances was as Nerone in Monteverdi's
``Incoronazione di Poppea'' at the Caramoor Festival in Katonah,
N.Y., in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, he gave up singing and joined his father-in-law,
Mario Braibanti, in his Milan-based business making pasta machines.
Valletti became the director of the Braibanti company.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nicoletta.

DIRECTORS APOLOGIZE FOR AD THAT ACTORS CALL RACIST AND SEXIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ridley Scott, the director of ``Gladiator,'' the No. 1 movie at
the box office, has apologized for a trade publication
advertisement that has heightened tensions in a three-week-old
actors' strike. The advertisement depicted the bare breasts of a
black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in Shoot, a weekly magazine of the advertising
industry, the advertisement stated that Marcus Nispel, a prominent
director of commercials, was setting up a temporary office in South
Africa _ out of reach of the striking Screen Actors Guild. Nispel
works for RSA U.S.A., a commercial production agency owned by Scott
and his brother, Tony Scott, the director of the movie ``Top Gun''
and the current film ``Where the Money Is.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike against the advertising industry by members of the
Screen Actors Guild, known as SAG, and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists began on May 1. Some 135,000 actors
belong to the unions.
</P>
<P>
   In the advertisement, under the picture of an aging woman's
pendulous breasts, the text read: ``In South Africa, this is what
SAG means.''
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over the advertisement prompted actors and
representatives of the NAACP to protest in front of RSA's offices
in West Hollywood on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Anne-Marie Johnson, a television and film actor who chairs the
equal employment opportunity committee for the screen actors, said
the advertisement showed ``the lengths that certain companies will
go to attract nonunion work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This company felt very comfortable using racism, ageism, and
sexism to promote business and to attract advertisers,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the protest, the Scott brothers apologized for a ``huge
mistake'' by their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew absolutely nothing about this advertisement,'' they
said in a statement, ``and are as upset, sickened and appalled by
this situation as anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson pointed out that the Scotts had waited three days
after the advertisement had appeared to express their regret. ``I
think they apologized too late,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of National Advertisers and the American
Association of Advertising Agencies disavowed the advertisement,
saying it did not represent the industry's views.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Independent Commercial Producers, the largest
trade organization for the television commercial production
industry, blamed the tensions caused by the strike for the
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the association, Matt Miller, said:
``Commercial producers are in a position where they need to work.
We're in a time right now where emotions are running very high.''
</P>
<P>
   The central issue in the strike is how to pay actors for their
work in commercials. The actors want to be paid each time a
commercial is shown on network television and want to extend that
practice to cable television. Advertisers want to replace ``pay for
play'' with a flat one-time-only fee for both network and cable
spots.

ANXIETY ON GENETICALLY ALTERED SEED SPREADS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Not since ``Jack and the Beanstalk'' has a handful of
seeds produced such a loud fe, fi, fo and fumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness spread across Europe on Friday with the news that a
tiny amount of one variety of one seed company's rapeseed
inadvertently contained a trait common in American crops but feared
in Europe because it is produced by genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden is widely believed to have 1,200 acres planted with the
seeds, of which less than 1 percent contain the genetic trait. But
the national Board of Agriculture proposed destroying all those
crops. The board conceded that the plants posed no risks, but said
government permission should have been sought before the seeds were
planted.
</P>
<P>
   The company that imported the seeds, Advanta of the Netherlands,
said it did not know until mid-April that some seeds that it
imported from Canada in 1998 had been accidentally cross-pollinated
by plants with the genetic trait.
</P>
<P>
   In France, which has 1,500 acres with the crop, the environment
minister disagreed with the agriculture minister and demanded that
the French crop be destroyed. The Consumer Affairs Ministry ordered
an inquiry on how the seeds entered the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, with 12,000 acres of crop, the government said it
had no plans to destroy plants. But it was becoming apparent that
the 600 farmers estimated to have bought the seeds were in no rush
to volunteer to have their fields burned. The national farmers'
union said that none of its members had come forward and that it
was considering its legal position.
</P>
<P>
   Private and government scientists said the fears were greatly
exaggerated. Rapeseed is used for canola, an oil used in margarine
and baked goods. Processed oil does not contain DNA and is
indistinguishable from oil from nonmodified plants, the scientists
said. The pressed seeds are used as animal feed. Digestion breaks
down DNA, and the trait in the plant _ herbicide resistance _ could
hardly be transferred to animals.
</P>
<P>
   Rapeseed is related to wild radish and wild turnip. But the
chances of the herbicide resistance entering one of those plants,
surviving for generations in the wild and converting the lowly
turnip into an unkillable superweed poised to devastate British
agriculture are extremely remote, scientists said.

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 230.
WASHINGTON, May 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday passed, 50 to 49, a non-binding
resolution that commends the efforts of last week's Million Mom
March and calls for further action on stalled gun control
legislation by Memorial day. That gun control legislation, which
would require background checks for all gun-show sales, child safty
devices for handguns and a ban on high capacity ammunition
magazines, was passed in the Senate last year but has not been
delivered to the House. Supporters said that in the wake of the
massacre at Columbine High School, the new gun laws are long
overdue. Opponents said the gun control advocates were trying to
force a vote on a divisive issue in an election year. A ``yes''
vote supports the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 53 to 47, a measure to remove a
provision from military spending bill that would set a deadline for
withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. Supporters said setting a
date for removing troops from the area would put them at greater
risk and give Yogoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic the victory
he seeks. Opponents said the U.S. was mired in an endless conflict
and that President Clinton had recklessly placed troops there
without congressional approval in the first place. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2
</P>
<P>
   --- ---
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 250-166, a measure to streamline
the congressional budget approval process by restricting emergency
spending, reviewing entitlement programs, and giving the president
a stronger role in writing spending bills. Supporters said it would
prevent government shut downs and last minute negotiations that
often end up favoring the president's spending priorities.
Opponents said it gave too much power to the president and would
end up creating more problems. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 264-153, a measure that would
require U.S. troops in Kosovo to begin withdrawing by next April
unless NATO allies start taking on a larger share of military
responsibility in the region. Supporters said NATO allies should be
providing more military and financial support for peace-keeping
operations. Opponents said the measure could imperil the peace
process at a critical time. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved a provision to a larger Defense
authorization that allows the government to purchase guns from all
gunmakers, not just those that adopt new safety measures. The
authorization passed 353 to 63. Supporters said they wanted to
prevent the president from circumventing Congress by enacting the
policy. Opponents said eliminating the policy would mean gun makers
have no incentive to make safer guns. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.

 NRA CONVENTION OPENS AMID AIR OF DEFIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ A week after hundreds of thousands of mothers
demonstrated for gun control in the nation's capital, thousands of
gun owners gathered here Friday for the National Rifle
Association's 129th annual convention, vowing to fight new firearms
restrictions and threatening to carry their pro-gun sentiments into
voting booths this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As they tested the heft of 9 mm handguns and checked the scopes
of hunting rifles in a dense forest of display booths on the
convention floor, NRA members time and again expressed the same
sentiments: Stop portraying us as right-wing nuts. Crack down on
criminals, not legal gun owners. And leave us, and our guns, alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a concerted assault on gun owners,''
said Ed Kelleher, 49, a computer systems designer from West
Columbia, S. C. ``We're always being described as crazies. But look
at me. I don't walk around with a gun in my hand and a knife in my
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has been perhaps the best example of a dynamic common to
many special interest organizations: They flourish amid adversity.
Nearly bankrupt and losing members in the mid-1990s, the group says
it has gained nearly a million members, to a record 3.6 million, in
just the past year. Its leaders and members attribute that growth
to the increasing prominence of gun control as a political issue,
from the presidential race on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Clinton has been the best thing to happen to the
NRA,'' said David Sikorsky, 50, an engineer from High Point, N.C.
``And he's been terrific for gun sales. People really think he
would try to take away their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's leaders have done their best to stoke their members'
siege mentalities. The cover of a new NRA magazine, ``America's
First Freedom,'' features a drawing of a politician with Vice
President Al Gore's face and President Clinton's white hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Clinton to the Gore: The Face of Gun Hatred in America,''
the headline beside the drawing reads.
</P>
<P>
   And Charlton Heston, the organization's president, who is
expected to be elected to a third term during the convention,
kicked off the event with a passionate plea to NRA members to make
the November election a referendum on the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year holds the most important political elections in the
history of our country,'' he said in a videotaped message. ``Our
gun rights and the Second Amendment are truly in peril. As the sun
rises on Nov. 8, who's won and who's lost will define the quality
of freedom for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the buoyantly defiant mood of its members, the
NRA also announced plans Friday to open a theme store and
restaurant in Times Square, New York City, which boasts some of the
toughest gun laws in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The ``megastore,'' as Wayne LaPierre, NRA's executive vice
president, called it, would sell a variety of hiking, camping and
other outdoors equipment _ but not guns _ emblazoned with an NRA
logo. It would also have an arcade featuring ``virtual shooting''
games intended to promote target shooting and hunting, LaPierre
said.
</P>
<P>
   A carnival atmosphere enveloped much of the convention, which
NRA officials said is expected to draw 40,000 people over three
days. Inside on the sprawling convention center floor, people
checked out the latest in laser technology, vendors in rawhide
vests and ten-gallon hats hawked replicas of six-shooters and men
wearing camouflage caps fired at computer-simulated pheasants.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the street, members of a gun owners' group called
Grass Roots South Carolina provided a bit of street theater for
Second Amendment true-believers. Before a white banner that said,
``Your Future Under Gun Control,'' four commandos dressed in
military gear and armed with toy assault weapons assaulted a
blindfolded, flag-draped and, needless to say, unarmed, Lady
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   For all its campiness, the performance captured the sentiments
of many people at the convention. Sometimes plaintively, sometimes
angrily, they expressed frustration with what they considered the
relentlessly hostile attitudes of gun-control advocates against gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Many people said that individual gun regulations, on their own,
are often not onerous. But piled one atop another, those
regulations have become burdensome and aggravating, they said. And
most people said they have come to view any new gun restrictions as
a first step toward the outlawing and confiscation of all weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were particularly worried about a central
proposal of the Million Mom March: registering handguns and
licensing handgun owners. Gore has endorsed licensing all new
handgun owners, among an array of other gun regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan on the other side is to put new laws on the books
that aren't enforced so that they can say, `these laws don't
work,'' said Thomas Lovelace, 69, a retired management consultant
from Clifton, Va. ``Then they'll feel justified in confiscating our
guns.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there was a Gore supporter in the place, they weren't
admitting it publicly. Just about everyone interviewed said they
would vote for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee. Bush has been a strong ally of the
NRA in Texas, but recently he has tried to put some distance
between himself and the organization, clearly aware that he needs
to win the votes of some moderate Democrats and independents in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NRA officials say the group will almost certainly throw
its considerable resources behind Bush this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in this crowd, even Bush's strong record of supporting the
NRA was not always considered enough. Kelleher said he thought Bush
would probably allow a gradual erosion of gun-owners' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll vote for Bush, but I won't be that upset if he loses,''
he said. With its convention coming on the heels of the Million Mom
March, and with gun-control advocates trying to cast the proposals
as child safety measures, the NRA was clearly trying to burnish its
image as a family-oriented organization.
</P>
<P>
   A group of adolescent firearms enthusiasts were honored Friday,
and there will be a workshop on women in the NRA on Monday.
LaPierre also used his opening speech to assert that recreational
shooting is a ``friendly, wholesome, family'' sport.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, the vast majority of conventioneers were
white, older men. That said, one of the younger ones, 20-year-old
Matthew Swaim of Robeson, N.C., was clearly in sync with his
elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, only armed people are free,'' he said after
checking out some shiny new pistols at the Smith &AMP; Wesson booth.

&HT;     WHERE TO INVEST IN A RUNAWAY MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATT GRAVES

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ So you think one of these Kentucky Derby also-rans
or one of these over-hyped newcomers can shoot the winged horse out
of the sky? That's certainly the way to bet, because you can't do
much with a 2-5 shot, but is it the right mentality?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, do you bet against the best horse just because
he's a poor investment? A lot of people do, and a lot of people
will Saturday in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the previous three Kentucky Derby winners was nearly
as talented as Fusaichi Pegasus, yet all went on to win the second
leg of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   However, none went off as the betting favorite, and Charismatic
became the longest-priced Kentucky Derby winner ever to take the
Preakness, returning a staggering $18.80 on a $2 win ticket.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we got to the Belmont Stakes, the doubting Thomases,
including yours truly, believed. Charismatic tragically broke down,
but still managed to finish a courageous third as the 8-5 favorite.
</P>
<P>
   We also should pay some attention to recent history, which tells
us the last non-Derby starter to win the Preakness was Deputed
Testamony, way back in 1983. That's a tough nut to crack for the
likes of Red Bullet, Snuck In, and Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an occasional intrusion in the exotic wagers by
Preakness horses who skipped the Derby. Badge, for instance, ran
third at 58-1 last year, and Classic Cat was third at 12-1 the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   But the three years before Classic Cat, the top three finishers
all were Kentucky Derby runners, including 1996, when Louis
Quatorze scored a rare wire-to-wire victory in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, it appears that the only thing that can beat
Fusaichi Pegasus is the unfamiliar and possibly wet track at
Pimlico, or the scant two weeks since his Derby coup.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly expect a good performance by Captain Steve, who was
wiped out by Wheelaway in Kentucky, and High Yield, who simply
hates Churchill Downs. Impeachment benefited from a crazy pace in
Kentucky and passed tired and underbred colts there. Hal's Hope
would be an unlikely turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Of the newcomers, Red Bullet certainly merits serious
consideration, especially with Jerry Bailey riding. His speed
ratings have been climbing steadily, he's had five weeks off, and
he is a son of Unbridled. But let's not forget that Pegasus buried
him in the Wood by 4 1/4 on a wet track _ and we may have a wet
track Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Snuck In and Hugh Hefner are a cut below the rest of the field,
and don't appear to have the speed or staying power to pose a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   We don't expect to match the $66 exacta or the $435 trifecta we
got in the Derby, but what the heck. The picks: Fusaichi Pegasus,
Captain Steve, Red Bullet, High Yield.

 &HT;    The Pastor's wife
 &HT;    By Kim Folstad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is a gleam in Andrea Gardner's blue
eyes _ a glow to her whole face, really _ when she talks about her
husband's recent call to become a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that moment,'' she says. ``I just said. . . wow. I
had to let it sink in for a little while. But I was definitely
supportive of that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, she expects her passion may be subdued at certain
stages along the way. ``I know there are going to be
disappointments, trials,'' Andrea, 35, says. She and her husband
are, after all, very new to this. Boynton Beach Baptist Church just
opened in September, and there's no telling when the pastorate will
become Ron Gardner's full-time job. He was and is a teacher. So is
Andrea.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she says, they've really been preparing for this
ministry all their lives _ albeit unknowingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord will lead. This is his idea, not ours,'' Andrea says
and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He equips the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Ilnisky smiles, too, when she talks about life as a
pastor's wife. But she'll speak plainly about the pressures as well
as the pleasures of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Bill, has been a minister since before they were
married 46 years ago. They have been at Lighthouse Christian Center
International in West Palm Beach for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not for a second'' has she regretted her decision to share his
life's work. ``I've wondered. I've questioned,'' Esther says. ``But
I've never doubted.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are other jobs that aren't so life-altering or
time-consuming. The pay isn't great and the boss is awfully
demanding. And there are always those fawning female fans with whom
men of the cloth _ and their wives _ must contend.
</P>
<P>
   But William Ilnisky promised her an adventure, and she got it.
And she made the best of the situation, developing her interests
within the church and outside of it. She found her own place _
founded her own ministry, in fact, with The Esther Network
International and Children's Global Prayer Movement. She has her
own office at the church, a new book (''Let the Children Pray,''
Regal Books), even a new Web site (www.cgpm.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a personal calling myself to be in God's service,''
Esther says. ``I've complemented my husband's work while at the
same time, he has released me to do what I want, to follow my
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, and the role of the reverend's wife has
evolved. Thank goodness, says Mami Hampton-Kisner.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, is wise to the wishes of church congregations. But
during the four-plus years her husband, Gerald Kisner, has been
pastor of Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church in West Palm Beach,
Mami has managed to find a way to keep everybody pretty happy.
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in the church; her godfather was a preacher. ``I had
seen the commitment pastors' wives make,'' she says. So she knew
what she was getting herself into when Gerald told her that he had
decided to give up his career as a successful attorney to become a
minister. When he gave her some time to consider whether she still
wanted to join him in life's journey, she took more than a month to
rethink his marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, finally, was yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `OK, Lord, if this is the path, let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The path.
</P>
<P>
   It has its share of bumps, says Dale Wolery, a California pastor
and executive director of the Clergy Recovery Network. Wolery and
his wife travel the country offering workshops to clergy couples
who must deal daily with loneliness, stress, low pay and the
pressure to live up to others' high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The main complaint? The pastor is still seen by many as a sort
of superhero _ the collared crusader, if you will. And, too often,
his wife assumes the role of the superhero's unknown assistant,
working diligently to make sure he looks good, the house looks
good, the church runs smoothly and the children behave.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the phone rings, the right reverend flies off to the
rescue _ always with a purpose, usually to great praise. Meanwhile,
his steaming spouse must stand in line behind everybody else vying
for her husband's attention. And unlike other jobs, it's tough to
ask him to say no when the hours get out of hand, Wolery says.
``It's hard to say, `I really need you,' when your husband is
serving God and building a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger and resentment boil below the surface in many ministers'
marriages, he says. And it takes a toll: The divorce rate for U.S.
pastors has risen 65 percent in the past 25 years, while the
overall divorce rate in the United States has been declining since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 survey taken by the Christian journal Leadership found
that 94 percent of ministers feel pressured to have an ideal
family, and 77 percent of their spouses felt pressured to be an
``ideal role model for the Christian family.'' Although more wives
are declaring their independence _ dealing with and delegating
church duties on their own terms _ many still allow themselves to
be overworked and marginalized, Wolery says.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the role of the pastor's spouse is
so often ill-defined, he adds. ``The pastor gets a job description.
His wife doesn't. The pastor goes to his board. Where does the wife
go? Wives don't even have a forum for discussing expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolery agrees with a 1997 survey by the Episcopal Church, which
found that clergy wives who are employed outside the home were
better able to set and maintain boundaries between home and church
than those who aren't. According to the study, working wives still
volunteered in their husband's church activities, but they enjoyed
it more. ``They get a sense of self,'' Wolery says. ``And that
identity helps them navigate the tricky workings of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many churches continue to expect a two-for-one deal: When
they hire a pastor, they count on his wife to serve as music
director or secretary or nursery school supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if she chooses the job,'' Wolery says. ``It's
another if she feels it's been forced on her.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine Esther Ilnisky ever chilling in
someone else's shadow. Now in her 60s, she is a petite and pretty
free spirit, a nationally known force in the growing movement
empowering women of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ilnisky says it's his wife's charisma _ and her
unconventionality _ that makes her so popular with his
congregation. Forget the image of the matronly minister's wife with
her white shoes, white gloves, white hair and pursed lips. Esther
is warm and worldly, she speaks her mind and she loves her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They enjoy it when she's (in church),'' Bill says. ``When she
disagrees with something I say, she lets everybody know it. People
watch for her reaction. She adds some spice to the service in that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the two agree, it wasn't always so. When they were at a
rural church in Indiana, many years ago, Esther struggled with the
expectations of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd have interviewed my wife then, you wouldn't find the
same woman you see now,'' Bill says. ``She would go ballistic.
Sociologically, it was more than she was capable of dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was easier for Esther when they were missionaries in
Jamaica and Beirut, where there weren't as many preconceptions
about what she should or shouldn't do. When they came back to the
United States, she says, ``I didn't know what the rules were for
being a pastor's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she didn't own a proper dress. And though she was
interested in her husband's church, she wasn't prepared to take on
a set of preordained hostessing duties just to keep the members
satisfied. ``I just loved the people. But that wasn't enough for
some,'' Esther says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the missionary mind-set, a broader view. I wasn't
totally engrossed in the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   It took time, but Esther learned to deal with all those watchful
eyes. And, along the way, she and her husband became determined to
make the most of living life in a fishbowl. Instead of trying to
hide Esther's individuality or their need for time together _
particularly when their daughter was small _ the Ilniskys decided
to set an example with a lifestyle that put family first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for some of the women whose husbands are really dug
into their work,'' Esther says. But it's a mistake, she adds, to
expect him to change, and whining only makes things worse. Sure,
she's been known to lose her patience, particularly when the same
person calls again and again, then doesn't heed the counsel her
husband offers. But she understands it's his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a pastor's heart,'' she says, ``He's a coddler, I'm a
pusher.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of feminism. Not from Gardner or Ilnisky or
even the hyphenated Hampton-Kisner. But they all speak about
knowing independence, using their own gifts, and making the role of
pastor's wife fit them instead of trying to squeeze into some dated
two-dimensional image. If they aren't torchbearers for the cause,
they have at least benefited from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, people played fake roles,'' Mami says. ``They
were somber, bland, they wore old clothes. And if that's who you
are, that's fine. But. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   It definitely is not who Mami Hampton-Kisner is. A public
relations and marketing expert, she is outgoing, sophisticated and
busy with her own causes, which range from raising money for
nonprofit organizations such as Hope House to running political
campaigns. Standing on the steps of her husband's church on Eighth
Street, she points to the surrounding neighborhood and talks about
her hopes for the future of the community. This is her outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Loneliness? Resentment? ``He gets home before me, sometimes,''
the fortysomething Mami says and grins. ``I don't sit idle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be allowed to do what they have a passion for,''
Gerald Kisner says. And that goes for both the pastor and his wife.
``We've made it clear that Mrs. Kisner will do what Mrs. Kisner
wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, she's the pastor's wife. But she's also a member of the
congregation,'' he says. And she shouldn't be expected to do
anything more or anything less than others in the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding something she enjoys and making it her contribution to
the church _ that may be the key to happiness as a minister's
spouse, says Janice Hildreth, editor of the online newsletter ``The
Pastors Wife'' (www.pastorswife.com). If she follows her heart,
she's less likely to burn out, Hildreth stresses. And in the long
run, she's going to be of much more help to her husband and his
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The role of a pastor and his wife is to lead the church and to
teach, she says, and, ``If you're doing everything, no one's
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Ilniskys and the Kisners have found members who are
willing to take on the duties traditionally assumed by or assigned
to the pastor's wife. Esther plays the piano and works with the
``praise team'' that performs at each service, but she is not the
star of the show. She's not even the co-star. And when she's away
on business with her own ministry, she says, they certainly can go
on without her.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Mami. Instead of choosing just one church job
_ or trying to do all of them herself _ she says she spreads
herself around, doing a little something with each group. She also
makes a point of sitting in a different pew every Sunday, so she
can get to know all the members. ``My talent is people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She will not, she maintains, take an assigned role just because
``that's what man expects you should do.'' Her concern is what God
wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never seek a way to be a pastor's wife,'' Mami says. ``The
Lord helps me do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, her husband's congregation is established, and there
are plenty of people to share the work. It's not nearly so simple
at a smaller church, and, Hildreth says, the majority of pastors'
wives are dealing with congregations with fewer than 150 members.
Churches such as Boynton Beach Baptist, which had 25 to 30 regulars
at last count, have different needs. ``In a small church, everyone
has to work,'' Hildreth says.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone notices who's not working _ particularly if it's
the pastor's wife.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, ``Miss Andrea'' bids farewell to ``Pastor Gardner''
and takes her three children _ 8-year-old Austin, 5-year-old Amanda
and 2-year-old Avery _ along with the other little ones in the
congregation to children's church.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Gardner used to teach English and drama at Berean
Christian School. Now, she's a full-time mom and she home-schools
Austin and Amanda. Putting together a Sunday school lesson each
week is time-consuming, but she says she doesn't worry about taking
time away from her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave a lot of thought to the kids,'' Andrea says,
acknowledging the pressure that will come with being the pastor's
children. ``God has called them as well as us. They're excited
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she also helps her husband set up every week in the
cafeteria at Crystal Lakes Elementary School _ where the
congregation sits on folding chairs and the sound system must be
tweaked before each sermon _ Andrea spends most of her time with
the children, making crafts and teaching Bible verses.
</P>
<P>
   This is her ``main ministry,'' and one part of being a pastor's
wife for which Andrea believes she is especially well prepared. As
the congregation grows, the politics of pleasing everyone will get
more complicated, she knows. But she intends to stick with what
works for her.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she will play hostess. Of course, she will be her
husband's ``helpmate.'' But, she says, she plans to capitalize on
her God-given talents as she takes on those new duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is not to say, `Oh, I hope I said the right thing to
this woman this week,' '' she says. ``My motive is to please the
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Andrea plans to be a friend to the women who join the
church, and not the overworked martyr or the wrist-rapping
headmistress of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   That's a positive trend many churches are seeing, Hildreth says.
Next to dealing with the expectations they assume the membership
has for them, she's found the most common complaint among
ministers' wives is loneliness and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be a sort of an unwritten rule, passed down from one
pastor's wife to the next, that they weren't to get too close to
other women in the congregation, she says. Clergy spouses were to
ignore the inevitable church gossip, avoid any signs of favoritism
and hold themselves up as a worthy representation of godliness.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the first ladies of the church are learning
that spending time with women with the same interests and
commitment to God is good for them. By getting close and, on
occasion, showing their warts, Hildreth says, they're able to
``show how grace saves.'' And the blessing of never being put on a
pedestal is that you can't fall _ or be pushed _ off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're accepting of everyone, they're accepting of
us,'' Esther says.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it's about finding balance, the pastors and their wives
agree. Yes, the minister's spouse does have to be aware of her
position, and she has to be able to develop a sensitivity to the
people in the pews, Gerald Kisner says. ``There's a certain
graciousness people expect from a pastor's wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But you also have to give the members of the congregation a
little credit, his wife adds. ``They realize how it is. They have
careers too.''
</P>
<P>
   And for every negative, there are is this positive: ``You're
constantly around someone who tries to walk with Jesus,'' Mami
says.
</P>
<P>
   That the walk turned out to be a lifelong mission has been more
blessing than burden, these ministers' wives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a Sunday morning thing,'' Andrea says. ``This
is not just a job and it happens to be in the `religion' category.
This is our whole life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He equips the call,'' she repeats and beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't resent it at all.''

REPORTS TRACE LIVES OF SUSPECTS IN CHURCH BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ Thomas E. Blanton Jr. should not get
claustrophobic in his cell in the Jefferson County jail. At 8 feet
by 10 feet, it is roomier than the ramshackle 5-foot-by-10-foot
trailer in nearby Fultondale where he lived before surrendering
Wednesday on murder charges related to the 1963 bombing of
Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred and fifty miles away, near Payne Springs, Texas,
Bobby Frank Cherry's own trailer, substantially larger and neater
than Blanton's, now sits empty as its former occupant also has
taken up residence in an isolated cell here. Nearby homeowners
cannot fathom how their good-natured neighbor, an avid fisherman
who was always willing to lend a hand with a project, could have
been involved in one of the most heinous crimes of the civil rights
era.
</P>
<P>
   For 37 years, Blanton and Cherry have lived their lives, perhaps
always looking over their shoulders but only rarely concerned that
they would ever be charged with the murders of the four black girls
who died on Sept. 15, 1963. They have been suspects almost since
the beginning, and they have been interviewed and trailed and
reinterviewed over the years as investigators dusted off their
files and made another run.
</P>
<P>
   But until this week, the authorities never seemed to pose much
of a threat to the two old Ku Klux Klansmen, and so they carried
on. They saw the South change around them, or at least much of it.
And they had little choice but to sit and watch as eager young
prosecutors and investigators responded to pressure from black
leaders just as their predecessors had responded to white
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton, a 61-year-old loner, filled his time with a series of
jobs as a security guard in the Birmingham area, one of them at an
upscale subdivision known as Liberty Park. He lost several jobs,
sometimes when word of a new investigation would hit the papers,
and he would grumble that the publicity had cost him a paycheck,
said Wyman S. Lee, himself a former Klansman and a longtime friend
of both men.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton earned a juris doctor degree in 1980 from the
unaccredited Birmingham School of Law, but never passed the bar
exam, blaming that failure on the influence of civil rights figures
in the state bar association, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was charged, Blanton had been working for three
years as a sales associate for a Wal-Mart store in suburban Hoover,
just south of Birmingham. A Wal-Mart spokesman said he worked in
sporting goods, where the shelves are stocked with shotguns,
hunting knives and fishing lures. This week he was suspended
without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry, 69, who now has heart disease and diabetes, moved to
Texas in the 1970s shortly after Bill Baxley, Alabama's attorney
general at the time, reopened the investigation into the church
bombing. That inquiry resulted in the murder conviction of Robert
Chambliss, the presumed ringleader and the only man previously
charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the trail ran dry and Baxley left office before he could
pursue indictments against Blanton, Cherry and Herman Cash, the
three other men named as suspects in early FBI files. Cash died in
1994, and Chambliss died in prison in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry has worked as a welder, carpet cleaner and truck driver.
He reportedly has married five times and fathered 15 children, and
his estrangement from some members of his family is at least partly
responsible for his current problems. Several relatives and former
relatives, including an ex-wife and a granddaughter, have said they
told a grand jury that Cherry had boasted about playing a role in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember him bragging about it once or twice,'' said
Teresa Stacy, Cherry's 24-year-old granddaughter, who spoke in a
telephone interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Willadean Brogdon, who was married to Cherry from 1970 to 1972,
said that Cherry pointed out the church to her once. ``He said that
was the place he had bombed,'' she said, also in a telephone
interview on Thursday. As their marriage deteriorated, Brogdon
said, Cherry would threaten her: ``He used to tell me if I ever
talked, the same thing would happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement of Brogdon and Stacy echoes that of Chambliss'
wife and niece, both of whom played a role in providing information
to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss' niece, Elizabeth Cobbs, testified at his 1977 trial
that on the day before the explosion he had pointed to a newspaper
story about school desegregation and said: ``You just wait until
after Sunday morning and they will beg us to let them segregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were indicted on Tuesday by a state grand
jury after a nearly four-year reinvestigation, conducted primarily
by the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office here. They turned
themselves in to authorities on Wednesday and are now in jail
without bond. Through their lawyers, both have proclaimed their
innocence, as they have since first being identified as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton has long been suspected of using his two-tone 1957
Chevrolet, with a Confederate flag flying from the antenna, to
drive the three other men to the church, where they planted the
bomb on the night before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here on Wednesday, Doug Jones, the U.S.
attorney, and David Barber, the Jefferson County district attorney,
declined to discuss what roles they believe the two men played and
what evidence they would present.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, all four suspects in the bombing were
members of Eastview Klavern No. 13 of the United Klans of America.
Neither Blanton nor Cherry had ever been prosecuted for any
race-related crime. But FBI files from the original investigations,
which are now archived at Birmingham's public library, characterize
both as rabid racists of the head-knocking variety.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton is the son of Thomas Blanton Sr., known as ``Pops,'' one
of Birmingham's most notorious white racists. The FBI files state
that he was born in Washington, had a 10th-grade education, and
served as an aircraft mechanic in the Navy from 1956 to 1959. He is
divorced and has one daughter, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The files include an account of an interview with a woman who
said she was riding with Blanton in the early 1960s when he veered
toward a black man who was crossing the street. The man dived out
of the way and narrowly missed being hit, the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Eddy, a former state investigator who spent years on the
bombing case, said in an interview that Blanton would go into
grocery-store parking lots and put some sort of acid on the seats
of black people's cars so it would burn their skin when they sat
down.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry grew up in Mineral Springs, Ala., had an eighth-grade
education, and served in the Marine Corps from 1957 to 1959,
according to the FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   While Blanton's voice is rarely heard in the files, Cherry comes
off as vociferously unrepentant. One report states that he
``admitted to agents firing his rifle at Negroes outside his house
within the past two months.'' When investigators asked him about
the Aug. 20, 1963, bombing of a black civil rights leader's house,
he ``recalled saying to himself, `I hope it killed him.'''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Baxley, the former attorney general, said in an interview that
Cherry was ``a bully and a total liar.'' Blanton, he said, was ``a
little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad was so bad,'' Baxley said. ``The worst racist in this
city was Chambliss, but the runner-up was Pops Blanton.'' Baxley
said he felt ``a twinge of sympathy'' for the younger Blanton,
because with the racism he learned from his father, ``how else are
you going to turn out?''
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, Blanton asked Lee if he could put his tiny
trailer on Lee's one-acre plot behind a cement plant in Fultondale.
Lee, who lives in his own trailer on the land, is a plumber, and
the lot is strewn with junk cars and broken toilets. Lee said that
Blanton's trailer has no running water or plumbing. Blanton stores
belongings in a decrepit Dodge station wagon parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Though they live only yards from each other, Lee said he does
not see Blanton often. ``He comes and goes,'' Lee said, adding that
Blanton sometimes stays with his daughter. ``He stays to hisself,
pretty quiet, and never makes any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry had been living with his latest wife, Myrtle, amid
winding roads and thickly forested hills in Esquire Estates, a
rambling collection of mobile homes just outside Payne Springs,
Texas. Their large blue trailer, with a wooden porch and a few
attached outbuildings, is neatly kept with potted plants hanging
from the porch rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors described Cherry as helpful and friendly. ``When I got
sick with cancer, he and his grandson came over and replaced all
the carpet in my living room,'' said William K. Turner, who has
lived next door for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two men enjoyed drinking coffee together on the porch in the
mornings. ``In all that time I never heard him talk about racial
stuff or politics,'' Turner said. ``He said one time that he used
to be involved in politics, but that was all he said.'' He added:
``I don't know if I'll ever see him again.''

SHUTTLE ATLANTIS BEGINS MISSION TO SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ After a dawn liftoff Friday, the shuttle
Atlantis sped toward the uninhabited international space station,
finally successful in a fourth attempt to begin an urgent repair
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Thundering from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Atlantis climbed
steeply into a moonlit Florida sky, kicking off a two-day pursuit
of the orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The seven astronauts were on course to rendezvous with the
station late Saturday, and were to dock just before midnight CDT.
</P>
<P>
   High winds at the shuttle's emergency runways in Florida, Spain
and Morocco thwarted three attempts to begin the planned 10-day
mission late last month. Wind problems for another rocket earlier
this week bumped the fourth attempt by the shuttle another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way,'' cheered Atlantis commander Jim Halsell as
the mission's fortunes finally changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew plans to deliver more than a ton of supplies
and equipment to the station, including four large storage
batteries for the faltering Russian power system; electronic gear
to repair a wavering American communications system; and enough
fuel to gently boost the altitude of the slowly sinking outpost by
nearly 27 miles with the shuttle's steering jets.
</P>
<P>
   All of the work is intended to prepare the orbital facility for
the overdue arrival of the Russian crew module in July and of the
first resident crew of astronauts and cosmonauts in November.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Halsell are pilot Scott ``Doc'' Horowitz, mission
specialists Jeff Williams, Jim Voss, Mary Ellen Weber, Susan Helms
and Yuri Usachev, a Russian cosmonaut.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a 42-year-old Army officer and the crew's only rookie,
is scheduled to join Voss, a 51-year-old former Army aviator, late
Sunday for a near seven-hour spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   During the excursion, the two men plan to re-secure a wobbly
American cargo crane on the exterior of the station and continue
the assembly of a similar Russian cargo transport device.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Russian space agencies started what was to be a
six-year orbital assembly effort for the station in late 1998 by
coupling a Russian-built power, propulsion and guidance module
called Zarya with Unity, an American-made hub equipped to receive
future components.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two compartments form a 77-foot-long passageway
intended to interconnect future crew quarters, life-support
systems, laboratory modules for scientific research and solar-power
generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the first pair of modules were joined, Russia's crew
module was to follow in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   That appointment came and went as a new roadblock arose. Russia
experienced back-to-back failures of its normally reliable Proton,
the rocket that is to launch the crew module into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the two coupled components have been inactive since
June. At that time, a shuttle crew dropped off hundreds of pounds
of supplies for future resident astronauts and cosmonauts.
</P>
<P>
   As the delay in the crew module grew, the Zarya module's
half-dozen power storage batteries began to falter.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a temporary increase in solar activity has caused
wisps of the Earth's atmosphere to balloon higher in altitude. The
frictional drag of the blooming atmosphere is causing the orbital
outpost to descend between one and two miles each week.
</P>
<P>
   Both the impaired power system and the loss of altitude are of
concern to NASA, which serves as the managing partner for the
16-nation station assembly project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battery situation has the priority. Reboost is important,
but we are at a point where we want to get the electrical system
totally up and running,'' said NASA's Robert Cabana, the station
program's manager of international operations.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum of three batteries must function to ensure a crew
module linkup.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial boost in altitude from the shuttle will also
conserve fuel aboard the station.
</P>
<P>
   While inside the station, the shuttle crew will also install new
fire extinguishers, replace 10 smoke detectors and install new air
circulation fans in the Russian segment. They will leave exercise
and computer equipment, clothing and water for future resident
crews.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, six U.S. and Russian station construction missions
are scheduled through December, a doubling of all previous
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The project's global backers envision the fully assembled
station as a state-of-the art orbiting science laboratory for
cooperative research in a range of scientific disciplines,
including physics, biology and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the Atlantis crew into orbit on Friday was a
replica of the Olympic torch. The symbolic torch and a flag to
commemorate the competition will be delivered to Sydney, Australia,
site of the 2000 Summer Games, after the shuttle returns to Earth. &QL;

U.S. SENATOR BLOCKS U.S. PAYMENTS TO U.N. FOR PEACEKEEPING
MISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican senator has singlehandedly blocked the
United States from paying $368 million that it owes the United
Nations for four difficult peacekeeping missions, infuriating the
Clinton administration and some of its allies.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is the latest skirmish in a running battle between
an administration that has used American power and money abroad in
operations short of war and a Republican-led Congress that disdains
many of those missions.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, has used his power as
chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee to stop the
State Department from transferring the money _ already approved by
Congress _ to the United Nations for missions in Congo, East Timor,
Kosovo and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said unless the money was released, the
United Nations' ability to undertake such missions, already frayed,
might break down. The forces may lack gasoline and electricity in
Kosovo, face difficult delays in their imminent and potentially
dangerous Congo mission and go unpaid in Sierra Leone, U.N. and
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg objects most strongly to the Sierra Leone operation. He
said in an interview he would not lift his block until the
situation there had changed. ``I'm not going to pay for a policy
that's unethical and, as it turns out, barbaric,'' Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a peace agreement signed in July by the
combatants in Sierra Leone's eight-year-old civil war. The accord
gave amnesty and a share of power to rebels who had terrorized
civilians, murdering, raping and mutilating thousands. The rebels,
whose leader, Foday Sankoh, was arrested this week in Sierra Leone,
have held hostage hundreds of U.N. soldiers sent to try to stop the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, like many of his Republican colleagues in Congress, has a
low opinion of peacekeeping in particular and President Clinton's
foreign policies in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think this administration has been engaged in a
coherent way,'' he said. ``They have made very bad decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the subcommittee that governs the State Department
budget, Gregg can block money for foreign policy without hearings,
debate or votes.
</P>
<P>
   That power is ``unique to appropriations chairmen,'' Gregg said.
He has refused to let the department transfer hundreds of millions
of dollars to help pay for the four operations that he finds
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   He placed a hold on $96 million for the Sierra Leone force; $181
million for East Timor, where U.N. troops are trying to maintain
order on a island ravaged by forces that oppose the newly won
independence from Indonesia; $50 million for Kosovo, where the
troops policing towns and cities to halt ethnic conflict; and $41
million for Congo, where soldiers are starting to set up a system
to monitor a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The under secretary general for peacekeeping operations at the
United Nations, Bernard Miyet, said the United States' refusal to
pay for the Sierra Leone mission was felt directly by third world
nations that have sent troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the countries involved are poor countries making human
and financial sacrifices,'' Miyet said. ``The burden for Sierra
Leone falls on India, Bangladesh, Jordan, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and
Guinea, all countries in dire need of money. There have been
difficulties in certain African countries,'' because the forces
have not been paid on time.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet and several administration officials said the lack of
money in Congo might slow the creation of communications networks,
a system to control air traffic, improved roads and livable
barracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo,'' Miyet said, ``we might have difficulty paying our
personnel, in particular the 3,700 policemen'' who are trying to
maintain law and order. Administration officials also said the
Kosovo mission faced logistical problems like paying for gasoline
and electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And in Timor,'' he added, ``we might have difficulty
reimbursing countries'' that have provided the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The under secretary-general for management, Joseph Connor, said
the United Nations owed $800 million to troops on peacekeeping
missions in the last 10 years. ``Many member states are saying,
`Don't call us until you're ready to send the check,''' Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now owes the United Nations $1.77 billion.
Most of that bill is for peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is supposed to pay at least 25 percent of the
peacekeeping costs. It now owes the United Nations $1.3 billion for
past and present missions, Connor said. The bill has been
increasing since Jan. 1, largely as a consequence of Gregg's block,
he said. The United States also owes $468 million in membership
dues, Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United
Nations, traveled to Africa this month as part of a Security
Council delegation that paved the way for the Congo mission to
begin. He declined a request for an interview Friday. Other
administration officials said they were angry and embarrassed about
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really throws a spanner in the works,'' one said. ``When
the U.N. sees the U.S. Congress is reluctant to pay the bills, they
are less inclined to go along with U.S. leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official said, ``It undermines the
capacity of the U.N. to do its job and undermines our credibility
to argue that we are serious about enhancing the peacekeeping
ability of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials were loath to criticize Gregg, fearing that he
would block more money or cut the State Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Holt, a member of the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee for 27 years, called the system that let a single member
block spending that the entire Congress had appropriated a scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has no basis in law or Senate rules or history,'' Holt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Law and tradition dictate that if an administration deviates in
its spending from the program it presented to Congress, it has to
report the changes to the appropriations committees. But ``this
morphed into a system in which members and staff can object and the
gutless wonders downtown don't dare disagree,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whom Gregg strongly supported in
the New Hampshire presidential primary, has not addressed blocking
the peacekeeping money, said Condoleeza Rice, Bush's chief foreign
policy adviser. ``Obviously,'' Rice said, ``the administration has
some very hard work to do with Congress over the peacekeeping
issue.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TRAINERS SEEK A HOPE TO EMERGE, IN THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ If there is one thing that unites all racing people,
it is the fervent prayer that their stagnant industry will develop
a great four-legged hope, a Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky of the
equine set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to see a horse on the cover of Time
magazine,'' said Joe Orseno, the trainer of Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   But the trainers do not necessarily want that great horse to
emerge at their expense in Saturday's Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' reminded Bob Baffert, the trainer of Captain Steve,
``a $1 million race.''
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be won out there Saturday afternoon, and the
seven rival trainers have all tried to think of reasons why
Fusaichi Pegasus might not be the first Triple Crown winner since
Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   They are already coping with the great burst of energy from
Fusaichi Pegasus in the stretch run at the Kentucky Derby. Racing
has not felt that power since Secretariat flew home in the 1973
Belmont, or so it seems in a sport burdened with nostalgia and the
inroads made by other forms of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trainers would like to think the horse is, after all,
only human.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he ran a good Derby, but so did 125 other horses,''
said D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of High Yield, recalling the
previous Derby winners, including his own in 1999. ``Charismatic
ran a good Derby, too, but people said it was a fluke. The fact is
he won.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas seemed to be working himself into a theory that any Derby
winner is, by definition, a great horse until proven otherwise.
High Yield's vantage point is from 15th place in the Derby, not
even close enough to have heard the thunder from Fusaichi Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for Lukas to bad-mouth the Derby winner, since he had
entered the bidding for him in the yearling sales, willing to go
close to $2 million. Then he spotted Fusao Sekiguchi, the
flamboyant Japanese entrepreneur, double-jumping the bids in
increments of $200,000 at a time, and he realized, ``He was in it
till the bell rang,'' which it did at $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are no secrets about this horse. Now the seven brave
trainers try to become the man who shot Liberty Valance. Nobody
remembers the name of the good guy in the epic western, only the
epic gunslinger who was shot down.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Derby win was pretty special,'' Baffert said of Fusaichi
Pegasus, ``but Kent Desormeaux never had to throttle him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The jockey won the Derby essentially by letting Fusaichi Pegasus
do what comes naturally to him. So the trainers focus on the colt's
reputation for skittishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He runs and he stops, he runs and he stops,'' said Orseno,
talking about the six-segment workout on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Neil would like to get him a good workout,'' Orseno
added, noting how Neil Drysdale, the trainer, has kept the colt in
relative seclusion on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven other Preakness horses are subject to close
inspections by reporters, photographers, camera crews, other owners
and trainers, assorted friends and hangers-on, tourists and gaggles
of schoolchildren, Fusaichi Pegasus remains in isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil knows what he's doing,'' Orseno conceded. ``But there is
a mental part to racing. The horse has been on a van, a ramp, a
plane, takeoff and landing. It's not normal for a horse to do it,
although they do it. That's how they get here. But it's not normal.
Then coming out here to race in front of 100,000 people could mess
with his mind _ not that horses have too big of a mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the point. The horse mainly knows that once in a
while they let him out in the open, where he can run. Generally, he
makes the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard somebody say that the horse is 3-5 to win _ but 5-2 to
get in the gate,'' Orseno said, somewhat hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that the handlers managed to get Fusaichi
Pegasus into the starting gate in Kentucky two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man among boys,'' Baffert admitted. ``If he runs like that
again, we're all in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win, I hope he does,'' Baffert added, not needing
to note that it would mean his dear friend Lukas _ they call each
other Lukas and Baffert _ would not win.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've had plenty of good horses that stubbed their toes,''
Baffert concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers searched for obstacles for Fusaichi Pegasus. Mud is
a great equalizer. Horses can be thrown off by small fields. The
colt may not bounce back after only two weeks of rest. The name is
difficult to pronounce. He has been having a nervous breakdown in
private in the backstretch. You never know.
</P>
<P>
   They look for hope. They don't sound very convincing, but they
try.  &QL;

   &QL;  WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 230.
WASHINGTON, May 19 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday passed, 50 to 49, a non-binding
resolution that commends the efforts of last week's Million Mom
March and calls for further action on stalled gun control
legislation by Memorial day. That gun control legislation, which
would require background checks for all gun-show sales, child safty
devices for handguns and a ban on high capacity ammunition
magazines, was passed in the Senate last year but has not been
delivered to the House. Supporters said that in the wake of the
massacre at Columbine High School, the new gun laws are long
overdue. Opponents said the gun control advocates were trying to
force a vote on a divisive issue in an election year. A ``yes''
vote supports the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 53 to 47, a measure to remove a
provision from military spending bill that would set a deadline for
withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. Supporters said setting a
date for removing troops from the area would put them at greater
risk and give Yogoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic the victory
he seeks. Opponents said the U.S. was mired in an endless conflict
and that President Clinton had recklessly placed troops there
without congressional approval in the first place. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: BUDGET
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 250-166, a measure to streamline
the congressional budget approval process by restricting emergency
spending, reviewing entitlement programs, and giving the president
a stronger role in writing spending bills. Supporters said it would
prevent government shut downs and last minute negotiations that
often end up favoring the president's spending priorities.
Opponents said it gave too much power to the president and would
end up creating more problems. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 264-153, a measure that would
require U.S. troops in Kosovo to begin withdrawing by next April
unless NATO allies start taking on a larger share of military
responsibility in the region. Supporters said NATO allies should be
providing more military and financial support for peace-keeping
operations. Opponents said the measure could imperil the peace
process at a critical time. A ``yes'' vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: GUNS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved a provision to a larger Defense
authorization that allows the government to purchase guns from all
gunmakers, not just those that adopt new safety measures. The
authorization passed 353 to 63. Supporters said they wanted to
prevent the president from circumventing Congress by enacting the
policy. Opponents said eliminating the policy would mean gun makers
have no incentive to make safer guns. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.

REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS PREPARE FOR GIULIANI'S REPLACEMENT IN SENATE
RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state Republicans rushed Friday to ensure
that the party could still mount a serious challenge to Hillary
Rodham Clinton following New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
protracted exit from the Senate contest, rallying around the
candidacy of a little-known Long Island representative as they
contemplated a race whose every dynamic was altered in the space of
a single afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gov. George Pataki, party leaders in New York and
Washington embraced the candidacy of Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, proclaiming him an articulate and telegenic challenger to
Clinton. Lazio declared his candidacy in an e-mail to news
organizations as soon as Giuliani announced his withdrawal, and
moved to assemble a campaign staff, led by Michael Murphy, the
media consultant to John McCain's presidential campaign. And Pataki
said in an interview that he would personally assist Lazio in the
formidable task of raising money for his contest with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a political atmosphere that verged from carnival to chaos
throughout the day, there were sharply different assessments from
Republicans and Democrats about how Lazio (assuming that he wins
his party's support at the convention on May 30) would fare in a
contest against Clinton. But it was undisputed that this second-act
cast change would produce a profoundly different kind of race than
would have been presented by Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a battle between two celebrities _ candidates
about whom almost every New Yorker had fixed and often intense
opinions _ is now shaping up as a contest between a famous first
lady and a congressman who is barely known outside Suffolk County.
And what had been a competition between two people with fairly
similar views on issues that tend to be determinative in New York,
among them abortion and gun control, is now between two candidates
who occupy starkly different places on the ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans like Pataki, who was never particularly happy
with Giuliani in the first place, Lazio, he said, represented a
fresh and unencumbered challenger to Clinton. Pataki described
Lazio as a four-term member of Congress whose record could appeal
to moderate New Yorkers, an attractive television presence, and a
valuable base smack in the heart of the New York suburbs. Perhaps
even more significant, Lazio is not the polarizing figure that
Giuliani was, robbing Clinton of one of the advantages she enjoyed
in her contest with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki _ who was once an unknown state senator from Peekskill,
bringing what many people viewed in 1994 as a far-fetched challenge
to Mario Cuomo _ chuckled at the notion that Lazio would be hurt by
his obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be a very strong candidate,'' Pataki said in the
interview. ``We will have a very good philosophical debate on
issues, with two candidates with competing philosophies. There are
no questions in my mind that the overwhelming majority of New
Yorkers will agree with Rick Lazio and not with Mrs. Clinton. Not
to mention that Rick Lazio is a New Yorker. He is one of us. He
doesn't have to learn what it is to be a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, Lazio was an untested and barely known candidate
with a conservative voting record, faced with the formidable task
of getting a full-fledged campaign organization financed and
running, and getting himself known to New Yorkers. And Clinton's
aides moved to define Lazio to New Yorkers before he could. They
noted that he favored a ban on late-term abortion and voted for
much of the Contract With America as they invoked his affiliation
with Newt Gingrich, the departed House speaker, and reprised a
tried and trued line of attack in New York, most recently in
Charles Schumer's successful challenge to Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani, for whatever vulnerabilities he had, did present a
problem for us in terms of having a relatively good record on
issues like abortion, gun control and the environment,'' Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview. ``Now New
Yorkers will have a very clear distinction. He is a genuinely
conservative candidate. It's a fundamentally different race.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Rick Lazio is a clean slate that remains to be
written on. Hillary Clinton has the resources to do it.''

<P>
   EL CEIBAL, Guatemala _ The distant roar of howler monkeys echoed
like a ghastly dirge on a recent day in the smoldering remains of a
thick forest of palms, cedar and mahogany. Illegal loggers had cut
down the best trees and hauled them off at night, while
land-starved peasants torched what remained to clear the land for
cornfields.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of a population boom here has been disturbingly
visible during the peak of the dry season in April and May, with
the area's natural beauty shrouded in smoke from countless fires.
</P>
<P>
   Although El Ceibal is a national park that is home to Mayan
ruins, it is protected only on paper. The fires were set by
invasores, or squatters, more than 200 of whom have lived in the
park in two settlements of thatched-roof shacks since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of an unending internal migration to Guatemala's
Peten region, which covers a third of the country. It includes the
sprawling, environmentally sensitive jungles of the Maya Biosphere
Reserve, which is rich with wildlife, thick clusters of trees and
majestic temples. The area's population is estimated to have grown
from 20,000 in 1960 to almost a half million today _ not all
illegal, but nonetheless harmful.
</P>
<P>
   The fires, by and large, are set; some are from slash-and-burn
farming gone awry, and others are touched off by poachers who hunt
armadillos and large rodents by smoking them out of burrows and
hollow logs. Some are even believed to be set by poor peasants who
hope that the local authorities will hire them to help the
understaffed local fire brigades.
</P>
<P>
   The migration, with its accompanying fires and deforestation,
underscores the problems facing Guatemala as it emerges from 36
years of civil war, ending in 1996. Peasants, including thousands
who returned after years of exile in Mexico, scramble to find a
patch of land they can farm. In their struggle for
self-preservation, conservation is forgotten. And the government
lacks money and manpower to fight all the fires, much less arrest
wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peten has served for the last 20 years as a pressure
valve,'' said Roan McNab, the Guatemala program director for the
Wildlife Conservation Society. ``How can Guatemala prioritize
conservation in the face of overwhelming pressure? When you're
hungry for tomorrow, it's impossible to think 20 years down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early April, fires have raged not only in El Ceibal, but
also in several larger parks inside the reserve, scaring off or
killing wildlife. The Guatemalan government mobilized soldiers and
authorized $400,000 to fight the fires all over the country, a
small amount for damage that is expected to extend to 125,000
acres, if rains do not start soon. But the aid has been slow to get
to the hardest-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Mexico have lent helicopters to help spot
the fires and to bring water and food to park workers who have been
battling the flames, snatching a few hours of fitful sleep on palm
fronds spread on the jungle floor.
</P>
<P>
   While the blazes can be battled, if slowly, it has proved more
difficult to stem the flood of people who see the Peten as the
promised land. It is a deceptive vision of lush land, since the
thin layer of humus is unsuitable for agriculture. Settlers burn
trees and bushes to enrich the ground with nutrients, which makes
the land arable for three years at most before they have to clear
new land.
</P>
<P>
   Peten natives used to earn a living by carefully managing the
forests, tapping the sap from chicle trees for export to chewing
gum manufacturers or plucking the leaves of xate palms to be used
overseas in floral arrangements. The area's remoteness was its best
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But in the western part of the reserve, where oil production has
been allowed, squatters followed the roads built to carry oil,
carving out settlements when they could not find work in the oil
fields.
</P>
<P>
   Neria Virginia Guerrero Pinelo, who grew up in the central
Peten, remembers how, as a child, she saw planes before she ever
saw a car. When a road was built from Guatemala City in the 1960s,
the transformation for the worse began. The situation deteriorated
further during that era as the government encouraged development
through an agency essentially run by the military that cleared land
for farms and cattle ranches.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, native Peteneros are in the minority, squeezed
out by migrants from the south who bundle their belongings into
pickup trucks and head to the Peten like later-day Okies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the Peten is a paradise, and they hear the land is
so rich,'' she said. ``They come looking for work, but there is no
work, so they take a little piece of land for a cornfield. There
are large groups that go in, and they begin to cut trees and
burn.''
</P>
<P>
   Some squatters, desperate for money, have been enlisted by
illegal loggers who give them chain saws to cut down trees, then
use them as security guards, having dozens ride on the trucks with
their illegal bounty, ready to confront any authority who would try
to stop them. In several recent instances, policemen or park
workers were reported killed or tortured by squatters working for
the loggers.
</P>
<P>
   In El Ceibal, the squatters do not bother to hide. Their houses
line the road into the park. The buzz of chain saws is common, said
park workers, who, fearing attack, try to avoid the squatters. A
few months ago, the squatters stole the solar panel that powered
the park's only phone to prevent the administrator from calling the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, while workers were trying to clear areas with machetes
to contain a fire, the squatters were right behind them putting
fresh wood on the fire, park workers said. There have also been
scattered incidents of squatters stealing Mayan artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they finish with the wood, they will throw themselves
into excavating the ruins, because that will be all that is left
for them to destroy,'' said William Perlas Pineda, El Ceibal's
caretaker.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation has been difficult to promote. When Guatemala
established the National Council for Protected Areas, peasants were
angered that someone would interfere with their ability to use the
land as they saw fit. Most regard the idea of protected lands as
something foisted on them by groups from the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say we are protecting land for the gringos, while we
Guatemalans have a right to land,'' said Marie Claire Paiz, the
administrator of the Sierra del Lacanadon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Paiz said the peace accords' reference to every Guatemalan's
right to land has been broadly interpreted. ``Public land is seen
as nobody's land,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally new is the idea of enforcing the country's environmental
laws, considered the best in Central America. Park workers and the
police grouse that when they talk to squatters about their illegal
land use, they are quickly told that to remove them would be a
violation of their human rights. There is also fear that forcing
the squatters to move would be denounced as mistreatment of
indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been working with some international groups
to sort out a quagmire of land titles, and it started a program
this year of low-interest loans to acquire land. Officials have
also enlisted international conservation groups to negotiate with
the squatters to relocate them outside of environmentally sensitive
areas. The Peten governor is trying to find land in a nearby town
to resettle the El Ceibal squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some positive examples of such moving, but
very few,'' said Goran Fejic, director of the United Nations'
mission monitoring the peace accords in Peten. ``You need a
long-term strategy of social development.''
</P>
<P>
   While some people fault the government for a lack of political
will to address the problems, some initiatives are seen as a
hopeful sign. The government has been granting 25-year land
concessions to some communities, letting them live off the area's
above-ground resources as long as they come up with management and
business plans. The village of Uaxactun has the largest such
concession, more than 200,000 acres. Run by a local assembly
assisted by outside advisers, the concession has developed plans to
sell allspice, xate palm and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   To keep squatters out, Uaxactun has been made accessible only by
passing through the guarded gates of Tikal National Park, to the
south. Anyone wishing to move into the village must be approved by
the entire community, though no one has yet to get the nod.
Recently, a family whose carelessness led to a fire's getting out
of control was expelled. But residents worry that the government
may allow oil exploration nearby, which would mean more roads and
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people look at this with an eye to destruction,'' said
Julio Cesar Corado, the vice president of the assembly. ``Our plan
is to manage and conserve this. Our area is rich, but we are not
trying to get rich. We are only looking for equality among the
members of our assembly, human rights, health and schools for our
children.''

 &HT;    Giuliani ends his senate race
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Dream Political Match-Up succumbed to cold, hard
reality Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ending weeks of speculation, New York City's embattled Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani announced he was dropping out of the U.S. Senate
race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, aides and supporters packed into a
conference room at City Hall, Giuliani settled the question of his
immediate political future, although much about his personal and
professional life clearly remains in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the right time for me to run for public office,''
said Giuliani, who seemed uncharacteristically reflective and even
gentle at times, occasionally ``shooshing'' overeager reporters
like a bemused parent. ``It's not . . . the right priority for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics isn't as important as I thought it was,'' continued
Giuliani, who had been under increasing pressure to make a decision
to give the Republican Party a fighting chance against the
well-known, well-financed first lady. ``I used to make many of my
decisions in the last 10 years around politics and I'm going to
make them differently in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The past three weeks had been uncharacteristically unsettling
for the often hardnosed mayor, known for vanquishing real and
perceived enemies ranging from Times Square porn purveyors to
thoughtless jaywalkers. Just days after revealing late last month
that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, the mayor stunned
reporters by announcing he was seeking a legal separation from his
second wife _ apparently without telling her first. That followed
soon after his admission of a relationship with a ``very good''
female friend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Giuliani said his public agonizing over whether to
stay in the super-stakes, high-profile race against Mrs. Clinton,
and his decision to back out, was almost completely due to his
health. Namely, it was his indecision over how best to fight the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself unable to really make the treatment decision
yet, even though I've been over and over it,'' said Giuliani. ``The
decision on whether to run had me almost in the same position,
which has never really happened to me. I've always been able to
make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   No such hesitancy plagued Republican congressman Rick Lazio, who
immediately issued a short statement announcing his intention of
entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   Another New York congressman, Peter King, also had signaled his
desire to run if Giuliani dropped out, although Lazio appears to be
the choice of Gov. George Pataki and other leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Republican convention will be May 30 in
Buffalo and the influential Pataki reportedly will endorse Lazio as
early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Giuliani's announcement, Mrs. Clinton paused
briefly during a campaign appearance, telling reporters she had
already telephoned Giuliani to wish him well. She refused to
speculate about possible replacement opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of time to talk about the issues and to
compare and contrast the issues between me and anyone else,'' said
Mrs. Clinton, who was nominated as the Democrats' candidate at
their state convention Tuesday. ``I think today we all ought to
just wish the mayor the best and let him know the people of the
city are behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent poll of New York voters conducted by Quinnipiac
College, Mrs. Clinton led Lazio by nearly 20 points in what was
then a hypothetical match-up. A 42-year-old fourth-term congressman
from suburban Sussex County, Lazio trails the first lady in name
recognition and, perhaps more importantly, in money.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have estimated it will take each party's candidate about
$25 million to compete for the seat being relinquished by retiring
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has raised more than $12 million, while Lazio had
only raised about $3.5 million before Pataki persuaded him last
August to defer the Republican nomination to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   And while the mayor had raised more than $19 million for his run
against Mrs. Clinton, only $2,000 of it could go to Lazio under
federal campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio carries little of Giuliani's political baggage,
particularly among women and minorities in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of voters in New York City who hate Rudy
Giuliani,'' New York magazine political columnist Michael Tomasky
told CNN. ``I can't think of any voters in New York City who hate
Rick Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the married, Catholic, suburban congressman may be in a
position to exploit Mrs. Clinton's perceived weaknesses in ways
Giuliani couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to say, `I'm a New Yorker. I was born here and I
live here. I'm one of you,' '' said CNN political analyst Bill
Schneider. ``That's going to be the Lazio message.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that was Lazio's message when he spoke briefly to
reporters a few hours after Giuliani's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been my lifelong home,'' Lazio said, adding that he
would have ``much more'' to say about his campaign in the next few
days. ``This is the state I've represented in the House of
Representatives for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was first elected to Congress in 1994 as part of the
controversial freshman class that was fiercely loyal to then-House
speaker Newt Gingrich. Many political observers predicted Friday
that the first lady's campaign would attempt to paint him as a
right-wing extremist, in contrast to the more liberal Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of New Yorkers don't like the Republican Congress,''
said CNN's Schneider, pointing out that Lazio voted to impeach
President Clinton, something that might prove particularly damaging
to him in the New York metropolitan area. ``You can bet the first
thing the Clinton campaign will do is paint Rick Lazio as a loyal
lieutenant in the Gingrich Congress that went after her husband.''

SECOND HALF OF $363 MILLION LOTTERY IS CLAIMED  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A brewer and his family collected their half of the
$363 million Big Game lottery jackpot here Friday, after waiting
nearly two weeks to identify themselves as one of two winners of
the largest lottery prize ever awarded in America.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kainz, 64, and his wife, Sue, 62, of Tower Lakes, a
northwest suburb of Chicago, accepted their winnings Friday with
their three sons and daughter-in-law. The other winner, the owner
of a swimming pool company from suburban Detroit, stepped forward
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kainz family owns and operates a small brewery and a medical
supply company in the Chicago suburbs. The Kainzes, along with
their sons, Michael, 34, Patrick, 29, and John, 26, and Michael's
wife, Jennifer, 29, had pooled money to buy 50 $1 tickets for the
May 9 drawing. They opted to take their money in a lump sum, worth
about $61 million after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kainz, a regular lottery player, had purchased the tickets while
stopping by a service station in the nearby suburb of Mount
Prospect, to buy gas. The winning number was on the third line of
the fifth ticket he matched against the numbers printed in a
newspaper on the day after the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stomach retreated to the lower portion of my body,'' he
said, when he realized that he had won. He and his wife immediately
locked the ticket in a safe deposit box at a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kainz Friday compared his family to that of the other prize
winner, Larry Ross, 47, whose children also work for the family
business. Ross also took his prize in a lump sum payment of about
$61 million, after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine weeks leading up to the winning drawing, 565 million
tickets were sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia the seven states that participate
in the Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   Kainz said he and his wife had no intention of retiring, but
instead would use some of their money to improve their businesses,
including the Wild Onion Brewing Co., which Kainz said is on
schedule to ``just break even'' this year. They will also replace
the leaky roof on their home and travel to Ireland and France, and
they said they planned to give away a lot of the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win something of this size _ I mean this is sheer
luck, any one of you could have won this,'' Kainz said, ``you've
got an obligation. Certainly we will be considering the many, many
things we can do for humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members said they had had difficulty keeping their win a
secret, especially once officials revealed that the ticket had been
sold locally. Kainz had a particularly difficult time when, on a
visit to her dentist, he jokingly asked if ``she had picked up her
lottery winnings yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly bit off his hand,'' Kainz said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple went to Sweeney's Oil the day after the drawing, when
it was announced that the ticket had been sold there. They were
even approached by a television reporter, but declined to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have known they were winners all along, and have enjoyed
watching what has been going on,'' said Lori Montana, an Illinois
Lottery official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to put any of you through any anguish,'' Kainz
told reporters, adding that he was trying to protect his family's
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Kainz was also standing in the crowd when lottery officials
awarded a $1.8 million commission check to John Sweeney, owner of
the station that sold the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick and John Kainz, who are both single, joked that they
would probably be hearing from many of their old girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   But John Kainz had this message for them: ``Too bad, suckers.''

FLORIDA COURT RULES AGAINST IMPACT FEES FOR RETIREMENT
COMMUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Fla.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the
developer of a retirement community does not have to pay fees
imposed by the county to defray the cost of school construction.
</P>
<P>
   Many communities across the country have imposed such one-time
assessments, called impact fees, so that developments help pay for
the additional services they require.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen Florida counties use the fees to raise about $71.4
million a year for new schools, according to the state's School
Finance Construction Commission. State officials estimate that
about $3 billion is needed annually for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Aberdeen, a
mobile home community in Ormond Beach, 40 miles north of Orlando,
that prohibits children and requires residents to be 55 or older,
did not have to pay the fees because it would not require any more
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Volusia School District, of which Aberdeen is a part, must
now pay back $90,000 in fees and interest to the retirement
community. Aberdeen sued the school district in 1997, and a lower
court judge ruled earlier this year that Aberdeen residents did not
have to pay the fees.
</P>
<P>
   The case has generated interest nationally among home builders,
who have objected to impact fees for schools, utilities, roads and
other services. In Florida, those fees add $4,000 to $5,000 to the
cost of a new home, and Keith Hetrick, a lawyer representing the
Florida Home Builders Association, said that ``prices people out of
the market.''.
</P>
<P>
   California has the highest impact fees. In the Silicon Valley,
they can add as much as $30,000 to the cost of a new home, Hetrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Shackford, a spokesman for the National Association of Home
Builders in Washington, said impact fees are an ``unfair burden''
for first-time buyers because they pay for services and facilities
that benefit the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   Shackford said many states no longer impose such school
construction fees on housing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling will have a critical financial impact on school
districts that currently impose school impact fees,'' said Dick
Graham, a lawyer representing the Volusia School District, ``and
all other counties and school districts that may find the need to
impose a school impact fee as a means of raising funds for new
school construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards
Association, said counties have had doubts about the reliability of
the fees for several years. This case may lead to eliminating them
altogether, he said. ``For counties, they are going to have to look
at every project that goes up in the future,'' Blanton said, ``and
gauge whether it genuinely generates students.''
</P>
<P>
   Hetrick said Aberdeen residents would still have to pay property
taxes to the school district. ``People would like to think that
impact fees are not taxes, but they are,'' Hetrick said. ``They
have been sold to the public that these fees will solve our
problems, but they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hall, superintendent of the school district, said the
ruling separates the community. ``It allows a community of adults,
basically, not to have anything to do with children,'' Hall said.
``That's potentially disastrous in this democratic society.''

CNN SET TO DOMINATE CONVENTION COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone up for 264 hours of convention coverage  &UR; a day &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   The number may sound highly improbable, given that a political
convention lasts only four days. (Or 96 hours, if no one sleeps.)
But 264 hours is the amount of daily exposure that one television
network, CNN, has told Republican officials it will supply for
their presidential nominating convention, which starts July 31 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's estimate _ made viable by the cable network's growing
array of 24-hour news outlets, ranging from CNN International to
CNN En Espanol to CNNfn, all of which will simultaneously carry
convention programming _ was disclosed to the Republican National
Convention as part of CNN's pitch for space in the hall of the
First Union Center in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of other television networks, both cable and
over-the-air, snicker at the grandiosity of CNN's saturation
claims. ``Over here, there are still only 24 hours in the day,''
said a publicity agent for a competing outlet. But CNN officials,
who are aggressively seeking the title of ``network of record'' for
the 2000 campaign, say there are few events in a democratic society
of greater importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could it be overkill when we're talking about the fate of
this country and who we're electing?'' asked Gail Evans, a CNN
executive vice president. ``People love the drama of politics, and
this is the moment when the campaign becomes real.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the network's plan is a reflection of the rapidly
changing nature of convention coverage. As the traditional
over-the-air networks scale back their coverage, with some
promising only an hour of prime-time convention news each night,
cable networks and Web sites are stepping into the void with
wall-to-wall plans. As a result, the physical presence of the news
operations at the convention is changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican convention, to
be held from July 31 to Aug. 3, said that political Internet sites,
a marginal presence at the 1996 convention in San Diego, will be
represented in vastly greater numbers this year: 55 booths have
been set aside for Web sites in a building adjacent to the First
Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   And the allotment of skybooths reflects a changing pecking
order: CNN and NBC (in combination with its cable sibling, MSNBC)
will each be allocated five skybooths, Fitzpatrick said; CBS and
Fox get four each and ABC two, though that network will also create
a virtual skybooth inside the hall and have its anchor, Peter
Jennings, positioned at various places in the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new ballgame this year,'' said Steve Scully,
political editor of C-Span, which will offer gavel-to-gavel
convention coverage and even broadcast from the parties' platform
hearings this summer. ``It's the clear pattern of cable taking over
what was once the domain of ABC, NBC and CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the old-line networks say that the evolution of the
conventions into veritable four-day-long commercials, with little
major breaking news to offer besides the selection of a
vice-presidential candidate, justifies the reduced coverage in
commercial prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And even if the number of hours are fewer, our reporting and
analysis are every bit as strong as they've ever been,'' said Marc
Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC News. ``And
in fact, more people will watch ABC in the somewhat limited hours
ABC is providing than will see convention news elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Because viewership remains so much higher on the commercial
networks, it is not clear whether the blanket coverage on the cable
networks will make up the difference in the size of the viewing
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's any way to add up the audiences of
cable and C-Span and us, and whether that measures up to what the
commercial presence once was,'' said Lester M. Crystal, executive
producer of ``The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' which is producing
PBS' gavel-to-gavel convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Crystal added that there had been no talk at PBS about
reducing its commitment. ``We think there is an important story to
evaluate here, how these parties try and represent what the country
wants, what the country needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 16,000 journalists are expected to cover the Republican
convention, Fitzpatrick said. (The Democrats meet Aug. 14-17 in Los
Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   CNN alone will have about 500 staff members in Philadelphia,
said Jane Maxwell, CNN's senior vice president for special events.
The network's personnel will feed programming to CNN's various
networks, which now total 14. These include an airport network, a
service to 800 affiliated stations around the world and video
streaming to a dozen Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the conglomeration of services under the CNN umbrella,
there is the opportunity to do convention programming that many
hours a day,'' Maxwell said, referring to the proposed 264 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from the network's presence at its first
convention, the 1980 Democratic gathering in New York City, where
it had a single booth high in the hall above those of the other
networks. ``It wasn't even glassed in,'' Maxwell said. ``So every
time the band struck up, the anchors couldn't talk.''

BUSH TELLS OF PLAN TO BOOST SENIOR CITIZEN VOLUNTEERISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PADUCAH, Ky. _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush on Friday unveiled a
$290 million federal plan to boost senior citizen volunteerism by
paying more of their expenses and rewarding some of the most devout
volunteers with $1,000 trust funds for their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In the McCracken County Senior Center, where 350 elderly
citizens donate about 70,000 hours a year to help others, Bush said
he would target low-income seniors with his initiative. Many have
time and wisdom to share and more of them will be available to
volunteer as the baby boom generation ages, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Over five years, Bush's plan would add $240 million to existing
senior volunteer programs and $50 million to a new initiative. Bush
said a lack of money for training leaves many would-be volunteers
idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's older Americans are the healthiest, the most energetic
and best educated generation of seniors in our nation's history,''
Bush told his bipartisan audience. ``You all are daily blessings to
this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also offered assurances that his plans to make fundamental
changes in Social Security were no threat to seniors. Vice
President Al Gore has assailed Bush's plans as too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this clear to everybody in this room that when
I become the president, nobody is going to mess with your benefits
in Social Security. This Social Security system will be safe, will
be strong and will be secure, and in this campaign, I'm not going
to let any Washington, D.C., politician scare you into thinking
otherwise,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   To promote volunteerism, Bush said he would ask Congress to
boost funding for the federal Senior Corps, a 27-year-old
public-private partnership that includes programs for foster
grandparents, senior companions for the homebound and mentoring of
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals as president will be to increase the
opportunities for seniors to volunteer, to tap that reservoir of
good will and experience and wisdom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, my administration will seek more funds for Senior
Corps, from $183 million to $250 million over a five-year period of
time. This increase of funding will allow for an additional 250,000
senior Americans to serve as volunteers under Senior Corps
programs,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many senior centers like this one in Paducah will be able to
expand their activities,'' he said. The remark drew the biggest
applause of the day for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also disclosed his intention to create ``Silver
Scholarships'' to spur volunteerism by older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``A low-income senior who volunteers 500 hours will be eligible
for a $1,000 scholarship, which they can deposit into an education
savings account for their own children or grandchildren or another
needy child in their neighborhood,'' Bush explained.
</P>
<P>
   In his one-day swing through Western Kentucky in a tour bus,
Bush also dropped in on the lunch crowd at the busy Woodshed Pit
Bar-B-Que Restaurant in Hopkinsville, where Gore supporters greeted
him with signs saying ``Hands Off Social Security'' and ``Bush,
you've got a gambling problem.''
</P>
<P>
   They were reacting to Bush's proposal to modify Social Security
rules to allow workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Later he visited the Chevy Corvette assembly plant in Bowling
Green, where he greeted unionized workers and plant managers and
drove a car about 50 feet off the end of the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   In a new wrinkle to his grinding travel regimen, Bush's charter
jet dropped him off in Waco, Texas, so he could go straight to his
ranch in nearby Crawford. His jet and entourage continued to
Austin, the state capital. Bush returns to the campaign trail
Monday through Wednesday, traveling to Washington, D.C., Ohio and
Michigan.

AFTER A VICTORY, ETHIOPIA LOOKS TOWARD OTHER FRONTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARENTU, Eritrea _ It took three days for Ethiopian troops to
battle their way into this town, and now that they have it, they
are pressing deeper into Eritrea, denying with every step that they
plan any long-term invasion of their neighbor and once-tight ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intentions, no plans, no need to occupy Eritrea,''
an Ethiopian commander, Col. Gabre Kidane, said Friday night as he
stood on the old Italian fortress in this hilly town 45 miles
inside Eritrea. ``The only intention we have is to weaken the
forces that have occupied our country and to regain our
sovereignty. That is all.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after Ethiopia started an offensive that it says is aimed
at ending the two-year-old war, it is now clear that the whole of
Eritrea could become a battlefield. With hundreds of thousands of
civilians fleeing the region, Kidane said Ethiopian soldiers
continued to skirmish with Eritrean soldiers on the run here in
western Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Ethiopian officials said planes bombed the main
Eritrean military training center at Sawa, an American-built base
100 miles west of Asmara, the capital. The officials also said they
had taken a village, Maidema, 30 miles from Asmara, on the way from
the western front to the central front along the disputed border.
That is where the next round of fighting, already heavy, is
generally expected.
</P>
<P>
   For Eritrea, Ethiopia's rapid advance out of the border trenches
into the countryside is not merely a military setback. For 30
years, when Eritrea was the northernmost province of Ethiopia,
rebels fought two successive governments in Addis Ababa for their
independence. Those rebels, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front,
now are in power in Eritrea, and they say this advance is a
frightening continuation of Ethiopia's attempts at domination.
</P>
<P>
   An Eritrean government statement said Friday that a bombing on
Thursday south of the port of Massawa killed a civilian. That
death, the statement said, was ``further evidence of Ethiopia's
resurgent aim to annex this country and, in so doing, to make
targets of Eritrea's civilian populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said the target was a military installation.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that the leaders of Ethiopia fought side by side
with the Eritreans to oust the military government of Mengistu
Haile Mariam in 1991. For the first few years, the two governments
were close friends, so close that they never demarcated the border
when Eritrea became independent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions grew over personality clashes and economic rivalry,
exploding in May 1998 when Eritrea claimed the Badme border region
based on old colonial maps. Eritrea moved troops into the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said it was invaded, and a war ignited that has defied
long peace talks and claimed tens of thousands of lives on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ethiopia began its offensive last Friday, the fighting had
been confined to three fronts along the 620-mile border. But since
then, Ethiopia has pressed 65 miles into Eritrea, displacing
340,000 people, the World Food Program said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in neighboring Sudan said Friday that an additional
50,000 Eritreans had fled across their border. In both places,
relief officials said, people lack food and shelter. Even without
the war, the United Nations says 800,000 Eritreans face food
shortages because of drought.
</P>
<P>
   Most civilians fled from around this town, the regional capital
and a strategically important point because the area was a main
supply route for Eritrea's westernmost front.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been intense. Starting on Monday, Kidane said,
Ethiopian troops had pounded areas around the town with bombs,
tanks and artillery and then engaged Eritrean troops along a
mountain pass eight miles from town.
</P>
<P>
   Along the heavily mined road from the south, the route of
Ethiopia's advance, huge numbers of empty mortar shells, captured
Eritrean ammunition and destroyed trucks from both sides remain. At
spots, the smell of rotting corpses was strong. Kidane would not
give the number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Ethiopian troops took the town, the biggest
one that they have captured, and called it a major victory. The
Eritreans said they had staged a tactical withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, Ethiopian troops milled around and ate their
rations at the hilltop building that was once a fortress for
Italian troops in the colonial period and that, until Thursday,
according to the Ethiopians, was the command center for Eritrean
troops in the region. The Ethiopians joked about marching on to
Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to take the place of the invading army,'' said an
Ethiopian soldier, Seife Yechenku, 21, who has fought in the army
since the war began. ``There is no question I am very happy.''

ANTI-VIRUS COMPANIES WARN OF NEW ROGUE PROGRAM'S DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anti-virus software companies on Friday warned of potential
damage from a new computer program circulating on the Internet,
similar to but more malicious than the one that disrupted computer
systems around the world earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the new program's ability to evade most of the
current anti-virus software, there were no confirmed reports of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-virus companies said they had received reports of the
program from the United States, Europe and Israel after it emerged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh said late Friday afternoon
that it had received no independent confirmation of infections by
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-virus companies downgraded the threat of the new
program Friday afternoon after warning that it was a high risk
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday morning that the FBI had
opened an investigation into ``a new, more destructive variant'' of
the rogue program that circulated worldwide early this month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Vatis, director of the National Infrastructure
Protection Center of the FBI, said at the same briefing his agency
had received reports suggesting that more than 1,000 computers had
been infected. He did not cite the source of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-virus software experts said that despite the similarities
between the new program and the earlier one _ which was borne as an
attachment to e-mail with the heading ``I Love You'' _ the new one
appeared to have been written by a more experienced professional
programmer and had been designed to thwart detection by anti-virus
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is this was written by an English-speaking
programmer, because of some of the variable naming conventions
inside the program,'' said Roger Thompson, technical director of
ICSA Labs, a research firm based in Reston, Va. The new program,
which researchers have named VBS/NewLove.A Worm, exploits the
Microsoft Outlook e-mail program to send itself to each person in
the program's address book.
</P>
<P>
   The program does several things to avoid automatic detection,
Thompson said. This capability has led researchers to define the
new program as polymorphic _ a type of software designed to escape
detection by popular anti-virus programs.
</P>
<P>
   The NewLove program searches the Windows operating system to
find the name of a recent document and then takes the name of that
document. It also places the phrase ``FW:'' and the document name
in the subject heading of the electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the program constantly changes its length by altering
the number of lines of code it is made up of, an effort to escape
discovery by anti-virus software that uses file size as a detection
signature. In all cases, the program, written in the Visual Basic
language, appends the extension .vbs to each document name.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, many corporate computer managers took precautions to
stop the transmission of the program by simply closing their
networks to electronic mail with Visual Basic attachments.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is more destructive than the earlier one,
Thompson said, because after mailing itself from a victim's
computer, it systematically overwrites files not in use on all of
the disk drives attached to the target computer.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, data on an infected computer and attached network disk
drives will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Several computer security experts said the new program
highlighted the shortcomings of much of the industry's commercial
anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the technology used to guard against viruses was
developed for a pre-Internet computer world where malicious
programs were largely spread via floppy disks at a much slower
rate. Today instantaneous communication via the Net has meant that
the virus detection software is quickly outraced by malicious worm
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call for people,'' said David Kroll, a
director at Finjan Software Inc., a computer security firm in San
Jose, Calif. ``The reactive database models of the anti-virus
software industry can never keep up with these new worms.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers said that operating systems vendors like
Microsoft should shoulder more of the responsibility for protecting
users against malicious software code. Last week, after many
computer users complained about their system's vulnerability,
Microsoft modified some security features of its Outlook program to
make it more difficult for computer users to be victimized by such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly some and perhaps the majority of responsibility lies
with the operating system vendor,'' said Eugene Spafford, a
computer scientist at Purdue University. ``Why do we have operating
system vendors saying its a user problem and trying to absolve
themselves of the responsibility?''

RE-ENVISIONING GRADUATE EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 21, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Graduation day! Bachelors of arts and of science have begun
streaming out into the world to find their place in it. In terms of
our shared economic future, however, the graduates who are most
interesting are those completing, not their 16th year of formal
education, but their 21st, 22nd, 23d year in school _ in other
words, the PhDs.
</P>
<P>
   In this high-tech age, to a greater extent than ever before,
PhDs have become the people who make the future, inasmuch as they
create the new knowledge upon which economic growth depends. Now
the system that makes the PhDs is changing faster than ever, too,
thanks to technology.
</P>
<P>
   What could be done to improve it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on who you ask. After all, graduate education
is an industry of remarkable complexity.
</P>
<P>
   There are the research intensive universities; the rest of the
higher education system, including liberal arts and community
colleges; and the K-12 schools that prepare the young. There are
the doctoral students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are government agencies that subsidize the students,
businesses, and agencies that recruit them; the disciplinary
societies and educational associations (the American Chemical
Society, for example) that exist to strengthen professional
cohesion among them; and the foundations, which foment change.
</P>
<P>
   That is why 150 high-powered educators and technocrats
representing these eight core constituencies gathered in Seattle
last month at the invitation of the Pew Charitable Trusts and the
University of Washington for a conference on ``Re-envisioning the
PhD.''
</P>
<P>
   After three days of hashing over the matter in ways designed to
produce the greatest possible consensus, Jody Nyquist, director of
the university's Center for Instructional Development and Research
and the principal organizer of the conference, said, ``It's a good
start. There's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, almost everyone realizes that competition is at the
heart of the success of the US system of doctoral education. The
creation of the land-grant universities in 1862 ranks as one of the
most inspired acts of public policy in US history. The monopoly of
the old schools and the East Coast was broken; soon the Ivy League
was running hard to remain on top.
</P>
<P>
   But laissez-faire is not necessarily an all-or-nothing
proposition. Robert Weisbuch, president of the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation, told the gathering in Seattle, ``It
isn't about tearing down this loose structure but about making it
stronger, most particularly through asking it to see and understand
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   If the conference identified a single overarching problem, it
had to do with the lack of information in the system. Lots of
students go to graduate school without even knowing how long it
will take, never mind their job prospects when they are done. Their
choice many be informed by nothing more substantial than the latest
ranking of graduate departments in US News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Freeman, a Harvard economics professor, told the meeting
that when he assigned a graduate student to apply to the leading
programs in science and engineering, he found that information
about the distribution of salaries of graduates was virtually
impossible to obtain. Business schools and law schools routinely
furnish the information on first or second request but PhD programs
profess ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   This will change. Charlotte Kuh, executive director of the
Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel of the National
Research Council, told the meeting that the new NRC rankings of
university departments, due in 2005, would weigh factors other than
research dollars and reputations. By eliciting information about
the satisfaction and success of recent graduates, the NRC ranking
would give a much clearer picture of differences among graduate
departments.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Web-based bulletin boards, such as Tomorrow's
Professor, maintained by Stanford University's learning laboratory,
The Next Wave (for scientists), at PhDs.org (for engineers), help
fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Better information may also increase the pressure on
universities to come up with a shorter, more intensive PhD. Perhaps
the most successful curriculum reform was to standardize medical
training as a four-year postgraduate degree, with specialty
training to follow. Why not try to compress the learning required
to master physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, or computer
science to four or five years _ with postdocs specializing in
research, teaching, or industrial work, according to their
interests?
</P>
<P>
   No suggestion was heard more frequently than that the pattern of
funding graduate students be changed to give more money to students
in the form of portable scholarships. Currently professors control
most of the federal subsidies to higher education through their
administration of large research grants. Student must focus on the
topics the professors want to cover. The result: newly minted PhDs
with exceedingly narrow research interests who, according to
industrial research managers, require immediate retraining before
they're ready to work.
</P>
<P>
   Another gripe: New scientists are ill-prepared to talk to those
outside their immediate fields. Chemists are at ease only with
other chemists, not with molecular biologists or process engineers.
A taste for interdisciplinary work needs to be built into graduate
work. So does a taste for diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals talk about the reform of graduate education the
way the rest of us talk about the weather. Not so the
techno-politically-connected ``re-envisioning'' caucus. Their next
step is to seek a national task force to review opportunities for
reform in the Age of the Web. Look for the drumbeat to grow.

SAVORING PEDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have seen a lot more than we have, and their collective
advice is to sit back and enjoy. Hurricane Pedro is something
special to be savored. To get a better idea of the greatness of
Pedro Martinez, we spoke with a group of former players and
managers who span the last 50 years of Major League Baseball, in
both the American and National Leagues. Carl Yastrzemski, Jim
Lonborg, Dick Radatz, Joe Morgan, and Sam Mele have seen the best
of the best in the last half-century, and they feel Martinez is at
the top of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzemski: ``Pedro has as many ways to get a hitter out as any
pitcher I've ever seen. I thought (Bob) Gibson, (Sandy) Koufax,
(Ron) Guidry, (Denny) McLain were the best I've faced. Koufax had
the fastball, curveball. Gibson had the fastball, slider. Pedro has
five different pitches. Gibson and Koufax were power pitchers.
Everything was hard. Pedro has the power, but has the off-speed
stuff they didn't have. Gibson and Koufax came right at you. Pedro
can do that, and then get you out with finesse. He's a tremendous
finesse pitcher. The most important thing about pitching is
control. The thing that makes the greatest difference in pitching
is the ability to throw with all of that power to great spots. When
Guidry was going good for the Yankees, he had terrific control. He
could set you up with pitches to tough spots and then get you out
with a rising fastball just out of the strike zone. McLain never
missed a spot. Of the guys I have mentioned, McLain is the most
like Pedro. He had power, he had finesse. It would be impossible to
be better than Pedro is right know. The hitters don't have much of
a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonborg: ``I was thinking the other day . . . Have I seen anyone
better than what Pedro has been the last couple of years? I thought
about what (Orel) Hershiser did when he threw all of those
scoreless innings. That was the epitomy of consistency, throwing
all those innings, shutout after shutout. What Pedro is doing now
is phenomenal. I love the fire he pitches with. That incident (in
Cleveland for which he was suspended) didn't bother him. He came
back pumped, with fire in his heart. I like his aggressiveness. He
goes right after the hitters. Koufax was the best pitcher I ever
saw. He was dominant when he was at his best. I couldn't believe
Gibson could throw as hard as he did with such great control. With
Pedro, a hitter can never feel comfortable. He can work all parts
of the plate. In and out. Up and down with such great command of
his pitches, that it is impossible to feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sox manager Morgan: ``Right now, Pedro is as good as
anyone who has ever pitched. He's got the speed, the stuff, and the
best straight change I have ever seen. If you are lucky enough to
get your bat on the changeup, you just run down to first base and
take a right turn. Pedro is a lot like Juan Marichal. They both had
many ways to get a hitter out. Marichal threw five different
pitches from five different angles. You never knew what to expect.
You couldn't guess with him. Most guys just have two pitches, so
you could guess what was coming and get lucky once in awhile. You
couldn't do that with Marichal, and you can't do that with Pedro.
Gibson was the most intimidating pitcher I've ever seen. He was
devastating. I loved two lefthanders, (Warren) Spahn and Johnny
Podres. Spahn had unbelievable control. He didn't throw that hard,
but he had a great screwball, and that's the one he would set you
up for. I swear he would throw two fastballs and make sure they
were balls, and then when you thought he had to come with another
one, he threw that screwball and he had you on a ground ball.
Podres was very underrated. Great fastball. Great straight change.
I loved the straight change. It's a dynamite pitch. I don't know
why more guys don't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mele: ``Pedro has it all, and I like the way he pitches with
such great flair. He is sort of like Gibson in that way. They both
would look at you after they struck you out as if to say `You
really didn't think you were going to hit me, did you?' I don't
care what you have for stuff, you have to have control to be a
great pitcher. The thing that separates most of the great ones from
the rest of the pack is the great fastball, with movement and
control. When I played in the American League there was a pitcher
on Detroit, Virgil Trucks, who could throw as hard as anyone, but
he couldn't win. His fastball was straight. No movement. But after
awhile he learned to cut it, and get it to move, and he started to
win. These kinds of pitchers, with the fastball and control, set
you up, and then get you to chase the high fastball out of the
strike zone. They know how to use that `out' pitch to their
advantage. Pedro is fun to watch. He's really something when he is
in trouble, and works his way out of it. Koufax was the toughest I
ever hit against. I got a double off him once down the left-field
line, early in his career. Years later I was managing Minnesota and
we played against the Dodgers in the World Series. Sandy wouldn't
pitch the first game due to a Jewish holiday. But he won two games
in the Series and beat us, 2-0, in the seventh game. I've always
said, if I had another Jewish holiday in the right place, we would
have beat them that year. After the final game, I walked under the
stands and Sandy was standing in the doorway. He looks at me and
says: `10 years ago, in Ebbets Field, you hit a double off me down
the left-field line.' I couldn't believe he could ever remember
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Radatz: ``Outside of Marichal, he's the only guy I've ever seen
who can get you out with more than two pitches. Pedro has fastball,
curve, and the best change I've ever seen, and the ability to throw
them at any point in the count. It doesn't matter if he's ahead of
the batter or behind, he'll throw any pitch he has at any time, to
a spot where he wants to throw it. And when a pitcher is like that,
he is impossible to hit. The toughest pitcher I ever faced was
Koufax. I remember one time playing against him in a spring game in
Arizona. I came up to the plate and John Roseboro the catcher says
to me, `We're going to give you two fastballs, and a curve, and
then you sit down. I was a pretty good bunter, so I decided I was
going to bunt. I tried to bunt the first pitch and it almost
knocked the bat out of my hand. On the third pitch, I swear I heard
it break. Roseboro says to me, `Have a nice summer.' We should all
enjoy what we have in Pedro. Someone like this doesn't come along
often.''

   The Bruins sent an old knee brace worn by Ray Bourque to Denver
this week for him to wear in Friday night's playoff game with
Dallas. Bourque suffered a knee injury two weeks ago, in the same
spot he was hit 12 years ago by the Rangers' Michel Petit. Bourque
missed 20 games then and wore the brace from time to time for
protection. There has been speculation in the Bruins ranks that if
Bourque has stayed out of the lineup the last two weeks, he must
need surgery. However, Bruins president Harry Sinden, who had the
brace shipped to his former star, doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player has a serious knee injury, you don't send him out
to practice in full pads,'' Sinden said. ``Ray has been working in
full pads. My guess is that he took a good hit on the knee,
probably extended it, but that it is nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bourque left Boston, he said he didn't know if this would
be his final year. Apparently, it is not. Bourque recently told
someone close to him that he is going to play next year and wants
to play for Colorado. Ray will be a free agent at the end of the
season. However, he wants to stay with Colorado and there is
already an understanding that he and his agent, Steve Freyer, will
talk contract with the Avalanche at the end of the playoffs.

   The Celtics have a slim chance of getting into the top three
when the NBA's annual draft lottery takes place Sunday, and most
likely will end up in the No. 11 slot. At this point, general
manager Chris Wallace thinks the team could be looking at one of
the following players as a possible pick: Jerome Moiso, 6 feet 10
inches, UCLA; deMarr Johnson, 6-9, Cincinnati; Morris Peterson,
6-7, Michigan State; Mike Miller, 6-8, Florida; Erick Barkley, 6-1,
St. John's; or a 7-2 center from Greece, Tsakalides Iakovas . . .
When Joe Bellino out of Winchester was winning the Heisman Trophy
at the Naval Academy 40 years ago as the best college football
player in the land, he was idolized by the son of one of the
coaches at the school. At graduation, Bellino autographed his hat,
to be worn and thrown in the air at graduation, and gave it to the
kid when the day was over. Bill Belichick still has the hat.

   I still think the best deal Dan Duquette has made is Heathcliff
Slocumb to Seattle for Derek Lowe and Jason Varitek. But think
about this one. Mo Vaughn for Brian Daubach. When Vaughn opted for
$13 million a year with the Angels, becoming at that point Mo
Money, the Sox signed Daubach as a free agent. Since the start of
1999, here are the numbers:

</P>
<P>
   Name ! Avg. ! HRs ! RBIs ! Salary &QL; 
Money ! .286 ! 46 ! 145 ! $13 million &QL; 
Daubach ! .305 ! 29 ! 103 ! $390,000 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the money he saved on Money, Duquette could sign Jose
Offerman, Carl Everett, and Daubach for less than the Sox would
have paid to keep Mo.

ANALYSIS: A CHANGE IN GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudolph Giuliani has often been called operatic, but
little in his past prepared the audience for Friday's performance.
It was a new character on stage: vulnerable, affectionate,
introspective, indecisive, apologetic to his enemies, more
concerned with being ``a better person'' than winning a political
fight.
</P>
<P>
   His enemies may doubt his conversion. One of his promises
Friday, to reach out to disaffected New Yorkers, was reminiscent of
the overtures he made to minority voters in his second inaugural
speech.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever he does the rest of his term, there was no
mistaking the change in Giuliani Friday. He started off sounding a
bit like Lou Gehrig in ``The Pride of the Yankees.'' ``I'm a very
fortunate man,'' Giuliani said in response to the applause that
greeted him. ``The reason I'm such a fortunate man is that I have
people that love me and I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would not be ``a new Rudy,'' but then he promptly
talked about about becoming ``somebody who grows from the fact you
confront your limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I understand myself a lot better,'' he said. ``I think
I understand what is important to me better. Maybe I'm not
completely there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising to hear that intimations of mortality made
Giuliani reassess his life. But it was a shock to hear him confess
to a new sensation. For the first time, he had met a decision he
was having trouble making. For a moment he sounded almost like that
classic Hamlet on the Hudson, Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself unable to make, really make the treatment
decision yet,'' he said referring to his prostate cancer. ``And
about the decision to run, I was almost in the same position, not
being able to make it, which has never really happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his background as a prosecutor, Giuliani was
accustomed to making difficult decisions based on imperfect
information. Prosecutors, unlike politicians, are used to making
people unhappy. Giuliani prided himself on acting quickly and not
looking back.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked near the end of his second year in office to
name any mistakes he'd made, he could barely come up with anything.
He refused even to apologize for his endorsement of Mario Cuomo,
which left him politically isolated and unable to carry out some of
the most important reforms he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never revisit it,'' he said in October of 1995, a year after
the endorsement. ``You don't get the benefit when you make a
decision to know what you're going to know a year later. I made the
right decision based on the things that I knew at the time. I'm
actually proud of the decision, because it was an ability to take a
risk for what I thought was the good of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday he was having second thoughts about lots of things. He
promised to try to overcome ``the barriers that maybe I placed''
between himself and New Yorkers who didn't feel a part of the
city's good times. ``I'm going to dedicate myself to trying to
figure out how we can get them to feel that, too, including maybe
changes I have to make in the way I approach it, the way I look at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the mayor's new persona go over with the public? The
reaction was mixed among an unscientific sample of people
interviewed on the streets of Brooklyn. Ken DiPreta, a writer out
walking his dog in in Cadman Park, was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really pretty self-absorbed of him,'' DiPreta said, ``to
suddenly realize, `Gee, maybe I haven't exactly been nice to people
as mayor.' All of us knew that he was like that. So to hear him
discovering normal human kindness like it was some great new
invention seems a little strange.''
</P>
<P>
   But others were willing to cut the mayor a break. ``He suddenly
became human,'' said Quentin Arthur, a law student standing outside
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. ``It's like tragedy had to strike
before he could see what he was like. I don't think it's an act. I
think he really probably does want to be a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's new priorities have been obvious to city officials.
``There's been a lot of self-examination,'' Nicholas Scoppetta, the
commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said.
``What's quite remarkable is that he has done a good deal of this
in public, and his declarations of where he finds himself have been
public, too. I find it all very moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him,'' Scoppetta said. ``He is going through an
extremely difficult time and doing it with the whole city watching
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides and friends have always said there's a softer
and gentler Rudy that the public never sees, and journalists have
always known that he can be charming when he sits down to dinner
with a glass of Chianti. But even at his most relaxed, even when he
was rhapsodizing about opera, he was not what you could call a
touchy-feely guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What moves me about opera is that you can express emotions in
a way that you can't when you just speak,'' he said one evening
five years ago after watching ``Tosca,'' but the emotions that
concerned him seemed to be mainly political. ``Tosca'' was one of
his favorite operas because it featured a struggle against
political evil.

NO REASONING WITH NATURE, A LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST LEARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Pa., N. M.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ There was a time _ say, two weeks ago _ when
John C. Browne regarded the expression ``trial by fire'' as an apt
metaphor for what he had endured as the director of the Los Alamos
National Laboratory, the government's leading nuclear weapons
research center. From the day he stepped into the job a turbulent
two and a half years ago, he had faced an extraordinary series of
crises, from steep budget cuts, layoffs and an epidemic of safety
problems to plummeting morale because of accusations that China had
stolen weapons secrets from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   But he never imagined that the trial by fire would be a literal
one that would nearly engulf the lab and leave him with a sobering
sense of vulnerability to forces so completely beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   Browne is just emerging from operating at the center of the
worst wildfire in New Mexico's history and an unprecedented
two-week shutdown of the laboratory. The 11,000 or so employees of
the lab were kept away, the 18,000 residents of the town of Los
Alamos and nearby White Rock were evacuated, and at one point the
fierce fires raged to within yards of where tons of nuclear waste
are stored in steel barrels under tentlike plastic structures. Many
of more than 400 homes destroyed by the flames belonged to his
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a policy dispute or something, you can reason with
someone and work things out, but you don't reason with nature,
certainly not over the past two weeks,'' the 57-year-old Browne
said, sitting in the lab's bustling emergency operations center in
jeans and a windbreaker. ``It's hard to know how you prepare for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Browne, a strikingly gentle-mannered, self-effacing
research physicist, was as well prepared for the wildfire as anyone
could have been, because of the problems he had already weathered.
Well before the fire vividly demonstrated how volatile the lab's
rustic setting in the high desert could be, he was being forced to
contend with profound changes at this Cold War holdover. Browne, a
native of Pottstown, Pa., became director in November 1997, not
long after deep budget cuts had caused the lab to lose about 900
members of its staff to buyouts and some 200 others to layoffs. He
spent his first nine months in the job dealing with lawsuits filed
by many of those who had lost their jobs, work that was a far cry
from the pure science and research that had made him so happy in
his two decades at the lab, that had made the place seem like an
elite university rather than a center devoted to creating weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the accidents: a guard was shot during a training
exercise; a worker was nearly killed after running a jackhammer
into an underground power line; some chemicals exploded in a lab.
</P>
<P>
   Then Congress sharply reduced the money that the lab could spend
on pure research, which many scientists, particularly younger
recruits, regard almost as a reward for good work.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps worst of all, Browne said, was the dismissal and then
arrest last year of Wen Ho Lee, a top scientist who was suspected
of spying for China and was then indicted on charges of
compromising American nuclear secrets by downloading a huge arsenal
of data. Lee's indictment was followed by a ban on foreign
scientists' visits to the lab, another enjoyable research perk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably worse than anything else as to morale,''
Browne said. ``That created a sense that the people at the lab
could not be trusted. People here felt they were being punished. I
would say we're still rebuilding after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some of those other issues, the wildfire here at first
seemed controllable, then suddenly transformed itself into a threat
that had people reeling. The fire was started by the National Park
Service on May 4 in what was intended to be a controlled burn to
thin dense pine forests nearby. But strong winds sent it leaping
across canyons, and by May 7 it was closing in on the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Browne first got a call in the afternoon saying there was an
approaching fire. By early evening, the winds had sent the blaze
roaring to the lip of a canyon at the edge of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I said, `It's going to do what it's going to
do,''' he recalled, adding that heroic work by firefighters had
turned the flames back.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, the fire did sweep through several thousand
acres of the lab's 43 square miles, destroying a handful of
historic buildings from the 1940s where parts of the first atomic
bomb were assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Browne now speaks with a sense of profound relief that finally
the threat of fire is gone and the focus is on relief work and
finding housing for people who lost their homes. He looks forward
to being able to return to jogging, mountain biking, playing tennis
and tending to his family. He and his second wife have a
13-year-old daughter, a ski racer. He has two grown children from
his previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Browne concedes that even after the damage from the fire is
repaired, the lab will never be the same. In a conversation just
steps from a burned-out canyon, he recalled his early days working
on nuclear weapons, saying that even as the Vietnam War raged, he
had enjoyed the immense pleasures of a collegial, cerebral
environment where physicists could unlock the secrets of the atom,
like translators gently coaxing meaning from obscure texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That environment is so important,'' he said, ``the freedom to
do that kind of science, it would be a shame to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Browne admitted that this old model was threatened by cuts
in the pure-research budget and by a new mission for Los Alamos: to
produce an actual component used in bombs, rather than just
designs. The lab is already gearing up, he said, to produce
``pits,'' devices that act as a kind of nuclear trigger. He
described the task as hugely important but essentially an
engineering function, a significant shift from the lab's longtime
emphasis on pure science.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the challenge that Browne seems destined to face
repeatedly as director of the lab: Is it a place committed to the
notion of destroying or creating?
</P>
<P>
   Browne was offered his initial job in a nuclear lab, at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, after
receiving his doctorate from Duke University. First the legendary
physicist Edward Teller put the issue to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will give you a job, but first I have to ask you a
question,'' Browne recalled being told by Teller. ``If while you
were doing your scientific research I called and said I absolutely
need you to tell me the answer to this question relating to
weapons, would you work on such a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember,'' Browne said, ``that I started giving him sort of
a circuitous answer, and he interrupted me and said, `No, this is a
simple question, yes or no.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes,'' Browne recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But his manner suggested that he would not mind having it both
ways.

PARTISAN BATTLING ON CENSUS RESURFACES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Partisan vitriol dominated a House hearing on the
census Friday, with Republicans suggesting that the Clinton
administration was trying to manipulate the count to benefit
Democrats, and Democrats insinuating that Republicans did not want
to count members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations, at a hearing of the House Government Reform
Committee's Subcommittee on the Census, were not fresh. But the
testy exchanges came as the Census Bureau was poised to begin the
procedure that has most sharply divided the two parties:
statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the pressure factor,'' said Chip Walker,
communications director for the subcommittee's Republican majority.
``We're right in the middle of the census, and crucial activities
are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau's normally reserved
director, got into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Republicans on the subcommittee made public a
memorandum from a midlevel Census Bureau manager telling
subordinates that daily progress reports ``must and cannot be
shared'' with investigators from the General Accounting Office. The
Republicans said this indicated that there were people in
``influential'' positions at the bureau who were trying to hide
what it was doing, and so were ``dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Prewitt angrily demanded an explanation Friday from
the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla. Prewitt would
not relent even after the hearing had adjourned, instead
confronting Walker, the communications director. ``I want to know
who these influential people are and what is the evidence that they
are dangerous,'' Prewitt demanded.
</P>
<P>
   When Walker tried to offer an explanation, Prewitt responded
with an epithet.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding enlivened a dry, technical presentation of the
current status of the census and the bureau's plans to use
statistical sampling as a way to check to accuracy of the head
count and adjust the final totals.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials plan to collect data from a sample of 314,000
randomly selected households, and use that data to adjust
population totals for geographic areas as small as a city block.
The adjustment will increase the numbers of minority residents _
principally inner-city blacks and rural Hispanics, who are often
missed by traditional census methods. Democrats support the plan,
and Republicans oppose it, primarily because both sides believe it
will give Democrats an advantage during the process of redrawing
congressional districts.

SHAQ MUST TEMPER HIS TEMPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like ants or an eccentric aunt, the Portland Trail
Blazers will descend upon Shaquille O'Neal's crib today. They're at
Staples Center for two games against the Los Angeles Lakers and
O'Neal suspects they'll try to overstay their welcome.
</P>
<P>
   If he isn't extra vigilant, the Trail Blazers will end up taking
over the place, he just knows it. The gall of them! I mean, it's
not like he ever promised them a Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   How O'Neal wishes the Trail Blazers would get his hints about
when he has had his fill of them. Don't they ever wonder why his
elbows keep connecting with their chests?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is not ribbing them, he's reminding them that they're
being a complete nuisance. Duh. How dense can they be?
</P>
<P>
   Why, if he could, O'Neal would plaster the players' entrance at
Staples Center with bumper stickers that are takeoffs of ones
showing up on the backs of Volvos everywhere in greater Portland:
``Welcome to Southern California. Now Go Home.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the Lakers' 7-foot center, the Trail Blazers might as
well be Tonya Harding. The way they beat him up, O'Neal wishes he
could obtain a restraining order to prevent them from coming within
500 yards of Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine O'Neal is the worst. Just because he shares Shaquille's
surname, he evidently has gotten it into his head that he can plant
himself in O'Neal's favorite spot, around the basket.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaquille already is there.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if he thinks Shaquille's personal space is his to share,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neals nearly came to blows the first time they were
together in the ring, er, on the court, in November. The game was
in Portland and Shaquille got so tired of carrying his 330 pounds
around and Jermaine's, too_ my lord, you would have thought the
latter was a 226-pound backpack _ he dispensed with subtleties and
tried to tattoo the basketball onto Jermaine's chest.
</P>
<P>
   That earned Shaquille an early night. Since it was his second
technical foul in less than a minute _ he had shoved Jermaine over
another invasion of his personal space _ the Lakers' eighth-year
player and team captain was ejected. The Lakers, down by seven
points at the time, proceeded to lose by 15.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine played five minutes and picked up five fouls. Obviously
he wasn't in there to show Shaquille his jumper.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's numbers that night weren't as horrible as his mood. He
finished with 21 points. That was right around his four-game,
regular-season average against the Trail Blazers (20.5) but well
below his season average (30.1) against everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question, Jermaine O'Neal and his fellow forwards
Aryvdas Sabonis and Brian Grant can act on Shaquille's
concentration like a stiff breeze on a pile of raked leaves.
Goodness knows O'Neal's focus clearly was scattered in November
when he drew the two technical fouls and again in January when he
missed three foul shots out of four attempts in a four-point loss
to the Trail Blazers at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a coincidence that O'Neal averaged 2.5 fouls and shot
51.9 percent from the foul line in the Lakers' two victories in the
regular-season series. When he's tuned into the game, the Lakers
all are able to get on the same frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, when the Trail Blazers and Lakers meet today in
Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, John Salley, the Lakers'
backup center, will help out O'Neal by screaming, ``Focus!'' until
he's hoarse if he has to.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal kids Salley that his voice is as grating as fingernails
on a chalkboard, but he takes Salley's message seriously. O'Neal
seconds what Jackson said of Jermaine O'Neal and Co. in November :
``They're not playing ball, all they're trying to do is knock
(O'Neal) out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy being the host with the most; the most bulk, the
most press clippings, the Most Valuable Player in the NBA trophy.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal long ago stopped jawing at the officials for letting
opponents mug him in the paint with impunity. ``I'd rather save my
energy,'' O'Neal explained Friday after practice.
</P>
<P>
   The most he'll say, after a hack goes unpunished, is ``And
one.'' That's Shaq shorthand for ``the shot ought to have been a
three-point play.''
</P>
<P>
   A teammate said he once talked to the officials on O'Neal's
behalf. ``You can see Shaq's being hacked,'' the player recalled
saying. ``Why aren't you calling anything?''
</P>
<P>
   The official's reply was something along the lines of, ``Shaq's
so much bigger than everybody else, he ought to be able to handle
those fouls.''
</P>
<P>
   With few exceptions O'Neal has fed every frustration into a
flame that rages within. It provided the fuel for his MVP season.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers first-year coach Phil Jackson was the one who counseled
O'Neal to bury his emotions, the better to bury his opponents.
Indeed, O'Neal started referring to himself as ``The Big
Impervious'' after one of Jackson's lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Imperious,'' anyone? Jackson now wonders if it
wouldn't be better for O'Neal to set off a controlled burn every
once in a while in the hopes of avoiding a raging wildfire
somewhere down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He piles on (all the frustration) and loads up on it (and) it
wears him down,'' said Jackson, who doesn't want O'Neal saying or
doing anything dumb.
</P>
<P>
   He merely wishes he'd play his assigned role of prima donna with
a tad more conviction. You know, call the illegal defenses when he
sees them. Speak his mind on the worst of the uncalled fouls (but
never stop smiling). Let everybody know the Lakers are back, not
laid-back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see everybody of his stature going to the referees
constantly,'' Jackson said. ``He's one of the only guys in the
league at his level who leaves the referees alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley says O'Neal can afford to pipe up now because he has the
clout, after his play this season, to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make a difference when Shaq talks,'' Salley said,
``because he is who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is the league's MVP. As long as he remembers that's not
the Most Victimized Player, that's not the Most Volatile Player,
his house should be safe.

U.S. SAID TO SEEK A LAW TO BOLSTER INTERNET PRIVACY
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Concluding that companies on the Internet have not
properly protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade
Commission has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose
tough consumer-privacy safeguards, government officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In an unannounced vote taken on Friday, the commission approved
a staff recommendation to seek legislation giving the agency such
authority. The action followed a recently completed survey by the
commission that found that only about 20 percent of major companies
on the Internet had adequate standards for protecting the privacy
of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision comes as the agency has stepped up its
investigation of several major Internet companies over their use of
consumer data. It marks a sharp departure from the agency's
previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to
police itself.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation sought by the commission would permit it to
regulate the kinds of notice given to consumers about use of
information about them, as well as whether consumers can block that
use. It would allow the commission to establish rules for keeping
the information secure from third parties. And it would authorize
the commission to penalize companies that violate privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials are preparing to brief members of Congress
about the proposal on Monday. The commissioners are also planning
to testify about the proposal at a hearing before the Senate
Commerce Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate who have been
the most vocal advocates for privacy legislation said this week
that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were
not strong, since the Republicans have largely sided with industry
and there are not enough legislative days remaining to pass a major
new measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the chances are virtually nil,'' said Rep. Edward
J. Markey, D-Mass, whose own privacy bill has stalled. ``The
Republican leadership is committed to not doing privacy this year
in any area.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless a group of nine Democratic senators led by Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., and John D. Rockefeller 4th, D-W.Va., are
preparing to introduce a measure next week that is similar to what
the commission has sought. The legislation also contains some
measures that appeal to Internet companies, most notably a
provision that pre-empts all state law on Internet privacy issues.
Industry executives have long sought the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, privacy concerns represent the only remaining
obstacle impeding consumers' full embrace of the Internet's ample
commercial opportunities,'' Hollings said on Friday. ``Advances in
technology have provided information gatherers the tools to
seamlessly compile and enhance highly detailed personal histories
of Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless,'' he added, ``industry has to this point nearly
unanimously opposed even a basic regulatory framework that would
ensure the protection of consumer privacy on the Internet _ a basic
framework that has been successfully adopted in other areas of our
economy. My bill gives customers, not companies, control over their
personal information on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A report accompanying the commission's proposal for legislation
found that the industry had made significant progress in policing
itself, but not enough. Robert Pitofsky, the chairman of the trade
commission, has said recently that there is a big role for
companies to monitor themselves, but that as the market develops,
there may also be a need for government to play a role as well. A
person familiar with his thinking said Pitofsky had decided that
while self-regulation is a crucial element of protecting privacy
rights, he had also come to believe that the marketplace had
developed sufficiently to seek new authority to give the government
tools to prosecute those companies that do not police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups say any effort to give the commission new
rule-making authority would mark an unwarranted incursion by the
government into regulating cyberspace and could discourage the
development of many start-up Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this industry is the basis for a tremendous
economic boom, most of these companies in fact aren't making money
right now,'' said a top lobbyist for a major Internet and
entertainment company. ``To throw up new barriers that will make it
even more difficult to make money just doesn't make sense right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Varney, a former member of the trade commission who
now represents an industry group, said the agency already had
significant authority to crack down on companies that violated the
privacy interests of consumers by engaging in deceptive practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they already have authority and they have exercised
it,'' said Varney, an adviser to the Online Privacy Alliance, a
group of about 100 companies and associations interested in
Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates say the agency's track record is
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the privacy gap between the safeguards
in place and the intrusions seems to be growing not narrowing, and
that has as much as anything to do with the lack of enforcement at
the FTC,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a research organization that studies privacy
issues and technology. ``There is little indication that
self-regulation is working.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a recent Saturday afternoon in San Rafael,
Calif., fly-fishing instructor Floyd Dean was expertly casting and
reeling, bending and swiveling at the edge of a 40-foot
demonstration pool.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty or so a-fish-ionados lined the pool, following his every
move. It is a rite of spring in this Marin County parking lot _ the
annual Fly-Fishing Fair staged by Western Sport Shop, just across

</P>
<P>
   First, Dean demonstrated the ``Wyoming cowboy,'' twirling his
rod in a lassolike motion above his head. ``This'n 'll get your
ear,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the classic ``willow cast,'' featured in the movie,
``A River Runs Through It.'' Twenty rapt heads followed every move
as the line plopped down gently at the end of the long pool.
</P>
<P>
   The fair, which includes fly-tying demonstrations and booths
with the latest fishing paraphernalia, is more than a sales
opportunity for Western. Special events like this differentiate the
53-year-old retailer from discount chains and other rivals. In this
era of intense retail competition, they help the independent shop
stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small market, so any new competitor who makes a serious
run at it will take some business,'' said Jim Edgar, who has owned
Western for the past 13 years with his wife, Judy. ``Their margins
will hurt and our margins will hurt. That's happened several times,
but then they go out of business and we survive.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to retail rivals, Western faces the challenge of
declining interest in fishing and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Americans who fished at least once in 1999 was 7
percent lower than in 1987, while hunting was down 33.4 percent,
according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. By
contrast, mountain-biking participation rose more than 400 percent,
and snowboarding jumped 124 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract the downturn, Western offers frequent classes and
seminars on topics like bay fishing and fly-tying. (Flies are the
insectlike lures, typically made from animal hair and feathers,
that fly-fishers use instead of bait). For its lectures, Western
hires some of the biggest names in the esoteric world of
fly-fishing, like Lefty Kreh and Dave Whitlock.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Western's annual Waterfowl Day, featuring decoys,
shotguns, duck calls and other equipment, attracts flocks of bird
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Mounted Heads, Bait and Soda
</P>
<P>
   The store itself, with its high ceilings and timbered paneling,
is a relic of the past. A piece of paper scrawled with the words
``Bait &AMP; Soda'' is taped to a refrigerator in the back. Mounted
heads of elk, deer and other game, many of them decades old, line
every wall.
</P>
<P>
   The heads ``are too big for most people to keep in their
homes,'' so customers store them at Western, said Judy Edgar.
``Sometimes customers come in to visit their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Western ``is not a slick place'' and that's not the goal, said
Jim Edgar. ``We like to provide a unique shopping experience in an
age when there aren't many.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its quaint decor, Western's merchandise selection is
considered one of the broadest and most up-to-date in the area. In
addition to equipment, it stocks more than 5,000 titles of new and
used outdoor books with titles like ``In Praise of Wild Trout'' and
``Lunker!'' (a type of bass).
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably four shops in California that are really
good and this is one of the best,'' said Robert Louis Stephens, a
fishing guide who manned a booth at the Fly-Fishing Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Western's customer service is old-fashioned, too, shoppers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are helpful,'' said Darren Hesse, who attended the
Fly-Fishing Fair. ``They tell you where the hot fishing spots are,
and their information is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Western's employees receive commissions or any kind of
incentive pay tied to sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we think that's counter to the nature of the service
we're trying to deliver,'' Jim Edgar said. `It motivates people to
sell stuff customers don't need, and that's just not the kind of
store we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Western does give every employee Christmas bonuses, and managers
receive annual bonuses based on subjective performance measures,
but not sales, Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales on the Upswing
</P>
<P>
   Western, which occupies 5,000 square feet, has been riding high
for the past couple of years. Sales rose 13 percent in 1998 and 18
percent in 1999. Bay Area residents are flush with cash, and some
are now dropping $1,000 or more to get completely outfitted for,
say, a bone-fishing trip to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Business hasn't always been so good. When the Edgars bought
Western in 1987, the store had been in decline for several years.
The fact that it still exists is a testament to the Edgars' love of
minding the store, rather than to its financial rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Western's founder, Gene Thompson, started the business in 1947.
It rapidly became a mecca for local outdoorsmen. He moved it to its
current space on Third Street from its original Hayes Street
location in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's daughter, Antioch resident Sandy Gangwer, remembers
that her father greeted every customer by name. A meticulous
merchant, he insisted that she arrange bait fish in perfectly
straight rows.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Thompson sold Western to two longtime
employees. In the mid-'80s it was purchased by a
construction-company executive, Al Perini, who soon decided that
retailing wasn't his sport. By that point, the store had very
little inventory, its prices were a bit steep and it was losing
money.
</P>
<P>
   Perini mentioned his plan to sell the store to a fishing buddy,
Jim Edgar, a lifelong management consultant with no background in
retailing. The two were fishing for salmon at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar bit. ``I'll buy it,'' he told his friend. Today he notes,
``It was a decision of the heart, not the wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Edgars installed their son, Jim Edgar Jr., who had been
manager of a camera store, as Western's manager. Judy Edgar began
organizing events and publicity. Jim Edgar Sr. kept his eye on
finances without leaving his consulting business, Edgar Dunn &AMP; Co.,
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Phasing Out Hunting Gear
</P>
<P>
   The Edgars made significant changes in the first few years,
including reorganizing the floor plan, restocking depleted
inventories, hiring more staff and putting more emphasis on
fly-fishing. In its earlier incarnations, the store had focused
mostly on hunting, a sport that has been declining in popularity in
the Bay Area for years.
</P>
<P>
   When their son left Western in 1995 for another retail job, Judy
and Jim Edgar considered selling the store. But they were hooked.
They resolved to keep going and asked a longtime employee, Gene
Fassi, to manage day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues, which had doubled under Jim Edgar Jr., have risen
another 50 percent under Fassi. Fly-fishing is the fastest-growing
category; both hunting and other types of fishing are on the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgars' persistance has been rewarded with black ink for the
past three or four years, although profit margins remain thin,
under 5 percent. (They also own a fly-fishing specialty store in
Santa Rosa, Western Angler, which is profitable).
</P>
<P>
   Four-Day Weeks for Full-Timers
</P>
<P>
   Today, Western's biggest challenge is to find knowledgeable
employees with good people skills who are willing to work for a
retail wage, said Jim Edgar.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive, Western lets full-timers work 10-hour days,
four days a week _ a schedule that allows staff to spend three days
a week hunting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Many new hires are high school students who work after school
and retirees looking for something to do a couple of days a week,
Edgar said. These folks don't demand high wages and the old-timers
have extraordinary stores of knowledge about local hunting and
fishing spots, Edgar said.
</P>
<P>
   Another looming challenge for Western is a 12-screen cinema in
the works for downtown San Rafael. The theater would surround
Western on two sides and engulf an adjacent parking garage used by
Western customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parking is already difficult in San Rafael,'' said Jim Edgar.
He expects Western to survive if the theater is built, but business
may suffer.

 NASDAQ TAKES ANOTHER BEATING  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ That hissing sound you hear is the Nasdaq
composite index continuing to lose air.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 148.31 points, or 4 percent, Friday
to finish the week at 3,390.40 _ its first close below the 3,400
level since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are predicting that the Nasdaq could lose another
500 points _ or more _ before hitting bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, shed 150.43 points,
dropping to 10,626.85, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
dropped 30.26, to 1,406.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nasdaq has hit its high for the year,'' said Rao
Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in
Chicago. ``The market is unsupportable for technology stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wall Street's initial reaction to this week's
half-percentage-point increase in short-term interest rates was one
of relief that the bloody deed at last had been done, investors are
now fretting over what comes next.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve all but guaranteed that rates will go up
even more if the risk of inflation persists. Market watchers are
resigned to the almost certain prospect of another increase when
the Fed's policy-making committee meets again on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the consensus is that Greenspan &AMP; Co. are looking
to boost interest rates by another quarter-point. But some analysts
believe the Fed is ready to experiment with stronger medicine and
could jack up rates by as much as a full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is very possible,'' said Douglas Cliggott, chief
investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York. ``What
we've seen so far has done virtually nothing to slow things down.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech and telecom stocks led the selling yesterday. Cisco Systems
was the most active Nasdaq stock, falling $1.94, to $53.44. Intel
Corp. also took it on the chin, declining $6.06, to $117.88, while
Hewlett-Packard Co. slid $5.50, to $126.19.
</P>
<P>
   In an example of that old saw about buying the rumor and selling
the news, telecom equipment-maker Ciena Corp. plunged more than 15
percent to $116.50 after reporting better-than-expected quarterly
earnings of $18.4 million (12 cents per share).
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the market to remain in the doldrums, rising a
bit here, tumbling again there, until next month's Fed meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentiment on a day-to-day basis will keep swinging back
and forth,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein
Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. ``All this uncertainty is going to take a
couple of months at best to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   While he thinks most tech stocks remain overpriced, Kugel is
pointing clients toward financial services firms, which he said are
now trading at bargain levels.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan's Cliggott is adopting a more recession-ready
posture, focusing on companies that produce foods, beverages and
pharmaceuticals _ ``Things people will buy whether or not they have
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   One trend all analysts are taking note of is the absence of
investors spilling into the market in search of fire-sale
discounts. In the past, so-called buying on the dip was a hallmark
of the market and kept share prices from ever sinking too low.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like the only investor buying on the dip this week was
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the Saudi billionaire with a penchant
for U.S. tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   The prince said he had invested $1 billion in 15 U.S. companies,
including six Internet firms and two telecom ventures.
</P>
<P>
   These included separate $50 million investments he made in
bookseller Amazon.com, auctioneer eBay, investment firm Internet
Capital Group, discount reservation provider Priceline.com, content
producer InfoSpace.com and ad agency DoubleClick.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old prince, a nephew of Saudi King Fahd, also said
he has his eye on a number of other Net outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Does he know something that other investors don't?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the party is over, but tech stocks won't see
the same kind of run-ups that we saw in '99,'' said John
Scarborough, a partner with the San Francisco investment firm of
Bingham, Osborn &AMP; Scarborough.
</P>
<P>
   His advice for investors is to maintain the long view and,
despite short-term market turbulence, to take solace that even the
beleaguered Nasdaq will likely be higher five years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a huge mistake to bail out at this point,''
Scarborough said.

 FIRM BLOCKS WORKERS' USE OF NAPSTER  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The crackdown on Napster has reached the
corporate workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked
employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping
program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of
Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth
problems. But Napster officials said there have been only a few
scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine''
of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and
has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice
Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices,
including one in San Francisco. The message: Napster is officially
off-limits at work.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information
systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came
when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one
office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc. in San Mateo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to
Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other
business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems
backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no
longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the
operation. Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded
about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like potato chips, you can't download just one,'' Buss
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster software, created by founder Shawn Fanning, allows
music fans to share their MP3-formatted songs directly with other
Napster members without cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica
and rap star Dr. Dre have sued Napster claiming the program
promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 universities have enacted highly publicized bans or
restrictions on Napster because student file-swapping was clogging
the institutions' high-speed Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Three colleges, Yale University, Indiana University and the
University of Southern California, blocked Napster to avoid getting
drawn into Metallica's copyright infringement lawsuit against
Napster.
</P>
<P>
   MP3s have flourished at universities because they afford
students free access to high-speed Internet connections. A survey
this week by Greenfield Online showed 75 percent of college
students have downloaded music from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses also have those same high-speed connections. ``It
would make sense that people are using Napster at work,'' said
David Gould, who operates an independent Web site called
NapsterMP3.com, which offers Napster fans forums and news, but not
MP3s.
</P>
<P>
   Gould of Charlotte, N.C., said he has heard of no other company
bans of Napster. However, he said that about 20 percent of the
visitors logged on to his site yesterday morning were from
business-related Internet addresses, and that percentage seems to
go up on Mondays when workers return after the weekend off.
</P>
<P>
   Gould said visitors to his 3-week-old site yesterday included
users from financial services companies, the military, media
outlets and the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Napster spokesman Dan Wool had no specific information of other
companies that cracked down on Napster use. However, he said the
bans had more to do with workers slacking off than computer
resource problems.

INSURGENT IN PERU CALLS FOR ELECTION BOYCOTT
</HEADLINE>
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ A day after withdrawing from the Peruvian
presidential contest, Alejandro Toledo on Friday called for
peaceful demonstrations against the government to discredit the
vote scheduled for May 28.
</P>
<P>
   He also asked people to abstain from voting as a protest in
light of allegations of fraud that have tainted the initial round
of voting in April. Aides to Toledo, who has run a surprisingly
strong insurgent campaign, said his call would be the beginning of
a permanent civil disobedience effort he hoped would isolate and
discredit the government of President Alberto K. Fujimori, who is
seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, voting is obligatory, and failure to cast a ballot
carries a fine equivalent to $35 _ a large sum in this poor country
_ though it has rarely been collected.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old, American-educated business professor,
announced his withdrawal from the May 28 election late Thursday
because he said he believed that the vote would be a fraud. On
Friday he conceded in another news conference that he has left the
path open for Fujimori to claim a new five-year term. But he also
suggested that his strategy was aimed at forcing Fujimori to hold a
clean election or risk becoming an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to unleash the democratic forces of Peru,'' he
said. ``President Fujimori can declare himself the winner, but his
government will lack credibility and legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's aides said the campaign to discredit the election and
the government would include peaceful marches this weekend in Lima
and in provincial capitals around the country. Supporters set
bonfires at midday in the central plaza of Chimbote, a northern
port city where Fujimori was expected as he continued his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has refused to postpone the election, as Toledo
demanded after the publication of a report on Thursday by the
Organization of American States saying that it could not guarantee
a fair and clean vote on May 28 because there was insufficient time
to test a new computer program designed to count ballots. It also
asked that the May 28 vote be delayed for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he would not get back into the race unless the
election was postponed to June 18, and his campaign was given equal
time on all television channels and new poll-watchers were
selected.
</P>
<P>
   The April balloting was marred by charges of vote tampering and
campaign dirty tricks directed by Fujimori's intelligence agency.
The report by the Organization of American States questioned why
ballots and tally sheets disappeared for hours at a time after the
April vote, making it impossible for its monitoring group to
validate the results.
</P>
<P>
   If Fujimori continues to refuse to the postpone the May 28 vote,
advisers to Toledo said, the opposition forces will try to follow
the ``people power'' tactics that brought down the government of
Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines in 1986. Those tactics
included strikes by trade unions as well as business leaders and
marches by students and peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make peaceful demonstrations, pacific resistance,''
Toledo said at the news conference, ``until there is a transparent,
clean election.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar campaign had begun immediately following the April
balloting, with thousands of university students and other
protesters filling city squares across the country protesting
allegations of fraud. The demonstrations stopped after three days,
when the government announced that Fujimori had fallen just short
of an outright majority and that a second round would be required
to decide the election.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign election observers say privately that the internal and
international pressures probably stopped the government from
declaring a first-round victory for the president.

EDITORIAL: GIULIANI STAYS AT CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, may 20:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's announcement Friday that he is bowing
out of the U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton marked a
decision that, once revealed, feels both correct and inevitable.
But no one could have predicted as recently as a few weeks ago the
degree to which the mayor who asks and gives no quarter would turn
his withdrawal press conference into an existential meditation on
life, love, mortality and priorities. It was, in its way, as
extraordinary a political moment as the Bryant Park press
conference of May 10, when Giuliani acknowledged the emotional
impact of his cancer diagnosis and surprised the city, and his
wife, by announcing the end of his 16-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   From the medical standpoint, Giuliani was right to allow himself
more time to choose between surgical and radiation therapies for
his prostate cancer. From the standpoint of party loyalty, he acted
unselfishly in saying he did not want to disappoint fellow
Republicans by finding in September that he could not sustain a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the introspective, self-analytic quality of
Giuliani's remarks that was most striking. The press conference was
peppered with references to love, mortality, shaken confidence, an
unaccustomed difficulty in making decisions. Giuliani is not the
first middle-aged man to discover, under the shock of a threatening
diagnosis, that ``you're not a superman and you're just a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is a middle-aged man with 19 months to serve as mayor of
New York City. While he dismissed talk of a ``new Rudy'' as silly,
he seemed to be taking a fresh look at his relations with the
city's minority communities and perhaps at the polarizing effect of
some of his statements on law enforcement. He spoke of overcoming
``barriers that maybe I placed there'' to making every New Yorker
share in the city's new spirit of optimism and prosperity. The
mayor even included a very un-Giuliani-like pledge to consider
``changes I have to make in the way I approach'' some issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics will say that by showing a softer side, Giuliani was
looking to prepare himself for future campaigns and to limit the
damage from his public romance with a single woman, Judith Nathan,
and his impending legal separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.
But the content of Giuliani's remarks should be taken on the
merits. He has made New York City safer and more efficient. If he
can spend the final months of his term healing racial tensions and
behaving in a less authoritarian way, that would give real depth to
his declaration of ``love for the people of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's departure from the Senate race upends what seemed
destined to be a battle of political titans. But Clinton, the
Democratic nominee, would make a mistake to assume that her new
rival will not be competitive. For one thing, the campaign dynamic,
shifting from two strong characters to one, will make Clinton
herself a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Republican leaders seem to be rallying behind
Rep. Rick Lazio, who will bring energy to the task. Indeed, he
barely managed to muzzle his ambitions while Giuliani was the
party's favored contender. With his suburban base and conservative
views on social issues like abortion rights, he may win more votes
upstate than Giuliani. But with the mayor out, Clinton can aim for
an even bigger vote in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, for his part, has done everyone a service by making a
timely exit from a contest for which he no longer had an appetite.
Even his detractors will have to concede, too, that he gave New
York three weeks of political drama that no one is likely to
forget. &QL;

SAVING YOUR FINANCIAL LIFE FROM DESTRUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Adds byline)  
 (For release Sunday, May 21)  
 By JULIE FLAHERTY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just before a wildfire burned their house _ and more than 200
other Los Alamos, N.M., homes _ to the ground last week, Dick and
Judy Opsahl were told they had a last chance to rescue what they
could. Opsahl said they first grabbed ``a few treasures'' and a bit
of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next part,'' he added, ``was to be sure we got the hard
drives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of their financial lives, from tax records to rental
payments, were on their computers, which were soon up and running
again in their temporary home at the Cities of Gold Casino Hotel in
nearby Pojoaque.
</P>
<P>
   Laina Katcher, in her rush to leave Los Alamos, did not think to
bring the family computer, but she did pack her bills for the
current month. ``Isn't that stupid?'' she said, looking back. ``Why
would I want those?''
</P>
<P>
   Even during a catastrophe, people seem concerned about their
financial responsibilities, though usually after paying heed to
things with more sentimental value. Now that residences are often
home offices or home-based businesses, too, many have more data to
lose. People also now tend to carry more debt, which makes dealing
with creditors and worrying about cash flow part of the daily
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more going on in the household than ever before,''
said Brent A. Neiser, director of collaborative programs at the
National Endowment for Financial Education, a nonprofit group in
Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate databases can reconstruct most financial documents,
though the bureaucracy can be overwhelming. ``We're all financially
networked with large institutions, not just community banks and
credit unions where you can go down the street and ask, ``What's
going on?''' Neiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the devastation of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Neiser's
group began working on a way to provide financial guidance to
disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the Red Cross, it interviewed victims of previous
floods, fires and earthquakes and found that many experienced the
same financial obstacles. Some were as basic as not having change
on hand for pay phones when residential lines were down. Others
involved an added cause of misery, like unscrupulous contractors
who show up immediately after a calamity to take advantage of
homeowners still in shock.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines were developed, and later revised in tandem with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some seeming nightmares have a way of working out. Almost as
soon as the Los Alamos post office closed for a few days, for
example, the Postal Service began unloading mail at a Red Cross
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving, say, a Visa bill was important to the evacuees, said
Jo Anne Jones, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Los Alamos. ``When
they're in the shelter all day, they do worry about those things,
simply because there is not much else they can do,'' she said.
After the post office reopened, temporary post-office boxes were
set up for those who no longer had much of an address.
</P>
<P>
   Most large insurance companies send claims adjusters to disaster
sites, where they can write checks on the spot for people with
immediate needs. These representatives often also wind up fielding
general financial questions from their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just basically telling them not to worry,'' said Gloria
Brown, a Los Alamos claims adjuster for State Farm, who lost her
own home of 26 years in the fire. The only document she brought
with her in the evacuation was a birth certificate, but the last
thing on her mind was getting a copy of her mutual-fund statement,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do is start all over again,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, coping with a communitywide disaster is easier
than going it alone. ``The Rotary Clubs in Japan sent thousands of
dollars to this area,'' said Richard Hardman, whose home and
business were damaged in Northridge, Calif., earthquakes in 1994.
``Because it was so visible throughout the world, people kind of
rallied around.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the catastrophe involves one home or 200, there are
many steps people can take to keep things from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt phone calls, for example. Utility companies will usually
stop billing a residence and switch the service to another
location, waiving initial connection charges.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card companies usually monitor disaster situations and
mark ZIP codes where homes have been destroyed, but a call from a
card holder can help. Steve Boyden, a spokesman for the big card
issuer MBNA America Bank, said his company offered things like
payment holidays and increased credit lines for emergency
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Filing insurance claims, and collecting the benefits, can be a
daunting task. Some victims of previous disasters have said they
took years to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Neiser recommends submitting claim forms quickly and alerting
the insurer to the fact that the list of damages might be
incomplete. If property records are destroyed, catalogs or
classified ads can help establish a fair value for damaged or
destroyed items. A real estate agent can provide escrow papers for
the value of a home, the county assessor can provide property-tax
records, and contractors can determine the value of home
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration offers loans to homeowners and
renters in declared disaster areas as well as to small businesses.
FEMA offers grants; local governments may help, too.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will provide copies of prior tax returns and will allow
certain deductions for casualty losses. The costs of documenting
losses may also be deductible. Disaster victims may want to amend
their previous year's tax returns to report current losses, to get
a refund more quickly. Filing deadlines may be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Though getting fresh copies of documents is usually possible,
extracting information from a melted computer is not. Evacuating
with a computer or backup disks that have been kept current, or
having backup copies stored in remote locations, can be vital.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies also offer ways to replicate a desktop
environment through the Internet; these services _ sometimes free _
are essentially a means of storing back-up files on a server.
Experts warn, however, that there still are privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, the items that are most worth saving are
not Quicken files or Social Security cards. For Brown, the State
Farm adjuster, they were her jewelry, her Lladro porcelain
figurines and photographs of her nine children and 18
grandchildren. ``We have a lot of photographs,'' she said, and no
regrets at hauling them all.

FIRES CREATE NEW CONCERN ABOUT NUCLEAR WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``Mark Udall'' to ``Tom Udall'' in 5th graf from
end.) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The fires that consumed nearly 50,000 acres of
northern New Mexico, including parts of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, have raised new concerns over the buildup of nuclear
and hazardous waste stored at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal officials have insisted that the fires, which
were 70 percent under control by late Friday, did not get close
enough to threaten thousands of containers filled with used gloves,
rags, booties and other combustible items contaminated by low-level
radioactive waste, like plutonium. By some estimates, the nearest
flames remained half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists and environmentalists said Friday that dry
conditions in forests adjacent to the storage site make them ripe
for another fire _ and a potentially more dangerous situation
because of the increasing quantity of stored waste.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the laboratory generates 150 cubic meters of waste a
year that is stored above ground in 55-gallon steel drums and in
smaller wood boxes that sit under a fabric dome. The current level
is 4,808 cubic meters _ the equivalent of 14,000 drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is just sitting there, just waiting for another
incident to happen,'' said a Los Alamos scientist familiar with the
storage area who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``And there
are a lot of people at the lab who share that concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mello, director of the Los Alamos Study Group, a nuclear
watchdog organization, said: ``It's a dangerous situation. If they
could get that stuff out of there, everyone would be better
served.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Energy Department and the laboratory have
disputed the contention that anything at the storage site, a mesa
surrounded by canyons known as Technical Area 54, is vulnerable to
fire.
</P>
<P>
   They cite an environmental-impact study of the laboratory
conducted four years ago in which officials created a theoretical
worst-case fire and found that the waste would survive unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   But even if conditions became so grave that the drums overheated
and exploded, sending toxic plumes skyward, the study concluded
that no one living within a 50-mile radius would suffer ill
effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists, however, contend that the department's
worst-case test was not worst-case at all. While the department
model assumed a breach of 62 drums, Edwin Lyman, scientific
director of the Nuclear Control Institute, a nonprofit research
organization in Washington, said an intense fire would more likely
breach ``closer to hundreds'' of drums, causing a much greater
potential for illness than the study provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department,'' Lyman said, ``has refused to look at the
real worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts are under way to remove the waste at Los Alamos to the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside Carlsbad, which opened last
year after a decade of delays. For now, the rate of removal is but
a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   With cleanup at the Rocky Flats nuclear-weapons plant outside
Denver, which is scheduled to close by 2006, and three other
facilities producing nuclear waste for disposal, the competition
for removal has grown intense.
</P>
<P>
   For Los Alamos, the pace has been further slowed by lawsuits
challenging environmental impact and a dispute between the state
government, which requires that the contents of every container be
itemized, and the Energy Department, which does not agree that
detailed inventories are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said Friday that Los Alamos shipped
714 drums of waste last year, with 252 scheduled to go this year,
1,176 next year, 2,940 in 2002 and increasing numbers in the
following years.
</P>
<P>
   While that leaves the majority of the drums on site for the
foreseeable future, officials from the laboratory and the
department insisted that the containers were well protected,
largely because the recommendations of the environmental impact
study were followed. To add layers of protection, wood was removed
from the perimeter of the laboratory, the tree line was moved back
and dirt pathways were built as a buffer against fires from the
canyons below.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics are not convinced that enough safeguards are in
place, especially with the unpredictable updrafts from the canyons,
which the current fires demonstrated, and the ever-present
possibility of sparks during an intense fire.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Udall, a Democrat whose district includes the
laboratory, said Friday that a recent tour of the laboratory
convinced him that the fire ``was too close for comfort,'' and that
rebuilding efforts _ some older buildings were destroyed _ should
emphasize greater protection against fire and other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Udall also said that the waste removal from Los Alamos was part
of a larger national problem for which Congress has traditionally
authorized only limited spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a national scale,'' he said, ``this is not regarded as a
high risk. But we need to get to the job of cleaning up all over
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos scientist who did not want to be identified added
one further regret. He said he and his colleagues were eager to
return to work next week when the laboratory reopens. But they were
anxious, as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lab is tucked away in what was some of the most beautiful
scenery you've ever seen,'' he said. ``Since the fire, it looks
terrible, and you can't just go out there with a bucket of paint
and fix it. That was slow-growth forest that burned. It will take a
long time to come back to what it was.''

ALEXANDER S. NADAS, TEACHER OF PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGISTS, DIES AT
86 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alexander Sandor Nadas, who trained generations of pediatric
cardiologists at Children's Hospital in Boston and at Harvard
Medical School, died on Tuesday at his home in Needham, Mass. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Nadas, a longtime former resident of Wellesley, Mass., retired
in 1982 as chairman emeritus of the hospital's department of
cardiology and in 1984 as professor emeritus of pediatrics at the
medical school. He had been associated with Children's Hospital
since 1949 and was credited with helping build the department's
national and international renown for the care of children with
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital honored Nadas in
1989 by establishing a professorship in his name. Just days before
he died, the American Heart Association gave him its Paul Dudley
White Award for his work as a pediatric cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Nadas' research centered on cardiovascular physiology and the
physiology of congenital heart disease in children. He was the
author of hundreds of clinical research papers, and wrote four
editions of a textbook for medical students, Pediatric Cardiology,
first published in 1957 by W.B. Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past member of the editorial boards of Circulation, The
American Journal of Cardiology and the Yearbook of Cardiology. He
was active in various professional associations, and was president
of the American Pediatric Society in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Nadas was born in Budapest and graduated from Budapest
Medical School in 1937. He emigrated to the United States in 1938
to pursue his medical career, and trained in New York, Cleveland,
Boston and Detroit, where he received his medical degree from Wayne
State University in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Nadas then spent four years in private practice in Greenfield,
Mass. In 1949 he joined the staff of Children's Hospital. His
association with Harvard Medical School dated to 1950, when he was
appointed an instructor in pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Nadas' wife of 53 years, Elizabeth McClearen Nadas, died in
1994. He is survived by two daughters, Trudi Murch of Phoenix and
Betsy Seamans of Pittsburgh; a son, John A., of Wellesley, and
three grandchildren.

BLAZERS HOPE SATURATION DEFENSE WILL CONTAIN O'NEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ What a daunting task: contending with all
that size, that muscle, the athleticism and the quickness. The
ability to fill the lane, deny access to the rim, contest every
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would say it's a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Shaquille O'Neal certainly could have a rough time against
the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the league MVP, is the biggest, strongest weapon in the
NBA and the Los Angeles Lakers' greatest asset, but he faces
perhaps his greatest challenge in the Western Conference Finals
that open today at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal gets not one huge body to fight through but two or three.
And Portland can reload with a frequency that no other opponent can
match: From Arvydas Sabonis and Rasheed Wallace to Brian Grant and
Jermaine O'Neal, the Trail Blazers can always send strength and
size in pairs.
</P>
<P>
   A daunting task indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got that size,'' said Lakers teammate Ron Harper. ``I
mean, they've got guys the same size as him, almost.''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been the teams that can double-team with two big
men (San Antonio, Sacramento) that fluster O'Neal, and Portland
might have done it best this season. In four games, he averaged
just 20.5 points _ his lowest output against any team that made the
Western Conference playoffs, and nine points below his season
average.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are skewed a bit by O'Neal's fourth-quarter ejection
when the teams met Nov. 6 at the Rose Garden, but even in the other
three games, he scored only 21, 17 and 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to beat the NBA's deepest team. One way or
another, the Lakers know they will need O'Neal to score closer to
the 29.8 points he's averaged in playoff series victories over
Sacramento and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq will get more points this series,'' Harper said. ``I'm
sure about that. He knows we need him. And we're going to keep on
going to Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland knows it. And the Blazers are built to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense starts with the 7-foot-3, 292-pound Sabonis, who
is beefy enough to hold his position on the low post. Then comes
the help. The 6-11, 230-pound Wallace is one of the most agile
power forwards in the league and he's got a nice, long wingspan to
crowd O'Neal's sightlines and passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have a lot of big bodies and they do get away with
more banging than usual,'' O'Neal said, ``but we just have to play
through that and keep playing. . . . This is not a Shaq vs. Sabonis
thing. They have a deep team, they have a very talented team, so
it's vital that we take care of the ball, take high-percentage
shots and just play together. If we do that, we'll be fine. We
match up pretty well with this team and it's going to be an
exciting series.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sabonis gets in foul trouble, and he always does, the
Blazers turn to Grant, a mere 6-9 and 260 pounds but strong and
fearless. Jermaine O'Neal isn't the strongest of defenders, but
he's young, spry and 6-11, 248 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, Sabonis and the activity of some of the other guys
can cause him problems,'' said the Lakers' Derek Fisher. ``but I
think . . . we played them all four times so early in the season
that until that last time we defeated them (Feb. 29), we really
hadn't started to reach our peak as a team and develop our ability
to, when a team is taking certain things away or we're struggling
in a particular area, being able to adjust and still take advantage
of it. So I think we're a little smarter team now, where he might
not score 35 or 40 points, but we'll still figure out ways to make
sure that he's an effective part of our basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland has not only denied O'Neal points, it has taken away
opportunities. On average this season, he made 12 of 21 attempts
per game. But against Portland he averaged just 16 attempts and
eight made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've just got to stay with trying to get the ball
inside, be a little more patient on the offensive end,'' Glen Rice
said. ``I think Shaq is going to move a little bit more in the
paint so he can keep them off balance a little bit. . . . If he
struggles, we definitely have to be there to take up the slack. In
the past when he struggles, we tend to not do the things that we're
capable of doing. But rest assured, we'll be able to do it in the
playoffs.''

   But can the Lakers beat the Blazers if O'Neal is held to 20.5
points a game? ``What did he get in Portland, 23 in a ballgame and
we won?'' Jackson said, referring to the Lakers' 90-87 victory Feb.
29. ``We'll find a way.''

   NEW YORK _ New York state Republicans rushed Friday to ensure
that the party could still mount a serious challenge to Hillary
Rodham Clinton following New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
protracted exit from the Senate contest, rallying around the
candidacy of a little-known Long Island representative as they
contemplated a race whose every dynamic was altered in the space of
a single afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gov. George Pataki, party leaders in New York and
Washington embraced the candidacy of Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, proclaiming him an articulate and telegenic challenger to
Clinton. Lazio declared his candidacy in an e-mail to news
organizations as soon as Giuliani announced his withdrawal, and
moved to assemble a campaign staff, led by Michael Murphy, the
media consultant to John McCain's presidential campaign. And Pataki
said in an interview that he would personally assist Lazio in the
formidable task of raising money for his contest with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a political atmosphere that verged from carnival to chaos
throughout the day, there were sharply different assessments from
Republicans and Democrats about how Lazio (assuming that he wins
his party's support at the convention on May 30) would fare in a
contest against Clinton. But it was undisputed that this second-act
cast change would produce a profoundly different kind of race than
would have been presented by Clinton and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a battle between two celebrities _ candidates
about whom almost every New Yorker had fixed and often intense
opinions _ is now shaping up as a contest between a famous first
lady and a congressman who is barely known outside Suffolk County.
And what had been a competition between two people with fairly
similar views on issues that tend to be determinative in New York,
among them abortion and gun control, is now between two candidates
who occupy starkly different places on the ideological spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans like Pataki, who was never particularly happy
with Giuliani in the first place, Lazio, he said, represented a
fresh and unencumbered challenger to Clinton. Pataki described
Lazio as a four-term member of Congress whose record could appeal
to moderate New Yorkers, an attractive television presence, and a
valuable base smack in the heart of the New York suburbs. Perhaps
even more significant, Lazio is not the polarizing figure that
Giuliani was, robbing Clinton of one of the advantages she enjoyed
in her contest with the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki _ who was once an unknown state senator from Peekskill,
bringing what many people viewed in 1994 as a far-fetched challenge
to Mario Cuomo _ chuckled at the notion that Lazio would be hurt by
his obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be a very strong candidate,'' Pataki said in the
interview. ``We will have a very good philosophical debate on
issues, with two candidates with competing philosophies. There are
no questions in my mind that the overwhelming majority of New
Yorkers will agree with Rick Lazio and not with Clinton. Not to
mention that Rick Lazio is a New Yorker. He is one of us. He
doesn't have to learn what it is to be a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, Lazio was an untested and barely known candidate
with a conservative voting record, faced with the formidable task
of getting a full-fledged campaign organization financed and
running, and getting himself known to New Yorkers. And Clinton's
aides moved to define Lazio to New Yorkers before he could. They
noted that he favored a ban on late-term abortion and voted for
much of the Contract With America as they invoked his affiliation
with Newt Gingrich, the departed House speaker, and reprised a
tried and trued line of attack in New York, most recently in
Charles Schumer's successful challenge to Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani, for whatever vulnerabilities he had, did present a
problem for us in terms of having a relatively good record on
issues like abortion, gun control and the environment,'' Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview. ``Now New
Yorkers will have a very clear distinction. He is a genuinely
conservative candidate. It's a fundamentally different race.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Rick Lazio is a clean slate that remains to be
written on. Hillary Clinton has the resources to do it.''

</P>
<P>
   For Republicans across the state, who had waited with increasing
consternation for Giuliani to act, it was a day of relief, anxiety
about the future and occasional displays of irritation at the way
Giuliani had handled these last few weeks. In that time, he had
announced that he had prostate cancer; was involved with another
woman, an Upper East Side consultant for a pharmaceutical firm; and
was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been viewed with suspicion among Republicans since
he campaigned with Cuomo against Pataki in 1994. Giuliani's
announcement came so late that the Republican Party had already
printed thousands of ``Rudy'' placards for the convention at the
end of May, a point several Republicans noted acidly Friday. What
is more, Lazio is giving up a congressional seat that Democrats
could well capture in November.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the mayor has any interest in running for office in the
future is an open question, he said Friday. Giuliani's aides have
suggested that the mayor might want to run for governor in 2002.
They acknowledged that he has as much riding on Lazio's winning
this race as Lazio does himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on what plays out,'' said Stephen Minarik, the
Republican Party chairman in Monroe County, discussing Giuliani's
future status. ``He is on tenuous ground with some Republicans
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's advisers Friday described Lazio's candidacy as
uphill, in no small part because of his late start. ``It's going to
be a very difficult campaign,'' a Giuliani adviser said. ``The
Clinton campaign has had a year's head start.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton have each spent nearly a year setting up
the basic instruments of a campaign. Lazio needs to set up an
office, hire staff, and raise money; he has $3.5 million now,
compared with $9 million for Clinton. Presumably, Giuliani could
help in that regard, since he has $9.2 million on hand that could
be funneled through the Republican Party. The mayor said Friday he
wanted to help as much as possible, but would have to study the
financial and legal possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio does not have one of the main advantages that Giuliani
brought into the race against Clinton: the ability to draw votes in
New York City. He also has a long history of votes in Congress,
which Clinton's campaign has been cataloging for weeks now to use
in speeches and advertisements that will seek to portray him as ``a
foot soldier of Newt Gingrich,'' as one Clinton's aides put it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, running for Senate is entirely different than from
running for the House. Clinton has spent much of the past year
traveling the state, and the results of that are clearly apparent
in her increasing command of New York issues and ease on the
campaign trail, in contrast with her difficult start.
</P>
<P>
   This is Lazio's first statewide race for office, and he is not
going to have the luxury of time to learn the task, several
Democrats noted. And because he is the choice being offered by
Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William Powers, he is
vulnerable to portrayal by Democrats as the party machine
candidate, an attack that Cuomo sought to use against Pataki, who
was elected to a second term in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, Lazio clearly comes into this with several
advantages, a point that many Republicans made throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in many ways, this is certainly not insurmountable,
and I think it presents Hillary Clinton with a whole new set of
problems,'' said Rep. John Sweeney, whose district stretches from
the Hudson Valley to the Adirondacks.

 &HT;    AARP seeks diversity in its membership and its mission
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ They say the times they are a-changing for the
largest association of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This week the AARP held its 15th and likely last ever national
convention. Next week Bob Dylan turns 59 and the AARP embarks on a
mission to capture his generation _ one more interested in hip
topics than hip replacements.
</P>
<P>
   Like a divorcee bent on a new life, first to go was the name.
The American Association of Retired Persons recently became nothing
more than its acronym as the organization realized that almost half
of its membership was not retired and a good percentage wasn't
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are over the hill, we certainly have picked up steam
going downhill,'' said Horace Deets, the former Catholic
priest-turned-executive director of the 34 million-member AARP. He
delivered his address from the group's national convention this
week at the Orange County Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to the top of the hill for the organization is
storied, somewhat sordid history.
</P>
<P>
   AARP was founded in 1958 when a retiree named Ethel Percy Andrus
discovered that insurance companies discriminated against older
people, including friends from her own California Retired Teachers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Andrus soon found Palm Beach insurance magnate Leonard Davis,
who offered $50,000 in seed money that established Colonial Penn
Insurance Co. Millions signed up for the insurance with the
endorsement of the American Association of Retired Persons, and the
non-profit organization reaped benefits in the form of a royalty
that was then poured back into programs for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1978, a ``60 Minutes'' television report painted AARP as
a front for the insurance corporation and an outraged membership
subsequently dropped Colonial Penn for Prudential Insurance Co.
More recently, the organization has aligned itself with United
Health Care Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are still drawn to insurance packages and discounts on
cruises and hotels but the organization acknowledges such ``member
services'' are no longer enough.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech before the convention last week, Deets noted that
AARP's potential membership base is expanding at the edges _ there
are ever-more people 50-plus on the horizon and more people are
living beyond age 85 every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of the 21st Century is: What do we do with this
longevity bonus?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   About 18,000 seniors Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday used part
of theirs attending the convention _ billed as ``AARP Celebrates
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Most came to wander an exhibition hall largely filled with the
type of do-dads and giveaways that litter any corporate convention
hall. There were travel and insurance come-ons common of old-style
AARP gatherings. And salesmen hawked recreational vehicles, foot
massagers and vitamin caplets aimed at an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also a curious blend of new-age sights clearly
aimed at the 50-something market.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner, yoga instructor Ronni Diamond stood on one foot
to demonstrate how serenity can improve your golf swing. About 50
polo-shirted men and women hung on every word.
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall, acupuncturists competed for attention with
universities, each hoping to capture members' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneous educational workshops included a ``baby boomer
track'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Social responsibility in a diverse world,'' with entertainer
Harry Belafonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making time for fun and frolic,'' with Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discovering your entrepreneurial spirit,'' with ice cream
icons Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a misconception that this is a seniors
organization,'' said attendee Theresa Contino. ``We want to attract
younger people.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, most of the conventioneers appeared to be in their
60s and 70s. That may be because working men and women in their 50s
would have a hard time getting away for a three-day mid-week
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The organization not only wants to be younger, but also more
diverse. A number of high-profile presenters last week represented
ethnic minority groups, including poet Maya Angelou and Raul
Yzaguirre, president of the Hispanic National Council of La Raza.
Some say the effort has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could count the blacks at the last two conventions,'' said
Sheryl Clayton, a black woman from East St. Louis, Ill. ``This is
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 23 state offices but there will be one in
every state by the end of the year, according to AARP spokeswoman
Kathy Marma.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will change, too, Marma said. AARP hasn't yet set
a date or place for the next national convention, and Marma said it
likely will be replaced by a set of regional gatherings.

CHINA TRADE BILL EDGES CLOSER TO APPROVAL IN HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mo., Mich., Calif., Colo., N.Y., Ohio, Mass., Ill., Fla.,
Ky.)  By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opponents of a decisive China trade bill refused to
admit defeat on Friday and vowed to step up their lobbying over the
weekend. But growing signs indicated that barring an unforeseen
shift in votes or provocation by Beijing against Taiwan, the
measure was edging toward victory.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders expressed confidence that the
legislation to grant China permanent normal trading privileges was
on track for passage, and they scheduled a vote for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for approval increased Friday as supporters outlined
details of a bipartisan agreement to monitor Beijing's human rights
record, and agreed to fold the monitoring provisions into a single
package with the upgraded trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement should attract at least six
Republicans and 10 to 15 Democrats who otherwise would have voted
against the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proposal is a hard-fought compromise that should help us
in the House pass permanent trade relations with China,'' Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert said in giving the House Republican leadership's
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said publicly that they were still a
few votes shy of the 218 needed for passage, but privately they
expressed confidence that the goal was well within reach. President
Clinton and members of his Cabinet, including Commerce Secretary
William M. Daley, will continue to make calls to wavering lawmakers
this weekend, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Friday night that it was canceling a
short, prime-time television address on China that Clinton was to
give on Sunday night. White House officials said Democrats who
supported the measure or were undecided had told them a speech now
would come too late to influence any lawmakers and would only put
additional strains on House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the 211 House Democrats are expected to oppose the
bill, leaving its passage in the hands of Republicans, who are
expected to deliver about 150 votes in favor.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had delivered his speech on Sunday, it would have put
overwhelming pressure on the House Democratic leader, Richard A.
Gephardt, to deliver a rebuttal.

<P>
   Since Gephardt announced his opposition a month ago, he has
studiously played a behind-the-scenes role, leaving the public
lobbying job to the No. 2 House Democrat, David E. Bonior of
Michigan. ``It's a division of labor that's worked,'' said Peggy
Taylor, the AFL-CIO's chief Washington lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt fears that taking a more aggressive stance would worsen
tensions among Democrats, and threaten his goal of reclaiming the
House this fall and becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, Gephardt has quietly stepped up his
activity, in part because more members are seeking him out before
the vote next week. Gephardt said Friday on National Public Radio,
``I'm going to talk to everybody I can.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Gephardt was breaking his pledge not to lobby
actively against the measure, Rep. Robert T. Matsui of California,
a Democratic vote-counter in favor of the bill, said, ``No, not
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But a prime-time speech by Clinton would have pushed Gephardt
dangerously close to crossing that line, Democratic aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say passage would allow American companies to benefit
fully from a market-opening agreement connected with China's bid to
enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions, some religious leaders, environmental groups and
veterans' organizations oppose the bill because of China's record
on human rights and labor standards, and fears of job losses in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of the undecided diminished on Friday. Supporters
picked up Diana L. DeGette of Colorado, John J. LaFalce of New
York, Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio and Martin T. Meehan of
Massachusetts, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents won over Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey, Rod R.
Blagojevich of Illinois, Karen McCarthy of Missouri, Peter Deutsch
of Florida and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, all Democrats;
and Harold Rogers of Kentucky and Steven C. LaTourette of Ohio,
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, most opponents were putting on a brave face on Friday.
``I don't think either side has a majority, but at this point we're
in the lead,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But other foes were more fatalistic, especially as business
groups promised to ratchet up their advertising campaigns. Rep.
Gene Taylor, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi who opposes
the measure, said, ``Have you ever seen big money lose?''

PROSECUTORS PUSH FOR DEATH PENALTY IN RAILWAY KILLER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RAD SALLEE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Prosecutors used gruesome pictures and emotional
testimony Friday to drive home the message to jurors that, mentally
ill or not, multiple killer Angel Maturino Resendiz is too
dangerous to live and deserves to die.
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors cast stony glances at the defendant, who sat
attentively and expressionless through it all, turning occasionally
to speak to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the seven-woman, five-man jury convicted Maturino
Resendiz, 41, of capital murder in the Dec. 17, 1998, bludgeoning
of Dr. Claudia Benton in her West University Place home near
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz had confessed to killing Benton and eight
others, but pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Defense
psychiatrists described him as a paranoid schizophrenic who
believes that he is half-angel, half-man who kills at God's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   After being convicted, Maturino Resendiz said in court that he
would rather die than be imprisoned for life, and asked his lawyers
not to cross-examine witnesses or argue on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner objected to the most gruesome
photos but otherwise mounted no defense.
</P>
<P>
   To sentence Maturino Resendiz to death, the jury must find him a
continuing threat to society, with no mitigating circumstances to
justify a life sentence, the only alternative under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Before convicting him, jurors were told about his eight other
victims but saw only detailed evidence from the Benton case.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Dominguez, 29, of Phoenix described how he searched the
southeast Houston duplex of his sister, Noemi, 26, when she failed
to join him in Dallas for an animated cartoon convention in June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms were in disarray, with big piles of clothes and
bedding on the floor, and her car was gone. Finding no sign of his
sister, he realized he should look under the pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lifted the quilt that my mother had made for her, and a few
articles of clothing. I saw my sister,'' he said. ``I jumped back
and I think I shrieked.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, a Rice University graduate and schoolteacher, was
face down and partly nude, her head mangled. The pattern was
repeated in photos of some of Maturino Resendiz's other victims.
All lived near railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   After Maturino Resendiz's arrest, items of Noemi Dominguez's
jewelry, including a cross, a ``Return of the Jedi'' pin and a
spider ring, were found in Maturino Resendiz's home in Rodeo,
Mexico. Alex Dominguez identified the items in court.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Vacek of Schulenburg, Texas, wept as she testified about
finding the body of her mother, Josephine Konvicka, 73, under the
covers in her bed.
</P>
<P>
   A photo showed a garden tool embedded in her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Experts later testified that they found Dominguez's blood on the
blade, indicating that Maturino Resendiz had carried the
pickax-like ``grubbing hoe'' with him from Houston to Schulenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Neely of Weimar, Texas, a few miles from Schulenberg, told
how he waited on Sunday, May 7, 1999, for Pastor Norman ``Skip''
Sirnic and his wife, Karen, to show up for church.
</P>
<P>
   On duty as a ``greeter'' at the church door, Neely said, he knew
that Sirnic always preached an 8:30 a.m. sermon at a nearby church,
then drove hurriedly to the 9:30 service at Weimar United Church of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not appear, the service went on while Neely searched
the parsonage next door.
</P>
<P>
   A police videotape shows the Sirnics' nude bodies lying side by
side in bed, their faces crushed with a sledgehammer Maturino
Resendiz found in a utility room.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's truck turned up in San Antonio, and some of their
jewelry was found at Maturino Resendiz's home.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's last testimony, Randy Kennedy, police chief of
Hughes Springs, Texas, near Texarkana, described finding the body
of his neighbor, Leafie Mason, 87.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he went to check when Mason did not show up at the
local nursing home to visit her retarded sister, Birdie, whom she
had lived with and cared for as long as she could.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's body was under a pile of blankets on the floor. An
antique flatiron, its handle broken off, is thought to be the
murder weapon, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz was tied to the crime by a palm print Kennedy
noticed on a windowpane. Seeing a storm coming that could wash away
the print, he called a lumber company and had them cut out the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, prosecutors Ted Wilson and Devon Anderson expect to
call their last witnesses, including the girlfriend of Christopher
Maier, a college student beaten to death in Lexington, Ky., in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend was beaten and raped, and will be the only
eyewitness against Maturino Resendiz.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Bill Harmon advised jurors to bring their
overnight bags Monday, because they may be sequestered to
deliberate punishment.

FDA PANEL URGES CAUTION IN USE OF 2 MORE DIABETES DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ At an unusual meeting convened by the Food and
Drug Administration to discuss its decision in March to take the
diabetes drug Rezulin off the market, doctors warned that patients
taking two newer, related drugs, Avandia and Actos, should also be
checked carefully for signs of liver trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out, watch out,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, a researcher at
Rockefeller University and a member of the expert panel that
advised the FDA about Rezulin. ``I would monitor them to beat the
band.''
</P>
<P>
   The newer drugs, both approved last year to treat type 2
diabetes, are thought to be safer than Rezulin, but doctors have
urged caution because they belong to the same class as Rezulin,
known as ``glitazones.'' All three drugs help to lower blood sugar
by improving the body's ability to use insulin. Rezulin was the
first of this class, and it was hailed by many diabetics and their
doctors when it was introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Rezulin, made by Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert,
caused 90 cases of liver failure and drug agency scientists said
Friday they still did not know how the drug damaged the liver, or
how to identify people who might be especially vulnerable to such
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Avandia has been linked to two cases of liver failure, but one
of the patients had also taken Rezulin. One patient died, and the
other recovered without a transplant. No cases of liver failure
have been reported with Actos.
</P>
<P>
   Patients taking the newer drugs are supposed to have blood tests
to check their liver function before starting treatment, repeat the
tests every two months during the first year of treatment and then
continue regular testing at intervals determined by their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Rezulin was initially marketed in 1997 without instructions for
liver function tests. Testing recommendations were added after
problems became apparent, but later surveys by the FDA showed that
few patients were getting the required tests. Doctors say some, but
not all, of the cases of liver failure might have been prevented by
regular testing. Some cases occurred in people who were being
tested regularly but suddenly developed liver failure between
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 90 patients with liver failure, 63 died. Nearly 2 million
people had taken the drug at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   Although Actos and Avandia are marketed for use in most patients
with type 2 diabetes, Hirsch said they should be used only when
other treatments have failed. He said he was concerned about the
newer drugs because many patients taking them had successfully
taken Rezulin, and had switched only because Rezulin was pulled off
the market. The fact that they had been able to take Rezulin safely
might mean that they are not susceptible to problems from the newer
drugs. That pool of patients, whom Hirsch called ``Rezulin
survivors,'' might make Actos and Avandia appear safer than they
really are, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as more and more new patients who have never tried a
glitazone drug take Actos and Avandia, problems could show up,
Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of the agency's Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, said that if liver problems occurred
in patients on Actos or Avandia who had already taken Rezulin, it
would be difficult to figure out which of the drugs was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials do not normally convene meetings to discuss drugs
that they have already taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The agency pulled Rezulin without consulting its advisory panel,
which in March of 1999 had recommended leaving the drug on the
market, with restrictions. Panel members were invited to Friday's
meeting, and some expressed puzzlement over the purpose of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lumpkin said the purpose was partly to reassure panel members
that the agency had not disregarded their views. He explained and
defended the agency's decision, saying that Rezulin was kept on the
market even after problems developed because it seemed to be
helping more patients than it harmed. But once apparently safer
alternatives became available, he said, Rezulin was ``outmoded.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision was criticized by several doctors who spoke at
the meeting, saying the agency had acted in haste, and had taken a
valuable drug away from their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Personal-injury lawyers also offered criticism, insisting that
the agency had not acted fast enough, and should have pulled
Rezulin sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Lumpkin said the fact that liver problems quickly became
apparent represented a success of the agency's system for
collecting reports of adverse effects from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said, ``It's also a failure of the system. A bunch of
people died.''

RICE NOT KEY INGREDIENT IN RECIPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ His Los Angeles Lakers teammates trotted
out a couple of new variations on the Glen Rice theme Friday, as
practice broke up on the eve of the playoff showdown with the
Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   This was from Shaquille O'Neal: ``It's going to be our job to
get Glen more involved.'' And this was from Ron Harper: ``Glen?
It's not about him, it's about us. We've got to get him more
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Haven't we heard this before?
</P>
<P>
   On the court, in the 14 months since the 6-foot-8 jump shooter
joined the Lakers in a trade, his teammates haven't seemed to know
what to do with the vague concept of getting Rice ``involved.'' In
the locker room, though, they've always known what to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's always something along the lines of: ``Involving Glen is a
priority if we want to win.'' Or: ``We're working on promoting the
involvement of Glen.'' Or: ``Glen? Involved? A capital idea!''
</P>
<P>
   More than a year now and they haven't figured out how to do it.
Now you doubt they ever will.
</P>
<P>
   If you're nostalgic, watch Rice closely in the games ahead. He
is eligible for free agency this summer. These could be his last
13.9 points as a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   His shot is off target, his chances to shoot have declined, and
as a necessary result his playoff scoring is way down _ after his
regular-season scoring hit a 10-year low at 15.9 a game.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, he doesn't complain, and to their credit, neither
do the Lakers. This is no time for a member of a potential champion
to talk about his individual disappointments, and no time for the
front office to talk about a disappointing individual.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice can't be happy about his time in Los Angeles, where the
ex-All-Star and one-time 26-points-a-game scorer is a distant third
option behind O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Lakers believe they got what they expected when they
sent Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell to the Charlotte Hornets to get
J.R. Reid and a certain outside-shooting threat in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the Lakers' playoff media guide is adorned with a
posed photo of (left to right) O'Neal, Bryant and Rice. Move Rice a
little more to the right (off the page) and you get the real
picture.
</P>
<P>
   As reticent as Rice has been on the subject of his contentment
and future, he did reveal a little Friday afternoon when he was
asked if his 1999-2000 season has been different than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Rice emitted a quick laugh, ran his right hand over the stubble
on his scalp, and said: ``It has been different. But at the same
time, if you look at where we are as a team, I'm satisfied with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He had said earlier that his reduced role didn't diminish his
enjoyment of the longest playoff run of a 10-year NBA career with
Miami, Charlotte and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think team first,'' said Rice, who will be playing in his
first conference championship series. ``It's not an individual
thing. If we win a championship, good things will come to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   If they win the championship, Rice will own an NBA ring to go
with the NCAA-title jewelry he earned with Michigan. Then he might
correctly ask himself if it's worth sticking around.
</P>
<P>
   He's known as a proud fellow, and he must have been insulted
last summer when the Lakers merely picked up the $7 million option
on his contract and didn't address his wish for $14 million a year.
Even though the Lakers will have the salary-cap freedom to raise
his salary, Rice might get closer to his eight-figure request with
another team.
</P>
<P>
   He's a shooter by nature _ the Big Ten's all-time leading scorer
at the time he left Michigan, the NBA's third-most-prolific 3-point
shooter. If he wants to get back to that, he'll have to get out of
Shaq's and Kobe's shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Name another ``vital cog'' whose team went 16-3 when he scored
10 or fewer points this season.
</P>
<P>
   None of this appears to be Rice's fault or his teammates'. He
wants to score more. They'd love him to score more. But sometimes
these things just don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something changes fast _ in this series, or in the next,
if there is a next _ the next time we see him, Rice will be
involved with another team. &QL;

CHALLENGE TO AN ISLAMIC MYTH ON ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AS AILMENTS RISE
</HEADLINE>
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Even now, six months after her decision, Najah
Bazzy's family is still upset with her. Her 14-year-old daughter
pleads with her to reconsider. Older relatives fear that she has
offended God.
</P>
<P>
   But Bazzy is resolute. When she dies, her heart, liver, kidney
and lungs will be donated. While thousands of other people have
made the decision to sign organ donor cards or become live donors,
Bazzy's declaration is controversial. As an Arab-American Muslim,
she is part of a community that ardently believes it is forbidden
for Muslims to donate organs, even to a relative. To see Heaven,
they say, their bodies must return to God in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   These days, that notion is being challenged as increasing
numbers of Arab-Americans here in what is perhaps their largest and
most influential community in the United States, as well as their
relatives back home, are found to have liver and kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying in Islam: He who saves a life saves
humanity,'' said Bazzy, a 40-year-old Lebanese transcultural nurse
who is spearheading an initiative to include in Islamic wills a
section for organ donations. ``Why are we so eager to take our
organs with us and give up the opportunity to save a life? How do I
know I'm not depriving the world of a genius?''
</P>
<P>
   That is why religious leaders are rallying with doctors and
community outreach workers to dispel a decades-old myth that the
Koran forbids organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the International Association for Organ
Donation, a year-old nonprofit organization founded by a former
marketing executive whose teen-age son was battling kidney disease,
has started an education campaign. By introducing reluctant donors
to Arab-American patients waiting for transplants and by holding
dinners, distributing posters, bumper stickers and T-shirts, the
group hopes to sign up thousands of the more than 275,000 Arabs
here and in parts of Detroit. Doctors say organ transplants between
relatives or people of the same ethnicity have a higher rate of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Islamic taboo banning the donation of organs,''
said Imam Hassan Qzawani, who heads the Islamic Center of America,
which has more than 8,000 members and is one Detroit's largest
mosques. ``People have reservations because it was not practiced in
the old countries and because of Islam's strict guidelines about
disfiguring the body. But as long as you're not giving your eyes or
an organ that is needed for one's own survival, we have the right
to help save someone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadia Hammoud, 29, tried desperately last year to persuade her
father to accept a kidney from his son. But he opted for a cadaver
donation, which later failed. ``He would have waited another eight
years rather than take it from my brother,'' Hammoud said.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, about 20 people are waiting for either a kidney or
liver transplant, said the Gift of Life Transplant Society of
Michigan, which only last year started studying Arabs as a separate
group. In the last six years, only one Arab-American donated an
organ in Michigan, though at least a dozen have received
transplants, doctors and organ donation researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 69,399 patients waiting for organ transplants in the
United States, it is unclear how many are Arabs. The United Network
for Organ Sharing, in Richmond, Va., which oversees transplants in
the United States, traditionally counts Arabs as Caucasian, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joanna El Hajj, a health care coordinator at the Arab
Community Center for Economics and Social Service, said she only
needed to pick up her telephone to know that the numbers were
growing. The calls come with frightening frequency, El Hajj says.
Almost every day she is talking to someone, or the relative of
someone, waiting for a kidney, liver or bone marrow transplant. The
center routinely sponsors fund-raisers to help patients across the
country pay medical bills and bring sick relatives to the United
States for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, I would get maybe one call, two calls,'' said
El Hajj, who recently decided to become a donor. ``Now, every day
there is a new case. I get calls from Tulsa, from Boston, Maryland,
Jordan, Iraq. We can't continue to ignore what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hajj, who received a heart tissue transplant 26 years ago in
London, has a theory about the increase in need. ``We're seeing the
aftereffects of war, I believe. A lot of the people who are coming,
they lived through the chemical pollution of the civil wars in Iraq
and Lebanon. It's like in Vietnam when they sprayed the gases, you
only see the effects over a period.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the Arab population is merely in the midst
of growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have an immigrant community this large, eventually
they will develop the same disease as the larger population,'' said
Marwan Aboujould, director of transplant surgery at the Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit. ``The problem is that medical technology and
the population have surpassed the community's education. That can
be as hard to overcome as issues of culture and faith.''

TAIWAN'S NEW LEADER ENDS DECADES OF NATIONALIST PARTY RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Chen Shui-bian was sworn in as president of
Taiwan on Saturday morning, a landmark for Taiwan's democracy but
the start of a risky period in relations between this prospering
island of 23 million people and a strengthening Chinese mainland
that claims Taiwan as its own.
</P>
<P>
   With his inauguration Saturday, Chen ended 50 years of rule _
much of it under martial law _ by the Nationalist Party that fled
from the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has
long advocated Taiwan's independence from China, Chen won a
three-way race in March, in the island's second election of a
national leader.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds Lee Teng-hui, 77, the flamboyant Nationalist who
became world famous for ushering democracy to Taiwan but whose
recent tenure was increasingly tainted by his party's vote-buying
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first peaceful transition of power from one
political party to another in Taiwanese history and probably in all
of Chinese history,'' said Wu Yu-shan, a political scientist at
National Taiwan University, in words that have not lost their
wonder to Taiwanese even though they have been repeated often since
Chen's victory. ``But this triumph is being overshadowed by the
prospect of deep tension across the Taiwan Straits.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief ceremony inside the presidential palace a few minutes
after 9 a.m., Chen bowed before a picture of Sun Yat-sen _ who is
claimed by both the Taiwanese and the mainland governments' as
founding father _ then pledged to uphold the Constitution and was
handed the national seal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ceremony capped the storybook rise of Chen, 49, whose
intelligence and preternatural determination took him from
mud-house poverty to success as a corporate attorney before he
became involved, in 1979, in the dissident movement against the
Nationalists' authoritarian rule. He became a star of the
opposition after his election as mayor of Taipei in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Lu, 55, was sworn in as vice president. She is an
outspoken feminist and advocate of Taiwan independence with a law
degree from Harvard who spent more than five years in Nationalist
prisons in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Chen called for Taiwan's formal independence
from the mainland _ a step that Beijing has repeatedly said would
bring a military attack. Seeking to broaden his appeal among the
worried electorate and to placate the United States, which is
pledged to help defend Taiwan but does not want to be drawn into
war, Chen has moderated his position, though not enough to mollify
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen now says that since Taiwan already functions like a state
it does not need to declare independence. He has held out olive
branches to Beijing, proposing to talk about strengthened commerce
and even about the meaning of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing officials have expressed growing impatience with Chen's
refusal to accept their absolute precondition for any talks _ that
Taiwan is part of a single China.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Communist Party's flagship paper,
People's Daily, said that Chen has ``adopted an evasive and defiant
posture'' over the one-China principle and that his friendly
gestures ``lack sincerity.'' It reminded him that ``matters of
sovereignty are not for negotiation.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent months, China has warned that indefinite delay in
progress toward unity may be grounds for military action.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony Saturday, the international turnout provided a
stark reminder of China's relative power and its campaign to
isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Listed as attending were only four
heads of state _ from Swaziland, Nicaragua, Palau and Nauru _
countries drawn from fewer than 30 states that have dared to
recognize Taiwan in return for its financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   Representing President Clinton was Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a
former White House adviser. Although the United States sells
defensive weapons to Taiwan and has strong economic ties, senior
U.S. officials do not visit, because the United States, by
agreement with Beijing, does not grant formal recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political status and relations with Beijing are always
central issues here. But Chen's strongest mandate from the
election, analysts say, was in domestic affairs, especially to
start cleaning up corruption in politics, including growing ties
between local Nationalist politicians and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   As he takes on these and other issues, Chen will be operating in
what for Taiwan is the novel territory of a divided government.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Chen received less than a majority of votes in the election and
faces a legislature dominated by the Nationalists. Experts give him
good marks for cobbling together a multiparty cabinet that may
blunt some opposition. But many still wonder whether he can govern
with any force in a jumbled system of presidential and
parliamentary institutions that in the past was always controlled
by one disciplined party.
</P>
<P>
   In what many people here regarded as a master stroke, Chen
persuaded the former Nationalist defense minister and a retired
general, Tang Fei, to serve as prime minister. Tang is one of
several holdovers in the national security field, a deliberate
effort to assure various parties _ China, the United States and the
Taiwanese _ that Chen will not act rashly to incite China.
</P>
<P>
   Tang's powers relative to the president's are not clearly
defined, and he has lately been suffering complications from
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The cabinet includes a mix of Nationalists, members of Chen's
party and others. But divisive questions have already been raised
within the Nationalist and the Democratic Progressive parties about
the party loyalty of those in the cabinet, and the extent to which
they should follow Chen's lead on issues.

<P>
   Since Lee, the outgoing president, was forced from his job as
Nationalist Party leader, the Nationalists have been in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A new third party, led by James Soong, a former Nationalist, is
struggling to lure supporters from the legislative ranks and define
its role. And the Democratic Progressives have begun squabbling as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new government is going to be somewhat messy and
incoherent,'' said Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson
College in North Carolina who gives Chen high marks under difficult
circumstances. ``Chen is trying to put together a government that
can actually govern, and he had to violate the conventional rules
of party politics.''

SERB OPPOSITION LEADERS TO SEEK HELP IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The leaders of Serbia's political
opposition finally emerged from their private meetings and spoke to
their supporters Friday night, telling a rally of fewer than 5,000
people that they would fly to Moscow next week and ask Russia to
help moderate the policies of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to some an odd gesture from the opposition, just three
days after Milosevic's government seized the main opposition
television station, Belgrade's Studio B, and silenced independent
broadcasting in the capital, including radio B2-92.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, leader of the main opposition party, the
Socialist Renewal Movement, returned from Montenegro to appeal for
calm, saying, ``No television station or government authority is
worth a single life.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, announced a
large rally to be held in Belgrade next Saturday. ``We will see who
is bigger,'' he said. ``We'll see if they send cordons of police
against a million people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he made no mention of the plans he says he favors for
widespread civil disobedience to protest government's moves against
the independent media, and it seemed highly unlikely that a million
people _ more than five times the size of Belgrade's biggest rally
in the last two years _ would turn out here.
</P>
<P>
   There were scattered clashes with the police on the first two
nights of rallies, with up to 150 injured nationwide, including at
least four police officers, and 40 people detained. But on Friday
night, both sides seemed listless, and there was no confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, appealing for peaceful resistance, said that he,
Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party and Vojislav Kostunica,
leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, would go to Moscow, a
traditional Serbian ally, late next week and hoped to see President
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's government has promised Milosevic energy aid and loans,
and recently was host to Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and
Defense Minister Dragoljub Ojdanic, who has been indicted on
charges of war crimes in Kosovo. But Putin's government has also
been host to Draskovic and high-ranking Serbian Orthodox leaders
opposed to Milosevic in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Draskovic said that Russia was the only
country that could influence Milosevic and to which the opposition
could appeal without being accused of toadying to NATO, which
bombed Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After NATO's aggression against Serbia, the majority of Serbs
are very, very disappointed by the fact that NATO, including our
traditional allies, bombed our country without even a formal
decision of Security Council of the United Nations,'' Draskovic
said. ``Our people don't accept so frankly initiatives from the
Western countries who bombed us, and secondly, Russia opposes
sanctions against our state and nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic hastened to say that he was not an enemy of the United
States or Europe, but he urged them to stop suggesting new
sanctions against Serbia in response to the seizure of Studio B,
the station his party controlled until three days ago. ``Serbia is
now like a gulag,'' he said. ``We need to break down the outer wall
of the prison built by our American and European friends. After
that, democracy will come more easily to Serbia.''
</P>

<P>
   The party of Milosevic's wife, the Yugoslav United Left, part of
the ruling coalition, said Friday that it was preparing a new law
against terrorism that is widely expected to be used against the
opposition, including the student movement Otpor, or Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The new law is said to be largely based on the British law
against terrorism used in Northern Ireland that allows detention
without trial. Predrag Simic, a Draskovic adviser, said
sardonically Friday night, ``We can now say that the regime is
taking something from the West.''

NRA PLANS TIMES SQUARE RESTAURANT AND ARCADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With GUNS-NRA) 
By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Rifle Association plans to open a theme
restaurant and a game arcade in Times Square, a move that has
outraged gun-control advocates and astonished redevelopment
officials.
</P>
<P>
   At its national convention Friday in Charlotte, N.C., the NRA
said it was negotiating to open a restaurant called NRASports
Grille, featuring ``a wild game menu and fresh mineral waters from
around the world.'' The group said it also planned an adjacent
electronic-game arcade and gift store called NRASports Blast, which
it described as ``an exciting total shooting sports and sporting
goods experience.''
</P>
<P>
   William Powers, the NRA's director of public affairs, was not
specific about the plans, but said in a telephone interview that
the Times Square project would ``open sooner rather than later.''
He said the project would be ``big, very big.'' He compared it to
similar ventures by the World Wrestling Federation, which has a
Times Square restaurant and gift store, and Planet Hollywood, the
pop-culture theme restaurant on West 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said the gift store would not sell guns.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's plans quickly drew criticism. ``This is ludicrous,''
said Kimberly Mariani, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control, a
lobbying group in Washington. ``The very New Yorkers who have
worked to reduce their crime rate don't want the NRA coming into
Times Square and glorifying the gun culture. Now, not only their
policies will leave a bad taste in your mouth, but their food as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business
Improvement District, which provides business consulting, security
and other services to businesses in Times Square, said he was
surprised by the NRA's plans, which were first reported Friday by
the Daily News, and expressed mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're entitled to be in Times Square and it's my job to
treat them as a neighbor,'' Sexton said. ``But symbolically and
philosophically, it's very hard to look on a business whose focus
is shooting and feel that this is a happy development.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Real estate brokers familiar with Times Square who said they
were not involved in the negotiations said the NRA has been looking
for space for more than a year and that its interest has focused on
1530 Broadway, near 45th Street, the site of the Criterion movie
theater and Sbarro, an Italian-food cafeteria. That block of
Broadway also has some of Times Square's most prominent billboards,
including Liz Claiborne and Jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Moss, Jr., an owner of B.S. Moss Enterprises, the
landlord of 1530 Broadway, denied that he was negotiating with the
NRA. ``I've never spoken to them and I would not be interested in
speaking to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A broker who is said to be familiar with the negotiations
described the NRA as seeking 45,000 to 55,000 square feet on at
least two floors, one of them at street level.
</P>
<P>
   Rents for that area run $275 to $300 per square foot on street
level and $50 a foot for basement or second-floor space. At those
rates, that broker said, the NRA might pay annual rent of more than
$7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, the NRA spokesman, would not confirm that the group was
looking at 1530 Broadway, but said that the figure of $7 million
was not daunting and that the NRA was determined to develop the
project, with partners if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent like that didn't stop the WWF or Planet Hollywood and it
won't stop us,'' Powers said. The NRA has 3.6 million members and
an annual operating budget of $150 million. &QL;

U.S. COURT UPHOLDS LIMITS ON SIZE OF CABLE OPERATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Friday upheld the
constitutionality of a law that sets limits on the size of a cable
company. The ruling strengthens the hand of the government as it
completes its review of the largest merger in the cable television
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals here reversed a lower
court opinion that had found the law violated the First Amendment.
The lower court decision had cast a cloud over the pending review
by regulators of AT&AMP;T's proposed merger of MediaOne, which, when
completed, will catapult the company to the top of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The rules by the Federal Communications Commission limit cable
ownership to 30 percent of the market, and by some estimates, the
combined company would control about 40 percent or more of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, the court said
that in writing the law, Congress ``drew reasonable inferences,
based upon substantial evidence, that increases in the
concentration of cable operators threatened diversity and
competition in the cable industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the FCC said they would be completing the
examination of the AT&AMP;T deal shortly. The agency immediately lifted
a stay it had imposed on the enforcement of its cable concentration
rules. The commission is expected to approve the deal soon,
although AT&AMP;T has been lobbying hard to get as much time as
possible to complete any divestitures. The Justice Department is
also examining the deal to see if it violates any provisions of
federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals court also upheld the
constitutionality of a law that gives regulators the authority to
limit the number of channels that a cable system has a financial
interest in.

JARVIS HEADS SOUTH AS WIZARD TALKS STALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Jarvis will board a plane Saturday for Florida and the Big
East Conference coaching meetings. For now, he remains the
basketball coach of St. John's and not the new head coach of the
Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said his agent, Robert Ades, was gathering information
about whether Michael Jordan wanted to offer Jarvis a job with the
Wizards, giving him an opportunity to return to the city where he
coached George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ades nor Jarvis had heard from Jordan as of early Friday
night as the talks seemed to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis reiterated that he was not sure if he was the top choice
of the Wizards, adding that if he did receive an offer it would not
be a foregone conclusion that he would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely nothing to report,'' Jarvis said. ``I
haven't talked to Michael Jordan today. I have people who work for
me gathering information.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis would not say whether compensation was impeding the
progress of the negotiations, but one Eastern Conference team
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he heard the
two sides were far apart over salary and contract structure.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were far below the $3 million a year that Michigan
State coach Tom Izzo recently turned down from the Atlanta Hawks,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said he met with his assistant coaches Friday morning. He
said the Wizards' interest in him had not disrupted his program's
preparations for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis said he had kept Ed Manetta Jr., St. John's athletic
director, informed of his contact with the Wizards and indicated
that nothing would be resolved over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, however, had said he wanted a coach in place before
Sunday's NBA lottery drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate to work at a place that is understanding enough
to allow me to look, listen and learn,'' Jarvis said. &QL;

NEW `LOVE BUG' VARIANT WORKS THROUGH INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new and more powerful variant of the Love Bug
virus is worming its way through the Internet, changing its name
with every computer it infects.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, which is being called the New Love virus, works
similarly to the love bug that infected computers worldwide
recently, but its spread has been kept in check by security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Internet security service provider ICSA.net estimated the virus
has affected hundreds of North American organizations, well short
of the tens of thousands of organizations impacted by the earlier
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The number may get as high as a thousand organizations, said
Peter Tippett, chief scientist at ICSA.net.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the outbreak was limited by awareness and
preparedness developed by computer users as a result of the
previous virus.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno launched an FBI
investigation into the new virus, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus sends itself as an attachment to e-mails addressed
to every person in the address book of the infected computer. Once
it has been activated, it systematically deletes inactive files
stored on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing that is different about this one is the level of
destruction,'' said Kevin Haley, group product manager for
Symantec, maker of Norton Antivirus. ``It will completely delete
all of the files on a user's system.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the virus is polymorphic, meaning it changes its
look every time it is passed along, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks different for users, and it looks different for
antivirus software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Jackson, a computer consultant who repairs computers and
networks for Encino, Calif.-based Fulton-Meyer Information
Technology, said the virus kept him busy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his clients were prepared.
</P>
<P>
   One client, an Encino accounting firm, received 150 infected
files, but the only effect was a slowing of the e-mail system,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said e-mail filters helped weed out the offending attachments
before they could be opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients are pretty well protected. Their business
depends on e-mail, and when something like this hits it really
affects them,'' Jackson said. ``When their system goes down,
they're losing hundreds and thousands of dollars an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the public is better prepared, he said. But individual
users must learn to protect themselves, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they'll load an antivirus program on their
computer, and they'll think they're safe,'' he said. ``In a time
like this it should be updated almost daily.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus takes advantage of a loophole in Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail program that was designed to allow users of handheld devices
to add e-mail addresses to the address books on their desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site, Microsoft has security patches available
for Outlook 97, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The patches contain
various security enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Once it has established itself, the virus looks in the folder in
which recently used documents are stored. Then, it picks the name
of the most recently opened document and renames itself using that
designation.
</P>
<P>
   The virus carries a .vbs file extension, a file type for which
most individual users have little use.
</P>
<P>
   The file extension stands for Visual Basic Script, a language
programmers and network administrators use to update software
applications, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Haley and Jackson said users should look out for e-mail
attachments that end in .vbs and delete them without opening them,
even if they come from someone they know.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said Symantec, like other antivirus software makers, had
an update available early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We posted it on our Web site and made it available to all of
our users,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest virus has proved difficult to prepare for, he said.
Rather than simply changing the virus profile that users routinely
download, Haley said Symantec was forced to change the program
software itself.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade takes 125 kilobytes of disk space and takes no more
than a minute or two to download via a 56 Kb modem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential effect of the virus is a slowing of traffic on
the Internet, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of those e-mails going out, it really affects the
performance of the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink Networks users were not affected on the system level
by an increase in the amount of e-mail traveling the Internet, said
spokesman Kurt Rahn.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest Internet service provider maintains
a buffer in its service capacity so additional traffic does not
significantly slow the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really seen much more than a blip,'' Rahn said.

PAC-10 HAS DEPTH BUT FALLS SHORT OF SEC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The debate continues over which conference
ranks as strongest in college women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 put five teams into Friday's quarterfinals,
causing Florida coach Andy Brandi to declare: ``The Pac-10 right
now has the upper hand. They've had tremendous years and they
deserve to be called the best conference in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandi made his comments early Friday. By the end of the day,
Brandi's Southeastern Conference had placed two in today's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Georgia, ranked second and third nationally, beat
Arizona State and USC, and Cal lost to No. 4 Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Only No. 1 Stanford survived, beating UCLA. The consensus is the
Pac-10 is deeper but not deep enough to knock off the SEC's top
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a semifinal (conference), and we're a quarterfinal
(conference),'' USC's Jacqui Boyd said. ``I think the gap is
narrowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players offered opinions as to what the Pac-10 needs to
do. They include being mentally tougher, playing more consistently
and having depth. Florida and Georgia play in hot and humid
conditions, and Stanford didn't miss anything with No. 3 singles
Teryn Ashley out with back spasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a little tougher a little longer,'' USC coach
Richard Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his team. Yet except for Stanford, it
applied to the others.
</P>
<P>
   __ Time varies: In the NCAAs, as USC can vouch, you often don't
know when you'll play or when you'll finish.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's tournament in Gainesville, Fla., the Trojans
started at 8 p.m. and finished at 3:30 a.m. In Thursday's third
round, they started at 8 a.m. and finished at 11. In Friday's
quarterfinal against Georgia, they started at 11:50 a.m. _ 50
minutes late _ and finished at 2:18.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Richard Gallien didn't mind Thursday's early start
because he knew the time was guaranteed (it was first) and the
Trojans didn't have to wait around all day.
</P>
<P>
   Singles player Jacqui Boyd had a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to it,'' Boyd said. ``That wake-up call at 5
a.m. was rough. But I suppose it's better. It's getting hot and
we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Volunteers: A number of Pepperdine players are volunteering
around the tournament. This gives them a chance to hear what the
participants say about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my friends say, `It's bad for you, but we have a better
chance now,' '' singles player Ipek Senoglu said. ``I take it as
good. Not many teams could win the tournament, and we were one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were'' is the key word. Pepperdine, ranked seventh, is the
highest-ranked noncompeting team. The Waves were ousted in last
week's regional by No. 32 Louisiana State _ the lowest-ranked team
that participated. LSU lost to USC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scouting the best: The attendance over the first two days was
sparse. Yet one local high school player and her teacher father
played hooky to come watch.
</P>
<P>
   Hart High of Newhall's Jenny Munroe and her father, Dave, Hart's
girls' basketball coach, made the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny, a junior, wanted to see if she could play for one of the
top programs. She played No. 1 singles at Hart her first two
seasons but didn't last fall because it interfered with her
junior-tournament schedule.
</P>
<P>
   She has sent letters to several of the schools here, including
Duke,Arizona State, Notre Dame, Texas, Northwestern and Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Her verdict: ``They're too good. That's one reason I'm here to
watch: It helps you decide if you can play at this level.''

NEW `LOVE BUG' VARIANT WORKS THROUGH INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new and more powerful variant of the Love Bug
virus is worming its way through the Internet, changing its name
with every computer it infects.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, which is being called the New Love virus, works
similarly to the love bug that infected computers worldwide
recently, but its spread has been kept in check by security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Internet security service provider ICSA.net estimated the virus
has affected hundreds of North American organizations, well short
of the tens of thousands of organizations impacted by the earlier
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The number may get as high as a thousand organizations, said
Peter Tippett, chief scientist at ICSA.net.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the outbreak was limited by awareness and
preparedness developed by computer users as a result of the
previous virus.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno launched an FBI
investigation into the new virus, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus sends itself as an attachment to e-mails addressed
to every person in the address book of the infected computer. Once
it has been activated, it systematically deletes inactive files
stored on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing that is different about this one is the level of
destruction,'' said Kevin Haley, group product manager for
Symantec, maker of Norton Antivirus. ``It will completely delete
all of the files on a user's system.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the virus is polymorphic, meaning it changes its
look every time it is passed along, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks different for users, and it looks different for
antivirus software,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Jackson, a computer consultant who repairs computers and
networks for Encino, Calif.-based Fulton-Meyer Information
Technology, said the virus kept him busy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his clients were prepared.
</P>
<P>
   One client, an Encino accounting firm, received 150 infected
files, but the only effect was a slowing of the e-mail system,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said e-mail filters helped weed out the offending attachments
before they could be opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my clients are pretty well protected. Their business
depends on e-mail, and when something like this hits it really
affects them,'' Jackson said. ``When their system goes down,
they're losing hundreds and thousands of dollars an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the public is better prepared, he said. But individual
users must learn to protect themselves, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, they'll load an antivirus program on their
computer, and they'll think they're safe,'' he said. ``In a time
like this it should be updated almost daily.''
</P>
<P>
   The virus takes advantage of a loophole in Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail program that was designed to allow users of handheld devices
to add e-mail addresses to the address books on their desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site, Microsoft has security patches available
for Outlook 97, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000. The patches contain
various security enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Once it has established itself, the virus looks in the folder in
which recently used documents are stored. Then, it picks the name
of the most recently opened document and renames itself using that
designation.
</P>
<P>
   The virus carries a .vbs file extension, a file type for which
most individual users have little use.
</P>
<P>
   The file extension stands for Visual Basic Script, a language
programmers and network administrators use to update software
applications, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Haley and Jackson said users should look out for e-mail
attachments that end in .vbs and delete them without opening them,
even if they come from someone they know.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said Symantec, like other antivirus software makers, had
an update available early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We posted it on our Web site and made it available to all of
our users,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newest virus has proved difficult to prepare for, he said.
Rather than simply changing the virus profile that users routinely
download, Haley said Symantec was forced to change the program
software itself.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade takes 125 kilobytes of disk space and takes no more
than a minute or two to download via a 56 Kb modem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential effect of the virus is a slowing of traffic on
the Internet, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of those e-mails going out, it really affects the
performance of the Net,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink Networks users were not affected on the system level
by an increase in the amount of e-mail traveling the Internet, said
spokesman Kurt Rahn.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest Internet service provider maintains
a buffer in its service capacity so additional traffic does not
significantly slow the system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really seen much more than a blip,'' Rahn said.

STANFORD AND GEORGIA ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Those peep holes on the ends of tennis courts
work two ways. In addition to the fans getting a closer look, the
players can look beyond their court and sense the match's overall
mood.
</P>
<P>
   It was somber for the USC and UCLA women's teams, who suffered
one-sided defeats in the NCAA quarterfinals at Pepperdine. The
Trojans lost 5-1 to third-ranked Georgia, and No. 1 Stanford shut
out UCLA 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches don't like me to say that,'' UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt
said, ``but I can feel there wasn't as much cheering. You can tell
when people are up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Down was the operative word Friday. Although the 12th-ranked
Trojans(18-9) took almost an hour longer to lose than No. 9 UCLA
(17-9), not much went right for either team.
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA, the Bruins didn't win a set in losing in about 90
minutes. Schmidt came the closest, losing 7-5 and trailing 3-2 to
Jennifer Heiser at No. 5 singles when the Cardinal (29-0) had won
the necessary five matches.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else won more than three games in any set. After the
first sets were complete, UCLA had won just 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't let us into it,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   For USC, not much more went right.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 1 singles Kara Warkentin, a slow starter of late, started
about as slowly as possible, losing 6-0 to fifth-ranked Aarthi
Venkatesan. Then Warkentin lost 6-3 and the match was over in less
than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   __ No. 4 and No. 5 singles Jacqui Boyd and Anita Loyola lost in
an hour. Boyd lost the first set 6-4 when Lori Grey broke her at
love, then fell 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her serve is not one of her strengths, shall we say,'' USC
coach Richard Gallien said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola said she didn't let herself get patient and lost 6-2, 6-2
to Kelly Baskin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Veronika Safarova won the first set 6-4 over Esther Knox, but
then her right shoulder started acting up, and Knox won the next
two sets 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It threw my game off completely,'' Safarova said. ``I can't
play as relaxed as I like.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And Tiffany Brymer, at No. 6 singles, played a grueling two
hour, 28-minute match before losing in three to Anne Nguyen. Brymer
won the first set 7-5 and had all of the momentum before losing 6-2
in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   USC's lone bright spot: Freshman Jewel Peterson, ranked 17th
nationally, earned USC's lone point with a 7-5, 6-4 win over
Marissa Catlin at No. 3 singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look for things that go wrong, you're going to find
them,''Gallien said. ``The trick is to drive yourself through. If
you don't, it demoralizes you. The tough teams keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Stanford, which faces fourth-ranked Wake Forest in
a semifinal today at 2 p.m. Florida and Georgia meet at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal is so deep that when Teryn Ashley suffered back
spasms and couldn't play at No. 3 singles, coach Frank Brennan
moved everyone up one and put Keiko Tokuda at No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In case any player had doubts, top singles player Marissa Irvin
suggested to look at this not as moving up a step but as facing a
new opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Tokuda beat Catherine Hawley 6-1, 6-3. Normal fourth singles
Lauren Kalavaria beat Amanda Basica 6-1, 6-3 and Gabriela Lastra
knocked off Abigail Spears 6-1, 6-2 in fourth doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, shuffling the deck is nothing new for Stanford.
Irvin, from Harvard-Westlake High, played in just her 22nd match
Friday because she has been preparing to turn pro after the NCAAs.
Ashley has been hurt before, as has freshman Laura Granville at No.
2 singles.
</P>
<P>
   They're healthy now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every NCAAs, they come out at their best,'' said Annica
Cooper, who lost 6-0, 6-3 to Granville, ``and it's tough to go
against that.''

THE RETURN OF MILLER FORCES OUT THE 76ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The return of Reggie Miller marked the end of the
Philadelphia 76ers' season.
</P>
<P>
   Miller returned from a one-game suspension and scored 25 points
to lead the Indiana Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals with a
106-90 victory over the Philadelphia Sixers on Friday night in Game
6. By winning the four-of-seven-game conference semifinal series,
4-2, Indiana will make its third consecutive trip to the conference
finals against the winner of the New York Knicks-Miami Heat series.
</P>
<P>
   Showing their experience and poise in front of a noisy, partisan
Philadelphia crowd at the First Union Center, the Pacers never
trailed after the first few minutes and held off every rally by the
76ers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who sat out Game 5 after throwing a punch at Matt Geiger
in Game 4, got a measure of revenge by making jumper after jumper,
shooting 10 for 18 from the field, pushing the Pacers into the next
round and sending the Sixers on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by three points at halftime, Indiana took control
by dominating the third quarter, 29-16. That gave the Pacers an
85-69 lead heading into the final period, and Philadelphia never
cut Indiana's lead to single digits thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had hoped to become the first team in NBA history to
rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a series, but as Friday night's
game progressed, they finally succumbed to an opponent that had
more depth and more experience.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose, who had been quiet in the previous two games, added
21 points for the Pacers, giving Indiana a one-two punch that the
Sixers never contained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Pacers did a superb defensive job on Allen
Iverson, Philadelphia's All-Star guard, who was held to 18 points
on 7-for-20 shooting. When Iverson does not have a huge game,
particularly against a team as strong as the Pacers, the Sixers are
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana ran two or three defenders at Iverson, forcing him to
give up the ball or to take difficult shots. With Iverson in check
and none of his teammates able to step up, the Sixers simply did
not have enough offense to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Taking control in the third quarter, the Pacers took an 85-69
lead into the final 12 minutes. Miller was relentless, making key
shots that kept the Sixers reeling. With Rose on one side of the
floor and Miller on the other, Indiana spread Philadelphia's
defense and constantly found the open man.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pacers making baskets and controlling the tempo, the
Sixers never got a chance to get their running game going, and the
Pacers methodically took control of the game. By the fourth
quarter, it was clear Philadelphia was in deep trouble, and Indiana
never lost control in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers looked tired and they knew the end was near. By the
end of the game, Miller was smiling on the Indiana bench, looking
forward to the next series.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led at halftime, 56-53, but the Sixers rallied from a
14-point deficit in the second quarter. Running an offensive clinic
early, the Pacers madenine of their first 10 shots and built an
early lead. Indiana forced Philadelphia to scramble defensively,
and the Pacers moved the ball crisply and found open men all over
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Miller looked sharp, making his first four shots and had 13
point in the first quarter. Each time Miller made a shot, he turned
and stared at the fans in the front row as he ran down the court.
</P>
<P>
   It was Miller at his best, making key shots, and relishing his
role as a villain. And as the Pacers gradually increased their lead
to 39-25, it appeared the Sixers were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But at that point, Philadelphia went on a 16-3 run to change the
game's momentum. It was no coincidence that most of Philadelphia's
run occurred with Miller resting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Without Miller to spread the defense, the Sixers began making
stops, and that ignited their offense.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc made a huge impact, coming off the bench to score 10
first-half points for the Sixers. And instead of watching Iverson
carry the offense, the Sixers got a strong first half from George
Lynch and Aaron McKie, who combined for 19 points in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson had 11 first-half points on 4-for-11 shooting, but he
took good shots and got his teammates involved offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Miller scoreless in the second quarter, the Sixers tied
the game, 45-45, as the crowd at the First Union Center went wild.
But the Pacers never lost their poise, and they nursed a
three-point lead into the locker room. &QL;

PENTAGON CLASSIFIES A LETTER CRITICAL OF ANTI - MISSILE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)  By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon has classified as secret an anti-missile critic's
letter to the White House, and the censored expert is crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Theodore A. Postol, professor of science and
national security studies at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, first wrote the White House on May 11 to report what he
described as a major flaw in the Pentagon's anti-missile plan and
efforts to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Postol wrote the White House again, this time to say
that the Pentagon had classified his letter secret and to condemn
what he said was probably a bid to curb the high-stakes dispute.
The antimissile system under consideration is estimated to cost as
much as $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest letter, Postol said the Pentagon's Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, which ordered the imposition of
secrecy, ``is most likely attempting to illegally use the security
and classification system to hide waste, fraud, and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   If secrets were inadvertently released in his earlier letter, he
added, it was because his analysis was based on Pentagon documents
that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization had improperly
declassified.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which he made available to The New York Times,
Postol asked John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, to alert
his colleagues of the ``claimed status'' of the May 11 letter and
to ``refer this matter to the Department of Defense inspector
general for immediate investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the White House referred requests for comment to the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force, a spokesman for the
organization, said that no one was accusing Postol of releasing
secrets but that the antimissile office was taking steps to
classify the letter and its appended reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner said that one of the reports Postol had sent to the White
House apparently contained three or four charts of secret data that
declassification officers had failed to delete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If even one word is classified, then the whole thing is
classified until the secret part is removed,'' the colonel said,
describing the usual federal policy concerning secret documents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon's move to classify is unlikely to have much
practical effect because the letter has circulated widely
throughout the administration, Congress and the world, with
hundreds, if not thousands, of electronic copies speeding across
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It even appears on the Web site of the Institute of Physics and
Technology in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Postol's May 11 letter was three pages long and had four reports
attached to it that were meant to back up his technical claims.
</P>
<P>
   His criticism of the proposed antimissile system centers on the
most technically difficult part of the system's goal _ enabling a
speeding interceptor to distinguish incoming weapons from clouds of
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Postol contended that a pivotal flight test in June 1997 showed
that the objective was impossible to achieve, and that the Pentagon
then conspired to hide this surprising discovery.
</P>
<P>
   His accusations are based partly on antimissile criticism by
Nira Schwartz, a former senior engineer at the TRW Corp., a top
military contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit against the company, Schwartz said that TRW had
faked results of anti-missile tests and evaluations of computer
programs for the interceptor's sensor and fired her when she
protested. The company has denied her accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Through her litigation with TRW as well as an inquiry by the
Pentagon's Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Schwartz
obtained many antimissile reports and data, some of which she
shared with Postol.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents and data from them presumably lie at the heart of
any Pentagon concerns about leaked secrets.

AMGEN ANEMIA DRUG GETS GOOD TEST RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ Amgen's upcoming anemia drug lasts as
long in cancer patients as it does in patients with renal failure,
according to the results of a study to be presented today.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Dr. John Glaspy of the UCLA School of
Medicine, is being presented to the American Society of Clinical
Oncology annual meeting in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, NESP, already has been submitted for approval by the
Food and Drug Administration for use in chronic renal failure
patients. It is considered a successor to Epogen, Amgen's $1.76
billion-selling anemia drug.
</P>
<P>
   NESP, as a successor to Amgen's largest-selling drug, has the
potential to be a huge seller in its own right, in part because the
company is unrestricted in the markets it can seek.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen only holds the rights to market Epogen to kidney patients
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen is testing NESP's effectiveness in cancer patients, who
become anemic during chemotherapy when the treatments wipe out the
bone marrow.
</P>
<P>
   NESP, or novel Erythropoiesis stimulating protein, is not a
replacement for Epogen, but a different formula that allows
patients to go longer between doses, said Amgen spokesman David
Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said the research compared the length of time it takes for
the drug to work its way through the systems of patients undergoing
chemotherapy and those with chronic renal failure.
</P>
<P>
   More research is needed into the safety and efficacy of the drug
before the third phase of studies can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Anemia drugs are proving to be valuable where it was once
believed they weren't necessary, Glaspy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drugs that raise red (blood cell) counts are extremely
important drugs, and we're just finding out in the last few years
their effect on disability and low quality of life,'' Glaspy said.
``Fatigue we thought was due to the cancer, we've found out was due
to the anemia.''

   Cancer patients are a new market for Amgen, which only sells
Epogen to people with kidney failure because of a marketing
agreement it has with Johnson and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Johnson and Johnson has the U.S. rights to
market the drug - which it sells as Procrit - to all U.S. markets
other than patients with renal failure.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen faces a court challenge to its patents for Epogen. A
federal trial is ongoing in Boston to determine whether Cambridge,
Mass.-based Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. infringed on Amgen's
patents for its top-selling drug.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen also is scheduled to present the results of phase three
studies of a prostate cancer drug, Abarelix, which it developed
along with Praecis Pharmaceuticals. Those study results will be
presented Tuesday.

   FTC Seeks Authority to Protect Privacy Online
</P>
<P>
   Concluding that companies on the Internet have not properly
protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission
has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose tough consumer
privacy safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC approved a staff recommendation in an unannounced vote
to seek legislation giving it such authority. The action comes as
the agency has stepped up investigations of several major Internet
companies over their use of consumer data. It marks a sharp
departure from the agency's previous policy of relying almost
entirely on the industry to police itself. Democratic lawmakers in
both the House and Senate, however, said this week that the
prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were not strong.

</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor said its loss widened to 684.4 billion yen on a
consolidated basis, or $6.3 billion at current exchange rates, in
the fiscal year ended March 31, as it erased outstanding pension
liabilities, adopted new accounting practices and moved to cut

   China Trade Bill Edges Near Victory

   Opponents of a decisive China trade bill refused to admit defeat

provocation by Beijing against Taiwan, the measure was edging
toward victory. House Republican leaders scheduled a vote for
Wednesday.

   U.S. Trade Deficit Widens
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record in March as surging
demand for oil, automobiles and other imports overpowered a second
consecutive monthly increase in exports, Commerce Department
figures showed. The deficit in goods and services grew to $30.2
billion in March from $28.7 billion in February. Economists had
expected a $29.5 billion deficit. Although the U.S. shortfall with
China narrowed, record imports from Japan, Canada and Western
Europe caused the trade gaps with those regions to widen.

that ended on March 31, up from its previous forecast of 3.5
billion yen.

ARMY TRAINING SCHOOL TO RISE AGAIN, RECAST BUT UNMOVED
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga.) By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dogged by years of controversy over its mission and
its graduates, the Army's School of the Americas is on the verge of
getting a new charter, a new curriculum and a new name. It appears
likely, however, to face the same old protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's plans to reorganize the school, which has trained
generations of soldiers from Central America and South America,
cleared a major hurdle this week when the House narrowly rejected
an amendment that would have closed it down.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate goes along, as expected, the school that critics
have linked to human rights violations by former students will
officially ``close'' and ``reopen'' later this year as the Defense
Institute for Hemispheric Security Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The Army proposed the changes last month, prompted by rising
opposition to the school from religious groups and, more
importantly, from some members of Congress, who nearly succeeded in
cutting off the school's financing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in Panama in 1946 and moved to its current location at
Fort Benning, Ga., in 1984, the school has been the primary
training ground for more than 60,000 Latin American military and
police. Some were later implicated in the region's most notorious
abuses, like the murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of the Army, Louis Caldera, said in an interview
that critics have unfairly tarnished the school's reputation
because of the actions of very few. Nonetheless, he said, the
changes would give the school a focus that was more academic and
less strictly military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a mistake to close the school down,''
Caldera said, ``because that would be turning our backs on the
countries of Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress chartered the school, the Army had to seek
approval for its changes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having a new name, the school would have an
advisory board to review its curriculum and report to Congress.
Authority over the school would be transferred from the Army to the
Department of Defense and a students would be required to have at
least eight hours of instruction in human rights in each course.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said the Army would try to increase the number of
civilian students, and emphasize training political and military
leaders in the proper role of the military under the region's
emerging democratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   The school would remain at Fort Benning and still offer courses
involving purely military tactics and strategies, prompting
opponents to denounce the changes as cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Army's proposal came before the House on Thursday as
part of the defense authorization bill, four members sponsored an
amendment to shut the school and create a committee to review
military training for Latin Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with a new coat of paint, the School of the Americas has
trained far too many killers of innocent people to remain a part of
our foreign policy,'' said one of the sponsors, Rep. John Moakley,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment lost on a roll call vote of 214 to 204 after
lobbying by Army, Pentagon and Clinton administration officials. A
day before the vote, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent members a joint letter
saying the Army's proposal would ``allow us to move past what had
become a contentious annual debate on the school's legacy and focus
on the question of how best to engage militarily our friends and
allies in the hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's proposal won approval when the House overwhelmingly
approved the larger authorization bill late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a priest who has organized protests
against the school for a decade from his apartment at Fort
Benning's main gate, said the changes would not diminish the
movement against the school. The protests have grown from a handful
of opponents to a crowd last November that was estimated at more
than 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``After thinking this thing out, we realized what they're really
talking about is a name change,'' he said in a telephone interview
on Friday. ``For us, this is the same old school doing what it's
always been doing.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew from the most
celebrated Senate race in the nation on Friday, saying that his
health and his still-undecided treatment for prostate cancer were
more important to him than his campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional, riveting news conference, which he began in an
uncharacteristically nervous voice, Giuliani said that he wanted to
devote his remaining 18 months in office to becoming a better mayor
_ one who reaches out to minorities _ as well as becoming a better
person. He took his listeners along on a psychological journey,
holding out the possibility that his illness had changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably,''
Giuliani said during in his half-hour of remarks in the City Hall
Public Hearing Room, which was crowded with more than 35 television
cameras from around the world as well as hundreds of supporters,
teary campaign aides, members of his administration, reporters and
friends. ``It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity
you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being able
to take care of your health.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, he said that confronting his ``limits'' had
allowed him to see himself differently: ``You realize you're not a
superman and you're just a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is not the right time for me to run for office.
If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing
were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't
different, and that's the way life is.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party reacted with sympathy, but
immediately pledged support for Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, the
choice to replace the mayor. Party leaders said they were worried
about the race but nonetheless relieved that Giuliani had made a
decision after weeks of reviewing his options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand and respect his decision to put his health
first,'' said Gov. George Pataki. Pataki had much preferred Lazio
as the candidate to oppose Clinton. He supported Giuliani a few
months ago only because of a growing consensus among state
Republican Party leaders that Giuliani would be Clinton's strongest
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki described Lazio as a worthy candidate with a politically
appealing record in Congress on issues like tax cuts and smaller
government.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also tried to cut off speculation that he might enter the
race himself, saying that he was happy to remain in his current job
and support whoever became the Republican Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When Lazio began mulling over a bid for the U.S. Senate last
year, his biggest drawback was perceived as his lack of name
recognition in a race that was fast becoming defined by celebrity
and star quality.
</P>
<P>
   Now his supporters are hoping to turn that seeming weakness into
his biggest strength. Lazio may be a virtual unknown, their line of
reasoning goes, but at least he does not arouse the strong
antipathy inspired in certain quarters by both the man he hopes to
succeed, Giuliani, and the Democrat he hopes to challenge, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a moderate Republican, he's telegenic,'' said Howard
DeMartini, who was the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican
Party when Lazio was first elected to Congress here in 1992. ``He
will be able to turn the focus of the campaign back onto the first
lady. Over the last few months, Hillary has been able to shift the
focus away from herself and onto the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that Giuliani ``had the best interests of New Yorkers
in mind,'' and added that he was ready to run. ``I'm looking
forward to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's pending entry and Giuliani's withdrawal instantly
changed what had been an overheated, entertaining race of national
interest into a more traditional campaign. City Hall, which in
recent weeks has been a jangling nerve center, settled into a new
calm when the mayor left shortly after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Giuliani said that he had wavered in
recent days on whether to stay in the race, and had been up much of
Thursday night agonizing over his decision. But he said he finally
reached it Friday morning after speaking to a few close friends.
Earlier on Thursday night, he had appeared at a nationally
televised town hall meeting at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan,
where he gave no indication of his intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went in last night to the town hall meeting and I saw
the people outside saying `Run, Rudy, run, Rudy, run Rudy,' I had,
you know, half the time last night I felt like I wanted to run,''
Giuliani said. ``And half the time I felt like I shouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed up last night going back and forth about what's the
right decision and what isn't the right decision. I believe this is
the right decision. And I think somehow, somewhere, some way, this
is all for the best.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's life has been in a near-constant state of turmoil in
the last three weeks, much of it recorded by a persistent and
expanding press corps.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the mayor announced that he had prostate cancer. On
May 3, he said that he had a ``very good'' friend, Judith Nathan.
On May 10, he announced that he was seeking a separation from his
wife, Donna Hanover. Hanover, who was surprised by the
announcement, responded the same day by announcing that the
couple's troubles had begun years before because of a relationship
between her husband and a member of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover's press secretary identified the staff member as
Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, Giuliani's former director of
communications, and said that Hanover believed that the
relationship had been intimate. Both the mayor and
Lategano-Nicholas have denied that the relationship was sexual.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani has been holding increasingly personal news
conferences, in which he has ruminated openly about his life,
Friday's announcement reached a new level of introspection. ``I
also believe that, you know, things happen in life for reasons that
sometimes you only figure out afterwards,'' Giuliani said. ``And
there is something good that comes out of this. A lot of good
things come out of it. I think I understand myself a lot better. I
think I understand what's important to me better.''
</P>
<P>
   But that ``doesn't mean there's going to be a new Rudy,'' the
mayor said, making light of his frequently combative personality.
``I think that's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also sought to redefine the remaining months of his
mayoralty, promising that he would try to embrace the minority
groups he has alienated in the past. His administration, he said,
would try to make sure that it ``accomplishes the goal of, you
know, reaching every person that we can reach and making sure that
every New Yorker feels that I'm dedicated to them, that I want to
protect them, that I want to help them, and that I want my time as
mayor to count for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said that he wanted to figure out how he had placed a
``barrier'' between his administration and the city's minority
voters. He also said, abruptly, that he wanted to increase the
number of people covered by health insurance, because of what he
has been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I felt from the beginning of this and
continue to feel is a tremendous sense of compassion for the people
that have to make decisions like this alone,'' he said. ``One of
the things maybe that I can do is figure out how we accelerate
making sure that people are covered _ I mean, there are a lot of
things that I think I can accomplish that I haven't accomplished
before.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president who has been
a frequent critic of the mayor, said that she was ``very hopeful
that he will, indeed, work to overcome the many barriers that face
too many New Yorkers.'' The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Giuliani's
most vociferous critics, said that he wished Giuliani well, but
that he did not see his withdrawal from the race ``as a political
loss for the people of the state.'' Sharpton also said that he was
now more inclined to run for mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani had repeatedly said in the days after
announcing his illness that he would first make a decision on his
cancer treatment and then decide on the race, he said Friday that
his thinking had been flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't organize this,'' he said. ``I mean, I didn't
understand the impact of this. It was, what I thought at first was,
OK, I'll take a week or two, or three, whatever it takes, to figure
out what the treatment is. I will then decide on the treatment,
I'll then look at the treatment and I'll figure out, does that mean
I can run or I can't run.'' Giuliani added, ``I know it sounds
silly, but I thought of it like a budget decision or a legal
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said the decision, which was between surgery and
radiation, had turned out to be far more difficult than he ever
imagined _ in part, he said on Thursday, because of possible side
effects. Although surgery is the choice of most men of Giuliani's
age _ which is 55 _ and has a high cure rate, it also causes
impotence and incontinence in many patients. Doctors say that
radiation, particularly in the form of ``seeds'' inserted into the
prostate, has less effect on sexual function, but its long-term
cure rates are not known.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors said that Giuliani would have been physically
able to continue in the race no matter what treatment he chose _ if
he was willing to campaign part time over the summer _ Giuliani
said Friday that he did not want to run a race when he was not
operating at 100 percent of his capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concentration isn't going to be there,'' he said. He added:
``Nobody can tell you in percentages what the side effects are
going to be. You can be fine, you can be terrific, or you can have
problems and then you won't be able to carry out your commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that he would continue to mull over his treatment
options in the coming weeks, and that his decision would not be ``a
political matter'' but a personal one. He said again, as he has
repeatedly, that his decision not to run was based on his health,
not on his unraveling marriage or personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Joannie Danielides, Hanover's press secretary, said that the
mayor telephoned his wife and informed her of his decision shortly
before he made his announcement. Both Hanover and Giuliani are
living at Gracie Mansion while they work out a separation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked briefly,'' Danielides said. ``She's concerned for
his health and will try to help him with that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of Giuliani's announcement, a reporter asked the
mayor if he felt closer to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's closer to me,'' the mayor replied.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, who telephoned the mayor shortly after his
announcement, said afterward, ``I certainly hope and pray, as I
know all New Yorkers do, that he will have a full and speedy
recovery.'' Asked if she would miss the mayor as an opponent,
Clinton replied, ``Well, I think we should just wish him well as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides acknowledge that her campaign had long ago begun
studying the voting records and political backgrounds of each of
the men who were considering replacing Giuliani on the Republican
ticket. In the case of Lazio, Clinton's campaign had already begun
to compile information on the congressman's voting record, with an
eye toward portraying him as a conservative ideologue who is less
than supportive of abortion rights.

BRUINS WAKE UP IN SIXTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Adversity, taken in small, manageable doses,
isn't such a negative thing for the UCLA softball team.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State pushed UCLA for the better part of five innings
Friday, but the Bruins used a five-run sixth inning to earn a 10-4
victory and eliminate the 49ers on the second day of the NCAA
Tournament regional at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the girls that I think a game like this is good for
us,'' said UCLA coach Sue Enquist, whose team advanced to face
(Florida State or Iowa) today at 10 a.m. and is one victory away
from the regional championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, ranked No. 1 in the region, looked powerful and
frail at times against the No. 3 49ers. They held a tenuous 5-4
lead after four innings and needed two-run singles from Julie Adams
and Lyndsey Klein to break the game open in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the way we won in a tough situation,''
said Enquist, whose team had breezed through a five-inning 8-0
victory over Canisius on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA totaled 11 hits, but the difference was on the mound.
Amanda Freed, who pitched a complete game against Canisius, was
called upon to get the Bruins out of a jam in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach State had already scored twice to cut UCLA's lead to
5-4, and had the bases loaded with two outs. Freed relieved starter
Courtney Dale and struck out No. 3 hitter Elizabeth Sanches to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ultimate compliment a coach can pay a pitcher, to
put her in the game in a situation like that,'' Enquist said of
Freed. ``I was very pleased with her effort and it's great for her
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed (23-7) shut down the 49ers over the next three innings.
She allowed two hits and one walk and struck out five. Dale's
statistics (3 innings, five hits, four runs) weren't overwhelming,
except that she shouldn't even be on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Dale was diagnosed with a torn labrum in her pitching shoulder
in February but delayed surgery so she could keep pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a competitor,'' Enquist said. ``A lot of kids
wouldn't be able to handle what she is doing, with this kind of
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were able to break through against 49ers starter
Kristi Fox (Newbury Park High), a senior who had thrown a complete
game in Thursday's loss to Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   After a shaky start, which included a two-run home run by Crissy
Buck in the third inning, Fox (24-10) settled down and retired
seven of the next eight Bruins she faced but was hit hard in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA loaded the bases on singles by Buck and Natasha Watley and
a walk to Lupe Brambila, and Adams and Klein followed with two-run
singles to chase Fox from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a bad last game to end on,'' Fox said, ``but
if I'm going to lose to somebody, it might as well be UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins win this morning, they will advance directly to
Sunday's championship game. A loss would put the Bruins in today's
3 p.m. game, against the loser of the 12:30 p.m. Canisius vs.
(Florida State or Iowa) game.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The daring attempt to depose the Democratic
speaker of the state Assembly sputtered Friday as the man who
orchestrated it acknowledged that his base of support had seriously
eroded.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the insurrection, Assemblyman Michael Bragman, who
represents the Syracuse area, said that the ``rock solid'' backing
he once had in his bid to replace the speaker, Sheldon Silver of
Manhattan, had dwindled in the face of threats and retaliation by
Silver and his powerful allies.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Bragman vowed to press ahead with his
campaign to oust Silver, who he said had an autocratic and
secretive style that had alienated many of the 98 Democrats who
make up the majority party in the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman said he believed that there was enough dissatisfaction
with the speaker to topple him. ``Am I still in a position to win?
I don't know,'' he said. ``But you know what? There is going to be
change here. Sheldon Silver must go as the speaker of the New York
state Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman also ruled out the possibility that he would seek
support from Assembly Republicans to become speaker, a prospect
that would have thrown the chamber into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman needs the support of at least 50 Democrats to oust
Silver. But even if he cannot muster that many votes, he can still
create huge headaches for the speaker. Silver needs a sizable
majority to control legislation as tightly as he does now, and a
faction of Democrats led by Bragman might make that difficult, if
not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman made his comments two days after he threw the chamber
into turmoil with his announcement that he would try to overthrow
Silver in a showdown vote on Monday. Silver immediately stripped
Bragman of his position as majority leader, cut his $34,500-a-year
stipend and even had him locked out of his office here in the State
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, who has been in the Assembly since 1981, represents a
huge threat to Silver. Bragman is a formidable fund-raiser with
broad support among moderates, conservatives and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Silver has not taken the threat lightly, using all the powers at
his disposal to beat back the insurrection. He has punished
rebellious lawmakers and secured the help of powerful union
officials and influential party leaders to solidify his support.
</P>
<P>
   He demoted two high-ranking lawmakers who pledged their loyalty
to Bragman and then cut their annual pay by $12,500 each. The raw
display of power immediately placed other lawmakers on notice that
they would meet the same fate if they crossed Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's furious maneuvering over the last 48 hours seems to be
paying off. He has won the backing of key Assembly Democrats from
New York City whose support is crucial if he is to maintain power.
</P>
<P>
   The Silver loyalists include Herman D. Farrell Jr., the
Democratic leader in Manhattan; Clarence Norman Jr., the Democratic
leader in Brooklyn; and Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic leader in
the Bronx. The borough delegations that these men lead represent
more than 40 members of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was trying to negotiate today with Thomas Manton, the
Queens Democratic leader, to secure the support of all 16 Assembly
members from that borough. Manton has had a continuing feud with
Silver, and he recently offered to deliver most of the borough's
Assembly members to Bragman provided Bragman moved quickly to
depose Silver.
</P>
<P>
   The ouster of a speaker is an uncommon occurrence _ the last
attempt in the Assembly was in the 1960s _ and Bragman's comments
Friday were widely interpreted as an admission of defeat. But he
may have achieved something that is almost as extraordinary as
toppling a legislative leader: he may have seriously wounded
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman seemed to be hinting at such a prospect Friday. ``I
think something extraordinarily positive has already come out of
this,'' he told reporters, noting that he had the support of at
least 40 Democrats who were frustrated with Silver. ``It is my
intention to go in on Monday and let the members speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragman also sharply criticized the tactics Silver used in the
last few days to crush the uprising, saying they were typical of
the authoritarian rule Silver had imposed over the house since he
took power in 1994. ``The speaker has demonstrated to the public in
the last couple of days what he is all about,'' Bragman said.
``This is a one-man operation. The members are not participating.
They are not being treated with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   A speaker is traditionally chosen by the majority party's
members in an election held behind closed doors at the start of a
newly elected Legislature's two-year term. When a candidate emerges
with a majority, the full Assembly is convened and the members of
the majority party unite behind that candidate in a formal vote.

   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington
on Friday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach
in Delaware. The Gores were staying at the beach home of Tony
Coelho, Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The
couple took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense _ a requirement
of the Secret Service, a spokesman said. Accompanying them were
Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide,
although the White House had not notified reporters of the vice
president's travel until Friday afternoon, after the Gores had left
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore last month had told the reporters covering his presidential
campaign that he would notify them when he traveled, including on
his anniversary. ``I will err on the side of openness and full
access as much as possible,'' he said. But he apparently had not
shared this decision with his wife, who has said she hopes to
maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes
president, and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would
need to accompany the vice president on private trips.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George
W. Bush took his ``compassionate conservatism'' on the road Friday,
calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a senior citizen center in
Paducah, Bush praised retired volunteers who share ``wisdom,
experience and values'' as foster grandparents or mentors. He
proposed to increase federal funding for such volunteer programs
from $183 million annually to $240 million annually across five
years. Some of the money would go to a pilot program, under which
10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000
scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   THE ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   Certain that Gov. George W. Bush has handed them the perfect
campaign weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore
campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to attacking the
Republican's plan. Its not so subtle address:
www.bushinsecurity.com. The homepage features a photograph of
rolling dice ( Gore likes to accuse Bush of promoting ``casino
economics'') and a picture of a slightly crazed-looking Bush over
the caption, ``When he was asked if people could lose money under
his plan, Bush replied `Maybe, Maybe Not.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari Fleischer, Bush's
spokesman, said, ``Having invented the Internet, you would have
thought Al Gore could have used it for something positive and not
just another attack barrage.'' He added that he would check the
site to see if it included a link to the White House Web site that
promotes the administration's proposal to invest Social Security
funds in the stock market, an idea Gore once supported.

JOHN SAWHILL, 63, CHIEF OF NATURE CONSERVANCY, FORMER U.S. ENERGY
OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio, Md., N.Y.)   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John C. Sawhill, who advised three presidents on
energy policy, served as president of New York University and for
the last decade of his life was president and chief executive of
the Nature Conservancy, died on Thursday at a hospital in Richmond,
Va. He was 63 and lived in Washington and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was diabetes, the Nature Conservancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill became head of the conservancy, which describes itself
as the world's largest private conservation group, in January 1990.
The organization's mission is to preserve animals and plants by
acquiring land and water to protect the environment from
development.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy said in a statement Friday that during Sawhill's
tenure it had protected more than 7 million acres of land in the
United States; that the conservancy work force had tripled, to
about 3,000, and that its membership had more than doubled, to 1.1
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy said that in 1995, under Sawhill's direction, it
completed the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of the
conservation movement, raising $315 million. Last March, Sawhill
announced the start of a $1 billion campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill was president of New York University from 1975 to 1979.
When he took office, the university, like its hometown, was mired
in debt and its very future seemed in danger. Sawhill, who was a
professor of economics while serving as president, led a huge
fund-raising drive and was widely credited with putting the
university's finances back in order.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Mancuso, dean of the NYU School of Education, said Friday
that Sawhill was a risk taker and a strong manager, believing that
crises required new approaches. She praised him for helping women
achieve positions of responsibility at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill was a lean six-footer, ascetic in behavior and diet. He
rose early, often running for a few miles before starting his
workday. Lunch might be fresh fruit, cheese, crackers and a soft
drink. Mancuso recalled fondly that some of his first luncheons at
NYU were notable for ``extremely tiny portions of unappetizing
food.'' More seriously, she wondered whether his habits were part
of his never-ending campaign to stave off the effects of diabetes,
a disease she never knew he had.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of Loews Corp. and a longtime
friend of Sawhill, also expressed surprise Friday upon learning of
Sawhill's disease. Tisch described Sawhill as ``a very private
man,'' especially for a public figure, and one who managed to be
blunt and honest without being rude.
</P>
<P>
   Under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, he was
administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, deputy
administrator of the Federal Energy Office, and associate director
for energy and environmental matters in the Office of Management
and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1974, Sawhill was forced out by Ford, undone in part by
his candor. With the country still reeling from an oil shortage,
Sawhill favored additional gasoline taxes, and said so in public.
Ford opposed new gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill also conceded in an interview that the Ford
administration did not have a plan to stop the rise in oil prices _
an admission that was not exactly a surprise, but one that fanned
criticism of the administration as having a less-than-clear-cut
energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Though his credentials as an environmentalist became impeccable,
Sawhill's positions were not always predictable. In 1974, for
instance, he said that the environmental risks of strip-mining coal
might be acceptable to meet national energy demands. That year, he
said oil drilling off the New England coast _ an idea that
horrified fishermen, lobstermen and many environmentalists _ should
not be beyond consideration.
</P>
<P>
   And he told a Senate committee in 1974 that higher fuel prices
were not necessarily bad, especially if they encouraged oil
companies to find new supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Sawhill was deputy secretary of energy under President Jimmy
Carter, then became chairman and chief executive of the United
States Synthetic Fuels Corp. From 1981 until 1990, he was a
director of McKinsey &AMP; Co., the international management
consultants, specializing in energy issues.
</P>
<P>
   John Crittenden Sawhill was born in Cleveland on June 12, 1936,
and grew up in Baltimore. He graduated cum laude from Princeton
University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs in 1958 and received a doctorate in economics from New York
University in 1963. From 1960 to 1963, he was assistant dean and
assistant economics professor at NYU.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Isabel, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution; a son, James, of San Francisco; a brother,
James, of Newport News, Va.; two sisters, Sally Supplee of Palo
Alto, Calif., and Munroe Hodder of London, and a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Nature Conservancy, Sawhill pressed for more
cooperation between business interests and environmental groups. He
refused to see an unbridgeable chasm between profits and clean air
and water, and he insisted that Americans would never succeed in
cleaning up the environment unless there was growth in per capita
income.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, George magazine announced, not entirely tongue in
cheek, that Sawhill's accomplishments and free-ranging intellect
made him ideal to be president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw President Clinton after the George story came out,''
Sawhill said. ``I told him he didn't have to worry.''

HARLIN QUIST, 69, PUBLISHER OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn.)  By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harlin Quist, a publisher of sophisticated children's books,
died on May 13 at the home of a niece in Minneapolis. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   He was suffering from myasthenia gravis and complications from a
recent hip replacement, said Clare Zupetz, a niece.
</P>
<P>
   Quist maintained an office in Paris where Quist Books, his last
publishing venture, is based.
</P>
<P>
   Quist, whose name was originally Harlin Bloomquist, was born and
brought up in Virginia, Minn., attended a community college there
and Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh before coming to New York in 1958.
In 1959 he produced and appeared off Broadway in the highly praised
first English language production of Chekhov's ``Ivanov.''
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned the theater for publishing, beginning as an editor
at Crowell-Collier and then moving to Dell, where he worked on the
first picture paperback books. In 1967 he started Harlin Quist
Books and a year later established a French partnership that
enabled him to publish and distribute his books in Europe as well
as in the United States. A showcase for the work of young artists,
his books attracted immediate attention everywhere but won more
praise than sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Geranium on the Windowsill Just Died but Teacher You Went
Right On,'' written and illustrated by Albert Cullum, sold over a
half-million copies worldwide, and a new French edition appeared in
1999. ``Story Number 1,'' by Eugene Ionesco, illustrated by Etienne
Delessert, was a 1968 New York Times Best Illustrated Book. Other
artists whose distinctive work he introduced include Guy Billout,
Nicole Claveloux and Patrick Couratin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s he went into semiretirement and returned to
northern Minnesota to care for his ailing mother. He established a
nonprofit corporation, Theater in the State, to rehabilitate the
Norshor, an Art Deco movie theater in Duluth, Minn., and reopened
it with himself as an impresario of high culture. He presented
dance companies including the Hubbard Street troupe from Chicago,
staged contemporary plays and presented conversations with authors
like Edward Albee. In 1994 he became ill with myasthenia gravis,
which forced him to withdraw, and the building reverted to its
previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two brothers, Kermit Bloomquist and Quentin
Bloomquist of Virginia; a sister, Betty Hakala of Springfield,
Ohio; and many nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the Salon du Livre de Jeunesse in Paris held a
retrospective of original art and first editions of Quist's books
in French and English that attracted 150,000 visitors. Quist
established a new company in Paris with a French partner, Patrick
Couratin, a designer and illustrator, and they reissued limited
editions of some of his best-known books in France and Germany.
Plans are under way for new American editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance Francaise in New York exhibited 120 original
illustrations from Quist books last winter, and a similar show is
scheduled for the Minnesota Center for Book Arts in September.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert W. Stone, an actor and teacher, died on May 11
in New York. He was 81 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
